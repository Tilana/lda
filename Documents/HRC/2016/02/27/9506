<p><b>Introduction 
</b> 
1. This report contains a comprehensive account of communications sent to Governments up to 1 
December 2006, along with replies received up to the end of January 2007. It also contains two 
additional categories of communication: (i) Those sent after 1 December 2006 to which 
responses were received in time for inclusion; and (ii) Responses received to communications 
that were sent in earlier years. 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>I. COMMUNICATIONS AND REPLIES 
</b> 
2. Along with fuller reproductions or summaries of correspondence, this report summarizes the 
correspondence regarding each communication under four headings for ease of reference. 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Violation alleged 
</b> 
3. Violations are classified into the following categories: 
 
</p>
<p>(a)  Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating to 
the imposition of capital punishment (&#8220;Death penalty safeguards&#8221;); 
 
(b)  Death threats and fear of imminent extrajudicial executions by State officials, 
paramilitary groups, or groups cooperating with or tolerated by the Government, as well 
as unidentified persons who may be linked to the categories mentioned above and when 
the Government is failing to take appropriate protection measures (&#8220;Death threats&#8221;); 
 
(c)  Deaths in custody owing to torture, neglect, or the use of force, or fear of death in 
custody due to life-threatening conditions of detention (&#8220;Deaths in custody&#8221;); 
 
(d)  Deaths due to the use of force by law enforcement officials or persons acting in 
direct or indirect compliance with the State, when the use of force is inconsistent with the 
criteria of absolute necessity and proportionality (&#8220;Excessive force&#8221;); 
 
(e)  Deaths due to the attacks or killings by security forces of the State, or by 
paramilitary groups, death squads, or other private forces cooperating with or tolerated by 
the State (&#8220;Attacks or killings&#8221;); 
 
(f)  Violations of the right to life during armed conflicts, especially of the civilian 
population and other non-combatants, contrary to international humanitarian law 
(&#8220;Violations of right to life in armed conflict&#8221;); 
 
(g)  Expulsion, refoulement, or return of persons to a country or a place where their 
lives are in danger (&#8220;Expulsion&#8221;); 
 
(h)  Impunity, compensation and the rights of victims (&#8220;Impunity&#8221;).

<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>B. Subject(s) of appeal 
</b> 
4. The subjects of appeal are classified in accordance with paragraph 6 of Commission of Human 
Rights resolution 2004/37 and paragraph 5 (b) of General Assembly resolution 61/173. 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>C. Character of replies received 
</b> 
5. The replies received have been classified according to the following five categories designed 
to assist the Commission in its task of evaluating the effectiveness of the mandate: 
 
</p>
<p>(a) &#8220;Largely satisfactory response&#8221; denotes a reply that is responsive to the 
allegations and that substantially clarifies the facts. It does not, however, imply that the 
action taken necessarily complies with international human rights law; 
</p>
<p> 
(b) &#8220;Cooperative but incomplete response&#8221; denotes a reply that provides some 
clarification of the allegations but that contains limited factual substantiation or that fails 
to address some issues; 
</p>
<p> 
(c) &#8220;Allegations rejected but without adequate substantiation&#8221; denotes a reply 
denying the allegations but which is not supported by documentation or analysis that can 
be considered satisfactory under the circumstances;  
</p>
<p> 
(d) &#8220;Receipt acknowledged&#8221; denotes a reply acknowledging that the communication 
was received but without providing any substantive information; 
</p>
<p> 
(e) &#8220;No response&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 
There are two minor, additional characterizations: (i) Where a response has been received but 
has not yet been translated by the United Nations, the response is characterized simply as 
&#8220;Translation awaited&#8221;; (ii) Where a response has not been received from the Government but 
less than 90 days has elapsed since the communication was sent, that fact is indicated by 
characterizing the response as: &#8220;No response (recent communication)&#8221;. 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>D. Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>6. In order to underscore the importance of the dialogue between the Special Rapporteur and 
Governments and to avoid any appearance that the principal goal is the exchange of 
correspondence for its own sake, this report contains brief comments by the Special Rapporteur 
on the extent to which he considers each reply to have responded adequately to the concerns 
arising under the mandate. An indication is also provided in instances in which additional 
information is required to respond effectively to the information received. As the procedures of 
the Human Rights Council evolve, in an effort to establish a more effective, credible, 
comprehensive and integrated system for promoting respect for human rights these comments 
will ideally be taken into account in the peer review procedure which is likely to be set up.<b> </b></p>

</b> 
9. The subjects of communications are classified in accordance with paragraph 6 of Commission 
of Human Rights resolution 2004/37.

</b></p>
<p><b>C. &#8220;Alleged violations of the right to life upon which the Special Rapporteur intervened&#8221;

<p><b>Afghanistan: Death Sentence of Abdul Rahman 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Non-respect of international standards relating to the imposition of capital 
punishment 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal: </b>1 male (member of religious minority) 
<b> 
Character of reply: </b>No response 
<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Afghanistan has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human 
Rights. 
<b> 
Urgent appeal dated 22 March 2006 
</b></p>
<p>  
We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received 
regarding <b>Abdul Rahman</b>. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> 
Abdul Rahman is currently being tried in a Kabul court on criminal charges of conversion 
from Islam to Christianity. Mr. Rahman was arrested in February 2006 after the police 
received information that he was a convert.  He was found carrying a Bible at the time of 
his arrest. During his trial, Mr. Rahman acknowledged that he had converted to 
Christianity sixteen years ago. The Prosecutor, Mr. Wasi, indicated he would be willing 
to drop the charges if Mr. Rahman reconverted to Islam, but Mr. Rahman is unwilling to 
do so. According to the information received, conversion from Islam carries the death 
sentence under national law. 
</p>
<p> 
While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would also like to appeal 
to your Excellency's Government to ensure the right to freedom of religion or belief in 
accordance with the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief and article 18 of the Universal 
Declaration on Human Rights as well as of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. 
 
We would like to draw the Government&#8217;s attention to General Comment 22 of the Human Rights 
Committee.  Paragraph 3 provides that, &#8220;Art. 18 does not permit any limitations whatsoever on 
the freedom of thought and conscience or the freedom to have or adopt a religion or belief on 
one&#8217;s choice.&#8221;  Furthermore, paragraph 5 of General Comment 22 of the Human Rights 
Committee provides that, &#8220;The Committee observes that the freedom to &#8220;have or adopt&#8221; a 
religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right 
to replace one&#8217;s current religion or belief with another&#8221;. The General Comment goes on in 
Paragraph 9 to state that, &#8220;the fact that a religion is recognized as a state religion [&#8230;] shall not 
result in any impairment of the enjoyment of any of the rights under the Covenant, including 
article 18 [&#8230;], nor in any discrimination against adherents to other religions&#8221;.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 24 
 
 
We would also like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that, in accordance with article 
6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, &#8220;in countries which have not 
abolished the death penalty, sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;. 
In its General Comment No. 6, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has stated that &#8220;the 
expression &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; must be read restrictively to mean that the death penalty should 
be a quite exceptional measure&#8221;. Finally, the Safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of 
those facing the death penalty approved by Economic and Social Council resolution 1984/50 of 
25 May 1984 provide that &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death penalty, capital 
punishment may be imposed only for the most serious crimes, it being understood that their 
scope should not go beyond intentional crimes with lethal or other extremely grave 
consequences&#8221; (para. 1).  
 
In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of Mr. Rahman in compliance with the 
obligations under international law of your Excellency&#8217;s Government, as outlined above. 
</p>
<p> 
It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all 
cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the Commission, 
we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when 
relevant to the case under consideration: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2. Please indicate the law and the relevant articles, under which Abdul Rahman has been 
charged.  Please provide a copy of the relevant articles.   
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>3.  Please indicate the extent to which the criminalization of conversion is compatible with 
the international standards referred to above.  
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>4.  Please indicate how many people have been tried and convicted on charges relating to 
conversion during the past year.

The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Afghanistan has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human 
Rights. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal dated 20 April 2006</b> sent with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers<b> 
</b> 
We would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government reports we have 
received regarding the trial of Mr. <b>Asadullah Sarwari</b> and the imposition of the death penalty 
against him. We understand that Mr. Sarwari, who is now aged 65, was the head of 
Afghanistan&#8217;s intelligence service (AGSA) under the regime of Hafizullah Amin (1978-79), 
which carried out mass arrests and summarily executed many of those detained. According to the 
information received: 
</p>
<p> 
Mr. Sarwari was arrested in 1992 by a Mojahedin force following the withdrawal from 
Afghanistan of the Soviet Union&#8217;s armed forces. In 2003 he was handed over to the 
intelligence service of your Excellency&#8217;s Government, the National Security Directorate. 
In autumn 2005, Mr. Sarwari requested President Karzai &#8216;for justice&#8217;. Criminal 
proceedings against him were initiated and he was charged with several crimes against 
the internal security of the state, including inviting armed forces to an uprising, using 
force to overthrow the presidency, and homicide.  
 
The trial consisted of 3 hearings, the first on 26 December 2005, the last on 25 February 
</p><p>2006. Because of the highly charged atmosphere surrounding the trial and of the 
precarious security situation, Mr. Sarwari was unable to find a suitable lawyer to 
represent him. Most of the evidence adduced at trial related to the arrest and subsequent 
disappearance of up to 70 members of a family, the Mujeddadi, in June 1979. At the final 
trial hearing on 25 February 2006, at Kabul National Security Primary Court, sixteen 
witnesses gave testimony. Some of them were called by the prosecutor, others &#8216;gave 
evidence&#8217; spontaneously from the public gallery. Members of the Mujeddadi family and 
household stated that the accused was present at, and was in charge of, the arrests. One 
witness came forward and gave evidence supportive of Mr. Sarwari, stating that 120 
detainees were released by him in 1979. This produced an angry reaction from the public 
gallery. The presiding judge called the audience to order and stated that it was important 
that the court listened to both sides. Mr. Sarwari was not given the opportunity to cross 
examine any of the witnesses. 
 
Mr. Sarwari read out his defence statement denying all allegations against him. He 
complained about his illegal arrest and detention for more than 13 years without trial. He 
admitted to having issued arrest warrants, but asked the prosecutor to produce any 
testimony or documentary proof that could prove his involvement in the killing of 
detainees. During this exchange, the Prosecutor conceded the absence of any article in the 
Penal Code of Afghanistan under which Mr. Sarwari could be convicted as a war 
criminal, but argued that Mr. Sarwari&#8217;s official position as the head of AGSA was </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 26 
 
</p>
<p>sufficient to hold him responsible for the murder and disappearance of innocent 
countrymen under Article 130 of the Constitution.  
 
At 1.30 p.m. the judicial panel retired to consider its verdict. Fifteen minutes later the 
judges returned and pronounced the judgment and sentence. Mr. Sarwari was found 
guilty of the &#8216;killing of countless Afghans&#8217; on the basis of his involvement in the arrest of 
members of the Mujeddadi family and on the basis of his senior official position in the 
Amin Regime. He was not found guilty on any specific count contained in the indictment 
but rather, according to the judge, in accordance with article 130 of the Constitution 
which states that 'if there is no provision in the Constitution or other laws about a case, 
the courts shall in pursuance of Hanafi jurisprudence and within the limits set by the 
Constitution, rule in a way that attains justice in the best manner&#8217;. On the basis of this 
guilty finding, he was sentenced to death. 
 
It would appear that the Attorney General has filed an appeal against the judgment (or the 
sentence), while Mr. Sarwari has not appealed against the judgment and sentence within 
the 20-day deadline provided by the Interim Criminal procedure Code. <b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>We would like to commend your Excellency&#8217;s Government for bringing to justice a person 
accused of responsibility as a commander for numerous summary executions (although we 
remain concerned that the Afghan criminal code does not proscribe war crimes and crimes 
against humanity, and therefore does not allow the prosecution to file charges which fully reflect 
the seriousness of the crimes Mr. Sarwari is accused of &#8211; an issue which the problems related to 
the charges in the present trial would appear to highlight). Indeed, ending the impunity of those 
responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the 25 years of armed 
conflict in Afghanistan is an important obligation of your Excellency&#8217;s Government under 
international law and the Action Plan on Peace, Justice and Reconciliation. It also constitutes a 
demand of the Afghani people, as set forth in the Afghan Independent Human Rights 
Commission&#8217;s report <i>A Call for Justice. A National Consultation on Past Human Rights 
Violations in Afghanistan</i>.  
</p>
<p> 
Such efforts to ensure accountability must, however, themselves comply with international 
human rights law. While capital punishment is not prohibited under international law, it must be 
regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and is surrounded with strict 
limitations by international law binding upon your Excellency&#8217;s Government, in particular 
articles 6 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. With specific regard 
to the case of Mr. Sarwari, we would like to draw your attention to the requirement that &#8220;in 
capital punishment cases, the obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees 
for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the [ICCPR] admits of no exception&#8221; (Little v. Jamaica, 
communication no. 283/1988, Views of the Human Rights Committee of 19 November 1991, 
para. 10). The reports concerning the trial of Mr. Sarwari raise a number of very serious concerns 
with regard to the right to a fair trial: 
</p>
<p> 
(i) Regarding the requirement of independence and impartiality of the tribunal (article 
</p>
<p>14(1) ICCPR), reports indicate that before the decisive hearing of 25 February 2006 
representatives of the Mujeddadi family (i.e. victims and prosecution witnesses) and the Head of 
the Department of Judicial Inspections of the Supreme Court, Mr. Halimi, were sitting in the </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 27 
 
judges&#8217; chambers at the court house and meeting with the judge presiding over the trial. Mr. 
Halimi sat in the front row of the court throughout the hearing, next to prosecution witnesses and 
close to the prosecutor. At one point he intervened during the trial. When the judges retired to 
consider their verdict, he also left the court. Moreover, the judicial panel took only fifteen 
minutes of deliberation to find the applicant guilty and sentence him to death. We acknowledge 
that the presiding judge reportedly gave Mr. Sarwari the opportunity to speak unhindered in his 
defence and reminded the public that both sides must be given a full hearing. The circumstances 
referred to above, however, engender the impression of possibly undue influence over the trial 
judges by the Department of Judicial Inspections of the Supreme Court and the victims&#8217; family 
and cast a grave shadow over the appearance of independence and impartiality of the tribunal. 
</p>
<p> 
(ii) Regarding the accused&#8217;s right to be informed of the charges, to be given adequate 
</p>
<p>time and facilities for the preparation of his defence, and to be enabled to examine the witnesses 
against him and obtain the attendance of witnesses on his behalf (article 14(3), letters (a), (b) and 
(e) ICCPR), nothing in the reports I have received indicates that the accused had prior notice of 
who would give evidence against him and what exactly the witnesses would give evidence on. 
Under articles 51 and 53 of the Interim Criminal Procedure Code the prosecution was obliged to 
submit to the court a list of witnesses it intends to call, which it failed to do. Mr. Sarwari 
therefore had no opportunity to call evidence in rebuttal, to effectively challenge the prosecution 
evidence or to properly prepare his defence. The accused was not given the opportunity to cross-
examine the witnesses against him, and did not call any witnesses on his behalf. Finally, the 
accused was convicted on the basis of a provision, Article 130 of the Constitution, that was not 
contained in the criminal code in force at the time of the trial, was not mentioned in the 
indictment and reportedly was not discussed in the course of the trial, which would appear to 
have seriously undermined his chances of effectively preparing his defence. Articles 57 and 42 
of the Interim Criminal Procedure Code as well require prior notice to be given to the defence of 
changes in the definition of offences alleged. 
</p>
<p> 
(iii) Regarding the accused&#8217;s right &#8220;to defend himself in person or through legal 
</p>
<p>assistance of his own choosing &#8230; and to have legal assistance assigned to him, in any case 
where the interests of justice so require&#8221; (article 14(3), letter (d) ICCPR), Mr. Sarwari did not 
enjoy any legal assistance. The reports we have received indicate that this was not his free 
choice, but due to the circumstance that no lawyer was willing to take up his defence. We am 
also concerned that in the indictment, Mr. Sarwari&#8217;s request for an attorney was viewed as 
disruptive of the prosecution&#8217;s investigation and as another basis for his guilt. 
</p>
<p> 
(iv) Regarding the right to obtain review of conviction and sentence by a higher court 
</p>
<p>(article 14(5) ICCPR), the effective exercise of this right requires that the defendant be provided 
with legal counsel and time to adequately prepare his appeal. 
</p>
<p> 
We do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the reports we have received. In the event, however, 
that they were accurate, entirely or also only in part, we have no doubt that international law 
requires your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure that the death penalty is not carried out. I urge 
your Government to ensure that the concerns we (and other observers) have expressed with 
regard to the trial are fully taken into account at the second instance stage, whether or not Mr. 
Sarwari himself files an appeal against the judgment. We further urge your Government to </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 28 
 
ensure that Mr. Sarwari be provided with adequate legal assistance for all remaining procedural 
stages in his case. 
</p>
<p> 
In 2003, the Commission on Human Rights called on the Afghanistan Transitional 
Administration to &#8220;declare a moratorium on the death penalty in the light of procedural and 
substantive flaws in the Afghan judicial system.&#8221; (Situation of Human Rights in Afghanistan, 
CHR Res. 2003/77). We recognize that your Excellency&#8217;s Government is undertaking 
considerable efforts to improve the criminal justice system under the most challenging 
circumstances. Nonetheless, we consider that the concerns highlighted with regard to the trial of 
Mr. Sarwari (as well as those I set forth in my letter to your Government of 31 August 2005 
concerning the cases of Messrs. Sharifullah (surname unknown), Habib al-Rahman, Zalmai 
(surname unknown), Neyaz Mohammad, Tila Mohammad (known as Telgai), Mohammad Rafiq, 
and Omar Khan, which unfortunately has remained unanswered), require your Government to 
suspend all executions in order to live up to its obligations under international law.  
</p>
<p> 
It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all such 
cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on this case, we would be grateful 
for your cooperation and your observations  
 
a) as to whether the above information concerning the trial and sentence of Mr. Sarwari is 
accurate; and 
 
b) regarding all steps undertaken by your Government to ensure that Mr. Sarwari is not 
executed in violation of international law, including information concerning all ongoing and 
future proceedings in his case. 
 
We would appreciate a response on these matters before any irreversible steps are taken in 
relation to the fate of Mr. Sarwari. We undertake to ensure that your Government&#8217;s response is 
accurately reflected in the reports we will submit.

Nous souhaitons attirer votre attention sur nos commentaires  au sujet de l&#8217;adoption par le 
Gouvernement de son Excellence des mesures d&#8217;application de la Charte pour la paix et la 
r&#233;conciliation nationale (au sujet de laquelle nous vous avons d&#233;j&#224; communiqu&#233; notre point de 
vue par lettre du 27 avril 2005). Toutefois, ne voulant pas &#224; ce stade pr&#233;juger des all&#233;gations qui 
nous ont &#233;t&#233; soumises, nous saurions gr&#233; au Gouvernement de votre Excellence de bien vouloir 
nous faire parvenir dans les plus brefs d&#233;lais une copie des textes susmentionn&#233;s.  
 
D&#8217;apr&#232;s les renseignements dont nous disposons, le projet d&#8217;ordonnance et les d&#233;crets 
pr&#233;sidentiels portant mise en &#339;uvre de la Charte pourraient ne pas &#234;tre  conformes aux 
obligations de droit international prises par l&#8217;Alg&#233;rie. En effet, il nous a &#233;t&#233; rapport&#233; que le 
sixi&#232;me chapitre du projet d&#8217;ordonnance relatif aux &#171; artisans de la sauvegarde de la R&#233;publique 
Alg&#233;rienne D&#233;mocratique et Populaire &#187; consacrerait l&#8217;impunit&#233; des forces de l&#8217;ordre et 
assimil&#233;s pour les crimes commis durant la guerre civile. Il interdirait toute poursuite p&#233;nale, 
d&#233;nonciation ou plainte publique &#224; l&#8217;encontre des forces de d&#233;fense et de s&#233;curit&#233; de la 
R&#233;publique pour des actions men&#233;es en vue de la protection des personnes et des biens, de la 
sauvegarde de la nation et de la pr&#233;servation des institutions.  
 
Si elles s&#8217;av&#233;raient exactes, ces dispositions d&#233;rogeraient au Pacte International relatif aux Droits 
Civils et Politiques (article 2 para 3 a) auquel le Gouvernement de son Excellence est partie et 
selon lequel &#171; les Etats s&#8217;engagent &#224; (&#8230;) garantir que toute personne dont les droits et libert&#233;s 
reconnus dans le pr&#233;sent Pacte auront &#233;t&#233; viol&#233;s disposera d&#8217;un recours utile, alors m&#234;me que la 
violation aurait &#233;t&#233; commise par des personnes agissant dans l&#8217;exercice de leurs fonctions 
officielles &#187;.  
 
De m&#234;me, le texte &#233;noncerait l&#8217;extinction des poursuites judiciaires pour les personnes qui se 
sont pr&#233;sent&#233;es aux autorit&#233;s entre le 13 janvier 2000 et un d&#233;lai de six mois &#224; partir de la 
promulgation de l&#8217;ordonnance, &#224; condition qu&#8217;elles ne soient pas impliqu&#233;es dans les faits de 
massacres collectifs, viols ou usage d&#8217;explosifs dans les lieux publics. B&#233;n&#233;ficieraient &#233;galement 
de cette amnistie les personnes recherch&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;rieur ou &#224; l&#8217;ext&#233;rieur du territoire national 
ainsi que celles condamn&#233;es par contumace.  
 
Nous f&#233;licitons le Gouvernement de son Excellence de sa d&#233;cision de ne pas amnistier les crimes 
les plus graves et esp&#233;rons que celui-ci se conformera avec son devoir d&#8217;enqu&#234;te sur de telles 
violations afin de garantir qu&#8217;elles ne se reproduisent. Nous regrettons cependant que les auteurs 
d&#8217;ex&#233;cutions extrajudiciaires, actes de torture ou disparitions forc&#233;es soient, malgr&#233; la gravit&#233; de 
leur crimes, couverts par l&#8217;amnistie. 
 
Enfin, il nous a &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; rapport&#233; que le chapitre cinq du projet d&#8217;ordonnance codifiant les 
mesures d&#8217;appui &#224; la politique de prise en charge du dossier des disparus pr&#233;voirait 
l&#8217;indemnisation des ayants droit contre l&#8217;octroi d&#8217;un jugement de d&#233;c&#232;s. Nous saluons ces 
mesures de compensation car elles sont conformes &#224; l&#8217;article 19 de la D&#233;claration sur la 
protection de toutes les personnes contre les disparitions forc&#233;es. Cependant, nous souhaitons 
porter &#224; l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement de  son Excellence que dans l&#8217;hypoth&#232;se o&#249; la d&#233;livrance 
d&#8217;un certificat de d&#233;c&#232;s emp&#234;cherait les familles des victimes d&#8217;entamer des poursuites 
judiciaires, cette disposition enfreindrait  les articles 17 et 18 de la D&#233;claration pr&#233;c&#233;demment 
mentionn&#233;e qui stipulent notamment que tout acte conduisant &#224; une disparition forc&#233;e continue </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

d&#8217;&#234;tre consid&#233;r&#233; comme un crime aussi longtemps que ses auteurs dissimulent le sort r&#233;serv&#233; &#224; la 
personne disparue et le lieu o&#249; elle se trouve et que les faits n&#8217;ont pas &#233;t&#233; &#233;lucid&#233;s, et que les 
auteurs pr&#233;sum&#233;s de disparitions forc&#233;es ne peuvent b&#233;n&#233;ficier d&#8217;aucune loi d&#8217;amnistie sp&#233;ciale 
ni d&#8217;autres mesures analogues qui auraient pour effet de les exon&#233;rer de toute poursuite ou 
sanction p&#233;nale.  
 
<b>R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement de l&#8217;Alg&#233;rie du 24 mars 2006 
</b> 
Le Gouvernement alg&#233;rien a pris connaissance du contenu de votre lettre du 02 mars 2006. Il se 
d&#233;clare contre la tendance &#224; vouloir rel&#233;guer au second plan la volont&#233; populaire souveraine qui 
proc&#232;de de solutions naturellement r&#233;alistes. Seul le peuple alg&#233;rien r&#233;solument tourn&#233; vers 
l&#8217;avenir, est investi de l&#8217;autorit&#233; politique et morale de choisir les conditions et les implications 
de sa sortie de crise. Seul l&#8217;Etat national alg&#233;rien est habilit&#233; &#224; traduire la volont&#233; populaire en 
texte l&#233;gislatifs et r&#233;glementaires destin&#233;s &#224; prendre en charge tous les aspects de la paix et de la 
r&#233;conciliation nationale que le peuple alg&#233;rien soutient massivement. 
 
L&#8217;appr&#233;ciation que vous portez sur les textes de loi pris en application d&#8217;un Charte issue d&#8217;une 
consultation r&#233;f&#233;rendaire d&#233;mocratique et &#224; laquelle le peuple alg&#233;rien a majoritairement 
souscrit, le 29 septembre 2005, n&#8217;est pas recevable. Elle constitue une atteinte &#224; son libre arbitre 
et &#224; la volont&#233; citoyenne des Alg&#233;riens et des Alg&#233;riennes au nom duquel la justice est rendue. 
Elle contient des r&#233;f&#233;rents p&#233;remptoires et inacceptables sur les institutions r&#233;publicaines 
garantes de l&#8217;ordre, de la s&#233;curit&#233; et de la souverainet&#233; de la Nation alg&#233;rienne.  
 
Votre d&#233;marche est choquante et p&#234;che par une partialit&#233; &#233;vidente, dans la mesure o&#249; elle 
discrimine entre les victimes aux d&#233;pens de la quasi-totalit&#233; de ces derniers qui ont p&#233;ri ou p&#226;ti 
par suite d&#8217;actes terroristes. Elle cherche visiblement &#224; culpabiliser les agents de l&#8217;Etat pour des 
supputations hypoth&#233;tiques tout en occultant totalement les h&#233;catombes criminelles des groupes 
terroristes, auteurs av&#233;r&#233;s de pr&#232;s de deux cent mille morts. D&#8217;ailleurs, lors d&#8217;un entretien que 
j&#8217;ai eu le 6 avril 2005, en marge des travaux de la 61&#232;me session de la Commission des Droits de 
l&#8217;Homme avec M. Stephen J. Toope, j&#8217;ai soulev&#233; cette question sans pour autant recevoir une 
r&#233;ponse ad&#233;quate. M. Toope s&#8217;est limit&#233; &#224; affirmer que les groupes terroristes sont certs les 
auteurs de violations, en citant le cas du N&#233;pal, mais, a-t-il ajout&#233;, le mandat du Groupe qu&#8217;il 
pr&#233;side prend en charge uniquement les victimes de disparitions dont les auteurs seraient les 
agents de l&#8217;Etat. Selon cette d&#233;marche, les violations des droits de l&#8217;homme ne seraient pas 
dignes de compassion ou de prise en charge internationale, s&#8217;il s&#8217;agit de victimes de terrorisme, 
L&#8217;Alg&#233;rie rejette une telle approche s&#233;lective aux droits de l&#8217;homme, toute vie humaine &#233;tant 
digne selon elle de la m&#234;me compassion et de la m&#234;me protection. 
 
C&#8217;est fort du mandat que le peuple souverain lui a confi&#233;, &#224; la suite d&#8217;un scrutin d&#233;mocratique, 
par voie de r&#233;f&#233;rendum le 29 septembre 2005, que le Gouvernement a initi&#233; et adopt&#233; 
l&#8217;ordonnance portant mise en &#339;uvre de la Charte pour la paix et la r&#233;conciliation nationale ainsi 
que ses textes d&#8217;application. 
 
Par ces textes l&#8217;Alg&#233;rie a choisi sa propre voie pour apaiser les esprits, pacifier les rapports 
sociaux et rassembler les composantes de la soci&#233;t&#233;. Il s&#8217;agit d&#8217;une aspiration citoyenne &#224; 
laquelle aucune autre l&#233;gitimit&#233; n&#8217;est opposable. Elle constitue la juste voie de cicatrisation 
sociale qu&#8217;a agr&#233;&#233;e la Nation alg&#233;rienne. </p>

L&#8217;Alg&#233;rie qui a longtemps combattu seule, dans un pass&#233; r&#233;cent, dans l&#8217;incompr&#233;hension des uns 
et la suspicion des autres, le terrorisme barbare a chosi dans le contexte dynamique de la 
concorde civile initi&#233;e en 199, d&#8217;emprunter la voie de la paix et de la r&#233;conciliation nationale en 
se fondant sur ses propres r&#233;f&#233;rences et son propre v&#233;cu. 
 
Cette r&#233;conciliation vise une reconstitution viable du tissu social gravement endommag&#233; par les 
douleurs, les blessures et les souffrances. Elle se propose de prendre en charge les victimes, 
toutes les victimes, de la trag&#233;die nationale et d&#8217;assurer &#224; leurs ayants-droit la protection sociale 
de l&#8217;Etat. Le processus de r&#233;conciliation nationale fort complexe ne doit pas &#234;tre d&#233;tach&#233; de son 
context historique et factuel. 
 
L&#8217;Alg&#233;rie a toujours manifest&#233; sa disponibilit&#233; et sa coop&#233;ration avec les m&#233;canismes 
th&#233;matiques de la Commission des droits de l&#8217;Homme, y compris dans les moments les plus 
difficiles. Elle n&#8217;a pas m&#233;nag&#233; ses efforts, lorsqu&#8217;il a &#233;t&#233; port&#233; &#224; sa connaissance des faits 
suffisamment document&#233;s pour enqu&#234;ter et poursuivre les auteurs de manquement &#224; la loi contre 
toutes formes d&#8217;atteintes aux droits de l&#8217;homme. Elle souligne que la mission p&#233;renne de 
protection des droits de l&#8217;homme incombe &#224; l&#8217;Etat national qui sanctionne avec s&#233;v&#233;rit&#233; tout 
d&#233;passement de la part des agents charg&#233;s de l&#8217;application de la loi. Elle accepte volontiers la 
critique constructive, tout autant qu&#8217;elle rejette les proc&#232;s d&#8217;intention. 
 
Le Gouvernement alg&#233;rien souligne qu&#8217;il est respectueux des nombreux engagements 
internationaux qu&#8217;il a librement contract&#233;s et r&#233;cuse l&#8217;invocation dans ce contexte de la 
D&#233;claration des Nations Unies de 1992 qui, faut-il le rappeler, n&#8217;est pas un instrument juridique 
contraignant et qui n&#8217;est donc pas pertinent. Au demeurant, en mati&#232;re de disparitions forc&#233;es ou 
involontaires, une Convention internationale opposable aux Etats est encore su stade de projet. 
 
Le Gouvernement alg&#233;rien rappelle que le peuple qui est, selon la Constituion alg&#233;rienne, 
l&#8217;unique source de la souverainet&#233; et le seul artisan du changement institutionnel, exerce en 
cons&#233;quence la libert&#233; de choisir son syst&#232;me politique, juridique, &#233;conomique ou culturel. Le 
respect de ce choix consacr&#233; par la Charte des Nations Unies doit &#234;tre observ&#233; en premier lieu 
par les organes et les m&#233;canismes qui en d&#233;pendent. Toute autre attitude, de la part de ces 
derniers, serait, en cette p&#233;riode d&#8217;&#233;valuation des cadres existants en vue de gain de l&#8217;efficacit&#233; et 
de la cr&#233;dibilit&#233;, une claire invitation aux Etats &#224; assumer pleinement leurs responsabilit&#233;s contre 
les d&#233;rives et autres pratiques arbitraires par toutes les voies l&#233;gitimes qui leur sont ouvertes. 
 
Enfin, comme suite &#224; votre demande, vous voudrez bien trouver, joint en annexe, les textes 
d&#8217;application portant mise en &#339;uvre de la Charte pour la paix et pour la r&#233;conciliation nationale. 
 
<b>Lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation envoy&#233;e le 17 mai 2006</b> conjointement avec le Pr&#233;sident du groupe de 
travail sur les disparitions forc&#233;es ou involontaires. 
 
En r&#233;ponse &#224; votre lettre du 24 mars 2006 portant r&#233;f&#233;rence IJ/MedMB/338/06, nous souhaitons 
attirer l&#8217;attention de votre Gouvernement sur le fait que notre communication du 2 mars 2006 ne 
remet pas en question le principe de la souverainet&#233; du peuple alg&#233;rien. Nous r&#233;affirmons en 
effet le droit absolu de ce dernier &#224; choisir librement la mani&#232;re dont il veut r&#233;pondre &#224; des 
ann&#233;es de violence et de troubles internes, y compris par l&#8217;adoption par r&#233;f&#233;rendum populaire </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

d&#8217;une Charte pour la paix et la r&#233;conciliation nationale. Nous tenons cependant &#224; rappeler au 
Gouvernement de son Excellence que celui-ci est tenu de respecter les engagements &#171; qu&#8217;il a 
librement contract&#233;s &#187; et qu&#8217;&#224; ce titre, il doit donner effet aux droits reconnus dans le Pacte 
International relatif aux Droits Civils et Politiques, comme &#233;nonc&#233; en son article 2 paragraphe 2.  
 
En tant que partie au dit Pacte, l&#8217;Alg&#233;rie s&#8217;est engag&#233;e &#224; respecter et &#224; garantir &#224; tous les 
individus se trouvant sur son territoire et relevant de sa comp&#233;tence les droits qui y sont 
reconnus, sans distinction aucune (article 2, paragraphe 1). Nous rappelons au Gouvernement de 
son Excellence que, conform&#233;ment &#224; l&#8217;article 6 paragraphe 1 du Pacte, celui-ci s&#8217;est engag&#233; &#224; 
respecter le droit &#224; la vie. Dans son Commentaire G&#233;n&#233;ral No 6 paragraphe 4 relatif &#224; ce m&#234;me 
article, le Comit&#233; des Droits de l&#8217;Homme a expliqu&#233; que pour prot&#233;ger le droit &#224; la vie, &#171; les 
Etats parties doivent adopter des mesures sp&#233;cifiques et efficaces afin de pr&#233;venir les disparitions 
forc&#233;es  d&#8217;individus &#187; &#8230;  &#171; qui &#233;quivalent trop souvent &#224; une privation arbitraire de la vie &#187;. Il a 
par ailleurs &#233;nonc&#233; que &#171; les Etats doivent mettre en &#339;uvre des mesures et proc&#233;dures efficaces 
afin de mener des enqu&#234;tes exhaustives relatives aux cas de personnes disparues dans des 
circonstances pouvant impliquer une violation du droit &#224; la vie &#187;. Le devoir strict des Etats 
parties de pr&#233;venir et enqu&#234;ter sur les cas de personnes disparues a par ailleurs &#233;t&#233; unanimement 
confirm&#233; par le Comit&#233; dans <i>Maingo Muiyo v Zaire</i> (194/85), <i>Mojica v Dominica Republic</i> 
(449/91), et <i>Laureano v Peru</i> (540/93).  Ainsi, on ne peut simplement arguer que la d&#233;claration 
sur la protection de toutes les personnes contre les disparitions forc&#233;es n&#8217;est pas juridiquement 
contraignante car nombre de ses dispositions refl&#232;tent des principes de droit fondamentaux 
contenus dans le Pacte International relatif aux Droits Civils et Politiques.  
 
Enfin, nous tenons &#224; clarifier que le Pr&#233;sident Rapporteur du Groupe de Travail sur les 
disparitions forc&#233;es et le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial sur les ex&#233;cutions extrajudiciaires, sommaires ou 
arbitraires n&#8217;ont aucunement l&#8217;intention d&#8217;exclure du domaine des droits de l&#8217;Homme les 
poursuites &#224; l&#8217;encontre de terroristes. A cet &#233;gard, dans son rapport &#224; la Commission des droits de 
l&#8217;Homme (E/CN.4/2005/7, paragraphes 65-76), Philip Alston a rappel&#233; que la r&#233;ponse d&#8217;un 
Gouvernement &#224; des meurtres par des acteurs non &#233;tatiques y compris par des membres de 
groupes terroristes rel&#232;ve de son mandat. En particulier, il a &#233;nonc&#233; que &#171; des crimes, y compris 
des meurtres, perp&#233;tr&#233;s par des particuliers peuvent aussi engager la responsabilit&#233; de l&#8217;Etat si 
celui-ci n&#8217;a pas pris les mesures voulues pour dissuader, emp&#234;cher et punir les auteurs ou pour 
corriger toute attitude ou toute situation dans la soci&#233;t&#233; qui encourage ou facilite de tels crimes &#187; 
(paragraphe 71).

Carta de alegaci&#243;n enviada el 1 de septiembre de 2006</b> conjuntamente con el 
Relator Especial sobre la tortura 
 
Quisi&#233;ramos llamar la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre la informaci&#243;n que hemos recibido en 
relaci&#243;n con los incidentes ocurridos en la Penitenciar&#237;a de Mendoza en la que recientemente se 
encontraron muertos a tres reclusos.  
 
Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 17 de junio de 2006, el preso <b>Sebasti&#225;n Alejandro 
Hormazabal</b> fue encontrado muerto en el Pabell&#243;n 9, celda 16, como consecuencia de heridas 
m&#250;ltiples causadas por un instrumento corto-punzante.  El 18 de junio de 2006, se encontraron 
los cad&#225;veres de los reclusos <b>Diego Ferranti Lucero</b> y <b>Gerardo G&#243;mez Gonz&#225;lez</b> en un patio 
del Pabell&#243;n 16 de m&#225;xima seguridad. Los dos reclusos habr&#237;an sido trasladados horas antes 
desde la c&#225;rcel de C&#243;rdoba y su traslado se deber&#237;a  a que el martes siguiente iban a declarar ante 
el juez que instruye la causa por un mot&#237;n ocurrido en Mendoza en el a&#241;o 2000. Seg&#250;n la 
informaci&#243;n recibida ambos reclusos habr&#237;an sido apu&#241;alados y degollados. 
 
De acuerdo a nuestras fuentes, dichas muertes no constituyen hechos aislados, sino que se dan en 
un contexto reiterado de violencia y denuncias de violaciones a los derechos humanos en las 
c&#225;rceles de la provincia de Mendoza. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, desde el a&#241;o 2000 han 
muerto m&#225;s de 40 internos en dependencias del Sistema Penitenciario Provincial, con 22 
fallecimientos registrados entre febrero 2004 y noviembre 2005. En el anexo a esta carta  
incluimos una lista con los nombres, la fecha, el lugar y la causa de la muerte de los 22 internos 
fallecidos durante este periodo.  Diez de ellos habr&#237;an muerto como consecuencia de heridas 
causadas por armas corto-punzantes, cinco por asfixia, uno debido a graves quemaduras, dos por 
disparos de arma de fuego durante un intento de fuga, uno habr&#237;a muerto electrocutado, un 
recluso habr&#237;a sido asesinado y luego descuartizado y otro habr&#237;a aparecido colgado de su 
cintur&#243;n en su celda. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, en noviembre del 2005 s&#243;lo exist&#237;a avance 
en dos investigaciones sobre estos fallecimientos.   
 
Igualmente, se nos ha informado que las condiciones de reclusi&#243;n en las c&#225;rceles de la Provincia 
de Mendoza son preocupantes. Existir&#237;a un grave hacinamiento  en condiciones de insalubridad, 
escasez de agua potable y de una atenci&#243;n m&#233;dica adecuada. Un n&#250;mero elevado de presos 
habr&#237;a denunciado maltrato por parte del personal penitenciario, imposici&#243;n arbitraria de 
sanciones y demora en los procesos judiciales. A este respecto, me gustar&#237;a llamar la atenci&#243;n de 
su Gobierno sobre las conclusiones del Grupo de Trabajo sobre la Detenci&#243;n Arbitraria, de la 
Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos de las Naciones Unidas. Durante su  visita a centros de 
detenci&#243;n en varias provincias argentinas incluyendo Mendoza en septiembre y octubre de 2003, 
el Grupo de Trabajo pudo comprobar &#8220;el hacinamiento y las malas condiciones de seguridad, 
salud, nutrici&#243;n, vestimenta y sanitarias en la mayor&#237;a de los centros de detenci&#243;n visitados.&#8221; 
Doc. ONU.E/CN.4/2004/3/Add.3, 23 de diciembre de 2003, p&#225;rrafo 62.  
 
Por otro lado, quisiera llamar la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre la resoluci&#243;n del 22 de noviembre 
de 2004 de la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos. En dicha resoluci&#243;n, la Corte pidi&#243; al 
estado argentino &#8220;adoptar las disposiciones necesarias para proteger la vida e integridad personal 
de todas las personas privadas de la libertad en la Penitenciar&#237;a de Mendoza y en la unidad 
Gustavo Andr&#233; de Lavalle, as&#237; como la de todas las personas que se encuentren en el interior de </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

&#233;stas&#8221;. En diciembre de 2004, la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana realiz&#243; una visita a las c&#225;rceles de la 
Provincia de Mendoza, y en su informe declar&#243; que las medidas tomadas hasta el momento por 
el Gobierno no eran id&#243;neas ni suficientes y que  los internos continuaban viviendo en 
&#8220;condiciones infrahumanas&#8221;. 
 
En este contexto, deseamos instar a su Gobierno a que investigue las muertes de los 22 reclusos 
que fallecieron en las c&#225;rceles de la Provincia de Mendoza entre el 2004 y el 2005, as&#237; como las 
muertes recientes de los reclusos <b>Sebasti&#225;n Alejandro Hormazabal, Diego Ferranti Lucero y 
Gerardo G&#243;mez Gonz&#225;lez </b>en Junio de 2006<b>. </b>Igualmente, instamos al Gobierno de su 
Excelencia<b> a </b>que imponga las sanciones adecuadas a las personas responsables de estas muertes  
y a que adopte todas las medidas necesarias para que dejen de repetirse este tipo de hechos. A 
este respecto, llamamos la atenci&#243;n de su gobierno sobre  los Principios relativos a una eficaz 
prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, resoluci&#243;n 
1989/65 del 24 de mayo de 1989 del Consejo Econ&#243;mico y Social. En particular, llamamos la 
atenci&#243;n sobre los principios 9 y 19 seg&#250;n los cuales, los Gobiernos deben proceder a una 
investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de todos los casos en que haya sospecha de tales 
ejecuciones o amenazas; publicar en un informe las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; y 
velar por que sean juzgadas las personas que la investigaci&#243;n haya identificado como 
participantes en tales ejecuciones, en cualquier territorio bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n.  
  
Finalmente, instamos al Gobierno de su Excelencia a tomar todas las medidas necesarias para 
garantizar las condiciones m&#237;nimas de seguridad y de respeto de la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica 
de todas las personas que se encuentran detenidas en las c&#225;rceles de la Provincia de Mendoza. A 
este respecto, llamamos la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre las Reglas m&#237;nimas para el tratamiento 
de los reclusos, adoptadas por el Consejo Econ&#243;mico y Social en sus resoluciones 663C (XXIV) 
del 31 de julio de 1957 y 2076 (LXII) del 13 de mayo de 1977,  as&#237; como sobre el Conjunto de 
Principios para la protecci&#243;n de todas las personas sometidas a cualquier forma de detenci&#243;n o 
prisi&#243;n, adoptado por la Asamblea General en su resoluci&#243;n 43/173 del 9 de diciembre de 1988. 
   
Es nuestra responsabilidad, de acuerdo con los mandatos que nos ha entregado la Comisi&#243;n de 
Derechos Humanos y que est&#225;n reforzados por las resoluciones pertinentes de la Asamblea 
General, intentar conseguir clarificaci&#243;n sobre los hechos llevados a nuestra atenci&#243;n. En nuestro 
deber de informar sobre esos casos al Consejo de Derechos Humanos, estar&#237;amos muy 
agradecidos de tener su cooperaci&#243;n y sus observaciones sobre los asuntos siguientes, siempre y 
cuando sean aplicables al caso en cuesti&#243;n:  
 
1. &#191;Son exactos los hechos a los que se refieren las alegaciones?  
 
2. &#191;Fue presentada alguna queja? 
 
3. Por favor, proporcione informaci&#243;n detallada sobre las investigaciones iniciadas en 
relaci&#243;n con la muerte de <b>Sebasti&#225;n Alejandro Hormazabal, Diego Ferranti Lucero y 
Gerardo G&#243;mez Gonz&#225;lez</b>, as&#237; como las muertes de los 22 reclusos que fallecieron en las 
c&#225;rceles de la Provincia de Mendoza entre el 2004 y el 2005. Por favor incluya el resultado de las 
autopsias, y si &#233;stas no tuvieron lugar o no fueron concluidas, le rogamos que explique el porqu&#233;.

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur appreciates the preliminary information that was provided by the 
Government of Australia in response to his earlier communication, but he regrets that the 
Government has yet to provide the results of investigations, information on any penal or 
disciplinary sanctions that were imposed, or information relating to any compensation provided 
to the family of Mulrunji. 
 
<b>Follow-up letter dated 17 October 2006</b> (to an allegation letter sent on 21 December 2004)<b> 
</b> 
I would like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s attention to our correspondence, (reflected in my report 
to the Commission on Human Rights E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.1 p. 28), relating to the death in 
custody of <b>Cameron Doomadgee (Mulrunji)</b> in a cell at the Palm Island police station in 
November 2004. In its response, your Excellency Government informed that the case was being 
investigated.  
 
As further indicated in my observations I have made in my report, I would be grateful if your 
Government could provide me with the results of the various investigations under way as well as 
with detailed information on any penal or disciplinary sanctions that were imposed. I would also 
be interested in getting information relating to any compensation provided to the family of 
Mulrunji.  
 
I would appreciate a response within sixty days. I undertake to ensure that your Government&#8217;s 
response is accurately reflected in the report I will submit to the Human Rights Council for its 
consideration.

<b>Observation of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving a substantive response concerning the many 
deaths reported by the police and special forces as having occurred in &#8220;crossfire&#8221; with criminals 
but that raise suspicions of being staged extrajudicial executions.  The SR would note, however, 
that the Government has already taken longer than the customary 90 days to respond. 
<b> 
Allegation letter dated 22 August 2006 
</b> 
I am writing about the trend that has emerged in the last two years of criminal suspects being 
shot and killed in crossfire while in the custody of Bangladeshi police or special forces. 
According to the information that I have received, many of these deaths are explained by law 
enforcement officials in a manner so consistent as to raise suspicions of police wrongdoing. The 
pattern of incidents would suggest that what the police and special forces report as &#8220;crossfire&#8221; 
deaths are in fact staged extrajudicial executions. 
 
There are many examples to choose from, but I cite only three of the more recent: 
 
</p>
<p>(i) On or about 7 November 2005 a man identified only as <b>Ahad</b>, 30, was killed in a 
shootout between police and Ahad&#8217;s cohorts in Narayanganj. Police arrested Ahad earlier 
that day or the day before. Following a confession, police took him to recover hidden 
arms. Alleged accomplices of Ahad attacked the police, and Ahad was killed in the 
crossfire. 
</p>
<p> 
(ii) On or about 6 November 2005 <b>Ebu Hossain</b>, 29, was killed in a shootout between police 
</p>
<p>and Mr. Hossain&#8217;s cohorts. A special team of police arrested Mr. Hossain about one day 
earlier in Dhaka. After a confession, police took him to recover hidden arms. While 
retrieving the arms, alleged accomplices of Mr. Hossain opened fire on police. Mr. 
Hossain was killed in the crossfire while trying to flee. 
</p>
<p> 
(iii) On or about 3 November 2005 <b>Projapati Biswas</b>, 45, was killed in a shootout between 
</p>
<p>police and Mr. Biswas&#8217;s cohorts. Mr. Biswas was identified as the leader of the New 
Biplabi Communist Party, an outlawed group. He was arrested about a day before in 
Bolabunia village. After a confession, police took him to Tangramari village to recover 
hidden arms. While retrieving the arms, accomplices of Mr. Biswas opened fire on the 
police. Mr. Biswas was caught in the crossfire and killed instantly. 
</p>
<p> 
For additional cases, please see the table of recent incidents attached to this letter as an annex. 
This table is by no means comprehensive. Indeed, I have received information concerning 
hundreds of other incidents. 
 
Many of the deaths involve the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), although the regular police and 
its auxiliary Cheetah and Cobra units are implicated as well. For example, in the year following 
RAB&#8217;s founding in or about June 2004, more than one hundred (100) crossfire deaths were 
attributed to that agency. But other agencies have also been cited. I have received reports that 
three hundred and twenty-four (324) people were killed by Bangladeshi police agencies in the 
first nine months of 2005, and that between June 2004 and January 2006 there were four hundred </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 39 
 
and sixty-seven (467) crossfire deaths. As will be seen from the table of incidents, the crossfire 
deaths have continued to occur almost daily in January 2006. 
 
I am aware that several RAB officers have been subject to punitive action. I am also aware the 
government has called for an inquiry into some of these deaths. Nonetheless, the crossfire deaths 
continue. Moreover, the frequency with which I receive such reports raises with some urgency 
the possibility that police officers, and in particular RAB members, operate in an atmosphere of 
effective impunity.  
 
I remind Your Excellency&#8217;s Government that under Article 6(1) of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, every human being has the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of his or 
her life. Death sentences may only be carried out pursuant to a final judgment rendered by a 
competent court (Article 6(2)) in accordance with the requirements of due process (Article 14). 
Accordingly, if these reported crossfire deaths in fact comprise extrajudicial executions, they 
would represent a violation of the Bangladeshi government&#8217;s international human rights 
obligations. It is also relevant that Bangladesh&#8217;s own constitution guarantees that no person shall 
be deprived of life save in accordance with the law (Articles 31 and 32). In this context, the 
number of suspects that are killed without legal process is alarming. 
 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the facts reported in any of the incidents 
reported, it is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human 
Rights and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify 
all such cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on these cases to the 
Commission I would be grateful for the cooperation of Your Excellency&#8217;s Government in 
providing responses and observations related to the following: 
 
(i) With respect to the cases of Ahad, Ebu Hossain, and Projapti Biswas, summarized above: 
 
</p>
<p>a. Are the facts alleged accurate? If not, please provide the correct details of each case. 
 
</p>
<p>b. In each case, police have alleged the dead suspect was wanted on a number of serious 
charges. I would be grateful if in your response you substantiated such allegations 
where possible, possibly with information about police investigations prior to arrest, 
or explained why supporting evidence is not available. 
</p>
<p> 
c. Please provide details about any complaints lodged by the public about any of these 
</p>
<p>deaths and details of the response to such complaints. 
 
</p>
<p>d. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, or 
judicial or other form of inquiry carried out in relation to these cases. 
</p>
<p> 
e. Please provide the details of any criminal prosecutions or other disciplinary action 
</p>
<p>taken with respect to any officers. Please include the facts of the incident for which 
the officers were punished, the details of the punishment, and whether the officer is 
still serving on the force. 
</p>

</p>
<p>f. Please indicate the amount, if any, of compensation that has been provided to the 
families of the victims. 
</p>
<p> 
(ii) Please provide information concerning relevant oversight mechanisms, codes of conduct 
</p>
<p>or similar protocols governing Bangladeshi police and, in particular, the RAB. Please 
provide information of any steps taken to prevent such crossfire deaths or other deaths 
from occurring in the future.

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates the preliminary information that was provided by the 
Government of Bangladesh in response to his earlier communication regarding the attack and 
death threats against Sumi Khan, but he regrets that the Government has not responded to his 
request for the results of investigations or information on the measures taken to ensure her

<b> 
Follow-up letter dated 17 October 2006</b> (to a letter of allegation sent on 5 May 2004)<b> 
</b> 
I would like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s attention to our correspondence, (reflected in my report 
to the Commission on Human Rights E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.1 p. 31), relating to the death of 
journalist <b>Sumi Khan</b> who was stabbed and critically wounded in the Nandan Kanon area of 
Chittagong on 27 April 2004. In its response, your Excellency Government informed that four 
persons were arrested and investigated and that all attempts had been made for the personal 
security of Ms Khan.  
</p>
<p> 
As further indicated in my observations, I would be grateful if your Government could provide 
me with detailed information relating to the outcome of this case and to the measures taken to 
ensure Ms Khan&#8217;s personal security. 
 
I would appreciate a response within sixty days. I undertake to ensure that your Government&#8217;s 
response is accurately reflected in the report I will submit to the Human Rights Council for its 
consideration.

<b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving a substantive response concerning the deaths 
of Abul Hawladar and Md. Shamin. 
<b> 
 
Allegation letter dated 30 October 2006 
</b> 
In this connection, I would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information I have 
received regarding the killings of two persons, reportedly  in a &#8216;crossfire' by the Rapid Action 
Battalion (RAB) in Khulna on 1 September 2006, after they were arrested from their respective 
houses. 
 
According to the information received, on the morning of 1 September 2006, a Rapid Action 
Battalion (RAB) team arrested Mr. <b>Md. Shamim</b> (laundry worker) and Mr. <b>Abul Hawladar</b> 
(chicken-seller) from the Tutpara area in Khulna. Early in the morning on September 2, sounds 
of gunfire and hand bombs blasted throughout the streets awaking the inhabitants of Baro 
Khalpar, Khulna city. When local people thought that it was a robbery they began to shout at the 
culprits; however, the RAB officers urged them not to worry and explained that they had an 
&#8216;encounter' with an extremist group.  
 
In its news release issued on September 2, the RAB-6 reported that they arrested Mr. Abul 
Hawladar and Mr. Md. Shamim from Tutpara on September 1, at around 9:00 am. During their 
interrogation, both men reportedly confessed that they were cashiers (toll-collector) of the 
underground extremist party &quot;Janajuddho&quot; (Mass war).  They also revealed the names of their 
associates, who were allegedly plotting destructive activities on a regular basis at their meetings 
in the Baro Khalpar area.  
 
The RAB officials informed that when they took Abul and Shamim to the Baro Khalpar area, 
terrorists open fired against the officials, who then replied with gunshots. The RAB officials also 
claim that during the &#8216;encounter' between the RAB and the gang, Abul and Shamim fled the 
scene. The police along with local people then found their bodies and brought Abul and Shamim, 
to the hospital where the on duty doctors declared them dead. According to the information I 
have received, the killings have not been investigated and they have been recorded as &#8220;killings in 
encounter&#8221;.  
 
It has been alleged that the use of lethal force against Abul Hawladar and Md. Shamim from 
Tutpara was not justified and that these killings are not an isolated incident. In this respect, it has 
been brought to my attention that 283 persons were reportedly killed in similar circumstances by 
the RAB since it began its operations in June 2004, in the aftermath of the anti-crime operation 
&#8220;Clean Heart&#8221;. I understand that many of these killings share certain common elements as they 
are often reported by the RAB as having taken place in an exchange of fire with the RAB, which 
is usually triggered by the presence of &#8220;terrorists&#8221;. In other instances, reports indicate that the 
culprits tried to escape and were caught in crossfire.  
 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 51 
 
Concerns have also been expressed for the families of the deceased who have reportedly 
received death threats by members of the RAB who told them not to speak out regarding the 
circumstances of the deaths of their relatives.  
</p>
<p> 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, I would like to refer Your 
Excellency's Government to the fundamental principles applicable to such incidents under 
international law. Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides 
that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. As the Human Rights Committee has 
clarified, &#8220;arbitrarily&#8221; means in a manner &#8220;disproportionate to the requirements of law 
enforcement in the circumstances of the case&#8221; (Views of the Committee in the case Su&#225;rez de 
Guerrero v. Colombia, Communication no. 45/1979, &#167; 13.3). In order to assess whether the use 
of lethal force was proportionate to the requirements of law enforcement, there must be a 
&#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective 
Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This principle 
was reiterated by the 61st session of the Commission on Human Rights in Resolution 2005/34 on 
&#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;the 
obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Commission added that this obligation 
includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate 
compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary 
measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to &#8230; prevent the recurrence of such 
executions&#8221;.  
 
I would also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to instruct its Rapid Action 
Battalion teams to comply with the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and 
Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. These principles note, inter alia, that law enforcement 
officials should &#8220;as far as possible apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force 
and firearms&#8221; and that &#8220;in any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when 
strictly unavoidable in order to protect life&#8221;. I would also like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s 
attention the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, adopted by the General Assembly 
resolution 34/169 (1979) which more succinctly stresses the limited role for lethal force in all 
enforcement operations. 
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly and extended by the 
Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected 
to report on these alleged incidents, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters: 
</p><p> 
1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate?  
 
2. On what basis was it decided to kill, rather than capture, Abul Hawladar and Mr. Md. 
Shamim? What rules of international law does your Excellency&#8217;s Government consider to 
govern these incidents? 
 
3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any police investigation, 
medical examination (autopsy), and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 52 
 
alleged use of lethal force in the above incidents. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have 
been inconclusive, please explain why. 
 
4. Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures or criminal prosecution in relation 
to the members of the armed forces responsible for the above killings. 
 
5. Please state whether any investigation into the alleged death threats against the families of 
Abul Hawladar and Mr. Md. Shamim have been initiated. If no inquiries have taken place, or if 
they have been inconclusive, please explain why. If investigations have occurred, were any 
measures taken to protect the families of the victims.

</p>
<p>Sans vouloir &#224; ce stade pr&#233;juger des faits qui nous ont &#233;t&#233; soumis, nous aimerions attirer 
l'attention de votre Excellence sur les principes fondamentaux applicables &#224; ces faits. L&#8217;article 6 
du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques  contient le droit de ne pas &#234;tre 
arbitrairement priv&#233; de la vie. L&#8217;article 7 du m&#234;me Pacte et l&#8217;article 1 de la Convention contre la 
torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants interdisent la torture et les 
peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants. 
 
Les rapports indiquent  que les victimes ont &#233;t&#233; vues vivantes pour la derni&#232;re fois lorsqu&#8217;elles 
ont &#233;t&#233; sous l&#8217;autorit&#233; des forces de s&#233;curit&#233; du Gouvernement de votre Excellence. Dans ces 
circonstances, le droit international des droits de l&#8217;homme &#233;tablit une pr&#233;somption de 
responsabilit&#233; de l&#8217;Etat r&#233;futable pour les violations du droit &#224; la vie et &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; physique et 
morale.  
 
De m&#234;me, l&#8217;article 12 de la Convention contre la torture requiert que les autorit&#233;s comp&#233;tentes 
proc&#232;dent imm&#233;diatement &#224; une enqu&#234;te impartiale chaque fois qu'il y a des motifs raisonnables 
de croire qu'un acte de torture a &#233;t&#233; commis sur tout territoire sous sa juridiction, l&#8217;article 7 
requiert les Etats partie de soumettre les auteurs pr&#233;sum&#233;s d&#8217;actes de torture &#224; ses autorit&#233;s 
comp&#233;tentes pour l'exercice de l'action p&#233;nale. La Commission des droits de l&#8217;homme a soulign&#233; 
dans sa r&#233;solution 2005/39 (paragraphe 3) que &#171; toutes les all&#233;gations faisant &#233;tat d&#8217;actes de 
torture ou d&#8217;autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants doivent &#234;tre examin&#233;es 
sans d&#233;lai et en toute impartialit&#233; par l&#8217;autorit&#233; nationale comp&#233;tente, que ceux qui encouragent, 
ordonnent, tol&#232;rent ou commettent de tels actes doivent en &#234;tre tenus pour responsables et 
s&#233;v&#232;rement punis, y compris les responsables du lieu de d&#233;tention o&#249; il est &#233;tabli que l&#8217;acte 
interdit a &#233;t&#233; commis, et note &#224; cet &#233;gard que les Principes relatifs aux moyens d&#8217;enqu&#234;ter 
efficacement sur la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants et 
d&#8217;&#233;tablir la r&#233;alit&#233; de ces faits (Principes d&#8217;Istanbul) constituent un moyen utile de combattre la 
torture &#187;.  
 
Comme indiqu&#233; par les &#171; Principes relatifs &#224; la pr&#233;vention efficace des ex&#233;cutions 
extrajudiciaires, arbitraires et sommaires et moyens d'enqu&#234;ter efficacement sur ces ex&#233;cutions &#187; 
r&#233;solution 1989/65 du 24 Mai 1989, le droit international exige des Gouvernements qu&#8217;une 
enqu&#234;te approfondie et impartiale sera promptement ouverte dans tous les cas o&#249; l'on 
soup&#231;onnera des ex&#233;cutions extrajudiciaires, arbitraires et sommaires &#187; (Principe 9). Comme 
indiqu&#233; par la Commission des droits de l&#8217;Homme dans sa r&#233;solution 2005/34 (paragraphe 4), </p>

<b>Amadou Ismaela Balo</b>, M. <b>Hamza Hamadou</b> et  M. <b>Gilbert Bring Moumini</b>, ont &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;s &#224;

Les cinq jeunes hommes auraient &#233;t&#233; d&#233;tenus pendant trois jours dans les locaux du BIR &#224; Salak. 
Durant leur d&#233;tention Ils auraient &#233;t&#233; battus, menac&#233;s de mort, attach&#233;s par des cordes, d&#233;nud&#233;s

<b>Observaciones del Relator Especial 
</b> 
El Relator Especial lamenta que el Gobierno de Chile no haya cooperado con el mandato 
otorgado al Relator Especial por la Asamblea General y la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos.<b> 
</b> 
<b>Carta de alegaci&#243;n mandada el 7 de noviembre de 2006 </b>con el  Relator Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas y Relator 
Especial sobre la cuesti&#243;n de la tortura<b> 
 
</b>Quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente de Su Gobierno la informaci&#243;n que hemos recibido en 
relaci&#243;n con la muerte del Sr. <b>Juan Juan Domingo Collihu&#237;n Catril</b>, Lonko (autoridad 
tradicional mapuche), de 71 a&#241;os de edad, y as&#237; como las graves heridas causadas a dos de sus 
hijos, los Sres. Juan <b>Lorenzo Collihu&#237;n &#209;anculef</b> y <b>Jos&#233; Domingo Collihu&#237;n &#209;anculef</b>, durante 
al allanamiento policial que tuvo lugar en su domicilio familiar ubicado en la Comunidad de 
Bollico Grande, Comuna de Nueva Imperial, en la IX Regi&#243;n.  
</p>
<p> 
Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas,  
 
El 28 de agosto de 2006, alrededor de la una de la madrugada, un contingente policial 
supuestamente integrado por unos catorce carabineros, incluyendo personas uniformadas 
y de civil, habr&#237;an penetrado en el domicilio del Lonko Juan Domingo Collihu&#237;n Catril, 
alegando que miembros de su familia eran responsables de un delito de abigeato 
cometido en Iquique. Seg&#250;n estas informaciones, los carabineros, sin exhibir orden de 
allanamiento y detenci&#243;n, habr&#237;an procedido a disparar indiscriminadamente al interior de 
la vivienda. Las informaciones alegan que uno de los carabineros, el sargento Sr. Luis 
Marim&#225;n L&#233;vio, habr&#237;a disparado directamente contra el Lonko Juan Domingo Collihu&#237;n 
Catril, as&#237; como contra los Sres. Juan Lorenzo y Jos&#233; Domingo Collihu&#237;n &#209;anculef, 
quienes habr&#237;an salido en defensa de su padre. La muerte del Lonko se habr&#237;a producido 
consecuencia de un impacto de bala en el t&#243;rax, mientras sus hijos habr&#237;an recibido 
impactos de bala en las caderas.  
   
Las informaciones que hemos recibido alegan tambi&#233;n que, tras los hechos, los Sres. Juan 
Lorenzo y Jos&#233; Domingo Collihu&#237;n &#209;anculef se habr&#237;an dirigido a la Comisar&#237;a de Nueva 
Imperial para denunciar la agresi&#243;n y demandar asistencia. Se alega que los carabineros 
se habr&#237;an negado a prestar dicha asistencia, y que los hermanos Collihu&#237;n &#209;anculef 
habr&#237;an tenido que desplazarse por sus propios medios al hospital de Temuco. Durante su 
estad&#237;a en dicho hospital, el Sr. Juan Lorenzo Collihu&#237;n &#209;anculef habr&#237;a sido detenido 
bajo la acusaci&#243;n de abigeato.  
</p>
<p> 
Sin implicar de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los incidentes descritos, deseamos llamar la 
atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la 
Declaraci&#243;n Universal de Derechos Humanos  y el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y 
Pol&#237;ticos. Los art&#237;culos 3 y 6 de estos instrumentos garantizan a todo individuo el derecho a la 
vida y a la seguridad de su persona y disponen que este derecho sea protegido por la ley y que 
nadie sea arbitrariamente privado de su vida. 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 58 
 
Nos gustar&#237;a tambi&#233;n llamar la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre los principios 4 y 5 de los 
Principios B&#225;sicos sobre el Empleo de la Fuerza y de Armas de Fuego por los Funcionarios 
Encargados de Hacer Cumplir la Ley. Seg&#250;n el principio 4 &#8220;Los funcionarios encargados de 
hacer cumplir la ley, en el desempe&#241;o de sus funciones, utilizar&#225;n en la medida de lo posible 
medios no violentos antes de recurrir al empleo de la fuerza y de armas de fuego&#8221;. En esta misma 
perspectiva, el principio 5 recuerda que &#8220;Cuando el empleo de las armas de fuego sea inevitable, 
los funcionarios encargados de hacer cumplir la ley,  a) Ejercer&#225;n moderaci&#243;n y actuar&#225;n en 
proporci&#243;n a la gravedad del delito y al objetivo leg&#237;timo que se persiga; b) Reducir&#225;n al m&#237;nimo

de las personas heridas o afectadas&#8221;. (Adoptados por el Octavo Congreso de las Naciones Unidas 
sobre Prevenci&#243;n del Delito y Tratamiento del Delincuente, celebrado en La Habana (Cuba) del 
27 de agosto al 7 de septiembre de 1990).  
</p>
<p>  
Igualmente, quisi&#233;ramos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre la gravedad de 
los hechos alegados, as&#237; como por el contexto de conflictividad social en el que se registran.  
</p>
<p> 
En el curso de su visita oficial a Chile en 2003, el Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los 
derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas recibi&#243; informaci&#243;n sobre &quot;la 
alta presencia de fuerza p&#250;blica, permanente, en las comunidades, en algunas de las cuales se 
llevan a cabo diligencias de averiguaci&#243;n, no exentas de violencia f&#237;sica y verbal, con el 
consiguiente temor de la poblaci&#243;n&quot; (E/CN.4/2004/80/Add.4, para. 31). Durante los &#250;ltimos 
a&#241;os, he continuado recibiendo alegaciones provenientes de fuentes fidedignas donde se alegan 
distintos actos de violencia cometidas contra miembros de comunidades mapuche en el sur del 
pa&#237;s por parte de las fuerzas de orden p&#250;blico en el curso de actuaciones de vigilancia o 
averiguaci&#243;n. Algunas alegaciones espec&#237;ficas han sido puestas en conocimiento del Gobierno de 
Su Excelencia por parte de distintos mecanismos especiales de la Comisi&#243;n y del Consejo de 
Derechos Humanos de Naciones Unidas.  
</p>
<p> 
En el caso espec&#237;fico de la Comunidad de Bollico Grande, en la Comuna de Nueva Imperial, las 
informaciones que han podido ser recavadas se&#241;alan la existencia de un par&#225;metro continuado de 
actuaciones de la fuerza p&#250;blica en contra de miembros de la Comunidad, incluyendo previos 
allanamientos del domicilio del Lonko Juan Domingo Collihu&#237;n Catril, as&#237; como el arresto de 
&#233;ste y de otros miembros de su familia. En varios de las actuaciones de las fuerzas p&#250;blicas se 
alegaron tratos degradantes y uso excesivo de la violencia.  
</p>
<p> 
En este contexto, exhortamos respetuosamente a las autoridades de su Gobierno a que 
investiguen de forma completa y exhaustiva los hechos que dieron lugar a la muerte del Lonko 
Juan Domingo Collihu&#237;n Catril, y que se castigue al responsable o responsables de dicha muerte. 
Asimismo, solicitamos que se garantice la integridad f&#237;sica y mental del Sr. Juan Lorenzo 
Collihu&#237;n, y que se le asegure un juicio conforme a todos los est&#225;ndares de derechos humanos 
reconocidos por el ordenamiento jur&#237;dico chileno y por los instrumentos internacionales 
ratificados por Chile.  
</p>
<p> 
Asimismo, invitamos al Gobierno de su Excelencia a que considere la situaci&#243;n de conflictividad 
que afecta a las comunidades mapuche y a otros sectores sociales en el sur del pa&#237;s desde una </p>

auspiciado por el Estado chileno en relaci&#243;n con los pueblos ind&#237;genas del pa&#237;s, y desde el 
respeto a las normas internacionales en esta materia. 
 
Quisi&#233;ramos instar a su Gobierno que adopte todas las medidas necesarias  para proteger los 
derechos y las libertades de las personas mencionadas e investigar, procesar e imponer las 
sanciones adecuadas a cualquier persona responsable de las violaciones alegadas. Quisi&#233;ramos 
asimismo instarle a que tome las medidas eficaces para evitar que se repitan tales hechos.

De acuerdo con el Gobierno, desde el a&#241;o 2000, la Sra Calfunao fue involucrada en agresiones 
contra varias personas en el marco de sus actividades de l&#237;der mapuche. En la actualidad Juana 
Calfunao est&#225; alejada del Consejo de Todas las Tierras y no estar&#237;a siendo apoyada en ninguna 
de sus demandas por esta organizaci&#243;n ind&#237;gena. Su vinculaci&#243;n organizacional m&#225;s fuerte, es 
con la comunicada Uni&#243;n Temulemu de la comuna de Traigu&#233;n, la cual es beneficiaria del Fondo 
de Tierras de la CONADI, y parte del Programa de Desarrollo Integral Or&#237;genes. Por lo que se ha 
podido constatar, su presencia ha generado divisi&#243;n y problemas organizacionales en esta 
comunidad especialmente en la distribuci&#243;n de recursos entregados por los programas de

general, que durante la &#250;ltima d&#233;cada la sociedad chilena, el Gobierno y los pueblos ind&#237;genas

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of China and 
welcomes the information that the death sentence of Ishori Kumar Shrestha has been commuted 
and that the death sentence of Ravi Dahal has been suspended.   
 
The Special Rapporteur would request that he be informed should, for whatever reason, the 
sentence of Ravi Dahal not be commuted upon the expiration of the two year period. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 8 July 2004 </b>reproduced from E/CN.4/2005/7 at para. 82 
 
Two Nepalese citizens, Ishwori Kumar Shrestha and Rabi Dahal, were sentenced to death in the 
Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), People&#8217;s Republic of China, on 30 May 2004, on drug-related 
charges and could face execution at any time. The two men were appointed a lawyer, but it is not 
clear whether a Nepali-Chinese interpreter was provided, or whether the two were able to fully 
understand the process of their charge and trial. It was reported that their families had not heard 
from them for four months. They were not officially informed of their sentence, but read about it 
in a Kathmandu newspaper.

<b> 
</b>I. Basic circumstances: 
<b> 
</b>Ravi Dahal, aged 38, Nepalese businessman and Ishori Kimar Shrestha, aged 28, nepali 
businessman, were taken into custody on 8 July 2003. 
 
In May 2003, Ravi Dahal, acting on the invitation of persons outside the country, entered 
Khasa (Zhangmu Kou'an), in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China from Nepal and, on 
many occasions, contacted the receivers of contraband goods to make smuggling 
arrangements. He requested Ishori Kumar Shrestha to provide samples of contraband 
merchandise for the purpose of examination. On 28 May, the contact person outside the 
country smuggled a large quantity of heroin into Khasa, stashed it away in a warehouse which 
had been rented beforehand by Ishori Kumar Shrestha, and thereupon Ravi Dahal contacted 
other persons to take possession of th&#233; merchandise. After this, officiels of the local anti-
smuggling unit seized 75 bags of heroin in the rented warehouse, totalling 29,850 grams, and 
arrested Ishori Kumar Shrestha and with his assistance also arrested Ravi Dahal. 
 
On 30 May 2004, the Lhasa city intermediate people's court in the Tibetan Autonomous 
Region, following public proceedings, passed judgement at frrst instance and found both 
defendants guilty of the crime of smuggling narcotics. The court sentenced Ravi Dahal to death 
and Ishori Kumar Shrestha to death with a two-year suspension of the sentence and to the 
additional penalty of the forfeiture of all their property. Following the judgement, the two 
defendants refused to accept the verdict and lodged an appeal with the people's high court of 
the Tibetan Autonomous Region. 
 
The finding of the Tibetan high court was that the conduct of the two defendants had indeed 
constituted the offence of smuggling narcotics, in that they had smuggled 29,850 grams of 
heroin, which represented an extremely large quantity, and that the penalty handed down was 
consistent with the law. Taking into consideration that the d&#233;fendants had only been 
responsible for arranging contacts between those providing and those receiving the narcotics 
and had not themselves carried the contraband narcotics across the State frontier, having 
responsibility for only one link in the whole criminal process, and furthermore that Ravi Dahal 
had rendered significant service to the authorities, for that reason, on 21 December 2004, the 
Tibetan high court made final judgement at second instance that the sentence of death handed 
down on Ravi Dahal for the offence of smuggling narcotics should be suspended for two years 
and that the death sentence handed down on Ishori Kumar Shrestha should be commuted to life 
imprisonment and that both defendants should in addition forfeit all their property. The 
sentence has already entered into effect. 
 
During the legal proceedings, the legal counsel invited to represent the two defendants 
conducted their defence in compliance with the law, the two defendants also gave their own 
individual and separate explanations in their defence, and the court engaged th&#233; services of a 
Nepalese interpreter. The Tibetan high court promptly notified the Nepalese Consulate General 
in Lhasa of the circumstances relating to the case and officials from the consulate were able to 
visit the two defendants. Once the two offenders had been sent to prison to serve their 
sentence, the Nepalese consulate in Lhasa was promptly notified of the prison.

Throughout the proceedings described above, the Chinese judicial authorities acted in strict 
compliance with the Chinese Criminal Code, the Chinese Code of Criminal Procedure and 
other laws and regulations; the rights of the two defendants were fully upheld; and there is no 
question of anyone being put to death. 
 
<b>China: Killing of Demonstrators in Dongzhou, Guangdong 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Deaths due to use of excessive force by law enforcement officials 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> 3-20 persons (demonstrators) 
<b> 
Character of reply: </b>No response (recent communication) 
<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving a response concerning these allegations. 
<b> 
Letter of allegation sent on 13 December 2005 
</b></p>
<p> 
I would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information I have received concerning the 
recent shooting by police at a crowd in the Southern province of Guangdong. According to the 
information received, on 6 December 2005, thousands of villagers had gathered in the village of 
Donghzou to demand the release of three village representatives who had been arrested earlier 
that day in relation with a dispute over the use of a large power plant which appeared to have 
coal-fired and wind-driven turbines. The dispute had reportedly been running for five months 
without any incident until this point. Some residents had complained about the amount of money 
they received for ceding their land to the Government for the plant, while others said a 
reclamation project connected with the wind turbines would hurt fishing the area.  
</p>
<p> 
Reports indicate that hundreds of officers from the People&#8217;s Armed Police, a unit of the People&#8217;s 
Liberation Army, arrived at the village and started shooting at the crowd. Varying estimates of 
the death toll have been received, some indicating that as many as 20 people had been killed. 
Some sources still maintain that a number of people remain missing or unaccounted for, alleging 
that the authorities arrested people for participating in the protest. However the official New 
China News Agency mentioned that three people had been killed and eight others injured. Local 
authorities laid blame for the violence exclusively on villagers. They claim that local residents, 
led by three men, first attacked the power plant at the center of the dispute and then turned on to 
the police, using weapons including spears, knives and dynamite, compelling security forces to 
put down the insurrection forcibly.  
</p>
<p> 
In this respect, and without pre-judging the accuracy of the various conflicting accounts 
received, I would note the relevance in such situations of the United Nations Basic principles on 
the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. These Principles note, inter alia, 
that law enforcement officials should &#8220;as far as possible apply non-violent means before 
resorting to the use of force and firearms&#8221; and that &#8220;in any event, intentional lethal use of </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 64 
 
firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life&#8221;. I would also like 
to draw your Excellency&#8217;s attention to the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, 
adopted by the General Assembly resolution 34/169 (1979) which more succinctly stresses the 
limited role for lethal force in ale enforcement operations.  
</p>
<p> 
While I note the recent arrest by civilian local authorities of the commander of the People&#8217;s 
Armed Police reportedly responsible for ordering the shooting, I would like to appeal to your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure that all deaths that occurred in connection with the operation 
of 6 December 2005 are promptly, independently and thoroughly investigated in accordance with 
the United Nations Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, 
Arbitrary and Summary Executions. 
</p>
<p> 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all 
cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on these cases to the Commission, I 
would by grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 
1. What, in your view, were the facts of the situation described? 
 
2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the killings of villagers in 
Dongzhou. 
 
3. Assuming that those responsible for the shootings have been or will be identified, please 
provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken, and of any other penal, 
disciplinary or administrative sanctions imposed in this connection. 
 
4. Please indicate whether compensation has been provided to the families of the victims. 
 
Finally, I would like to appeal to the Government of Your Excellency to make sure that there is 
full public accountability for the actions of the State and of its security forces by ensuring that 
the result of your official investigation be made public

The Special Rapporteur appreciates the detailed response provided by the Government of China 
with respect to the cases of Huang Zhiqiang, Fang Chunping, Cheng Fagen, and Cheng Lihe.  </p>

The SR also appreciates the efforts made by the Government to investigate allegations that the 
defendants&#8217; confessions were extracted by torture. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 10 October 2005 </b>with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
reproduced from E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.1, pp. 54-55 
 
Urgent appeal sent in relation to four men &#8211; Huang Zhiqiang, Fang Chunping, Cheng Fagen, and 
Cheng Lihe &#8211; who we understand are currently held in Leping City Police Detention Centre in 
the Jiangxi province. We have been informed that they are at imminent risk of execution and the 
basis for our intervention concerns allegations that they were tortured while in pre-trial detention 
and that their convictions are therefore unsound. 
 
According to the information received, they were convicted of murder, rape, robbery and 
extortion in connection with their joint involvement in three separate crimes committed between 
September 1999 and May 2000. The Jingdezhen Intermediate People&#8217;s Court in Jiangxi province 
first sentenced them to death, a decision which they appealed to the Jiangxi High People&#8217;s Court. 
On 17 January 2004 it ruled that the case should be sent back to the Intermediate Court for re-
trial, since the detail of their testimony had changed several times and the evidence was 
insufficient to convict them. It has been brought to our attention that in their defence statements 
the four men had also highlighted several contradictions in their testimonies and alleged that they 
had confessed to the crimes under torture at the hands of the police. 
 
However, the Intermediate Court once again sentenced the men to death on 18 November 2004, 
reportedly without considering the torture allegations. The four men remain under sentence of 
death, and it is unclear why their executions have not yet been carried out. It is possible that the 
Jiangxi High People&#8217;s Court is continuing to refuse to approve the verdict. 
 
If these allegations are correct there would be ground for serious concerns. While we 
acknowledge the serious nature of crimes involved we would recall that &#8220;in capital punishment 
cases, the obligations of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set 
out in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights admits of no 
exception&#8221;. (Little v. Jamaica, communication no. 283/1988, Views of Human rights Committee 
of 19 November 1991, para. 10). This standard embraces the right not to be found guilty on the 
basis of a forced confession. We would also recall Commission on Human Rights resolution 
2005/39 which urges States to ensure that any statement which is established to have been made 
as a result of torture shall not be invoked in any proceedings. This principle is an essential aspect 
of the right to physical and mental integrity. 
 
We would further like to draw your Excellency's attention to the Principles on the effective 
investigation and documentation of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment (UN General Assembly resolution 55/89 of 4 December 2000, Doc. A/55/89, 
Annex), also known as the Istanbul Protocol, which states that &quot;alleged victims of torture, 
witnesses, those conducting the investigation and their families shall be protected from violence, 
threats of violence or any form of intimidation that may arise pursuant to the investigation.&quot; 
(Para. 3 (b)). We would urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that the rights under international law of Huang Zhiqiang, Fang Chunping, Cheng </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 66 
 
Fagen, and Cheng Lihe are respected. Under the circumstances this would include an official 
investigation of the allegations before any further action is taken. 
 
In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of the abovementioned persons in 
compliance with the applicable standards of international law.

Response of the Government of China dated 12 January 2006 to an UA sent on 10 October 
2005 (see E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.1, p. 55) 
</b> 
Receipt is acknowledged of communication UA G/SO 214 (33-23) G/SO 214 (53-20) CHIN 
21/2005 from the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture of the United Nations Commission on Human 
Rights.  The Chinese Government has carefully examined the matters referred to in the 
communication and wishes to submit the following response. 
 
I. Basic circumstances 
 
<b>Huang Zhiqiang</b>, male, born 4 January 1973, ethnic Han Chinese, from Leping city in Jiangxi 
province, primary education, farmer, resident in Zhongdian village, Jiyang road, 
Leping municipality.  On 19 June 2002 he was arrested and he is currently being held in custody. 
<b>  
Fang Chunping</b>, male, born 21 December 1977, ethnic Han Chinese, from Leping city in 
Jiangxi province, primary education, farmer, resident in Zhongdian village, Jiyang road, 
Leping municipality.  On 19 June 2002 he was arrested and he is currently being held in custody. 
<b>  
Cheng Fagen</b>, male, born 11 August 1968, ethnic Han Chinese, from Leping city in Jiangxi 
province, lower secondary education, farmer, resident in Zhongdian village, Jiyang road, Leping 
municipality.  On 19 June 2002 he was arrested and he is currently being held in custody. 
<b>  
Cheng Lihe</b>, male, born 18 March 1977, ethnic Han Chinese, from Leping city in 
Jiangxi province, primary education, farmer, resident in Zhongdian village, Jiyang road, 
Leping municipality.  On 19 June 2002 he was arrested and he is currently being held in custody. 
 
In the early morning of 8 September 1999, Huang Zhinqiang and Fang Chunping made their 
way, bearing knives, together with one Cheng Wencai (whose case is being handled separately), 
armed with a claw hammer, to Denggao hill in Donghu park, in Leping city, where they lay in 
wait for an opportunity to rob passers-by.  At about 1 a.m. on 9 September, the three men caught 
sight of a couple, a man by the surname Zou and a woman by the surname Xiong, who had a 
rendezvous at the kiosk on the badminton court on the left side of Leping television mast on 
Denggao hill.  The three men thereupon surrounded the couple, brandishing their weapons, and 
set upon Zou, who was taken entirely unawares.  They savagely stabbed and kicked him, 
fracturing his skull and causing him cranial haemorrhage and fatal cranial contusions.  The three 
men then seized hold of Xiong and, after beating her unconscious, gang-raped her.  They also 
pulled off her gold neck-chain. 
  </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 67 
 
In the evening of 23 May 2000, Huang Zhiqiang, Fang Chunping, Cheng Fagen, Cheng Lihe and 
one Wang Shenbing (currently on the run), armed with knives, made their way again to Denggao 
hill in Donghu Park, in Leping, where they lay in wait for victims.  That same evening at about 
11 p.m., on a small road on Wutiandi farm in Zhongdian village, the five men came across a man 
by the surname Jiang, proprietor of the L&#252;bao supermarket, and his wife, who has the surname 
Hao:  they surrounded the couple demanding money.  Jiang refused to comply, whereupon Wang 
Shenbing stabbed him in the head.  When she saw what was happening, Hao fled and Wang 
Shenbing chased after her.  The four other men - Huang Zhiqiang, Fang Chunping, Cheng Fagen 
and Cheng Lihe - threw themselves at Jiang, slashing away at him with their weapons and killing 
him on the spot.  Cheng Fagen removed 5,000 yuan which they found on Jiang&#8217;s person and a 
mobile phone, then they detached a length of rope from Jiang&#8217;s motorbike, parked nearby, and 
with the others took his body and tied it to the back seat of the motorbike in order to get rid of 
the body and to hide their traces.  Because the resulting load made the motorbike unstable, it 
caused it to topple over into a field on the side of the road, trapping the body beneath the bike, 
whereupon the four men decided to abandon their plan to move the body.  Shortly afterwards, 
the four men rejoined Wang Shenbing and together they chased and caught Hao, whereupon the 
five men repeatedly raped her.  In order to silence her, Cheng Fagen fetched the length of rope 
and tied it round her neck while the other men held down her arms and legs:  in this way they 
then strangled her.  In order to conceal their traces, the five men took Hao&#8217;s body and hauled it 
into the bushes behind the hill, where they buried it.  Later, anxious that the body might be 
discovered, the five men decided, after a discussion, to cut it into pieces so that it would be easier 
to conceal, and they then went their separate ways to fetch the tools to cut it up with.  At midday 
on that same day, the five men, as previously arranged, came to the spot where the body was 
buried and, after drawing lots to decide in what order to proceed, came up one after the other 
with their knives to cut off pieces of the body.  They then took the dismembered body parts, 
stuffed them into plastic bags, carried them off one by one and scattered them in all directions.  
The five men then took the 5,000 yuan, the mobile phone which they had stolen and a telephone 
credit card with a face value of 30 yuan which they had removed from Hao and divided all this 
loot up among themselves.  On 25 June and in the evening of 28 June of that same year, Huang 
Zhiqiang, Fang Chunping and Chen Fagen used this stolen telephone card to call the L&#252;bao 
supermarket from a public telephone, demanding a ransom of 100,000 yuan, after which the 
three men made no further use of it, for fear of being discovered. 
 
In September 2003, the Jingdezhen intermediate level people&#8217;s court in Jiangxi province, hearing 
the trial at first instance, sentenced Huang Zhiqiang, Fang Chunping, Cheng Fagen and Cheng 
Lihe to death for the offences of murder, robbery with violence, rape and extortion.  The four 
defendants refused to accept the verdict and lodged an appeal.  In January 2004, the Jiangxi 
provincial people&#8217;s high court, after considering the case, ruled that, owing to problems with 
certain details of the case, the investigation had not been sufficiently thorough and further full 
inquiries should be held.  Accordingly, as the facts were not sufficiently clear and the 
investigation was not sufficiently thorough, it ordered that the case be sent back for retrial.  
Following a full investigation by the public security and the procuratorial authorities, the 
Jingdezhen city intermediate level people&#8217;s court reconsidered the case and, 
on 18 November 2004, reached the following new judgement: 
 
For the offence of murder, Huang Zhiqiang was to be put to death and stripped of his political 
rights in perpetuity, and all his personal property to be confiscated; for the offence of robbery </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 68 
 
with violence, he was to be put to death and stripped of his political rights in perpetuity and all 
his personal property to be confiscated; for the offence of rape, he was to serve 15 years&#8217; fixed-
term imprisonment and to be stripped of his political rights for five years; for the offence of 
extortion and blackmail, he was exempted from any criminal penalty; it was therefore ordered 
that he be put to death, that he should be stripped of his political rights in perpetuity and that all 
his personal property should be confiscated. 
 
For the offence of murder, Fang Chunping was to be put to death and stripped of his political 
rights in perpetuity, and all his personal property to be confiscated; for the offence of robbery 
with violence, he was to be put to death and stripped of his political rights in perpetuity and all 
his personal property to be confiscated; for the offence of rape, he was to serve 15 years&#8217; fixed-
term imprisonment and to be stripped of his political rights for 5 years; for the offence of 
extortion and blackmail, he was exempted from any criminal penalty; it was therefore ordered 
that he be put to death, that he should be stripped of his political rights in perpetuity and that all 
his personal property should be confiscated. 
 
For the offence of murder, Cheng Fagen was to be put to death and stripped of his political rights 
in perpetuity, and all his personal property to be confiscated; for the offence of robbery with 
violence, he was to be put to death and stripped of his political rights in perpetuity and all his 
personal property to be confiscated; for the offence of rape, he was to serve 15 years&#8217; fixed-term 
imprisonment and to be stripped of his political rights for five years; for the offence of extortion 
and blackmail, he was exempted from any criminal penalty; it was therefore ordered that he be 
put to death, that he should be stripped of his political rights in perpetuity and that all his 
personal property should be confiscated. 
 
For the offence of murder, Cheng Lihe was to be put to death and stripped of his political rights 
in perpetuity, and all his personal property to be confiscated; for the offence of robbery with 
violence, he was to be put to death and stripped of his political rights in perpetuity and all his 
personal property to be confiscated; for the offence of rape, he was to serve 15 years&#8217; fixed-term 
imprisonment and to be stripped of his political rights for 5 years; for the offence of extortion 
and blackmail, he was exempted from any criminal penalty; it was therefore ordered that he be 
put to death, that he should be stripped of his political rights in perpetuity and that all his 
personal property should be confiscated. 
 
After the court had passed judgement, the four defendants refused to accept the verdict and 
lodged an appeal.  The Jiangxi people&#8217;s high court is currently considering the case. 
 
II. Concerning the allegation that the four persons have been subjected to torture 
 
Because the matters involved in this case were particularly serious, the Leping people&#8217;s 
procurator&#8217;s office assigned two procuratorial officials to make a careful study of the case.  
These officials were present on numerous occasions when the suspects made statements and 
identified the scene of the crimes and they found no evidence at all that the investigating officers 
had employed any unlawful methods in their handling of the case, such as extorting confessions 
by torture, etc. 
 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 69 
 
Throughout the course of the investigation, the officials handling the case made sound and video 
recordings of the questioning of the defendants and the identification of the scene of the crime.  
The disc containing the sound and video recordings of the questioning of the four defendants and 
the identification of the scene of the crime was carefully studied and the recordings showed no 
evidence that the police had used beatings, verbal abuse, or threats; the criminal suspects were 
seen to be in a stable and calm state of mind and no harsh treatment was used against them:  they 
showed no signs of fear or having been intimidated and freely confessed their crimes. 
 
The criminal suspects Huang Zhiqiang and Cheng Lihe are able to correspond with their families 
while being held in preventive detention and they have freely admitted that they had committed 
serious offences, and have shown themselves to be extremely repentant.  Over this period, in his 
letters home, Huang has written that he &#8220;committed a serious crime&#8221;; he writes &#8220;I myself 
perpetrated a disgraceful deed, I have the blood and lives of three people on my hands, and now I 
deeply regret what I did.&#8221; 
 
When the procurator&#8217;s office commenced its examination of the appeal stage of the proceedings, 
the suspects Huang Zhiqiang, Fang Chunping, Cheng Fagen and Cheng Lihe complained to the 
procuratorial authorities that the investigative officers had extorted confessions from them by the 
use of torture and showed abrasions on their wrists to prove it.  The oversight division of the 
Leping people&#8217;s security bureau conducted a special investigation, but did not find any evidence 
that the investigating officers had extorted confessions by torture.  An examination of the 
criminal suspects revealed that the abrasions on their wrists had been caused by pressure from 
the clasps of their handcuffs and the resulting bruising (because of the gravity of the offences 
committed by the four offenders, the investigating officers had put handcuffs on them, as 
provided for by law). 
 
The Chinese Government respectfully requests that the content of the above response be 
incorporated in full in a relevant document of the United Nations.

<b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of China that 
the case of Ismail Semed remains under ongoing consideration.  The Special Rapporteur would 
suggest that such consideration should include the thorough investigation of allegations that the 
confessions on which charges were brought were extracted with torture.

<b>Urgent appeal dated 13 April 2006 </b>sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
and Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms while countering terrorism 
 
We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received 
regarding <b>Ismail Semed</b>, an ethnic Uighur from Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) 
in northwest China who is believed to be at imminent risk of execution.  
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, Ismail Semed was convicted by the Urumqi Intermediate 
People&#8217;s Court on 31 October 2005 for &#8220;attempting to split the motherland&#8221; and other charges 
related to possession of firearms and explosives. The possession of firearms charges against 
Ismail Semed appear to have been based on old testimonies taken from other Uighurs, some of 
whom were reportedly executed in 1999. According to reports, those testimonies might have 
been extracted through torture. The charge of &#8220;splittism&#8221; was based on second-hand testimony 
which stated that Ismail Semed was a member of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), 
an organisation qualified as &#8220;terrorist&#8221; by the Chinese authorities, and attended one ETIM 
meeting in 1997 in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. However, his alleged membership of ETIM and 
attendance at that meeting have reportedly been disputed by people who were present at the 
meeting.  
</p>
<p> 
Concern has been expressed that he reportedly confessed to the terrorism-related charges under 
torture and subsequently denied them during his trial.  
</p>
<p> 
We have received information indicating that his appeal might have already been heard in a 
closed session. If rejected, Ismail Semed could have been executed, as sentences are usually 
carried out soon after the appeal hearing is concluded. However, given the political nature of the 
charges brought against Ismail Semed, his death sentence should be reviewed by China&#8217;s 
Supreme People&#8217;s Court. 
</p>
<p> 
While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to respectfully 
remind your Excellency that according to the well-established international standard in capital 
punishment cases, the obligation of states to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial 
admits no exception. (See, Little v. Jamaica, communication no. 283/1988, Views of the Human 
Rights Committee of 19 November 1991, para. 10). Relevant to the case at issue, this guarantee 
includes the right not to be compelled to confess guilt. 
</p>
<p> 
We also recall that Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/39 urges States to ensure that 
any statement, which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked 
in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made. This principle is an essential aspect of the right to physical and mental integrity set forth, 
inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Declaration on the Protection of All persons from Being Subjected to 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p> 
We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the 
rights under international law of Ismail Semed are respected. This can only mean suspension of 
the capital punishment until the allegations of torture have been thoroughly investigated and all </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 71 
 
doubts in this respect dispelled. Moreover, international law requires that the accountability of 
any person guilty of subjecting Ismail Semed to torture is ensured. 
</p>
<p> 
In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government. 
</p>
<p> 
1. Are the facts reproduced in the above summary of the case accurate? 
 
2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the allegations that Ismail 
Semed was subjected to torture while in pre-trial detention. If no enquiries have taken place or if 
they have been inconclusive, please explain why.  
 
3. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken with 
regard to the alleged torture of Ismail Semed. Have penal, disciplinary or administrative 
sanctions been imposed on the perpetrators?  
 
4. Please indicate on the basis of what criteria organizations are qualified as terrorist 
organizations and whether they can appeal against such qualification. Please provide the relevant

Response of the Government of China dated 12 July 2006 
</b> 
Receipt is acknowledged of communication UA G/SO 214 (33-23) G/SO 214 (53-20) CHN 
12/2006 from the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
while countering terrorism and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture of the United 
Nations Commission on Human Rights.  The Chinese Government has carefully examined the 
matters referred to in the communication and wishes to submit the following response. 
<b> 
Ismail Semed</b>, male, ethnic Uighur, born 20 May 1969, without fixed profession. 
 
On 13 August 2004, the Urumchi city procuratorial authorities instituted criminal proceedings 
against Ismail Semed with the Urumchi city intermediate level people&#8217;s court for the offences of 
separatism, unlawful manufacture of ammunition and the causing of explosions.  The precise 
charges as set out in the bill of indictment are as follows. 
 
In January 1997, Ismail Semed, together with Hasan Mahsum (later shot dead in Pakistan) and 
Abdukadir Amat (now on the run), slipped out of the country through the city of Xiamen and 
made their way to Saudi Arabia to meet Kurban Aji and other persons, to propagate the notion of 
an independent Xinjiang, to carry out separatist activities and to drum up support.  Soon after, 
Semed and the two other men travelled to Rawalpindi in Pakistan, to meet Uighur students and 
other young Uighurs engaged in business in that city, preaching to them and urging them to form 
an organization and to go to Afghanistan to receive training, for the purpose of waging a holy 
war.  In March of that same year, Semed and the other men convened a preparatory meeting of 
the East Turkestan Islamic Movement and, following a division of tasks, Ismail Semed was 
appointed in charge of military operations.  Thereafter, Ismail Semed and the other men </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 72 
 
continued to develop and expand the organization, establishing military bases, recruiting 
members, conducting fund-raising and other activities and forging links with Afghan Taliban 
bases and bases run by Bin Laden, striking an agreement with them on the provision of free 
training for their jihadists.  From May 1997 to January 1998 Semed and his accomplices 
organized the transport of some 100 Uighur jihadists from Pakistan and the Middle East to the 
above-mentioned military camps for training.  After completing their training, Semed and the 
others appointed Usman Imat in charge and sent him to take 13 men to Xinjiang to set up 
workshops to manufacture explosives, to conduct training and to develop jihadist columns.  
After arriving in Xinjiang, Usman and the others purchased 1,053 boxes of erbium nitrate, for 
use in preparing chemicals and other reagents for the manufacture of explosives, and set up 
explosive manufacturing workshops in Turfan, Hotan and other cities.  They trained some 
100 men in the use of chemicals and reagents for the manufacture of explosive devices, 
detonators and blasting fuses and in weapons technology. 
 
On 5 December 1997 Semed attended a conference of the formally constituted East Turkestan 
Islamic Movement, held in Rawalpindi in Pakistan, and was appointed military commander.  The 
conference resolved that the goal of the organization would be to liberate East Turkestan through 
a holy war and to set in place an Islamic State, and mapped out a strategic plan for the period 
ahead. 
 
In mid-December 1998, Semed and others organized a meeting in Rawalpindi at which they 
decided to break away from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement and form a separate grouping.  
They deposed their former leader, Hasan Mahsum, assumed control of their members and funds 
in Afghanistan and started to look for ways of illegally entering Xinjiang, so as to prepare for the 
conduct of military jihadist activities in that region. 
 
On 16 September 2004 the Urumchi intermediate level people&#8217;s court commenced hearings on 
this matter.  Given the complexity of this case, it is still under consideration. 
 
The Chinese Government respectfully requests that the content of the above response be 
incorporated in full in a relevant document of the United Nations.

Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>  
 
The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of China 
regarding the cases of Xu Shuangfu and Li Maoxing.  However, the SR remains concerned that 
they have been sentenced to death despite the apparent absence of an investigation into 
allegations that their confessions were extracted with torture. </p>

<b>Urgent appeal dated 18 July 2006 </b>sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture<b> 
</b> 
We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received 
regarding Mr. <b>Xu Shuangfu</b> (also known as Xu Wenku) and Mr. <b>Li Maoxing</b>, two Chinese 
religious leaders belonging to a group known as &#8220;the Three Grades of Servants&#8221; who were 
sentenced to death on 28 June 2006. They were accused of murdering twenty leaders of a 
religious group known as the Eastern Lightning group. Xu was also accused of defrauding his 
congregation of over thirty-two million Yuan. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> 
Xu Shuangfu, was kidnapped in April 2004 by gun-wielding men in a police car while 
visiting congregation members in neighboring Haerbin, Heilongjian Province. Reports 
indicate that he was held incommunicado for some time before his family was informed 
of his detention. 
</p>
<p> 
Concern has been expressed that Xu Shuangfu and Li Maoxing confessed to their murder 
charges under torture and subsequently denied their guilt during their trial which was held at the 
Shuangyashan Intermediate Court, from 28 February to 3 March 2006.  
 
While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to respectfully 
remind your Excellency that according to the well-established international standard in capital 
punishment cases, the obligation of states to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial 
admits no exception. (See, Little v. Jamaica, communication no. 283/1988, Views of the Human 
Rights Committee of 19 November 1991, para. 10). Relevant to the case at issue, this guarantee 
includes the right not to be compelled to confess guilt. 
 
We also recall that Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/39 urges States to ensure that 
any statement, which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked 
in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made. This principle is an essential aspect of the right to physical and mental integrity set forth, 
inter alia, in article 15 of the Convention against Torture provides that, &#8220;Each State Party shall 
ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not 
be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as 
evidence that the statement was made.&#8221;  
 
In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of defendants in compliance with the 
obligations under international law of your Excellency&#8217;s Government, as outlined above. This 
can only mean suspension of the capital punishment until the allegations of torture have been 
thoroughly investigated and all doubts in this respect dispelled. Moreover, international law 
requires that the accountability of any person guilty of subjecting someone to torture is ensured. 
 
It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all 
cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the Commission, 
we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when 
relevant to the case under consideration: </p>

<b>Response of the Government of China dated 21 August 2006 
 
</b>Receipt is hereby acknowledged of the letter addressed jointly by the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture (UA G/SO 214 (33-23) G/SO 214 (53-20) CHN 25/2006).  The Chinese Government has 
carefully investigated the matters referred to in this letter and wishes to make the following 
reply: 
 
From 28 February to 3 March 2006 the Shuangyashan Intermediate People&#8217;s Court in 
Heilongjiang Province conducted an open trial in the criminal cases brought against 
Xu Shuangfu and others for a series of killings.  As a result of the trial it was determined that 
from 2002 to 2004 Xu Shuangfu, Li Maoxing and others, seeking to gain control over other 
people and obtain money by fraudulent means, engaged in such serious criminal activities as 
ordering, abetting and encouraging others to commit or participate directly in murders, wilful 
injury, unlawful detention and fraud.  Some 17 cases of murder or wilful injury resulting in death 
were brought; the methods used were cruel, the particulars of the cases were abominable, and in 
all 21 persons were killed.  The defendants also fraudulently obtained &#8220;contributions&#8221; totalling 
more than 20 million yuan.  The criminal activities of Xu and others extended to various 
provinces and cities including Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Jiangxi, Shandong and Chongqing; 
they caused severe harm to peoples&#8217; lives, security and physical and mental health, and 
destroyed the order of normal productive life, causing great public indignation. 
 
On 4 July 2006 the court handed down its sentence:  Xu Shuangfu and Li Maoxing were found 
guilty of the crimes of murder, wilful and malicious injury, unlawful detention and fraud, for 
which they were sentenced to death, in accordance with the law; they were also deprived of their 
political rights for life and their personal property was confiscated.  
 
In conducting this trial, the Chinese judicial authorities adhered to the facts of the case, took the 
law as their criterion, applied the law properly and proceeded in accordance with the law.

Character of reply:</b> Largely satisfactory response 
 
<b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>  
 
The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of China 
regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of Xiao Guopeng. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation sent on 1 September 2006 
</b>  
I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received regarding 
Mr. <b>Xiao Guopeng</b>, a journalist who is alleged to have been beaten to death by a policeman in 
the province of Guizhou. 
According to the information received, on 18 July 2006, Mr.<b> </b>Xiao Guopeng was attacked by 
police officer Pan Dengfeng outside the offices of the daily newspaper &quot;Anshun&quot;. The police 
officer knocked Mr.Guopeng to the ground and continued to hit him despite the protests of a 
crowd that gathered. Mr. Guopeng was taken to a hospital where he died as a result of cerebral 
hemorrhaging. According to our source, this attack is reportedly linked to a recent article in 
which Mr. Guopeng strongly criticized the local police.  
According to the information received, Mr. Xiao Guopeng is the second journalist beaten to 
death by a police officer in China this year. On February 2006, the deputy editor of the &quot;Taizhou 
Evening News&quot; in Zhejiang province was killed because of an article in which he criticized the 
local police.  
 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I respectfully request that your 
Government ensures that the death of Mr. Xiao Guopeng is promptly, independently and 
thoroughly investigated, in accordance with the United Nations principles on the effective 
prevention and investigation of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions.  
 
In this connection, I would like to recall the principle whereby all States have &#8220;the obligation 
(&#8230;) to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;, as recently reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human 
Rights in Resolution 2005/34 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4). The 
Commission added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice 
those responsible, (&#8230;) to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or 
their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order 
to (&#8230;) prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;.  
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all cases 
brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on these cases to the Human Rights 
Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters 
in relation to each of the cases referred to above: 
 
1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
 
2. Has a complaint been lodged? </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
examinations (autopsy), and judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in 
relation to the death of Mr. Xiao Guopeng. If no inquiries have taken place or if they have been 
inconclusive please explain why. 
 
4. In the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, please provide the full details of 
any prosecutions which have been undertaken; Have penal, disciplinary or administrative 
sanctions been imposed on the alleged perpetrators?

Response of the Government of China dated 28 November 2006</b> regarding an urgent appeal 
sent on 1 September 2006<b> 
</b>  
Receipt is acknowledged of communication UA G/SO 214 (33-24) CHN 36/2006 from the 
United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions.  The 
Chinese Government has carefully examined the matters referred to in the communication and 
wishes to submit the following response. 
 
Victim:  <b>Xiao Guopeng</b>, male, head of the editorial office at the <i>Anshun Daily </i>newspaper. 
 
Suspect:  <b>Pan Dengfeng</b>, male, formerly chief of the Xinchang office of the Anshun city public 
security bureau. 
 
Third party to the proceedings:  <b>Tang Yunxia</b>, female, employee of <i>Anshun Daily</i>, former wife 
of Pan Dengfeng.   
 
In May 2006, Pan Dengfeng discovered that his wife Tang Yunxia was involved in a relationship 
of an irregular nature with Xiao Guopeng.  After that discovery, husband and wife started 
arguing.  On 1 June they decided to divorce.  Following their divorce, because they were 
apprehensive about the way both their parents would react and about the effect it would have on 
the development of their children, they continued living together.   
 
At about 10.20 p.m. on 18 July, Tang received a phone call at home and started preparing to go 
out.  As it was raining heavily at that time, Pan offered to give her a lift, but Tang declined his 
offer and proceeded to leave the house.  After she had gone out, Pan set off in his car to his 
mother-in-law&#8217;s home to visit their daughter.  When he had driven some 100 metres from their 
house along Kuija Street, at the entrance to the Yuanhe food-store, he spotted Tang walking 
together with Xiao and sharing his umbrella, heading in the direction of Shidong Street.  Pan 
immediately got out of his car and challenged Xiao.  He then grabbed hold of him and started 
pulling and shoving him.  During the ensuing scuffle between the two men, Pan punched Xiao 
and knocked him to the ground.  Tang then got between them and tried to stop them from 
fighting but was pushed aside by Pan.  When Xiao tried to get back to his feet he was knocked 
down again by Pan and struck the ridge between the roadway and the pedestrian footpath with 
the back of his head.  Blood started pouring from his head and he lost consciousness.  He was </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 77 
 
taken to Anshun city hospital No. 73 but efforts to save his life were to no avail and he died at 
11.28 p.m. on 19 July.  Following the autopsy, the coroner ruled in his report that Xiao&#8217;s death 
had been caused by a serious head wound.   
 
Following this incident, Pan reported at the Dongguan police station to turn himself in.  That 
same day he was taken into police custody and on 21 July he was formally remanded.  On 31 
July the Xixiu local public security office referred Pan&#8217;s case, of the suspected offence of assault 
and battery, to the Xixiu district people&#8217;s procurator&#8217;s office for review and prosecution.  The 
Xixiu district people&#8217;s procurator&#8217;s office referred the case, which involved the suspected 
offence of murder, to the Anshun procurator&#8217;s office for prosecution and on 13 October criminal 
proceedings were instituted with the Anshun city intermediate level people&#8217;s court.  Proceedings 
in the case are currently under way.   
 
Investigation and verification by the police established that the principal cause in this case was 
the involvement of a third party which led to the break-up of the police officer&#8217;s family, and an 
unexpected and disproportionate reaction by the police officer which resulted in the death of 
another person, and the case has nothing to do with articles written by Xiao Guopeng criticizing 
the local police. 
 
The public security authorities at the level both of Anshun city and Xixiu district gave very 
serious attention to this case and, after the incident itself, immediately set in place the proper 
working procedures and made the correct arrangements.  Even though they were not obliged to 
accept any responsibility in this matter, the Xixiu public security authorities, acting in a purely 
charitable spirit, promptly donated the sum of 60,000 yuan to Xiao Guopeng&#8217;s family to cover 
the costs of hospitalization and funeral expenses.   
 
The Chinese Government respectfully requests that the content of the above response be 
incorporated in full in a relevant document of the United Nations.

China: Killing of Persons Attempting to Cross into Nepal 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Deaths due to the exceussive use of force by law enforcement officials 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> More than 1 but less than 43 persons exercising their freedom of 
movement 
<b> 
Character of reply: </b>UN translation awaited for response of the Government of China dated 20

Letter of allegation dated 18 October 2006 
 
</b>I wish to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s attention information I have received regarding 43 members 
of a group of Tibetans that was fired upon while attempting to cross the Nangpa Pass at the 
border between China and Nepal on 10 October 2006.  
 
According to the information received, a group of 43 Tibetans departed Lhasa by bus on 
approximately 18 September. They began walking at Sakya, intending to cross into Nepal via the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 78 
 
Nangpa Pass near Mt. Everest.  Traveling by night and resting during the day, the group walked 
for 13 nights.  On the 13th night, the group was warned by local nomads that a military patrol 
was in the area and aware of the presence of the group, and was trying to locate them.  Over the 
course of that evening, the group (which included women and small children) became somewhat 
separated from each other, and frequently called out to each other to locate the proper route, 
perhaps causing the patrol to locate them.   
 
The group was proceeding up the final ascent of Nangpa La during the morning of 30 September 
when they were located by 6-7 members of a Chinese patrol.  Soldiers called out to the group, 
ordering them to stop.  The stronger Tibetans began to run towards the top of the pass.  However, 
the slower members of the group were unable to run in the deep snow, including approximately 
10-12 small children and a number of sick or injured Tibetans.   
 
Shortly after calling out to the Tibetans, two members of the patrol began firing at the fleeing 
Tibetans.  At least two Tibetans were hit, including one nun, Kelsang Nortso, 17, from Nagchu, 
Kham, Tibet.  She was struck in her thigh and in the back, falling into the snow.   She called out 
to the others, who attempted to drag her towards the pass.  However, as the gunshots continued, 
the woman's friends were forced to abandon her unconscious body.  Her body was left 
approximately five minutes' or so walk below the pass (which represents the border between 
PRC and Nepal).  The body remained visible on the Nangpa Pass during the day of 30 
September, though it was apparently removed by the following day.  A young man, of unknown 
age, was also hit in the leg; the extent of his injuries is unknown, as is his location. 
 
In this respect, and without pre-judging the accuracy of the information received, I would note 
the relevance in such situations of the United Nations Basic principles on the Use of Force and 
Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. These Principles note, inter alia, that law enforcement 
officials should &#8220;as far as possible apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force 
and firearms&#8221; and that &#8220;in any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when 
strictly unavoidable in order to protect life&#8221;. I would also like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s 
attention to the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, adopted by the General 
Assembly resolution 34/169 (1979) which more succinctly stresses the limited role for lethal 
force in all enforcement operations.  
</p>
<p> 
While I note that on 6 October the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the authorities 
will investigate claims that the military shot Tibetans attempting to flee the country, I would like 
to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure that the deaths that occurred on 10 October 
at the Nagpa pass are promptly, independently and thoroughly investigated in accordance with 
the United Nations Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, 
Arbitrary and Summary Executions. 
</p>
<p> 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly and extended by the 
Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council I would by grateful for your cooperation 
and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. What, in your view, were the facts of the situation described? </p>

2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical

provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken, and of any other penal, 
disciplinary or administrative sanctions imposed in this connection. 
 
4. Please indicate whether compensation has been provided to the families of the victims. 
 
Finally, I would like to appeal to the Government of Your Excellency to make sure that there is 
full public accountability for the actions of the State and of its border military patrols by 
ensuring that the result of your official investigation be made public.

del Escuadr&#243;n M&#243;vil Antidisturbios (ESMAD) de la Polic&#237;a Nacional, los cuales se desplazaban 
en una tanqueta, cargaron contra los estudiantes, agredi&#233;ndoles, golpe&#225;ndoles, disparando

se encontraban en el campus universitario. Seg&#250;n algunas de las denuncias, miembros del 
ESMAD atacaron a los manifestantes lanzando piedras, pedazos de ladrillos y botellas. Se alega 
que durante el altercado, el estudiante Oscar Leonardo Salas &#193;ngel, quien se encontraba entre los 
manifestantes, recibi&#243; un golpe en la cabeza por parte de uno de los integrantes del ESMAD, 
fruto del cual falleci&#243; el d&#237;a 10 de marzo de 2006, aproximadamente a las 2 de la ma&#241;ana, 
v&#237;ctima de un trauma craneoencef&#225;lico que le provoc&#243; muerte cerebral irreversible, en la Cl&#237;nica 
los Fundadores de la ciudad de Bogot&#225;, donde hab&#237;a sido trasladado. Adem&#225;s de la muerte del Sr. 
Salas &#193;ngel, otros estudiantes resultaron heridos, a causa de la reacci&#243;n de los miembros del 
ESMAD. 
 
Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, quisi&#233;ramos hacer un llamamiento 
urgente al gobierno de su Excelencia para que tome  las medidas necesarias para asegurar que el 
derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n sea respetado, de acuerdo con los principios 
enunciados en el art&#237;culo 19 de la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de los Derechos Humanos, y reiterados 
en el art&#237;culo 19 del Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;tico: &quot;Todo individuo tiene 
derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n; este derecho incluye el no ser molestado a causa 
de sus opiniones, el de investigar y recibir informaciones y opiniones, y el de difundirlas, sin 
limitaci&#243;n de fronteras, por cualquier medio de expresi&#243;n&quot;.  
</p>
<p> 
Consideramos apropiado hacer referencia a la resoluci&#243;n 2005/38 de la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos 
Humanos la cual reafirma que el  derecho de reuni&#243;n pac&#237;fica y de asociaci&#243;n, adem&#225;s del 
derecho a participar en la direcci&#243;n de los asuntos p&#250;blicos guardan una estrecha relaci&#243;n con el 
derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y expresi&#243;n, y en este contexto llama a los Estados a que adopten 
todas las medidas necesarias para prevenir y poner fin a las violaciones de estos derechos. 
</p>
<p> 
Quisi&#233;ramos instar a su Gobierno que adopte todas las medidas necesarias  investigar, procesar e 
imponer las sanciones adecuadas a cualquier persona responsable de las violaciones alegadas, de 
conformidad con los principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las 
ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, (resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 del 24 de mayo de 1989 del 
Consejo Econ&#243;mico y Social) seg&#250;n los cuales los Gobiernos deben proceder a una investigaci&#243;n 
exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de todos los casos en que haya sospecha de tales ejecuciones o 
amenazas; publicar en un informe las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; y velar por que sean 
juzgadas las personas que la investigaci&#243;n haya identificado como participantes en tales 
ejecuciones, en cualquier territorio bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n.(principios 9 a 19). Quisi&#233;ramos 
asimismo instarle a que tome las medidas eficaces para evitar que se repitan tales hechos. 
 
Es nuestra responsabilidad de acuerdo con los mandatos que nos ha entregado la Comisi&#243;n de 
Derechos Humanos, y est&#225;n reforzados por las resoluciones pertinentes de la Asamblea General, 
intentar conseguir clarificaci&#243;n sobre los hechos llevados a nuestra atenci&#243;n.  En nuestro deber

<b>Respuesta del Gobierno de Colombia del 20 de junio de 2006 
</b> 
El Gobierno envi&#243; informaci&#243;n relativa a una carta del 24 de marzo de 2006, relativo al supuesto 
uso excesivo de la fuerza por parte de la polic&#237;a en contra de unos manifestantes y que 
ocasionaron la muerte del joven Oscar Leonardo Salas Angel.  
 
La Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n transmiti&#243; la respuesta siguiente: 
 
Pregunta No. 1: Son exactos los hechos referidos? 
 
Respuesta: Los hechos relatados en el comunicado procedente de los Relatores  como ocurridos 
al interior de la Universidad nacional no son exactos. 
 
Sobre las 11:15 horas, los manifestantes se dirigieron a la a la porteria de la carrera 30 donde se 
enfrentaron con la polic&#237;a, lanz&#225;ndole papas explosivas, petos, y otros elementos. La polic&#237;a 
respond&#237;a a dichos ataques desde la parte exterior de la Universidad con chorros de agua y gases 
lacrim&#243;genos dirigidos al puente peatonal interno de la universidad, en donde se encontraba un 
grupo de encapuchados. En este sitio fue visto un joven revolc&#225;ndose en el piso, quien fue 
auxiliado por otros que lo retiraron de all&#237; gritando que hab&#237;a un herido y pidiendo una 
ambulancia. El enfrentamiento con la polic&#237;a continu&#243;, termin&#225;ndose horas despu&#233;s debido a un 
fuerte aguacero. 
 
Pregunta No. 2: Fue presentada alguna queja? 
 
Dentro del contexto de la investigaci&#243;n penal, no existe ninguna queja formulada por familiares 
ni por ninguna entidad frente al desarrollo o a los hechos mismos. 
 
Pregunta No3: Por favor proporcione informaci&#243;n sobre las investigaciones iniciadas en relaci&#243;n 
con el incidente que produjo el fallecimiento del joven Oscar Leonardo Salas Angel. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 84 
 
 
La investigaci&#243;n penal iniciada, est&#225; orientada a establecer las circunstancias que rodearon estos 
hechos y a establecer los responsables de los mismos. 
 
Pregunta No 4: Por favor proporcione informaci&#243;n detallada sobre las diligencias judiciales 
practicadas. Han sido adoptadas sanciones de car&#225;cter penal o disciplinario contra los presuntas 
culpables? 
 
A la fecha no se ha vinculado formalmente a ning&#250;n sujeto a la investigaci&#243;n, ni se ha 
establecido si la lesi&#243;n sufrida por el joven fue producto de una acci&#243;n cometida por alg&#250;n 
miembro de la fuerza p&#250;blica. 
 
Pregunta No. 6: Indique si alguna compensaci&#243;n ha sido otorgada a la familia de la v&#237;ctima. 
 
La Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n desconoce si la familia de la v&#237;ctima ha recibido alguna 
compensaci&#243;n. 
 
En lo referente a la pregunta No. 5 de su cuestionario relativa a la base legal de las acciones 
emprendidas por el Escuadr&#243;n M&#243;vil Antidisturbios (ESMAD) de la polic&#237;a Nacional, me 
permito se&#241;alar que la Direcci&#243;n General de la polic&#237;a nacional, mediante resoluci&#243;n 01363 del 
14 de abril de 1999, por medio de la cual se adiciona la resoluci&#243;n 0044 del 19 de enero del 
mismo a&#241;o &#8211; que desarrolla la estructura org&#225;nica y determina los procesos de la Direcci&#243;n 
Operativa- crea el Escuadr&#243;n M&#243;vil Antidisturbios como desconcentrados de la direcci&#243;n 
operativa, con el encargo de &#8220;apoyar a los departamentos de polic&#237;a y metropolitanas en la 
atenci&#243;n de des&#243;rdenes, cuando su capacidad en talento humano y medio sea rebasada&#8221;. Tal 
disposici&#243;n no s&#243;lo es reafirmada por la resoluci&#243;n 01140 de 2002, sino que eleva a la categor&#237;a 
de especialidad del servicio el control antidisturbios. 
 
En lo que hace al funcionamiento del ESMAD, menci&#243;n aparte merecen la directiva transitoria 
205 del 24 de febrero de 1999 y las directivas permanentes 031 y 019, del 9 de septiembre de 
2003 y 20 de mayo de 2005 respectivamente. Con la primera, se imparte una serie de 
instrucciones para la organizaci&#243;n del escuadr&#243;n m&#243;vil antidisturbios, y se establece que, previo 
a la entrada de sus operaciones, deber&#225; surtirse un proceso de capacitaci&#243;n y entrenamiento en 
temas relacionados con el respeto y protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos. Entre tanto, la 
Directiva 031 imparte una serie de instrucciones a las seccionales metropolitanas y 
departamentales respecto del empleo y uso adecuado de los ESMAD, mientras que la directiva 
019 se refiere a los criterios de identificaci&#243;n que deben ser tomados en cuenta por el personal 
que integra el ESMAD, entre ellos el n&#250;mero de identificaci&#243;n policial y el apellido de quien lo 
porta, aspecto de suma importancia frente a las actividades que debe desempe&#241;ar el organismo. 
Finalmente, y con el objeto de reforzar las actividades institucionales orientadas hacia la 
capacitaci&#243;n en el &#225;rea de derechos humanos al interior del personal que integra el ESMAD, la 
escuela nacional de polic&#237;a dispuso, mediante resoluci&#243;n 128 del 4 de mayo de 2006, un nuevo 
plan de estudios para el curso de control de multitudes de los ESMAD, en cuyo programa la 
formaci&#243;n en derechos humanos ocupa un lugar central y articulador entre la diversas materias. 
 
El Gobierno de Colombia seguir&#225; atento al resultado de las investigaciones que se adelantan, 
respecto de lo cual informar&#225; oportunamente a su excelencia.  </p>

</b> 
Quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente de su Gobierno la informaci&#243;n que hemos recibido en 
relaci&#243;n al asesinato de la ni&#241;a <b>Susana Patricia Galeano Galeano</b>  as&#237; como de la violaci&#243;n 
sexual de <b>otra ni&#241;a de 14 a&#241;os</b> cometidas en la zona rural del municipio de Argelia, oriente del 
Departamento de Antioquia, y presuntamente perpetradas por miembros del ejercito regular. De 
acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida: 
</p>
<p> 
El 15 de febrero de 2006 un grupo de soldados del batall&#243;n &#8220;Juan del Corral&#8221;, adscrito a 
la Cuarta Brigada del ej&#233;rcito regular colombiano con sede en Medell&#237;n, se habr&#237;an 
presentado en la vereda &#8220;El Plan&#8221; del antemencionado municipio e iniciado la 
persecuci&#243;n contra un presunto miembro de la guerrilla. Posteriormente los soldados 
habr&#237;an entrado en la vivienda de la familia Galeano Galeano, ubicada en la misma 
vereda donde se encontraban solas dos menores de edad: una de 14 a&#241;os, cuyo nombre se 
desconoce hasta el momento, y Susana Patricia, de 17 a&#241;os. Se alega que los soldados 
habr&#237;an procedido a disparar contra esta &#250;ltima caus&#225;ndole la muerte. Seg&#250;n las 
denuncias, los soldados habr&#237;an tratado de convencer a la familia que el disparo que 
acab&#243; con la vida de Susana Patricia lo hab&#237;a hecho el antemencionado supuesto 
miembro de la guerrilla y habr&#237;an exhortado a los familiares de la victima a informar a las 
autoridades &#8220;que a la joven la hab&#237;a matado el guerrillero&#8221;. Se informa tambi&#233;n que los 
militares habr&#237;an presionado a diferentes integrantes de la familia, con el fin de evitar que 
estos denunciasen la verdad sobre la forma en que sucedieron los hechos. Se alega 
tambi&#233;n que el cad&#225;ver de Susana Patricia habr&#237;a sido dejado en el potrero de la finca 
hasta el d&#237;a siguiente cuando, otros miembros del ej&#233;rcito lo habr&#237;an trasladado hasta el 
municipio de Sons&#243;n con el fin de efectuar las correspondientes diligencias judiciales, 
pese a que la jurisdicci&#243;n de la vereda &#171; El Plan &#187; corresponde al municipio de Argelia, 
alegando que la fiscal&#237;a los habr&#237;a autorizado a efectuar dicho traslado. Los Relatores 
Especiales expresamos nuestra preocupaci&#243;n por los miembros de la familia de Susana 
Patricia quienes, seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, se encuentran muy atemorizados y temen </p>

<p>sufrir agresiones contra su vida e integridad personal por haber denunciado los citados 
hechos. 
 
El 12 de febrero de 2006 en la vereda de nombre &#8220;Gitana&#8221;, un soldado habr&#237;a llegado a la 
vivienda de una familia campesina, y habr&#237;a exigido que le entregaran a su hija, una ni&#241;a 
de 14 a&#241;os ante lo cual los padres se negaron. El soldado habr&#237;a procedido a llevarse a la 
menor procediendo a violarla. La ni&#241;a regres&#243; posteriormente al domicilio de sus padres. 
Se alega que los padres de la menor tambi&#233;n habr&#237;an sido agredidos f&#237;sicamente cuando 
intentaron evitar que el soldado agrediera a la ni&#241;a.  
</p>
<p> 
Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, quisi&#233;ramos instar al Gobierno de 
su Excelencia a que adopte todas las medidas necesarias para garantizar el derecho de la persona 
mencionada a no ser v&#237;ctima de cualquier forma de violencia por cuestiones de g&#233;nero, 
discriminaci&#243;n y abuso. A este fin, quisi&#233;ramos llevar a la atenci&#243;n de su Excelencia la 
Declaraci&#243;n sobre la eliminaci&#243;n de la violencia contra la mujer, aprobada por la Asamblea 
General de las Naciones Unidas, que establece que la mujer tiene derecho, en condiciones de 
igualdad, al goce y la protecci&#243;n de todos los derechos humanos y libertades fundamentales en 
las esferas pol&#237;tica, econ&#243;mica, social, cultural, civil y de cualquier otra &#237;ndole. Entre estos 
derechos figuran, (a) el derecho a la vida; (b) el derecho a la igualdad; (c) el derecho a la libertad 
y la seguridad de la persona; y (d) el derecho a igual protecci&#243;n ante la ley (art&#237;culo. 3). Adem&#225;s, 
tambi&#233;n estipula que todos los estados deber&#225;n proceder con la debida diligencia a fin de 
prevenir, investigar y, conforme a la legislaci&#243;n nacional, castigar todo acto de violencia contra 
la mujer, ya se trate de actos perpetrados por el Estado o por particulares (art&#237;culo 4 (c)).  
 
En la resoluci&#243;n 2005/41 de la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos se reafirma que los Estados 
est&#225;n obligados a ejercer la diligencia debida para prevenir e investigar los actos de violencia 
contra mujeres y ni&#241;as y castigar a sus autores, as&#237; como dar protecci&#243;n a las v&#237;ctimas, y que no 
hacerlo constituye una violaci&#243;n de sus derechos humanos y libertades fundamentales y 
obstaculiza o anula el disfrute de esos derechos y libertades. 
 
La resoluci&#243;n subraya tambien la importancia y la necesidad imperiosa de contar con esfuerzos 
concertados  encaminados a eliminar la impunidad de los actos de violencia contra las mujeres y 
las ni&#241;as en situaciones de conflicto armado, en particular mediante la persecuci&#243;n penal de los 
delitos sexistas y de violencia sexual, la instauraci&#243;n de medidas de protecci&#243;n y la prestaci&#243;n de 
asesoramiento y otro tipo de asistencia apropiada a las v&#237;ctimas y testigos. 
</p>
<p> 
Quisi&#233;ramos instar a su Gobierno que adopte todas las medidas necesarias  para proteger los 
derechos y las libertades de las personas mencionadas e  investigar, procesar e imponer las 
sanciones adecuadas a cualquier persona responsable de las violaciones alegadas de conformidad 
con los principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones 
extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 del 24 de mayo de 1989 del Consejo 
Econ&#243;mico y Social seg&#250;n el cual los Gobiernos deben proceder a una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, 
inmediata e imparcial de todos los casos en que haya sospecha de tales ejecuciones o amenazas;

las personas que la investigaci&#243;n haya identificado como participantes en tales ejecuciones, en 
cualquier territorio bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n.(principios 9 a 19) . Quisi&#233;ramos asimismo instarle a que 
tome las medidas eficaces para evitar que se repitan tales hechos. </p>

Quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente de su Gobierno la informaci&#243;n que hemos recibido en 
relaci&#243;n con una serie de incidentes ocurridos con motivo de una serie de manifestaciones 
celebradas en los departamentos del Cauca, Nari&#241;o, Neiva y Huila en el marco de la &#8220;Gran 
Cumbre de Organizaciones Sociales en defensa de la vida, del territorio, la dignidad, la 
autonom&#237;a y la soberan&#237;a nacional&#8221;. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida: 
 
</p>
<p>El  14 y 15 de mayo de 2006, m&#225;s de 50 000 personas de distintos sectores de la sociedad 
civil colombiana se habr&#237;an congregado en diversos puntos del pa&#237;s para protestar de 
manera pacifica contra la firma del Tratado de Libre Comercio, la re-elecci&#243;n de &#193;lvaro 
Uribe V&#233;lez y la adopci&#243;n de la  &#8220;Ley de Justicia y Paz&#8221;.  
 
Seg&#250;n se informa, el 15 de mayo de 2006, en la ciudad de Popay&#225;n, capital del 
departamento del Cauca, el Escuadr&#243;n M&#243;vil Antidisturbios (ESMAD) de la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional habr&#237;a intentado disolver por la fuerza la concentraci&#243;n de las m&#225;s de 1000 
personas que se manifestaban frente a las instalaciones del SENA (una escuela t&#233;cnica). 
Como resultado de dicha intervenci&#243;n policial, varias personas habr&#237;an resultado heridas, 
algunas por arma de fuego. Otros manifestantes, que hab&#237;an decidido ocupar el edificio 
del SENA, habr&#237;an sido desalojados por la fuerza lo que habr&#237;a provocado un 
enfrentamiento con las fuerzas del orden que se habr&#237;a prolongado hasta altas horas de la 
madrugada. Seg&#250;n los informes, integrantes del ESMAD habr&#237;an entrado en el barrio de 
la Paz, donde se encontraban algunos manifestantes a los que habr&#237;an atacado con gases 
lacrim&#243;genos. Como  resultado de esta intervenci&#243;n policial, al menos 60 manifestantes y 
residentes del barrio, habr&#237;an resultado heridos, y m&#225;s de 40 personas habr&#237;an sido 
detenidas, entre ellas 5 menores de edad.

Mar&#237;a, en la localidad de Piendamo, departamento del Cauca habr&#237;an ocupado un tramo 
de la autopista Panamericana. El ESMAD, la polic&#237;a de carretera y el Ej&#233;rcito Nacional 
habr&#237;an intervenido con acciones a&#233;reas y por tierra. En el transcurso de esta intervenci&#243;n 
<b>Pedro Mauricio Coscue</b> de etnia ind&#237;gena, habr&#237;a sido asesinado, y m&#225;s de 100 personas, 
en su mayor&#237;a ind&#237;genas, habr&#237;an resultado heridas, entre ellas 7 menores de edad. 
Adem&#225;s, <b>Misael Vizcunda Chocu&#233;</b>, de entre 16 y 17 a&#241;os, habitante de la vereda San

emisora <i>La Libertad</i> del municipio de Totor&#243;. Seg&#250;n los informes, los 4 periodistas 
habr&#237;an sido liberados sin cargos el 22 de mayo de 2006. Se alega tambi&#233;n, que las 
fuerzas del orden p&#250;blico habr&#237;an confiscado los materiales de grabaci&#243;n de diversos 
miembros de la prensa. 
  
El 15 de mayo en Neiva, capital del departamento del Huila, miembros del equipo 
period&#237;stico del programa de televisi&#243;n <i>TV novedades</i> habr&#237;an sido agredidos por varios 
encapuchados, quienes adem&#225;s les habr&#237;an sustra&#237;do el material de grabaci&#243;n. Los hechos 
habr&#237;an ocurrido en las instalaciones de la Universidad Surcolombiana., donde los 
periodistas se encontraban cubriendo la ocupaci&#243;n de las instalaciones de este centro 
educativo por parte de varias comunidades ind&#237;genas. 
 
El 16 de mayo de 2006 miembros del ESMAD habr&#237;an disparado contra los manifestantes 
cuando trataban de detener una movilizaci&#243;n campesina e ind&#237;gena en el lugar conocido 
con el nombre de El Pital, cerca de Mondomo, Departamento del Cauca.  
 
Finalmente, se alega que la fuerza p&#250;blica habr&#237;a agredido a los manifestantes que se 
encontraban bloqueando la carretera Panamericana a la altura del sector conocido como 
&#8220;Remolinos&#8221; en el Departamento de Nari&#241;o, resultando gravemente heridos los Sres. 
Bayardo Rosero, quien habr&#237;a sido herido en el abdomen con arma de fuego y Dagoberto 
Mestra, quien se encontrar&#237;a en estado cr&#237;tico. 
  
</p>
<p>Los Relatores Especiales expresan su preocupaci&#243;n ante la posibilidad de que en los 
antemencionados incidentes, las fuerzas del orden p&#250;blico hayan podido haber incurrido en el 
uso excesivo de la fuerza en el ejercicio de sus funciones.  
</p>
<p> 
Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n del 
Gobierno de Su Excelencia para que considere las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la 
Declaraci&#243;n Universal de Derechos Humanos fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n 
Universal de Derechos Humanos y el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos. Los 
art&#237;culos 3 y 6 de estos instrumentos garantizan a todo individuo el derecho a la vida y a la 
seguridad de su persona y disponen que este derecho sea protegido por la ley y que nadie sea 
arbitrariamente privado de su vida. 
</p>
<p> 
Asimismo, quisi&#233;ramos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las siguientes 
normas y principios que son particularmente significativos con respecto a las denuncias 
mencionadas precedentemente: 
</p>
<p> 
- Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones 
</p>
<p>extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 de 24 de mayo de 1989 del Consejo 
Econ&#243;mico y Social. En particular, los principios 4 y 9 a 19 obligan a los Gobiernos a garantizar 
una protecci&#243;n eficaz, judicial o de otro tipo, a los particulares y grupos que est&#233;n en peligro de 
ejecuci&#243;n extralegal, arbitraria o sumaria, en particular a aquellos que reciban amenazas de 
muerte. Los Gobiernos deben proceder a una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de 
todos los casos en que haya sospecha de tales ejecuciones o amenazas; publicar en un informe 
las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; y velar por que sean juzgadas las personas que la </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 91 
 
investigaci&#243;n haya identificado como participantes en tales ejecuciones, en cualquier territorio 
bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p> 
En este contexto, deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de Su excelencia para que considere 
las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n sobre el derecho y el deber de los 
individuos, los grupos y las instituciones de  promover y proteger los derechos humanos y las 
libertades fundamentales universalmente reconocidas y en particular los art&#237;culos 1 y 2. Estos 
establecen,  respectivamente, que toda persona tiene derecho, individual o colectivamente, a 
promover y procurar la protecci&#243;n y realizaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades 
fundamentales en los planos nacional e internacional y que es la responsabilidad primordial y el 
deber de todos los Estados de proteger, promover y hacer efectivos todos los derechos humanos, 
adoptando las medidas necesarias para crear las condiciones sociales, econ&#243;micas, pol&#237;ticas y de 
otra &#237;ndole, as&#237; como las garant&#237;as jur&#237;dicas requeridas para que toda persona sometida a su 
jurisdicci&#243;n, individual o colectivamente, pueda disfrutar en la pr&#225;ctica todos esos derechos y 
libertades.  
</p>
<p> 
Adem&#225;s, quisi&#233;ramos referirnos a los art&#237;culos siguientes:  
</p>
<p> 
- el art&#237;culo 12 p&#225;rrafos 2 y 3 estipula que el Estado garantizar&#225; la protecci&#243;n, por las 
</p>
<p>autoridades competentes, de toda persona, individual o colectivamente, frente a toda violencia, 
amenaza, represalia, discriminaci&#243;n, negativa de hecho o de derecho, presi&#243;n o cualquier otra 
acci&#243;n arbitraria resultante del ejercicio leg&#237;timo de los derechos mencionados en la presente 
Declaraci&#243;n. A este respecto, toda persona tiene derecho, individual o colectivamente, a una 
protecci&#243;n eficaz de las leyes nacionales al reaccionar u oponerse, por medios pac&#237;ficos, a 
actividades y actos, con inclusi&#243;n de las omisiones, imputables a los Estados que causen 
violaciones de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales, as&#237; como a actos de 
violencia perpetrados por grupos o particulares que afecten el disfrute de los derechos humanos y 
las libertades fundamentales. 
</p>
<p> 
- el art&#237;culo 5 apartado a) estipula que a fin de promover y proteger los derechos humanos 
</p>
<p>y las libertades fundamentales, toda persona tiene derecho, individual o colectivamente, en el 
plano nacional e internacional a reunirse o manifestarse pac&#237;ficamente; 
</p>
<p> 
Nos permitimos tambi&#233;n hacer un llamamiento urgente al gobierno de su Excelencia para que 
tome  las medidas necesarias para asegurar que el derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n 
sea respetado, de acuerdo con los principios enunciados en el art&#237;culo 19 de la Declaraci&#243;n 
Universal de los Derechos Humanos, y reiterados en el art&#237;culo 19 del Pacto Internacional de

medio de expresi&#243;n&quot;.  
</p>
<p> 
Quisi&#233;ramos instar a su Gobierno que adopte todas las medidas necesarias  para proteger los 
derechos y las libertades de las personas mencionadas e investigar, procesar e imponer las 
sanciones adecuadas a cualquier persona responsable de las violaciones alegadas. Quisi&#233;ramos

El 18 de Agosto de 2006, <b>H&#233;ctor Jairo Paz</b>, directivo del mencionado Sindicato 
SINALTRAINAL y trabajador de Nestl&#233; Colombia, recibi&#243; graves amenazas en una 
tarjeta depositada en su domicilio.  
 
El 15 de Agosto de 2006, <b>Martha Cecilia D&#237;az Su&#225;rez</b>, l&#237;der sindical y presidenta de la 
Asociaci&#243;n Santandereana de Servidores P&#250;blicos (ASTDEMP) fue intimidada y 
golpeada por unos individuos desconocidos que le amenazaron con matar a su hija. Seg&#250;n 
la Sra. D&#237;az, no se trata del primer caso de agresi&#243;n ni amenaza sufrida desde que es 
presidenta sindical.  
 
El 17 de Agosto de 2006, <b>Carlos Arturo Montes Bonilla</b>, activista sindical afiliado al 
Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Industria de los Alimentos (SINALTRAINAL) 
fue asesinado cuando regresaba a su domicilio. El Sr. Montes Bonilla hab&#237;a participado 
en las denuncias contra la multinacional Coca-Cola y en las actividades sindicales del 
puerto petrolero ECOPETROL.  
</p>
<p> 
Se teme que las amenazas recibidas por H&#233;ctor Jairo Paz y Martha Cecilia D&#237;az Su&#225;rez, as&#237; como 
el asesinato de Carlos Arturo Montes Bonilla, est&#233;n vinculados a sus actividades como 
defensores de los derechos sociales y econ&#243;micos, y puedan formar parte de de una campa&#241;a de

<b>Carta de alegaci&#243;n del 11 de julio de 2006 
 
</b>Quisiera se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente de su Gobierno la informaci&#243;n que he recibido en relaci&#243;n 
con supuestas violaciones sufridas por el pueblo wiwa de la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta 
cometidas por miembros del ej&#233;rcito nacional. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida: 
</p>
<p> 
Se habr&#237;an producido al menos 6 ejecuciones extrajudiciales entre diciembre de 2005 y junio de 
2006 de ind&#237;genas wiwa. Estas ejecuciones de ind&#237;genas wiwa habr&#237;an sido presentadas por el 
ej&#233;rcito nacional como &#8220;homicidios en combate&#8221;. No obstante, la informaci&#243;n recibida alega la 
existencia de evidencias que demostrar&#237;an que varias de las v&#237;ctimas se encontraban en el 
momento de su muerte bajo custodia del ej&#233;rcito nacional. El 9 de diciembre de 2005, miembros 
del ej&#233;rcito nacional habr&#237;a detenido en su casa al Sr. <b>Laudelino Montano</b> en el resguardo 
ind&#237;gena en el municipio de San Juan del Cesar. Se alega que al d&#237;a siguiente se habr&#237;an o&#237;do 
disparos y encontrado el cad&#225;ver del Sr. Laudelino Montano en un sitio localizado entre las 
comunidades de Ulaka (Ulago) y Abo Guaquina (Sabana de Joaquina). El 3 de enero de 2006 
miembros del ej&#233;rcito habr&#237;an detenido a los Sres. <b>Ricardo Arias Solis</b> y <b>Celso Carrillo Perea</b>, 
en la comunidad de Abu Guaquina (Sabana de Joaquina). Al d&#237;a siguiente se habr&#237;an escuchado 
disparos en un lugar cercano a las comunidades ind&#237;genas de Mamarongo y Guamaka, 
apareciendo los cad&#225;veres de las personas anteriormente mencionadas. Se alega que ese mismo 
d&#237;a, varias radios locales habr&#237;an difundido la noticia de que dos miembros de las FARC-EP 
habr&#237;an sido dados de baja, por lo que se teme se hiciera referencia a la misma persona. Se alega 
que el 9 de enero de 2006, el Sr. <b>Bernardo Montano Armenta</b> habr&#237;a sido asesinado por 
paramilitares en el municipio de San Juan del Cesar Departamento de Guajira). Se alega que el 6 
de abril de 2006, habr&#237;a sido asesinado en el municipio Riohacha el mamo (l&#237;der espiritual 
ind&#237;gena) <b>Juan Rafael Alberto Gil</b> por personas desconocidas. Se alega que el 30 de abril de 
2006, el Sr. <b>Hector Jose Nieves</b> habr&#237;a muerto a manos de la polic&#237;a nacional. Se alega que la 
polic&#237;a nacional habr&#237;a entrado en su casa, habr&#237;a ordenado a todas las personas que all&#237; se 
encontraban a tumbarse y uno de sus miembros habr&#237;a disparado al Sr. Hector Jos&#233; Nieves 
cuando se encontraba tumbado en el suelo.  
 
La informaci&#243;n recibida alega tambi&#233;n la existencia de maltrato y hostigamiento por parte del 
ej&#233;rcito nacional dentro del Resguardo ind&#237;gena Kogui-Malayo-Arhauco. Se alegan, entre otros, 
los siguientes casos. En agosto de 2005 el joven de 17 a&#241;os <b>Eladio Jose Banos Alonso</b> habr&#237;a 
sido golpeado por miembros del Ej&#233;rcito Nacional, obligado a vestirse con el uniforme de las 
FARC. Se alega que se habr&#237;a previsto su asesinato pero que miembros del ej&#233;rcito nacional se 
habr&#237;an opuesto al mismo, motivo por el que habr&#237;a sido liberado. Entre el 17 y 22 de abril de 
2006, el Sr. <b>Wilson Enrique Villazon Villazon</b> habr&#237;a sido detenido y amenazado en un 
campamento militar cuando se dispon&#237;a a denunciar las supuestas torturas que habr&#237;a sufrido en 
2004 por miembros del ej&#233;rcito nacional.  
 
La informaci&#243;n recibida alega asimismo una serie de hechos que supondr&#237;an, en su caso, una 
violaci&#243;n del derecho humanitario internacional. Se alega que en junio de 2005, varios miembros 
del ej&#233;rcito nacional habr&#237;an amenazado a ind&#237;genas wiwa con retirar al ej&#233;rcito y permitir la 
entrada de los paramilitares en caso de que no colaboraran con ellos e informaran sobre los 
movimientos de la guerrilla. Asimismo, se alega que en agosto de 2005, los Sres<b>. </b>Jos&#233; Francisco 
Alonso Zabata, Merilo Montero Maestre, Robinson Pachecho Malo, Jian zabata Torres y </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 97 
 
Hermenegildo Zabata habr&#237;an sido utilizados como escudos humanos por parte del ej&#233;rcito 
nacional durante una persecuci&#243;n de guerrilleros de las FARC-EP, entre otros hechos. 
 
La informaci&#243;n recibida alega la existencia de detenciones arbitrarias de ind&#237;genas wiwa por 
parte del ej&#233;rcito nacional. As&#237;, se alega que habr&#237;an sido detenidos acusados de rebeli&#243;n los 
Sres. <b>Juan de Jes&#250;s Mendoza Arias</b> (3 de agosto de 2005), <b>Jos&#233; Eduardo Marestre Crespo</b> 
(11 de diciembre de 2005), <b>Carmen Cecilia Arias C&#225;ceres</b> (7 de enero de 2006) y <b>Jorge Luis 
Montero Malo</b> (30 de abril de 2006). Se alega que el 18 de marzo de 2006 habr&#237;an sido  
detenidos los Srs. <b>Geovanis Montano Mendoza, Obdulio Dario Montano Armenta, Yamelis 
del Rosario Montano Armenta </b> y<b> Julio Bolivar Montano Loperena</b>, acusados de haber 
participado en un ataque de la guerrilla sobre el ej&#233;rcito nacional del 9 de marzo de 2006 y por 
ser miembros de las FARC. Se alega que tras discutir con las autoridades locales, estas personas 
habr&#237;an pasado a custodia de las autoridades tradicionales wiwa, dentro del refugio ind&#237;gena. 
 
Sin implicar de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, deseo llamar la atenci&#243;n del 
Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n 
Universal de Derechos Humanos  y el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos. Los 
art&#237;culos 3 y 6 de estos instrumentos garantizan a todo individuo el derecho a la vida y a la 
seguridad de su persona y disponen que este derecho sea protegido por la ley y que nadie sea 
arbitrariamente privado de su vida. 
 
Quisiera instar a su Gobierno que adopte todas las medidas necesarias  para proteger los 
derechos y las libertades de las personas mencionadas e investigar, procesar e imponer las 
sanciones adecuadas a cualquier persona responsable de las violaciones alegadas de conformidad 
con los principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones 
extralegales, arbitrarias, o sumarias, resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 del 24 de mayo de 1989 del Consejo 
Econ&#243;mico y Social. Quisiera asimismo instarle a que tome las medidas eficaces para evitar que 
se repitan tales hechos. 
 
Es mi responsabilidad de acuerdo con el mandato que me ha entregado la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos 
Humanos, y esta reforzado por las resoluciones pertinentes de la Asamblea General, intentar 
conseguir clarificaci&#243;n sobre los hechos llevados a mi atenci&#243;n. En mi deber de informar sobre 
esos casos al Consejo de Derechos Humanos, estar&#237;a muy agradecido de tener su cooperaci&#243;n y 
sus observaciones sobre los asuntos siguientes: 
 
1. &#191;Son exactos los hechos a los que se refieren las alegaciones? 
 
2. &#191;Fue presentada alguna queja? 
 
3. Por favor, proporcione informaci&#243;n detallada sobre las investigaciones iniciadas en 
relaci&#243;n con el caso, incluyendo los resultados de los ex&#225;menes m&#233;dicos llevados a cabo. Si &#233;stas 
no tuvieron lugar o no fueron concluidas, le rogamos que explique el porqu&#233;. 
 
4. Por favor, proporcione informaci&#243;n detallada sobre las diligencias judiciales y 
administrativas practicadas. &#191;Han sido adoptadas sanciones de car&#225;cter penal o disciplinario

Quisiera llamar la atenci&#243;n urgente de su Gobierno la informaci&#243;n que he recibido en relaci&#243;n 
con la Ejecuci&#243;n Extrajudicial de tres ind&#237;genas Wayu&#250;s y otras violaciones de derechos

El 21 de enero de 2006, miembros del ej&#233;rcito colombiano habr&#237;an disparado 
indiscriminadamente contra  m&#225;s de 100 ind&#237;genas de la comunidad Way&#250;u, que se encontraban 
celebrando una fiesta en el corregimiento de Ware Ware (Guasimal), ubicado en el municipio de 
Albania, departamento de la Guajira. Como producto de los disparos propinados por el ej&#233;rcito 
habr&#237;an muerto los se&#241;ores <b>Javier Pushaina</b>, de 28 a&#241;os de edad, <b>Luis &#193;ngel Fince Iguana</b>, de 
18 a&#241;os de edad, y el ni&#241;o <b>Gaspar Cambar Ramirez</b>, de 16 a&#241;os de edad. Adicionalmente, 
habr&#237;a sido golpeada la se&#241;ora <b>Irene L&#243;pez</b> (quien se encontraba embarazada en el momento de 
los hechos) y por los impactos de bala, dos personas m&#225;s habr&#237;an resultado heridas.  
 
Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, los efectivos del ej&#233;rcito aparentemente habr&#237;an alterado 
evidencia y dejado municiones de fusil en el lugar de los hechos para alegar la presencia de 
miembros de las FARC-EP y el desarrollo de un enfrentamiento armado y justificar su operativo.  
 
De acuerdo a la informaci&#243;n recibida, en el Juzgado 20 de instrucci&#243;n Penal Militar cursa 
actualmente una investigaci&#243;n preliminar contra los miembros del ej&#233;rcito que participaron en 
este operativo. En este contexto, quisiera expresar mi preocupaci&#243;n por el hecho de que la 
investigaci&#243;n de estos casos haya sido asumida por la jurisdicci&#243;n penal militar, con 
desconocimiento de los principios internacionales sobre la materia y de la propia jurisprudencia 
constitucional colombiana.  
 
En este contexto, deseo llamar la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre las observaciones finales del 
Comit&#233; de Derechos Humanos relativo al quinto informe peri&#243;dico de Colombia 
(CCPR/CO/80/COL) del 26 de mayo de 2004, y en particular sobre su p&#225;rrafo 16 seg&#250;n el cual 
&#8220;al Comit&#233; le preocupa que los tribunales militares sigan investigando delitos cometidos por el 
personal militar que implican tortura, (&#8230;) ejecuciones sumarias y arbitrarias, no obstante su 
anterior ineficacia para resolver esos cr&#237;menes y de la decisi&#243;n de la Corte Constitucional que 
otorg&#243; jurisdicci&#243;n sobre tales cr&#237;menes a los tribunales ordinarios (art&#237;culos 6,7, y 9, en 
conjunto con el art&#237;culo 2). Asimismo, quisiera se&#241;alar al Gobierno de su Excelencia que el 
Comit&#233; recomend&#243; en el mismo p&#225;rrafo que &#8220;El Estado parte deber&#237;a asegurar que los tribunales 
ordinarios investiguen y juzguen dichos cr&#237;menes y que todos los elementos de las fuerzas 
armadas cooperen en dichos procedimientos. Las personas investigadas por tales delitos deber&#225;n 
ser suspendidas del servicio activo durante la investigaci&#243;n y el proceso de estos casos&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 
De acuerdo con el mandato que me ha entregado la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos, mandato 
reforzado por las resoluciones pertinentes de la Asamblea General y del Consejo de Derechos 
Humanos, es  mi responsabilidad intentar conseguir clarificaci&#243;n sobre los hechos llevados a mi 
atenci&#243;n.  En mi deber de informar sobre esos casos al Consejo de Derechos Humanos, estar&#237;a

<p> 
De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida: 
 
El 26 de octubre de 2006, al volver a casa el Sr. Cuesta habr&#237;a encontrado unos folletos 
que conten&#237;an amenazas de muerte en contra suya y del Sr. Cuadrado.  Seg&#250;n los 
informes, dos hombres encapuchados dejaron los folletos en su casa, situada en el 
municipio de Apartad&#243; (Departamento de Antioquia).

</p>
<p>Por otra parte, el 11 de octubre de 2006, en la madrugada, el Sr. Jes&#250;s Marino Mosquera 
habr&#237;a muerto despu&#233;s de recibir varios impactos de bala, cuando se dirig&#237;a a su lugar de 
trabajo en el municipio de Carepa (Departamento de Antioquia). 
 
Seg&#250;n los informes, el Sr. Carlos Arciniegas Ni&#241;o, otro dirigente de SINTRAINAGRO 
en Barrancabermeja, desapareci&#243; a fines del a&#241;o pasado.  Se nos informa que el 2 de 
enero de 2006 se descubri&#243; su cad&#225;ver amarrado, con se&#241;ales de tortura y tres impactos 
de bala, en la v&#237;a que conduce de Barrancabermeja a Puerto Wilches (Santander). 
 
</p>
<p>Se expresa preocupaci&#243;n por las amenazas de muerte en contra de los Sres. Cuesta y Cuadrado, y 
se menciona que dichas amenazas pueden representar un intento de disuadir a los miembros de 
SINTRAINAGRO de continuar con su trabajo.  Adem&#225;s, se teme que los Sres. Jes&#250;s Marino 
Mosquera y Carlos Arciniegas Ni&#241;o hayan sido asesinados debido a su trabajo en defensa de los 
derechos humanos. En general, se teme que los ataques y actos de hostigamiento en contra de los 
integrantes del SINTRAINAGRO est&#233;n relacionados con sus actividades en defensa de los 
derechos humanos, en particular los derechos de los trabajadores agr&#237;colas.   
</p>
<p> 
Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n del 
Gobierno de su Excelencia para que considere las normas fundamentales enunciadas en el 
art&#237;culo 6 del Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos: &#8220;El derecho a la vida es 
inherente a la persona humana. Este derecho estar&#225; protegido por la ley. Nadie podr&#225; ser privado 
de la vida arbitrariamente&#8221;. Deseamos tambi&#233;n llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia 
sobre las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de Derechos Humanos y

garantizan a todo individuo el derecho a la vida y a la seguridad de su persona y disponen que 
este derecho sea protegido por la ley y que nadie sea arbitrariamente privado de su vida. 
</p>
<p> 
Deseamos luego llamar la atenci&#243;n de sur Gobierno sobre la Declaraci&#243;n sobre el derecho y el 
deber de los individuos, los grupos y las instituciones de  promover y proteger los derechos 
humanos y las libertades fundamentales universalmente reconocidos y en particular los art&#237;culos

<b>Carta de alegaci&#243;n del 24 de noviembre de 2006

En este contexto, quisiera llamar la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre la informaci&#243;n que he 
recibido con relaci&#243;n a la muerte del agricultor <b>Leber Castrill&#243;n Sarmiento</b> y las heridas de 
bala causadas a uno de sus hijos, el ni&#241;o <b>Miguel Castrill&#243;n</b>, en hechos ocurridos en el Municipio 
de Rio Viejo, Departamento de Bolivar.  
 
Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 24 de Octubre de 2006, miembros del Batall&#243;n Antia&#233;reo 
Nueva Granada dispararon contra el Sr. Leber Castrill&#243;n Sarmiento y sus dos hijos, quienes se 
encontraban pescando en la quebrada del corregimiento de Noros&#237; en horas de la noche. El Sr. 
Castrill&#243;n muri&#243; como consecuencia de los disparos, mientras que su hijo Miguel result&#243; herido 
en una pierna.  
 
El Coronel Gustavo Enrique Avenda&#241;o, Jefe del Estado Mayor de la Quinta Brigada, habr&#237;a 
afirmado que dicho incidente era la consecuencia de un error militar. De acuerdo a su versi&#243;n, el 
incidente habr&#237;a tenido lugar en un sector donde el Ej&#233;rcito adelantaba operaciones de registro y 
control militar. Al parecer, el Ej&#233;rcito habr&#237;a abierto fuego contra el Sr. Castrill&#243;n y sus hijos al 
confundirlos con miembros de organizaciones al margen de la ley. 
 
En estas circunstancias, deseo expresar mi profunda preocupaci&#243;n con relaci&#243;n a las denuncias 
que he venido recibiendo en contra de tropas del Ej&#233;rcito presentes en la regi&#243;n del  sur de 
Bolivar. A trav&#233;s de una carta enviada el 8 de Noviembre de este a&#241;o, llam&#233; la atenci&#243;n de su 
Gobierno sobre la muerte del Sr. <b>Alejandro Uribe</b>, reconocido defensor de derechos humanos, 
quien habr&#237;a sido asesinado el 19 de septiembre de 2006 por presuntos miembros del Ej&#233;rcito </p>

Nacional en el sur de Bol&#237;var. Seg&#250;n nuestras fuentes, su muerte estar&#237;a relacionada con la 
denuncia que el Sr. Uribe efectu&#243; ante la Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo, sobre la presunta ejecuci&#243;n 
extrajudicial del <b>Sr. Arnulfo Pab&#243;n</b>, un habitante del sur de Bolivar que habr&#237;a sido asesinado el 
18 de agosto de 2006 por supuestos miembros del Batall&#243;n Antia&#233;reo Nueva Granada. 
 
Seg&#250;n las &#250;ltimas informaciones, desde el 19 de septiembre miembros de las comunidades del 
sur de Bolivar se desplazaron al municipio de Santa Rosa para protestar  por la muerte del Sr. 
Alejandro Uribe, y denunciar que las tropas del Ej&#233;rcito presentes en la regi&#243;n, han manifestado 
que &#8220;no responden por las personas que transiten por caminos despu&#233;s de las 6:00 p.m.&#8221;,  y que 
&#8220;las personas no deben andar en grupo, pues es un peligro la reacci&#243;n del Ej&#233;rcito contra ellos&#8221;.  
 
Frente a esta grave situaci&#243;n, insto al Gobierno de Su Excelencia a que investigue el incidente 
que caus&#243; la muerte del Sr. Leber Castrill&#243;n Sarmiento, as&#237; como todas las alegaciones en contra 
de las tropas del ej&#233;rcito presentes en el sur de Bolivar, a que  imponga las sanciones adecuadas a 
cualquier persona responsable de las violaciones alegadas, y a que adopte todas las medidas

Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea: Death Sentence of Son Jong Nam 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Non-respect of international standards relating to the imposition of capital 
punishment 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> 1 male (religious minority) 
<b> 
Character of reply:</b> Allegations rejected but without adequate substantiation

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>In keeping with a public statement made by him and other special procedures on 31 May 2006, 
the Special Rapporteur would reiterate that he is profoundly dismayed by the response of the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and deplores its failure to cooperate with the special 
procedures established by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal dated 26 April 2006</b> sent with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention, Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 
We would like to bring to your attention information we have received regarding Mr. <b>Son Jong 
Nam</b>, who we understand is currently held imprisoned in the basement of the National Security 
Agency in Pyongyang in a critical health condition after he was reportedly tortured at the hands 
of members of the National Security Agency. We have been informed that he is accused of 
treason and that he is at risk of imminent execution. Information received does not indicate that a 
trial took place. The sentence is believed to have been passed by the National Security Agency. 
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, Mr. Son Jong Nam had defected from North Korea in 
1997 with his wife, son and brother. He was born in Sadong, Soryongdong, Pyongyang and 
served his full military term as a non-commissioned officer at the Security Protection 
Headquarters from October 1975 to May 1983. In January 1998, Mr Son's sister-in-law was 
investigated by the secret police while pregnant. During the interrogation she was kicked in the 
stomach and she miscarried. Mr Son brought the matter before the Central People's Committee. 
However, his claim was dismissed and he decided to leave North Korea to China shortly 
afterwards. Reported indicate that he attended Church in China and became a Christian.  
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 108 
 
Son Jong Nam was repatriated in April 2001 and imprisoned for three years in the Ham-yung-
Buk area prison camp in North Korea. He was released on parole in May 2004 and was expelled 
to Chongjin where he worked at a rocket research institute.  
 
In May 2004, Son Jong Nam was able to meet his brother in China and return to North Korea. 
However, the National Security Agency got to know about this trip and he was taken in by the 
secret police in January 2006 as he was leaving his younger sister's house in Pyongyang. Shortly 
afterwards, his two older and two younger sisters were exiled from Pyongyang.  
 
It would appear that the charges against Mr. Son Jong Nam are grounded in his visit to China 
where he met with his brother and shared information with him on his life in South Korea.  
  
According to the information we have received, the date of Mr. Son Jong Nam&#8217;s execution has 
not been communicated but reports indicate that it could be carried out sometime in April. It is 
further reported that the general practice is to only announce executions for murder and other 
common crimes while dates of executions for treason are not made public in advance.  
  
While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to respectfully 
remind your Excellency that States have the legal duty to ensure and respect the right to life and 
that this right shall be protected by law. In addition, in countries which have not abolished the 
death penalty, sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes in accordance 
with the law in force at the time of the commission of the crime. This penalty can only be carried 
out pursuant to a final judgment rendered by a competent court (International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, article 6 paragraphs 1 and 2).  
 
Without in any way making any determination on whether the detention of Mr. Son Jong Nam  is 
arbitrary or not, we would like to appeal to your Excellency's Government to take all necessary 
measures to guarantee his right not to be deprived arbitrarily of his liberty and to fair 
proceedings before an independent and impartial tribunal, in accordance with articles 9 and 10 of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights.  
 
We also recall that Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/39 urges States to ensure that 
any statement, which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked 
in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made. This principle is an essential aspect of the right to physical and mental integrity set forth, 
inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Declaration on the Protection of All persons from Being Subjected to 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
 
We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the 
rights under international law of Mr. Son Jong Nam are respected. This can only mean 
suspension of the capital punishment against him until all allegations relating to the absence of 
trial and the recourse to torture have been thoroughly investigated. Moreover, international law 
requires that the accountability of any person guilty of subjecting Mr. Son Jong Nam to torture is 
ensured. 
 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government. 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2. Please provide the details about the steps taken to guarantee that Mr. Son Jong Nam was 
sentenced to death by a competent court after a fair trial. 
 
3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the arrest, detention and 
allegations of torture of Mr. Son Jong Nam. If no enquiries have taken place or if they have been 
inconclusive please explain why.  
</p>
<p> 
4. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken with 
regard to the alleged torture of Mr. Son Jong Nam. Have penal, disciplinary or administrative 
sanctions been imposed on the perpetrators?

Response of the Government of Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea dated 5 May 2006 
</b> 
According to the Government &#8220;this joint letter like previous ones also represents a product of 
conspiracy undertaken in pursuit of the ill-minded aim of spreading fabricated information while 
following the attempts of those hostile forces to defame, disintegrate and overthrow the state and 
social system of the DPRK on the pretext of human rights. The letter has therefore no relevance 
to genuine human rights. Therefore, we resolutely and categorically reject the letter once again. 
For this and those other reasons stated on previous joint letters, unfortunately, I send back to you 
the joint letter of 3 special rapporteurs and the Chairperson of the working group on arbitrary 
detention dated April 26, 2006.&#8221;

Le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial souhaite souligner que les compensations financi&#232;res requises pour 
assurer la r&#233;paration de violations des droits de l&#8217;Homme ne peuvent l&#233;gitimement se substituer &#224;

<b>Lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation envoy&#233;e le 13 janvier 2006 
 
</b>Je souhaite attirer votre attention sur la r&#233;pression sanglante par les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; 
djiboutiennes de la manifestation qui a eu lieu le 30 novembre 2005 &#224; Djibouti-ville. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les 
renseignements qui m&#8217;ont &#233;t&#233; communiqu&#233;s, vers 8h30 du matin les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; ont ouvert 
le feu sur les habitants du quartier d'Arhiba dans la capitale Djiboutienne alors que ceux-ci 
tentaient de s'opposer &#224; la destruction de leurs habitations par les pouvoirs publics dans le cadre 
d&#8217;une campagne d'expulsion forc&#233;e des r&#233;sidents ne pr&#233;voyant pas de relogement et d&#233;truisant 
par le feu des habitats insalubres du quartier d'Arhiba. On d&#233;nombre la mort de cinq 
manifestants, dont une femme et un enfant. Huit personnes auraient &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; bless&#233;es lors 
de cette attaque et cinq autres seraient port&#233;es disparues. 
  
Il m&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; rapport&#233; que ces actes de r&#233;pression brutale sont intervenus un mois apr&#232;s la mort d'un 
jeune homme de 18 ans, abattu par les forces de l'ordre le 23 octobre 2005 lors d&#8217;une 
manifestation pacifique de travailleurs et de lyc&#233;ens contre l'augmentation des prix des 
transports. 
 
Sans vouloir &#224; ce stade me prononcer sur les faits qui m&#8217;ont &#233;t&#233; soumis, je souhaiterais 
n&#233;anmoins intervenir aupr&#232;s de votre Excellence afin de lui rappeler l&#8217;applicabilit&#233; dans de telles

l'accomplissement de leurs fonctions, auront recours autant que possible &#224; des moyens non-
violents, en limitant le recours &#224; la force &#224; certains cas exceptionnels comme la l&#233;gitime d&#233;fense 
ou pour d&#233;fendre des tiers contre une menace imminente de mort ou de blessure grave. Je 
souhaite &#233;galement attirer votre attention sur  le Code de conduite pour les responsables de 
l'application des lois, r&#233;solution 34/169 du 17 d&#233;cembre 1979 de l'Assembl&#233;e g&#233;n&#233;rale qui stipule 
que les responsables de l'application des lois peuvent recourir &#224; la force seulement lorsque cela 
est strictement n&#233;cessaire et dans la mesure exig&#233;e par l'accomplissement de leurs fonctions.  
 
J&#8217;en appelle au Gouvernement de son Excellence afin d&#8217;assurer que les morts qui ont eu lieu lors 
de l&#8217;op&#233;ration par les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; le 23 et 30 octobre 2005 fasse rapidement l&#8217;objet d&#8217;une 
enqu&#234;te approfondie et impartiale en conformit&#233; avec les Principes des Nations Unies relatifs &#224; la 
pr&#233;vention efficace des ex&#233;cutions extrajudiciaires, arbitraires et sommaires, et moyens 
d'enqu&#234;ter efficacement sur ces ex&#233;cutions. 
 
Il est de ma responsabilit&#233;, en vertu du mandat qui m&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; confi&#233; par la Commission des Droits 
de l&#8217;Homme et par les r&#233;solutions de l&#8217;Assembl&#233;e G&#233;n&#233;rale des Nations Unies de solliciter votre 
coop&#233;ration afin d&#8217;&#233;claircir les cas qui ont &#233;t&#233; port&#233;s &#224; notre attention. Dans l&#8217;obligation d&#8217;en 
faire rapport &#224; la Commission des Droits de l&#8217;Homme, je remercie le Gouvernement de son

<b>R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement de Djibouti du 5 avril 2006 
</b> 
En r&#233;ponse &#224; votre courrier en date du 13 janvier 2006 et relative aux &#233;v&#233;nements malheureux 
survenus &#224; Arhiba le 20 novembre 2005 lors des op&#233;rations de d&#233;casement des habitations de 
fortune construites ill&#233;galement et plus particuli&#232;rement sur les d&#233;c&#232;s ainsi que les bless&#233;s 
enregistr&#233;s &#224; la suite des affrontements avec les forces de l&#8217;ordre ainsi que du d&#233;c&#232;s d&#8217;un &#233;tudiant 
le 23 octobre 2005 &#224; l&#8217;occasion d&#8217;une manifestation publique, j&#8217;ai l&#8217;honneur de vous faire 
parvenir ci-joint le rapport d&#233;taill&#233; pr&#233;par&#233; par les autorit&#233;s comp&#233;tentes de notre pays. Ce 
rapport retrace les faits dans leur contexte, les enqu&#234;tes men&#233;es ainsi que les suites donn&#233;es par 
notre pays &#224; ces &#233;v&#233;nements tragiques et regrettables. 
 
Rapport de Djibouti suite &#224; la plainte contenue dans la communication du 13 janvier 2006. 
 
Contrairement &#224; la l&#233;gende de l&#8217;op&#233;ration surprise commandit&#233;e par l&#8217;administration tel que 
d&#233;crite par les auteurs de la plainte, les op&#233;rations de d&#233;casement ob&#233;issainet &#224; une logique 
m&#251;rement r&#233;fl&#233;chie qui faisait suite &#224; un besoin insistant des reiverains en mati&#232;re de s&#233;curit&#233;. 
 
Les installations d&#233;cas&#233;es faites de bric-&#224;-brac en carton, taules et en tous genres de mat&#233;riaux de 
r&#233;cup&#233;ration s&#8217;&#233;tendaient sur une surface de plusieurs hectares derri&#232;re le quartier d&#8217;Arhiba. 
 
Il faut signaler que le quartier d&#8217;Arhiba est d&#233;j&#224; source d&#8217;inqui&#233;tude pour les autorit&#233;s de la ville 
de Djibouti &#224; cause de la v&#233;tust&#233; des constructions, de son surpeuplement et de la promiscuit&#233;. 
 
Or c&#8217;est pr&#233;cis&#233;ment les habitants non seulement du quartier d&#8217;Arhiba mais aussi les habitants de 
la cit&#233; Makka Al-Moukarama du quartier 7 et l&#8217;ensemble des des habitants du 2&#232;me 
arrondissement qui depuis longtemps interpellaient les autorit&#233;s de la ville de Djibouti sur les 
risques encourus &#224; cause de ces constructions sauvages. 
 
L&#8217;inqui&#233;tude des riverains &#233;tait justifi&#233;e car les constructions insalubres devenaient contig&#252;es au 
Lyc&#233;e Industriel et commercial de Djibouti, et les associations de parents d&#8217;&#233;l&#232;ves insistaient 
aupr&#232;s des responsables de la ville sur les risques pour la s&#233;curit&#233; et la moralit&#233; de leurs enfants. 
 
En effet, &#224; cause de leurs constructions sauvages, du manque total d&#8217;&#233;clairage et de tout 
&#233;quipement sanitaire, le &#171; secteur des taudis &#187; (comme il &#233;tait famili&#232;rement surnomm&#233;) &#233;tait 
devenu le rep&#232;re de tous les trafiquants (drogue, prostitution, racket&#8230;) 
 
D&#8217;ailleurs, il convient de rappeler qu&#8217;en octobre 2005, un m&#233;decin avait &#233;t&#233; assassin&#233; dans ce 
secteur. Il a &#233;t&#233; attaqu&#233; par 5 hommes arm&#233;s de poignards et de barre de fer. Son &#233;pouse a &#233;t&#233; 
sauv&#233;e de justesse gr&#226;ce &#224; l&#8217;intervention des promeneurs qui ont entendu ses cris de d&#233;tresse. 
 </p>

Les 5 hommes ont extorqu&#233; &#224; la victime 2500 FD (15 dollars US) et une cha&#238;ne en or. La police a 
interpell&#233; les 5 hommes, tous d&#8217;origine &#233;thiopienne et en situation irr&#233;guli&#232;re, pr&#233;cis&#233;ment dans 
un taudis situ&#233; en plein c&#339;ur des installations d&#233;cas&#233;es. 
 
Si ce crime a v&#233;ritablement constitu&#233; un choc et une prise de conscience pour les habitants des 
quartiers 7, Arhiba et Makka Al-Mukkarama, de nombreuses agressions avaient d&#233;j&#224; &#233;t&#233; 
signal&#233;es tout au long de l&#8217;ann&#233;e 2005 dans le m&#234;me secteur. 
 
C&#8217;est dans ces conditions que les autorit&#233;s de la ville de Djibouti en concertation avec les 
habitants du quartier d&#8217;Arhiba qui est juxtapos&#233; &#224; ces installations sauvages et pirates ont 
entrepris un travail de dialogue et de sensibilisation avant de commencer les op&#233;rations de 
d&#233;casement. 
 
D&#232;s le d&#233;part, les autorit&#233;s de la  ville de Djibouti avaient planifi&#233; de r&#233;installer les personnes 
d&#233;cas&#233;es sur un site pr&#233;par&#233; &#224; cet effet &#224; la p&#233;riph&#233;rie de la ville, dans le secteur du PK 12. 
 
Les services du district de Djibouti, d&#8217;un commun accord avec les notables et les responsables 
des deux arrondissements concern&#233;s avaient d&#233;cid&#233; qu&#8217;un registre serait tenu dans les deux 
arrondissements concern&#233;s pour permettre aux familles d&#233;cas&#233;es de s&#8217;y inscrire et de b&#233;n&#233;ficier 
ainsi des parcelles pr&#233;vues au PK 12.  
 
C&#8217;est dans ces conditions que sous la direction de M. Djaffar Hersi, directeur de la voirie du 
district de Djibouti, les services techniques de la ville, assist&#233;s par la police et la gendarmerie ont 
entrepris les op&#233;rations de d&#233;casement. 
 
L&#8217;op&#233;ration a d&#233;but&#233; le 22 novembre 2005 &#224; 6h30 et a concern&#233; quelques dizaines de familles 
compos&#233;es de 149 personnes. 
 
Cette premi&#232;re journ&#233;e a &#233;t&#233; un succ&#232;s total et aucun incident n&#8217;a eu lieu. Mieux encore, les 
populations d&#233;j&#224; pr&#233;par&#233;es psychologiquement et s&#251;res d&#8217;&#234;tre r&#233;install&#233;es emballaient elles-
m&#234;mes leurs bagages et affaires et s&#8217;enregistraient aupr&#232;s des deux chefs d&#8217;arrondissements 
concern&#233;s. 
 
Le 23 novembre 205 les op&#233;rations de d&#233;casement se sont poursuivies et 98 taudis on &#233;t&#233; enlev&#233;s 
sans aucun incident.  
 
Les op&#233;rations de d&#233;casement ont repris le 26,27,28 et 29 novembre 2005 sans aucun incident. 
Le 29 novembre les op&#233;rations de d&#233;casement &#233;taient pratiquement achev&#233;es puisque seul le 
nettoyage et le ramassage des ordures derri&#232;re le LIC &#233;tait pr&#233;vu pour le 30 novembre 2005. 
 
D&#8217;ailleurs &#224; partir du 29 novembre 2005, le dispositif de s&#233;curit&#233; &#233;tait all&#233;g&#233;, l&#8217;essentiel de 
l&#8217;op&#233;ration &#233;tant achev&#233; ; le nombre de policiers destin&#233; &#224; prot&#233;ger les agents des services de la 
voirie et leurs engins &#233;tait r&#233;duit et le renfort des &#233;l&#233;ments de la gendarmerie avait &#233;t&#233; estim&#233; 
inutile. 
 
Or dans la nuit du 29 au 30 novembre 2005, des personnes mal intentionn&#233;es avaient fait courir 
la rumeur parmi les quelques familles qui restaient encore sur place ne seraient pas r&#233;install&#233;es </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 113 
 
faute de place ; information totalement erron&#233;e puisque toutes les familles sont aujourd&#8217;hui 
r&#233;install&#233;es. 
 
Cette rumeur s&#8217;&#233;tant propag&#233;e comme une train&#233;e de poudre aliment&#233;e par des individus mal 
intentionn&#233;s, les agents des services techniques de la ville et les policiers ont &#233;t&#233; surpris le 
mercredi 30 novembre &#224; 7h00 du matin de constater derri&#232;re le LIC la pr&#233;sence d&#8217;une centaine 
de personnes arm&#233;es de barres de fer et de machettes d&#233;cid&#233;es &#224; les attaquer. 
 
Face &#224; cette foule surexcit&#233;e et hurlant des propos mena&#231;ant l&#8217;officier en charge de la s&#233;curit&#233; 
des agents techniques de la voirie donnait l&#8217;ordre de se replier et de prot&#233;ger les agents 
techniques de la voirie donnait l&#8217;ordre de se replier et de prot&#233;ger les agents civils pour leur 
permettre de quitter les lieux. 
 
Les manifestants commenc&#232;rent alors &#224; lancer des cailloux et d&#8217;autres projectiles, &#224; casser les 
v&#233;hicules et les engins de la voirie. Les policiers ont utilis&#233; d&#8217;abord en riposte, des grenades 
lacrymog&#232;nes pour disperser les manifestants. 
 
Mais face &#224; des personnes surexcit&#233;es, l&#8217;officier commandant l&#8217;unit&#233; compos&#233;e d&#8217;une vingtaine 
d&#8217;agents charg&#233;s de la protection des agents de la voirie n&#8217;a pas eu d&#8217;autre choix que de se 
replier avec son effectif vers le Dry-Port. 
 
Constatant que cette unit&#233; allait &#234;tre encercl&#233;e par un autre groupe de manifestants, l&#8217;officier 
lan&#231;ait des v&#233;hicules grillages sur le flanc Nord par rapport &#224; son unit&#233;, tout en se retirant vers le 
LIC. 
 
Aussit&#244;t le proviseur du Lyc&#233;e (LIC) M. Hassan Ismail Hersi d&#233;cidait avec sagesse d&#8217;&#233;vacuer le 
LIC pour &#233;viter que les lyc&#233;ens ne soient pris &#224; partie par les manifestants. Cette strat&#233;gie a 
permis de contenir la foule et de permettre aux agents de la voirie et aux policiers de se replier 
sous une pluie de projectile. N&#233;anmoins la foule arrivait &#224; attraper deux policiers qui ont &#233;t&#233; 
v&#233;ritablement lynch&#233;s. Le v&#233;hicule de l&#8217;officier commandant &#233;tait par ailleurs la cible des 
manifestants et s&#233;rieusement endommag&#233; ; celui-ci demandant par radio &#224; l&#8217;Etat Major de la 
police des renforts. 
 
Malheureusement, dans la panique et la confusion des coups de balles &#233;taient tir&#233;s par les 
policiers qui, outre sept bless&#233;s civils, entrainaient la mort de Hawino Mohamed Ali et Mohamed 
Molla Mohamed. 
 
Par ailleurs, le directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral de l&#8217;h&#244;pital Peltier, le Dr Mohamed Abdourahman &#233;tablissait 
une liste faisant &#233;tat de 22 policiers bless&#233;s dont 2 gri&#232;vement, tous soign&#233;s (ainsi que les bless&#233;s 
civils) dans ce m&#234;me h&#244;pital. 
 
Parall&#232;lement, des responsables de l&#8217;administration et les notables du quartier entreprenaient une 
m&#233;ditation afin de r&#233;tablir le calme et l&#8217;ordre. Une commission d&#8217;enqu&#234;te administrative &#233;tait 
institu&#233;e par le Ministre de l&#8217;Int&#233;rieur pour &#171; indiquer aux autorit&#233;s de l&#8217;Etat les circonstances 
dans lesquelles la police s&#8217;est servie des armes &#224; feu. 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 114 
 
Cette commission a rendu ses conclusions le 12 d&#233;cembre 2005 en estimant que &#171; les policiers 
charg&#233;s de la protection des agents de la voirie et de leurs engins lors de ces op&#233;rations de 
d&#233;casement s&#8217;&#233;taient retrouv&#233;s cern&#233;s par un nombre consid&#233;rable de manifestants qui les ont 
attaqu&#233;s avec des projectiles, des couteaux, des b&#226;tons et des barres de fer et qu&#8217;ils &#233;taient (avec 
les employ&#233;s civils de la voirie) en danger de mort &#187;. 
 
La commission a estim&#233; qu&#8217;il pourrait s&#8217;agir d&#8217;un cas de l&#233;gitime d&#233;fense. Le rapport met 
n&#233;anmoins en cause l&#8217;attitude irresponsable du capitaine Kamil Ali officier de police ; ce dernier 
a &#233;t&#233; aussit&#244;t suspendu par le Ministre de l&#8217;Int&#233;rieur.  Les familles des deux victimes d&#233;c&#233;d&#233;es 
par balles &#233;taient re&#231;ues par le Premier Ministre, toutes les victimes civiles ont &#233;t&#233; indemnis&#233;es 
et aucune plainte p&#233;nale n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;e. 
 
De m&#234;me la famille du jeune homme d&#233;c&#233;d&#233; lors des manifestations du 23 octobre 2005 contre 
l&#8217;augmentation des prix des transports a &#233;t&#233; re&#231;ue par le premier ministre et indemnis&#233;e par l&#8217;Etat 
djiboutien. Par ailleurs, le 4 f&#233;vrier 2006, des lyc&#233;ens et &#233;tudiants manifestaient leur col&#232;re 
contre la diffusion par certains journaux europ&#233;ens des caricatures du proph&#232;te Mohamed et des 
accrochages avec les forces de l&#8217;ordre ont fait des bless&#233;s l&#233;gers parmi les manifestants. 
 
Or, &#224; la suite de ces diff&#233;rents incidents et malgr&#233; les difficult&#233;s inh&#233;rentes &#224; toute op&#233;ration de 
maintien de l&#8217;ordre, le pr&#233;sident de la R&#233;publique de son Excellence, Monsieur Ismail Omar 
Guelleh, a par d&#233;cret du 5 f&#233;vrier 2006 relev&#233; le Colonel Hassan Djama Guedi de ses fonctions 
de Directeur G&#233;n&#233;ral de la Police. Ce m&#234;me d&#233;cret nommait le Lieuteneant-Colonel Abdillalhi 
Abdi Farah, nouveau chef de la police.  
 
Le chef de l&#8217;Etat, en sanctionnant ainsi directement le Directeur G&#233;n&#233;ral de la polcie &#224; la suite de 
ces &#233;v&#233;nements tragiques, voulait ainsi d&#233;montrer que la R&#233;publique de Djibouti est une 
d&#233;mocratie respectueuse de la vie humaine et que le recours &#224; la force sans discernement est 
inadmissible. 
 
Enfin la vie politique djiboutienne a connu une nouvelle dimension ces derniers mois &#224; travers 
les &#233;lections r&#233;gionales et communales qui ont eu lieu de fa&#231;on pacifique et d&#233;mocratique le 10 
mars (1er tour) et le 31 mars 2006 (2eme tour) deans les 5 r&#233;gions et &#224; Djibouti-ville, outre 
qu&#8217;elles confirment davantage encore la r&#233;alit&#233; de la vie d&#233;mocratique de notre pays, d&#233;montrent 
le souci permanent du Chef de l&#8217;Etat d&#8217;associer les populations &#224; la gestion de leurs r&#233;gions, 
villes et communes. Ainsi la tenue de ces &#233;lections qui r&#233;alisent la d&#233;centralisation constitue un 
instrument de gestion mieux adopt&#233; &#224; certaines situations de crises comme la crise des 
d&#233;casements des logements insalubres. En effet, face aux d&#233;fis majeurs que constituent les crises 
du logement, celle de l&#8217;eau, de l&#8217;&#233;lectricit&#233; ; les probl&#233;matiques de la promiscuit&#233;, de 
l&#8217;insalubrit&#233; et de l&#8217;absence d&#8217;hygi&#232;ne dans les villes, le gouvernement de la r&#233;publique de 
Djibouti a estim&#233; indispensable d&#8217;associer les populations concern&#233;es &#224; la prise de d&#233;cision en 
permettant largement &#224; des personnes issues de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile et du monde associatif d&#8217;&#234;tre 
&#233;lus aux conseils r&#233;gionaux et municipaux. 
 
Ainsi, lors de ces &#233;lections r&#233;gionales et municipales, sur 28 listes pr&#233;sent&#233;es, plus d&#8217;une 
vingtaine &#233;tait compos&#233;e des personnalit&#233;s issues des milieux associatifs et qui ont pr&#233;sent&#233; des 
listes ind&#233;pendantes qui concouraient &#224; c&#244;t&#233; des partis politiques traditionnels. Des nombreux 
candidats issus de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile ont ainsi &#233;t&#233; &#233;lus et vont si&#233;ger dans les conseils r&#233;gionaux et </p>

municipaux. Aussi, cette participation de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile &#224; la gestion des probl&#232;mes des r&#233;gions 
villes et communes confirme donc la volont&#233; du gouvernement djiboutien d&#8217;&#233;tablir un ordre 
social pacifi&#233; ou les conflits se r&#232;glent par le dialogue, la confrontation d&#8217;id&#233;es et donc apr 
l&#8217;expression du suffrage universel. En d&#233;finitive, les informations totalement erron&#233;es sur les 
&#233;v&#233;nements du 30 novembre 2005 qui ont &#233;t&#233; soumises au Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial  sont contraires &#224; 
la r&#233;alit&#233; sociale et politique de notre pays. Pire encore, ces fausses informations sont &#233;galement 
en contradiction avec la v&#233;rit&#233; sur le d&#233;roulement des &#233;v&#233;nements tragiques du 30 novembre 
2005, faits mat&#233;riels donc susceptibles de v&#233;rification et en cons&#233;quence, celles-ci 
compromettent jusqu&#8217;&#224; leur dignit&#233; ceux qui, dans le but de nuire une fois de plus &#224; l&#8217;image de 
notre pays, les ont transmises.

<b>Carta de alegaci&#243;n del 3 de julio de 2006 
 
</b>Quisiera se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente de su Gobierno la informaci&#243;n que he recibido en relaci&#243;n 
al supuesto excesivo uso de la fuerza por parte de miembros de la polic&#237;a en contra de <b>Fernando

de General Farf&#225;n en la provincia de Sucumb&#237;os, regi&#243;n fronteriza con Colombia, en Ecuador. 
 
De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas, el s&#225;bado 10 de junio de 2006 se despleg&#243; un 
operativo policial en la Parroquia conocida con el nombre de General Farf&#225;n, luego que, 
aproximadamente a las ocho y media de la noche, dos polic&#237;as, Luis David Lora Alvarez y 
Carlos Alejandro Garan Mina, fueran acribillados en el interior de su patrullero por individuos 
no identificados, en el mencionado lugar. 
 
Los informes indican que pocos minutos despu&#233;s del ataque armado contra los dos polic&#237;as, se 
activaron las alarmas locales de prevenci&#243;n instaladas en el pueblo. Sin embargo, ning&#250;n 
miembro de la polic&#237;a se hizo presente en los siguientes noventa minutos, por lo que la propia 
poblaci&#243;n civil intent&#243; dar los primeros auxilios a los gendarmes, con resultados infructuosos. 
Posteriormente, hacia las diez de la noche, llegaron a General Farf&#225;n miembros de la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional, acantonada en la capital provincial de Lago Agrio, con la intenci&#243;n de dar con el 
paradero de los asesinos de sus dos compa&#241;eros. Seg&#250;n las denuncias, los polic&#237;as se 
comportaron de manera poco profesional, con actitudes violentas y bruscas contra la poblaci&#243;n 
civil, realizaron allanamientos a varias casas, y procedieron a detener a numerosas personas.

<b>Egypt: Excessive Use of Force in Dispersing Crowds during Parliamentary Elections

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of Egypt 
concerning the events of 7 December 2005.   
 
The SR notes, however, that the explanation provided by the Government for the use of 
potentially lethal force to disperse the crowd raises serious concerns.  According to human rights 
law, however necessary the use of force may be to achieve a particular objective, such as the 
dispersal of a crowd, the force used must nevertheless be proportionate to the threat posed.   (<i>See</i> 
A/61/311, paras. 33-45.)  In particular, the intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made 
when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life, and even the potentially lethal use of firearms 
may only be made to apprehend the perpetrator of or otherwise prevent a particularly serious 
crime involving grave threat to life.   
 
The description of the crowd provided in the allegation received by the Special Rapporteur and 
the description provided in the response of the Government of Egypt both suggest that for the 
police to have opened fire at the legs of individuals was disproportionate to any crime or threat 
posed by the crowd. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation sent on 16 December 2005 
</b></p>
<p>I would like to bring to the attention of Your Excellency&#8217;s Government information I have 
received according to which, on 7 December 2005, the police fired into crowds of people who 
wished to gain access to polling stations in al-Daqahlia, al-Sharqia and other areas in order to 
cast their votes in run-offs to the third and last phase of Egypt&#8217;s parliamentary elections. The 
police shootings resulted in the death of at least eight people, namely <b>Sa&#8216;eed al-Deghidi</b>, 
<b>Sha&#8216;aban Abu Rabaa&#8216; </b>and <b>&#8216;Atif Ahmed</b> from Damietta, <b>Tamir al-Qamash</b> and <b>Mohammed 
al-Bahrawy</b> from al-Daqahlia and <b>Mostafa &#8216;Abd al-Salam</b>, <b>Mohammed &#8216;Aliwa</b> and 
<b>Mohammed Gazzar</b> from al-Sharqia. Besides, <b>&#8216;Izzat Ra&#8217;fat Seddiq</b>, a fifteen-year-old boy 
from al-Duqahlia, was among a number of people who received gunshot injuries or were 
wounded by being struck by tear gas bombs. The polling stations concerned had been closed or 
cordoned off by the police. As well as live fire, police are reported to have used tear gas and 
rubber bullets in their efforts to disperse the crowds. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 118 
 
I would like to refer your Excellency's Government to the fundamental principles applicable to 
such incidents under international law. Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights provides that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. As the Human 
Rights Committee has clarified, &#8220;arbitrarily&#8221; means in a manner &#8220;disproportionate to the 
requirements of law enforcement in the circumstances of the case&#8221; (Views of the Committee in 
the case Su&#225;rez de Guerrero v. Colombia, Communication no. 45/1979, &#167; 13.3). This was further 
elaborated in the 1990 U.N. Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law 
Enforcement Officials. Principle 7 provides that &#8220;Governments shall ensure that arbitrary or 
abusive use of force and firearms by law enforcement officials is punished as a criminal offence 
under their law.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> 
In order to assess whether the use of lethal force was proportionate to the requirements of law 
enforcement, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation&#8221; (Principle 9 of the 
Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary 
Executions). This obligation, affirmed also in the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee 
(see, e.g. the Committee&#8217;s views in Arhuacos v. Colombia, Communication no. 612/1995, &#167; 8.8.), 
is an integral part of the obligation to respect and protect the right to life enshrined in Article 3 of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. This principle was recently reiterated by the Commission on Human Rights 
(Resolution 2005/34) which noted that every State has &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive 
and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions&#8221;. The Commission added that this includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to 
justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the 
victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial 
measures, in order to &#8230; prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I urge your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to take all necessary measures to ensure the accountability, in accordance with 
international law, of any person responsible for the above mentioned shootings. 
</p>
<p> 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
to seek to clarify all such cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on these 
cases to the Commission, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? Please provide a full list of persons 
deceased as a result of police shootings on 7 December 2005. 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any police investigation, medical 
examination (autopsy), and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to these cases. Please 
include information regarding the guarantees for independence and impartiality of the

been imposed in connection with this incident? If your Government has not undertaken any 
inquiries in this matter or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why.

<b>Response of the Government of Egypt dated 23 May 2006 
</b> 
I. Constitutional and legislative norms pertaining to the &quot;Organization of rallies and 
</p>
<p>demonstrations - the expression of opinion&quot; contained in Act No. 10 of 1914 
concerning rallies and Act No 14 of 1923 concerning the rules governing public 
meetings and demonstrations on the public highways: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1.  The competent security department must be informed three days before the holding of 
the demonstration or rally (articles 1 and 9 of Act No. 14 of 1923). 
 
2. The notification must state the time, place and purpose of the demonstration and it must 
be signed by five of the organizers, who must be persons entitled to exercise civil and political 
rights and who are of good reputation (articles 3 and 9 of Act No. 14 of 1923). 
 
3.  The time, place or purpose of the demonstration should not cause a disturbance of 
public order or security (articles 4 and 9 of Act No. 14 of 1923).  
 
4. The demonstration must follow the prescribed route, or the rally must be held at the 
notified place, it must deal with the subject notified, and there must be no public calls or 
clamour for disorder or for the commission of a crime defined in the Criminal Code or other 
legislation, or any rioting (articles 7 and 9 of Act No. 14 of 1923). 
 
II Legal consequences of breaches of the Assembly Act: 
 
The legal consequences consist in the prohibition or breaking up of such demonstrations, the 
dispersal of any rally or assembly, and the punishment (of convenors - organizers - committee 
members) as prescribed by law with a prison term not exceeding six months and a fine of not 
more than 100 Egyptian pounds, or either of the two; participants in the demonstration are 
punishable with a prison term not exceeding one month and a fine of not more than 20 
Egyptian pounds, or either of the two. 
 
III. Means used to handle rioting during demonstrations or assemblies and police 
</p>
<p>authorization to use force: 
 
</p>
<p>- Article 102 of Police Force Act No. 109 of 1971 concerning the circumstances in which 
firearms may be used to break up assemblies or demonstrations where there is a risk to 
public order stipulates that police officers must first issue a warning that they are about to 
fire and only then open fire; the order to use firearms must be issued by a superior officer, 
with the assembled persons first being given a warning and time to disperse and being 
informed of the required direction of dispersal, including the streets and roads they may 
use; gas weapons (rifles, ammunition, gas hand grenades) may be used and the 
demonstrators pursued with batons and sidearms (truncheons and bayonets); where the 
demonstrators fail to disperse, where alternative measures have been exhausted and in the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 120 
 
</p>
<p>event of attacks on police officers, on one's own person, on property or on installations, it 
is permissible to open fire at a person's legs. 
</p>
<p> 
IV. Offences committed by he demonstrators on 8 September 2005 during the run-off election 
</p>
<p>for the third phase of the parliamentary elections in the Governorates of Al-Daqahlia and 
Al-Sharqia. 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. The above-mentioned demonstrators breached all the constitutional and legislative rules so 
that the law enforcement agencies had no option but to issue a warning, giving them a deadline 
to disperse, indicating the requested direction of dispersal and the streets and roads they could 
use to depart, but they failed to heed the warning. 
 
2. The police were compelled to use gas weapons (gas handguns) and to pursue the 
demonstrators with batons and side arms. Alter the exhaustion of such measures, the 
demonstrators had still failed to disperse and had escalated their attacks, throwing stones at the 
police, who were forced to use firearms to disperse the demonstrators, which resulted in some 
fatalities among them. 
 
V. Forensic medical reports concluded that death occurred either as a result of cuts to the 
</p>
<p>head or gunshot wounds or as a result of acute circulatory and respiratory failure, which 
indicates that some of the deaths were due to crowding, pushing and shoving and stone-
throwing, for which the demonstrators themselves were primarily responsible. 
</p>
<p> 
VI. Compensation is awarded on the basis of a court decision in cases where damage is 
</p>
<p>culpably inflicted on another person, which means that a perpetrator must be identified 
so that the victim can be awarded compensation. No perpetrators have been identified 
in view of the fact that the investigations have not yet been completed.

 Page 121 
 
According to the information received, on 7 October 2005 a police officer from the Atlas police 
station got into a bus and asked the driver, Alaa Mahmoud Abdel Lateef, to order passengers to 
get off the vehicle so that he could give him a ride to the Atlas area. As he refused to do so, the 
police officer shot Alaa Mahmoud Abdel Lateef as well as his friend Mohamed Adly. 
 
Both men were transferred to El-Manial El-Gameay hospital and placed under intensive care. 
Alaa Mahmoud Abdel Lateef went into a coma while Mohamed Adly got paralyzed as a result of 
a shot that broke his spinal cord. Reports indicate that an investigation was held and that the 
police officer was imprisoned for four days. 
 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I urge your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that accountability of any person guilty 
of shooting Alaa Mahmoud Abdel Lateef and Mohamed Adly is ensured. 
 
<b>Reply from the Government of Egypt dated 21 February 2006 
</b> 
On 7 October 2005, Alaa Mahmoud Abdel Lateef and Mohamed Adly attacked and punched a 
police officer and attempted to seize his government-issued weapon while he was escorting them 
to the Helwan police station to make a report on the former individual for driving a car without 
licence plates.  As a result, the police officer opened fire on the two individuals, wounding them 
both.  They were taken to the Helwan general hospital, where the driver of the car, Alaa 
Mahmoud Abdel Lateef, subsequently died. 
 
The Office of the Public Prosecutor undertook an investigation into the matter, and the relevant 
documents were placed on file under the reference No. 10166/2005 (Admin.), Helwan Division.  
After questioning the officer concerned, the Office of the Public Prosecutor decided to hold him 
for purposes of its investigation of the case.

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of Egypt 
concerning the death sentences of Mr. Ezzat and Mr. Hamdi Ali Hanafi. 
 
The SR would observe that the Government does not dispute the allegation that the right to 
appeal was denied, and the SR would note that Egypt has made a legal commitment to respect 
that right. 
 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 122 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 2 June 2006 
</b>  
I would like to draw your attention to information I have received regarding two men who are 
reportedly at imminent risk of execution: Mr. <b>Ezzat </b>and Mr. <b>Hamdi Ali Hanafi</b>.  
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, the brothers Ezzat and Hamdi Ali Hanafi have been 
sentenced to death and could be executed at any time. The sentence has been sent to the supreme 
religious authority (Mufti) for approval. President Hosni Mubarak still has the power to 
commute the sentence. 
 
Ezzat and Hamdi Ali Hanafi were sentenced to death on 25 September 2005 by the (Emergency) 
Supreme State Security Court (SSSC). They were arrested in March 2004 and convicted of using 
an area of land belonging to the state to grow unspecified &quot;drugs&quot;; when the security forces 
raided the property, they allegedly offered armed resistance, and took hostages to use as human 
shields. 
 
The brothers are the first defendants sentenced to death by the SSSC since 1998. Under the 
Emergency Law, which has been in force in Egypt since 1981, they had no right to appeal 
against this verdict and could only lodge a petition to quash or reduce the sentence. On 2 May 
the Deputy Military Governor of Egypt rejected this petition. Under the state of emergency, the 
Deputy Military Governor is equivalent to President Mubarak's deputy. 
 
It is my understanding that had they been tried before an ordinary criminal court, both 
defendants would have had the chance to appeal to the Court of Cassation on grounds of 
procedural irregularity. On a number of occasions the Court of Cassation has ordered retrials for 
people sentenced to death by courts of first instance. 
 
Although the death penalty is not prohibited under international law, it must be regarded as an 
extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be interpreted in the most 
restrictive manner. It is therefore crucial that all restrictions pertaining to capital punishment 
contained in international human rights law are fully respected in proceedings relating to capital 
offences.  
 
While I am fully aware of the seriousness of the crimes of which these two men have been 
convicted I respectfully remind your Excellency that &#8220;in capital punishment cases, the obligation 
of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the 
[ICCPR] admits of no exception&#8221; (Little v. Jamaica, communication no. 283/1988, Views of the 
Human Rights Committee of 19 November 1991, para. 10); relevant to the case at issue, these 
guarantees include the right to appeal and to seek pardon or commutation of sentence. 
 
My major concern is with the arrangements relating to the functioning of the SSSC and the 
procedures it follows.  There would appear to be compelling reasons to conclude that these fall 
far short of the applicable international standards My assessment in this regard has also taken 
account of the conclusions reached by the Human Rights Committee.  In its Concluding 
Observations of 28 November 2002 (CCPR/CO/76/EGY) it stated, inter alia: 
 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 123 
 
</p>
<p>16. While understanding the security requirements associated with efforts to combat 
terrorism, the Committee voices concern at their effects on the human rights situation in 
Egypt, particularly in relation to articles 6, 7, 9 and 14 of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p> 
(a) The Committee considers that the effect of the very broad and general definition of 
terrorism given in Act No. 97 of 1992 is to increase the number of offences attracting the 
death penalty in a way that runs counter to the sense of article 6, paragraph 2, of the 
Covenant.  
</p>
<p> 
(b) The Committee notes with alarm that military courts and State security courts have 
jurisdiction to try civilians accused of terrorism although there are no guarantees of those 
courts' independence and their decisions are not subject to appeal before a higher court 
(article 14 of the Covenant). 
</p>
<p> 
I accordingly urge your Government not to proceed with the execution of Mr. Ezzat and Mr. 
Hamdi Ali Hanafi until the relevant procedural defects have been rectified. In view of the 
urgency of the matter, I would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of the two brothers in compliance with 
applicable international law. 
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolution of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all cases 
brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on this case to the Human Rights Council, 
I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
 
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details of the steps taken to guarantee that the trial of Mr. Ezzat 
and Mr. Hamdi Ali Hanafi conformed to international standards and indicate what arrangements 
for a judicial appeal to a higher court were provided. 
 
<b>Response of the Government of Egypt dated 11 July 2006 
</b> 
These two persons were charged, in Abu Tij criminal case No. 192 of 2004, registered as Higher 
State Security Criminal Case No. 16/2004, with:  using, together with others, land owned by the 
State and a group of individuals to grow narcotic plants; bearing arms against public officers 
tasked with arresting the members of this gang; taking individuals hostage and using force, 
violence and threats to put pressure on public officers attempting to carry out their duties; setting 
fire to gas cylinders; and shooting at the police, thereby causing the death of Shima Mohammed 
Ahmad; and deliberately attempting to murder 10 other persons.  They were not able to continue 
with their crimes for reasons beyond their control, namely, the intervention of the police.  They 
were charged with possessing and procuring unlicensed firearms and ammunition for use in 
activities prejudicial to public security.  They were sent, together with others, for trial before the 
Asyut Appeal Division of the Higher State (Emergency) Security Court.  The case was heard in 
open session, until a unanimous verdict was handed down on 25 September 2005, sentencing the 
two men to death.  The Prime Minister endorsed the verdict on 8 March 2006 and the President 
of the Republic gave his approval, on 28 May 2006, for execution of the sentence (pursuant to </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 124 
 
article 470 of the Code of Criminal Procedures).  The lawyer for the two men submitted a 
request for a review of the verdict to the Prosecutor-General.  The request was turned down on 3 
June 2006, pursuant to article 12 of Act No. 162/1958, as amended by Act No. 164 of 1981. 
 
 It is clear from the foregoing that: 
 
&#8722; The death sentence was issued based on the findings of the investigation by the Department 
</p>
<p>of Public Prosecutions.  The two men were tried before a division of the Asyut Appeal Court 
which was competent to hear the case.  The trial was held in open court and afforded the 
defence full legal guarantees.  The decision to impose the death sentence was unanimous.  
Both men pursued all legal means to appeal the verdict.  The appeal was rejected and the 
verdict was upheld. 
</p>
<p> 
&#8722; This shows that the criminal trial afforded full safeguards and respect for due process and 
</p>
<p>guaranteed the two men a full and proper defence.  The trial was not vitiated by any criminal 
or legal errors and thus met the conditions stipulated in article 6 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Egypt is a party.

<b> 
Letter of allegation sent on 11 April 2006 
</b> 
I would like to draw the attention of your Government to reports I have received concerning 
several incidents of summary executions allegedly carried out by security forces in the Ogaden 
in the course of the year 2005.  
 
According to the information received, on 29 June 2005, in Shilaabo, Ogaden, your 
Government&#8217;s armed forces opened fire on a group of civilians listening to BBC Somali Service 
in a teashop. There would appear to have been no reason for the use of force except that they 
were listening to an interview with a member of the Ogaden National Libertaion Front (ONLF). 
The armed forces killed six persons, among them reportedly <b>Ali Adan dhorre, Hurre Ali Barre, 
Hassan Faqid Dhuhul</b> and <b>Sahardid Abdi Ali Horor</b>, and wounded others, including Ms. 
Jamila Aden, the owner of the teashop. 
 
It is further alleged that on 26 October 2005 in Farmadow, Ogaden, your Government&#8217;s armed 
forces killed seven civilians, <b>Abide Aided Adair, Ahmed-Wail Mohamed Betel, Abide Hay be </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 125 
 
<b>Ali, Mohamed Seabee, Wail Omar Gabled, Anise Abide Sofa Made </b>and<b> Burial Abide Rabbi</b>, 
and wounded fifteen others. Reportedly, the killing was unprovoked and the authorities have not 
provided any reason for the use of lethal force. 
 
On 15 November 2005, a jail break reportedly occurred at Birgaydhka barracks detention camp, 
in Qabridaharre, Ogaden. Among the fugitives were both members of the ONLF and prisoners 
not affiliated with the ONLF. Your Government&#8217;s armed forces reportedly opened fire on a 
crowd that included by-standers and prevented assistance for those wounded by opening fire also 
on rescuers. More than twenty persons died as a result, including <b>Abdullahi Ahmed Aqib, 
Abdullahi Gani Ali, Abdiaziz Muhumed, Abdullahi Ahmed Mohamed, Yusuf Mohamed 
Adan, Asad Mohamed Abdullahi, Bashi Mohamed Hassan, Mohamed Mohamed, 
Abdirahman Hared Alaki, Geesh Olad, Anwar Sheikh, Arab Garwah, Amin Mohamed 
Abdullahi, Siyad Irgah, Bashi Hassan, Rage Moalim, Abdi Wali</b>. The authorities left the dead 
bodies on display for two days. 
 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, I would like to refer Your 
Excellency's Government to the fundamental principles applicable to such incidents under 
international law. Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides 
that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. As the Human Rights Committee has 
clarified, &#8220;arbitrarily&#8221; means in a manner &#8220;disproportionate to the requirements of law 
enforcement in the circumstances of the case&#8221; (Views of the Committee in the case Su&#225;rez de 
Guerrero v. Colombia, Communication no. 45/1979, &#167; 13.3). In order to assess whether the use 
of lethal force was proportionate to the requirements of law enforcement, there must be a 
&#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective 
Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This principle 
was reiterated by the 61st session of the Commission on Human Rights in Resolution 2005/34 on 
&#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;the 
obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Commission added that this obligation 
includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate 
compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary 
measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to &#8230; prevent the recurrence of such 
executions&#8221;.  
 
It is my understanding that there are in the Ogaden occasional clashes between governmental 
armed forces and the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF). Insofar as your Government 
was to consider that there is an armed conflict in course in the Ogaden justifying the use of lethal 
force in accordance with international humanitarian law, I would like to recall that international 
humanitarian law requires parties to an armed conflict to distinguish at all times between 
combatants and civilians, and to direct attacks only against combatants (Rules 1 and 7 of the 
Customary Rules of International Humanitarian Law identified by the International Committee 
of the Red Cross); acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror 
among the civilian population are prohibited (Rule 2); and launching an attack which may be 
expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or 
a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military 
advantage anticipated, is prohibited (Rule 14).

</b>El Relator Especial lamenta que el Gobierno de Guatemala no haya cooperado con el mandato 
otorgado al Relator Especial por la Asamblea General y la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos.<b> 
 
Llamamiento urgente del 10 de febrero de 2006 
 
</b>Quisiera se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente de su Gobierno la informaci&#243;n que he recibido relativa al 
ataque armado a manos de la polic&#237;a en contra de dos travest&#237;s profesionales del sexo, a saber 
<b>Kevin Robles, alias Sulma</b>, y <b>Juan Pablo M&#233;ndez Cartagena, alias Paulina</b>.  
</p>
<p> 
De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, en la madrugada del 17 de diciembre Sulma y 
Paulina se encontraban en la zona 1 de la ciudad de Guatemala, en la intersecci&#243;n entre la 
Cuarta Avenida y la Calle 11, cuando cuatro hombres en motocicleta, que seg&#250;n testigos 
llevaban uniformes de la polic&#237;a, les ordenaron que se detuvieran, y luego dispararon 
contra ellas. Paulina recibi&#243; dos disparos en la cabeza, y muri&#243; minutos despu&#233;s. Sulma 
recibi&#243; tres disparos, pero sobrevivi&#243;. Se encuentra en estado grave pero estable en el 
hospital. Habla con dificultad, pues, seg&#250;n los informes, una de las balas le destroz&#243; 
todos los dientes superiores. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

</p>
<p>Sulma y Paulina colaboraban desde a&#241;os con la Organizaci&#243;n de Apoyo a una 
Sexualidad Integral frente al SIDA (OASIS), organizaci&#243;n que trabaja para prevenir el 
VIH/sida y presta apoyo a lesbianas, gays, bisexuales y personas transg&#233;nero. Paulina 
hab&#237;a empezado a trabajar como empleada asalariada de OASIS en 2004, y desde 
entonces s&#243;lo hab&#237;a tenido que ganar dinero ocasionalmente como profesional del sexo. 
</p>
<p> 
OASIS ha pedido protecci&#243;n especial para Sulma, ya que agentes de la polic&#237;a est&#225;n 
patrullando las calles cerca del lugar donde se produjeron los disparos, en un aparente 
esfuerzo para intimidar a los testigos. Informes indican que la Procuradur&#237;a de los 
Derechos Humanos transmiti&#243; dicha solicitud al Ministerio de Gobernaci&#243;n. Sin 
embargo, hasta la fecha no se ha tomado ninguna medida de seguridad a favor de Sulma.  
 
Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, requiero al Gobierno de su 
Excelencia que protege con efecto inmediato a Sulma y que aparte de sus puestos a todos 
los agentes implicados en las amenazas y homicidios. Adem&#225;s, solicito al Gobierno que 
me informe sobre los progresos realizados en las investigaciones sobre el asesinato y el 
ataque en contra de Paulina y Sulma.  
 
</p>
<p>Es mi responsabilidad de acuerdo con el mandato que me ha entregado la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos 
Humanos y reforzado por las resoluciones pertinentes de la Asamblea General, intentar

espera informaci&#243;n sobre los resultados de las investigaciones mencionadas en dicha respuesta. 
 
<b>Llamamiento urgente del 27 de octubre de 2006 
</b> 
Quisiera llamar la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre la informaci&#243;n que he recibido con relaci&#243;n a 
las amenazas de muerte en contra del abogado y defensor de los derechos humanos <b>Maynor 
Roberto Berganza Betancourt</b>, que encontr&#233; durante mi visita a Guatemala entre el 21 y 25 de 
Agosto de este a&#241;o. 
 
De acuerdo a la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 22 de Agosto, el Sr. Berganza Bethancourt recibi&#243; una 
llamada telef&#243;nica en la que un desconocido le dijo: &quot;dej&#233;monos de rodeos, pertenezco a una 
banda del crimen organizado y nos contrataron para matarlo&quot;. El Sr. Berganza colg&#243; el tel&#233;fono 
pero seg&#250;n m&#237;s fuentes, unos minutos despu&#233;s el mismo desconocido volvi&#243; a llamar y a&#241;adi&#243;: 
&quot;as&#237; como nos bajamos al gobernador as&#237; te vamos a bajar a vos. Ahora te vamos a ir a sacar de 
donde est&#225;s, porque te tenemos controlado&quot;.  
</p>
<p> 
Seg&#250;n se me ha informado, el 24 de Agosto, un desconocido llam&#243; al celular del Sr. Berganza 
Bethancourt y lo amenaz&#243; dici&#233;ndole: &quot;Si no quiere a su familia, hay dos personas que est&#225;n 
conmigo que me est&#225;n pidiendo que les demos agua&quot;. Ese mismo d&#237;a un desconocido habr&#237;a 
entrado a la oficina del Sr. Berganza Bethancourt. Cuando se le cuestion&#243; sobre el motivo de su 
visita, el hombre mostr&#243; un carnet de miembro del &quot;Comit&#233; Central de Acci&#243;n&quot;. Al pregunt&#225;rsele 
d&#243;nde estaba ubicada la sede de la organizaci&#243;n, el hombre respondi&#243; que en &quot;La Casa 
Presidencial&quot; e inmediatamente se fue de la oficina. 
</p>
<p> 
A trav&#233;s de una carta enviada el 7 de septiembre de 2006, el Relator Especial sobre la 
independencia de magistrados y abogados y el Representante Especial del Secretario-General 
para los defensores de los derechos humanos, informaron al Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre 
algunas de las amenazas de muerte que ven&#237;a recibiendo el Sr. Berganza Betancourt y 
respetuosamente solicitaron que se les informara sobre las medidas adoptadas para garantizar su 
integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica.  
</p>
<p> 
Sin embargo, teniendo en cuenta que las amenazas de muerte en contra del Sr. Berganza 
contin&#250;an y que hasta la fecha no hemos recibido ninguna respuesta por parte de su Gobierno 
con relaci&#243;n a este caso,  deseo expresar mi inquietud por la seguridad del Sr. Berganza 
Bethancurt, e informar con profunda preocupaci&#243;n que las amenazas descritas en la presente 
carta podr&#237;an estar  ligadas a la entrevista personal que el Sr. Berganza Bethancout sostuvo 
conmigo, en mi calidad de Relator Especial para las ejecuciones extrajudiciales sumarias o 
arbitrarias, durante mi visita a Guatemala entre el 21 y 25 de Agosto de este a&#241;o.  
</p>
<p> 
Teniendo en cuenta la urgencia del caso, agradecer&#237;a recibir del Gobierno de su Excelencia una 
respuesta sobre las acciones emprendidas para garantizar la seguridad del Sr. Berganza 
Bethancourt y su familia, la investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva e imparcial de las amenazas en su contra, y </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 129 
 
la imposici&#243;n de sanciones adecuadas a cualquier persona responsable de las violaciones 
alegadas. 
</p>
<p> 
Asimismo, quisiera llamar la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre las siguientes normas y principios 
que son particularmente significativos con respecto a las denuncias mencionadas 
precedentemente: 
</p>
<p> 
- Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones 
</p>
<p>extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 de 24 de mayo de 1989 del Consejo 
Econ&#243;mico y Social. En particular, los principios 4 y 9 a 19 obligan a los Gobiernos a garantizar 
una protecci&#243;n eficaz, judicial o de otro tipo, a los particulares y grupos que est&#233;n en peligro de 
ejecuci&#243;n extralegal, arbitraria o sumaria, en particular a aquellos que reciban amenazas de 
muerte. Los Gobiernos deben proceder a una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de 
todos los casos en que haya sospecha de tales ejecuciones o amenazas; publicar en un informe 
las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; y velar por que sean juzgadas las personas que la 
investigaci&#243;n haya identificado como participantes en tales ejecuciones, en cualquier territorio 
bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p> 
- Principios b&#225;sicos sobre la funci&#243;n de los abogados, adoptados por el Octavo 
</p>
<p>Congreso de las Naciones Unidas sobre Prevenci&#243;n del Delito y Tratamiento del Delincuente, La 
Habana, 27 de agosto a 7 de septiembre de 1990. Seg&#250;n los principios 16 y 17, los gobiernos 
garantizar&#225;n que los abogados puedan desempe&#241;ar todas sus funciones profesionales sin 
intimidaciones, obst&#225;culos, acosos o interferencias indebidas y sin sufrir, ni estar expuestos a 
persecuciones o sanciones administrativas, econ&#243;micas o de otra &#237;ndole. Cuando la seguridad de 
los abogados sea amenazada a ra&#237;z del ejercicio de sus funciones, recibir&#225;n de las autoridades 
protecci&#243;n adecuada. 
</p>
<p> 
Adem&#225;s, deseo llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre la resoluci&#243;n 1994/70, 
adoptada por la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos el 9 de marzo de 1994, la cual pide a los 
Gobiernos, entre otras cosas, que se abstengan de todo acto de intimidaci&#243;n o represalia contra 
particulares y grupos que traten de cooperar o hayan cooperado con representantes de los 
&#243;rganos de las Naciones Unidas, prestando testimonio ante ellas, proporcion&#225;ndoles informaci&#243;n, 
vali&#233;ndose de los procedimientos establecidos bajo los auspicios de las Naciones Unidas para la 
protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales y present&#225;ndoles 
comunicaciones, o prestando asistencia jur&#237;dica con tal fin. Seg&#250;n esta resoluci&#243;n, tambi&#233;n deben 
ser protegidos los parientes de v&#237;ctimas de violaciones de los derechos humanos. 
</p>
<p> 
De acuerdo con el mandato que me ha entregado la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos, mandato 
reforzado por las resoluciones pertinentes de la Asamblea General, es mi responsabilidad intentar 
conseguir clarificaci&#243;n sobre los hechos llevados a mi atenci&#243;n.  En mi deber de informar sobre 
esos casos al Consejo de Derechos Humanos, estar&#237;a muy agradecido de tener su cooperaci&#243;n y 
sus observaciones sobre los asuntos siguientes:

Quisiera llamar la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre la informaci&#243;n que he recibido con relaci&#243;n a la 
muerte del Sr. <b>Florent&#237;n Gudiel Ramos</b> y a las amenazas contra su familia. 
 
Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el d&#237;a 20 de diciembre de 2004 a las diez de la ma&#241;ana el Sr. 
Gudiel se dirig&#237;a en bicicleta a su casa, ubicada en la Municipalidad de Santa Luc&#237;a 
Cotzumalguapa. Trescientos metros antes de llegar a su casa fue interceptado por hombres 
armados en una camioneta gris con vidrios polarizados, quienes le dispararon por la espalda con 
una escuadra 9mm. Cuando el Sr. Gudiel hizo un esfuerzo por levantarse, uno de los hombres le 
puso el pie en el pecho, le dispar&#243; en la sien izquierda y luego procedi&#243; a dispararle un tiro de 
gracia.  Despu&#233;s de estos tiros, uno de los atacantes dispar&#243; varios tiros al aire.   
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 132 
 
Durante los ritos del velorio y en los d&#237;as siguientes la familia y los amigos de la v&#237;ctima 
recibieron varias amenazas.  Alrededor de las nueve de la noche del d&#237;a del ataque, una presunta 
patrulla de siete militares encabezados por &#8220;Kaibil&#8221; lleg&#243; en una camioneta blanca sin placas y se 
apostaron frente de la casa del Sr. Gudiel. Uno de los presuntos soldados, portando un rifle con 
mira telesc&#243;pica, se subi&#243; un &#225;rbol.  En otro d&#237;a, durante el rezo de la novena, un coche rojo con 
hombres armados y vistiendo playeras del Frente Republicano Guatemalteco (FRG), se apost&#243; 
frente a la casa.  Las personas que participaban en los rezos empezaron a recibir amenazas 
indicando que sufrir&#237;an la misma suerte que el Sr. Gudiel. Los miembros de la familia del Sr. 
Gudiel, en particular su hija, Sra. <b>Makrina Gudiel Alvarez</b>, tambi&#233;n recibieron mensajes 
indicando que deben huir.  Al t&#233;rmino de la novena, el 29 de diciembre, la familia dej&#243; sus casas 
en compa&#241;&#237;a de la Polic&#237;a Municipal de Tr&#225;nsito de Santa Luc&#237;a Cotzumalguapa. 
 
Se teme que el homicidio y las amenazas puedan estar ligados al trabajo de Sr. Gudiel y su hija.  
Sr. Gudiel fue involucrado en varios esfuerzos escolares y comunitarios.  Tambi&#233;n, junto con su 
familia, hab&#237;a estado buscando justicia ante la desaparici&#243;n forzada de su hijo Jos&#233; Miguel 
Gudiel &#193;lvarez, y quince d&#237;as antes de su muerte hab&#237;a ido a dejar los &#250;ltimos papeles para 
completar su expediente. La Sra. Gudiel est&#225; involucrada en movimientos sociales y fue oficial y 
candidata de la Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG).  Ella tambi&#233;n ha 
participado en la elaboraci&#243;n del expediente de su hermano. 
 
En estas circunstancias, y sin implicar de antemano una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, hago un 
llamado al  Gobierno de Su Excelencia para que me proporcione informaci&#243;n detallada sobre las 
medidas adoptadas para garantizar la investigaci&#243;n de las violaciones mencionadas en esta carta, 
as&#237; como el procesamiento y castigo de las personas responsables de dichas violaciones. 
 
A este respecto, me gustar&#237;a llamar la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre art&#237;culo 2 del Pacto 
Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos, que provee que los Estados partes deben &#8220;respetar 
y garantizar a todos los individuos que se encuentren en su territorio y est&#233;n sujetos a su 
jurisdicci&#243;n los derechos reconocidos en el presente Pacto,&#8221; incluyendo el derecho a la vida.  
Seg&#250;n esta obligaci&#243;n general, los Estados deben investigar, enjuiciar y castigar efectivamente 
cualquiera privaci&#243;n arbitraria de la vida. (V&#233;ase Comit&#233; de Derechos Humanos,<i> Arhuacos v.

</b> 
Quisiera llamar la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre la informaci&#243;n que he recibido con relaci&#243;n a la 
muerte del Sr. <b>Adilio Darinel Domingo</b>.  
 
Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el 21 de enero de 2006, el Sr. Adilio Darinel Domingo 
Montejo sali&#243; de su casa, ubicada en la Colonia Alioto L&#243;pez de Villa Nueva, Guatemala, y no 
regres&#243;. Su cuerpo fue encontrado por uno de sus hermanos el 26 de enero, en la morgue de 
Amatitl&#225;n.  Presentaba severas se&#241;ales de tortura, degollado y con ambas piernas cercenadas a la 
altura de la ingle. S&#243;lo una de sus piernas fue encontrada al momento del hallazgo del cuerpo.  
La otra fue encontrada una semana despu&#233;s, cerca de un barranco, en la zona 12 capitalina. 
 
Dadas las condiciones, parece obvio que el Sr. Montejo fue asesinado por razones ajenas a la 
delincuencia com&#250;n, y se teme que este homicidio pueda estar relacionado con el trabajo de uno 
de sus hermanos, el Sr. Mario Gonzalo Domingo Montejo, que act&#250;a como Coordinador del &#193;rea 
de Defensa de la Dignidad Humana, de la Oficina de Derechos Humanos del Arzobispo de 
Guatemala.  Dentro de las actividades realizadas por &#233;sta Oficina, resaltan las investigaciones y 
el proceso del caso por el caso del Monse&#241;or Juan Jos&#233; Gerardi Conedera ocurrida el 26 de abril 
de 1998. El juicio para esclarecer la muerte del Monse&#241;or Gerardo Conedera concluy&#243; el 7 de 
junio del a&#241;o 2001, con sentencia para cuatro personas: el coronel Byron Disrael Lima Estrada, 
el capit&#225;n Byron Miguel Lima Oliva, el especialista del Ej&#233;rcito Jos&#233; Obdulio Villanueva 
Ar&#233;valo, y el sacerdote Mario Lionel Orantes N&#225;jera, los tres primeros como autores del delito 
de ejecuci&#243;n extrajudicial, y el &#250;ltimo por complicidad del mismo.  La sentencia fue modificada 
en marzo de 2005, en donde se les endilg&#243;, a todos, como c&#243;mplices del delito de ejecuci&#243;n 
extrajudicial. El expediente fue elevado ante la Corte Suprema de Justicia por interposici&#243;n del </p>

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur appreciates the preliminary information provided by the Government of 
India with respect to the incident in Orissa and will request the report of the commission of 
inquiry that was established.  The Special Rapporteur would also note that he has received no 
clairification of the incident in Assam. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation dated 22 August 2006 
</b> 
I would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to information I have 
received regarding two incidents in which lethal force was allegedly used against protesters.  In 
the first incident, <b>three university students</b> were killed by the police on 23 December 2005 in 
Assam while protesting the alleged sexual molestation of their fellow students by police on a 
train.  In the second incident, <b>twelve tribal people</b> were shot and killed by the police on 2 
January 2006 while demonstrating against the construction of a Tata Steel plant in Kalinga 
Nagar in Orissa.  It has been alleged that the use of lethal force was not justified under the 
circumstances. 
 
If these allegations were correct, there would be ground for serious concern. Therefore, while I 
do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I would like to draw the attention of 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental principles set forth in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).  Article 6 of the ICCPR provides that every 
individual has the right to life, that this right shall be protected by law and that no one shall be 
arbitrarily deprived of his or her life.  The U.N. Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms by Law 
Enforcement Officials applies this standard to the policing of unlawful public assemblies.  These 
principles explain that to disperse a violent protest or assembly, law enforcement officials may 
only use firearms when less dangerous means are not practicable and only to the minimum extent 
necessary (&#167;14).  In all circumstances, the intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 137 
 
when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life (&#167;9) and after a clear warning of the intention to 
use firearms has been provided (&#167;10).  
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly to seek to clarify all such 
cases brought to my attention.  Since I am expected to report on these cases to the Commission, I 
would be grateful for your cooperation and observations on the following matters: 
</p><p> 
1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any police investigation, and

3. Please provide the full details of any disciplinary action and prosecution undertaken with 
</p>
<p>regard to the police officers responsible for the above mentioned shootings.

homes for setting up industrial complexes. The displaced persons had been agitating for some time 
against the low compensation rate given by the State Government as compared to the sale price

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of India has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
<b> 
Letter of allegation dated 17 October 2006 
 
</b>I would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government attention, information I have received 
concerning the alleged extrajudicial execution of Mr. <b>Longjam Surjit</b>, a resident of Samurou 
Makha Leikai within the jurisdiction of Wangoi police station of Imphal West District, Manipur.  
 
According to the information received, on 31 August 2006, Mr. Longjam Surjit was killed by the 
officers from the 22 Maratha Light Infantry, based at Mayang, Imphal, Manipur. It is alleged that 
Surjit was shot dead by the army when he went out looking for his missing horse with his friend 
Mr. Naorem Brajamani. According to our source, they went separate ways looking for the horse 
by the banks of the river Nabul, when Mr. Brajamani heard shots coming from the direction in </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 139 
 
which Surgit had gone. Scared of the shots Mr. Brajamani ran back home. The next morning Mr. 
Surjit was found dead.  
 
The army reportedly claimed responsibility for the killing and affirmed they had to shoot at Mr. 
Surjit because he tried to open fire on the army officers. The army also claimed they had found 
arms and ammunitions in Surjit&#8217;s possession, a possibility that his family has denied. 
 
During a public meeting which local residents organized, it was decided that Surgit&#8217;s family 
would not claim his body from the mortuary, unless there was an independent investigation into 
this case. During the meeting, the local residents reportedly claimed that security forces often 
executed alleged militants of secessionists groups instead of bringing them to trial, and affirmed 
that most of those summarily executed are falsely reported to have died during armed clashes 
between the army and militants in &quot;encounter killings.&quot; According to our sources, this situation is 
linked to the fact that the Armed Forces (Special Power) Act, 1958 is in force in this area. 
 
In a letter dated 24 August 2005, I had previously raised with your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
information I had received concerning alleged extra-judicial executions in Manipur. On that 
occasion, I suggested that the (Special Power) Act, 1958 violates non-derogable provisions of 
international human rights law and can thus facilitate the perpetration of extrajudicial executions, 
by giving the security forces the power to shoot to kill in circumstances where members of the 
security forces are not necessarily at imminent risk. Furthermore, the Act provides that no person 
can start legal action against any member of the armed forces for anything done under the Act or 
purported to be done under the Act, without permission of the Central Government which, I 
understand, is rarely given. Prosecutions of security force personnel, even where the facts are 
well established, have apparently been rare.    
 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I respectfully request that your 
Government ensures that the death of Mr.<b> </b>Longjam Surjit is promptly, independently and 
thoroughly investigated, in accordance with the United Nations principles on the effective 
prevention and investigation of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions.  
 
In this connection, I would like to recall the principle whereby all States have &#8220;the obligation 
(&#8230;) to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;, as recently reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human 
Rights in Resolution 2005/34 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4). The 
Commission added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice 
those responsible, (&#8230;) to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or 
their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order 
to (&#8230;) prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;.  
 
Furthermore, I would like to refer Your Excellency's Government to Article 6 of the 
<i>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)</i> which provides that every 
individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be protected by law 
and that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life.  
 
In its General Comment on Article 6, the Human Rights Committee has observed &#8220;that States 
parties should take measures not only to prevent and punish deprivation of life by criminal acts, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 140 
 
but also to prevent arbitrary killing by their own security forces. The deprivation of life by the 
authorities of the State is a matter of the utmost gravity. Therefore, the law must strictly control 
and limit the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of his life by such authorities.&quot; 
 
Both Article 4(2) of the <i>ICCPR</i> and Principle 8 of the <i>Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms 
by Law Enforcement Officials </i>provide that exceptional circumstances such as internal political 
instability or any other public emergency may not be invoked to justify any derogation from the 
right to life and security of the person. Besides, Article 3 of the <i>Code of Conduct for Law 
Enforcement Officials</i> provides that law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly 
necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty. 
 
In this connection, I would like to urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to consider either 
repealing the (Special Power ) Act, 1958 or ensuring that it and any other such future legislative 
measures comply fully with international human rights and humanitarian law treaties to which 
India is a state party, especially the ICCPR and the four Geneva Conventions.  In the 
interpretation of these obligations full account should be taken of the detailed standards included 
in the <i>UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials</i>, the <i>Principles on the Effective 
Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions</i>, and the <i>UN 
Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances</i>. 
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human Rights Council and 
reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all such 
cases brought to my attention.  Since I am expected to report on these cases to the Council I 
would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following six matters: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
 
2. Has a complaint been lodged? 
 
3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of India has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
<b> 
Letter of allegation dated 30 October 2006 
 
</b>We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received 
concerning Mr. <b>Saju</b>, a private bus conductor who reportedly died from custodial torture for 
refusing to pay bribes to police officers in Kerala state. 
 
According to the information received, on 8 September 2006, Mr. Saju was taken into custody 
by three police officers from Kunnathunadu police station, on an allegation that he was involved 
in the theft of three telephone posts. According to our sources the posts had been abandoned by 
the Kunnathunadu telephone office on the road near Mr. Saju&#8217;s home, and he picked them up 
and used them as a protective barricade around an open well so that children and animals would 
not fall into the well.  
 
The police officers reportedly told Mr. Saju he had to give them 3000 rupees (68 USD) if he 
wanted to be released, money that Mr. Saju refused to pay. Reports indicate that Mr. Aliyar, a 
person who was also taken into custody by the police officers in connection with the same crime, 
was released by the police after he accepted to bribe the police officers. 
 
On 9 August 2006, at about 3:00 pm Mr. Saju&#8217;s wife went to Kunnathunadu police station to 
visit her husband who told her that he had been tortured because he refused to pay a bribe to the 
police officers. Ms. Saju returned home and at about 4:30 pm she received a call informing her 
that Mr. Saju was at the Kolenchery Medical College. At the hospital she was informed that her 
husband died at the police station. A doctor asked her whether Mr. Saju had any previous 
ailments. Ms Saju said her husband was perfectly healthy and that he had complained about the 
police torturing him while he was held in custody.  
 
 Without in any way implying any conclusion as to the facts of the case, we respectfully request 
that your Government ensures that the death of Mr.<b> </b>Saju<b> </b>is promptly, independently and 
thoroughly investigated, in accordance with the United Nations principles on the effective 
prevention and investigation of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions.  
 
 In this connection, we would like to recall the principle whereby all States have &#8220;the obligation 
(&#8230;) to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;, as recently reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human 
Rights in Resolution 2005/34 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4). The 
Commission added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice 
those responsible, (&#8230;) to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or 
their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order 
to (&#8230;) prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;.

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

 Furthermore, we would like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to articles 12 and 7 of the 
Convention against Torture. Article 12 requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt 
and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been 
committed, and article 7 requires State parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture.  We 
would also like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to paragraph 3 of Resolution 2005/39 of the 
Commission on Human Rights. Paragraph 3 stresses that &#8220;all allegations of torture or other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment must be promptly and impartially examined by 
the competent national authority, that those who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of 
torture must be held responsible and severely punished, including the officials in charge of the 
place of detention where the prohibited act is found to have been committed, and takes note in 
this respect of the Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Principles) as a 
useful tool in efforts to combat torture;&#8221;.   
 
It is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly and extended by the

<b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Indonesia has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
<b> 
Urgent appeal sent on 3 May 2006</b> with the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and counter 
terrorism <b> 
</b> 
In this connection, we would like to draw your attention to information we have received 
regarding three men who are reportedly at imminent risk of execution: Mr. <b>Amrozi bin H. 
Nurhasyim</b>, Mr. <b>Ali Ghufron</b> alias <b>Mukhlas</b>, and Mr. <b>Imam Samudera</b>.  
</p>
<p> 
Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and Imam Samudera have been found 
guilty of involvement in the 12 October 2002 bombings on the island of Bali, which killed 202 
people and injured a further 209. They were sentenced to death by the Denpasar District Court 
between August and October 2003. The men and their families have declined to seek a pardon 
from the President. On 14 April 2006, the Attorney General&#8217;s office stated that the refusal to 
seek clemency would mean that they have exhausted all the legal remedies available to them and 
that, as a result, they would be executed immediately. On 25 April 2006, the Bali Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office announced that it has &quot;completed preparations&quot; for the execution and stated that it was 
waiting for the Attorney General&#8217;s order to proceed with the executions. 
</p>
<p> 
It is our understanding that on 18 October 2002, six days after the Bali bombing, President 
Megawati issued two &#8220;'Government Regulations in lieu of law&#8221; (Peraturan Pemerintah Pengganti 
Undang-Undang, or &#8220;Perpus&#8221;), Perpus 1/2002 and 2/2002. Perpu 1/2002 provides that an act of 
terrorism, or the planning of or assisting in an act of terrorism, is punishable by death. Section 46 
allows for its retroactive application if this is authorised by another Perpu or law. Perpu 2/2002 
authorised that retroactive application &#8220;in relation to the [Bali] bombing incident&#8221;. Perpus 1/2002 
and 2/2002 were subsequently approved by Parliament in March 2003 and converted into the 
Law on Combating Criminal Acts of Terrorism 15/2003. We have further been informed that on 
23 July 2004, the Constitutional Court has ruled that the retroactive application of Perpu 1/2002 
(i.e. Law 15/2003) violates Article 28I (1) of the Constitution and is therefore unconstitutional.  
 
International law does not prohibit the death penalty <i>per se</i> as automatically violating the rights 
to life, but it mandates that it must be applied in the most restrictive manner. It is therefore 
crucial that all restrictions pertaining to capital punishment contained in international human 
rights law are fully respected in proceedings relating to capital offences. One such fundamental 
guarantee is that &#8220;the death penalty may be imposed only &#8230; in accordance with the law in force 
at the time of the commission of the crime&#8221; (Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Indonesia has become a party on 23 February 2006). This 
provision reinforces with regard to capital punishment the general principle that &#8220;[n]o one shall 
be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute 
a criminal offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was committed. Nor 
shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time when the criminal 
offence was committed.&#8221; (Article 15 ICCPR). We note that this principle is also enshrined in the 
Constitution of Indonesia, which in Article 28I(1) provides that &#8220;the right not to be prosecuted 
under retrospective laws [is a] basic human right that may not be diminished under any </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 144 
 
circumstances at all.&#8221; All of these provisions, or at least their core, represent universal standards 
and customary international law. Moreover, Article 4(2) ICCPR provides that the right to life as 
enshrined in Article 6 and the protection against retroactive criminal legislation in Article 15 are 
among those rights that cannot be derogated from even &#8220;[i]n time of public emergency which 
threatens the life of the nation&#8221;. 
 
While we fully recognize your Government&#8217;s right and duty to forcefully combat heinous acts of 
terrorism such as those the three above-named men have been found to be complicit in, we recall 
that the fight against terrorism must be conducted within the framework of international law. In 
particular, we would like to recall UN GA Resolution 60/158 of 28 February 2006, which in its 
paragraph 1, stresses that &#8220;States must ensure that any measure to combat terrorism complies 
with their obligation under international law, in particular international human right, refugee and 
humanitarian law&#8221; 
 
If the information we have received is correct, it would appear that the death sentence against 
Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and Imam Samudera is not compatible 
with Article 6(2) and Article 15 of the ICCPR. We accordingly urge your Government not to 
proceed to their execution until all doubts in this respect have been dispelled. In view of the 
urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government. 
</p>
<p> 
Moreover, it our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on Human 
Rights and reinforced by the appropriate resolution of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify 
all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on this case to the Human 
Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. Are the facts presented in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 
2. Please explain the grounds on which your Excellency&#8217;s Government intends to proceed 
with the execution of Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and Imam 
Samudera notwithstanding Article 28I(1) of the Constitution, the ruling of the Constitutional 
Court and your Government&#8217;s obligations under Articles 6(2) and 15 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

Letter of allegation dated 22 August 2006 
</b> 
I would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to information I have 
received regarding lethal force used against school children.  According to this information, <b>four 
students</b> were shot dead by Indonesian security forces in the village of Waghete in West Papua 
and a fifth was injured.  One of these students was Moses Douw, age 15, who was a close 
relative of one of the 43 refugees who landed at Cape York in Australia in a few days earlier. I 
have also received information stating that according to Indonesian authorities, only one student 
was killed and two others were injured, and that the incident was caused by a violent clash 
between civilians and police. 
 
Therefore, while I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I would like to draw 
the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the relevant human rights standards.  The U.N. 
Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials provide that, even in the 
context of a violent protest or assembly, law enforcement officials may only use firearms when 
less dangerous means are not practicable and only to the minimum extent necessary (&#167;14).  In all 
circumstances, the intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable 
in order to protect life (&#167;9) and only after a clear warning of the intention to use firearms must be 
provided (&#167;10). 
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights

The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of Indonesia.   
 
The SR regrets, however, that the information provided is not responsive to several of the issues 
that require clarification.  In particular, the SR would renew his request for (1) a copy of the final 
report and recommendations of the Presidential Fact-Finding team established in December 2004 
as well as a copy of the 3 October decision of the Indonesian Supreme Court overturning 
Pollycarpus&#8217; conviction, (2) information on the current status of legal proceedings against 
individuals additional to Pollycarpus, and (3) information on why key recommendations of the 
Presidential Fact-Finding team appear to have been ignored by the police and the attorney 
general&#8217;s office. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation dated 30 November 2006 
</b> 
I wish to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s attention information I have received regarding the recent 
decision of the Indonesian Supreme Court to acquit the only person convicted for the murder of 
<b>Munir Said Thalib</b>, a leading human rights activist, despite reported evidence of a conspiracy 
involving many suspects, some of whom are high-ranking intelligence officers.  
 
According to the information I have received, Munir died of poisoning on Garuda flight 974 
from Singapore to Amsterdam on 6 September 2004.  This was investigated by an independent 
fact-finding team, <i>Tim Pencari Fakta</i> (TPF), established by presidential decree on 23 December 
2004. However, I understand that the key recommendations and findings of the TPF have been 
ignored. Reportedly, the TPF identified Pollycarpus Budihari Priyanto, an off-duty co-pilot who 
was on Munir&#8217;s flight, as a primary suspect in the case. It also suggested the involvement of 
senior employees of the Garuda airline and of high-ranking intelligence officials in Munir&#8217;s 
death. 
</p>
<p> 
The trial of Pollycarpus opened 9 August 2005 at the Central Jakarta District Court. The primary 
charge was that he carried out, ordered, or joined in an intentional and premeditated killing, a 
crime under section 340 of the Indonesian Criminal Code. He was also charged with forgery 
under section 263, in connection with a series of internal Garuda letters enabling his presence on 
board. 
</p>
<p> 
Pollycarpus was convicted on both charges on 20 December 2005 by the Central Jakarta District 
Court and sentenced to 14 years in prison. The panel of judges noted in their verdict that the 
accused had not acted alone, and it was necessary to investigate who else had played a role in 
Munir&#8217;s death. Pollycarpus&#8217; sentence was upheld on appeal in March 2005. The murder charge 
was then overturned by the Supreme Court on 3 October 2006 due to insufficient evidence. 
Pollycarpus remains in prison on the forgery charge, but may soon be released. 
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, the effective investigation and prosecution of all persons 
responsible has been impeded by the failure of State Intelligence Agency officials to cooperate 
with investigations, by the lack of a vigorous effort by the police, and by the failure of the police 
to cooperate with the TPF. 
 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 147 
 
Beginning in March 2005, the TPF turned its attention to the State Intelligence Agency (<i>Badan 
Intelijen Negara</i>, or BIN). The primary evidence of a link between Pollycarpus and the agency 
was a series of phone calls between Pollycarpus&#8217; home and cell phone and an office phone and 
cell phone used by H. Muchdi Purwopranjono, a retired general who moved to BIN as Deputy V 
in 2001. The calls took place in the days around Munir&#8217;s death, and in the days after the autopsy 
results became public.  In June 2005 the TPF disclosed that it had found BIN documents 
describing four scenarios to kill Munir, including the use of poison.  
 
But BIN&#8217;s refusal to cooperate made it difficult to confirm the documents&#8217; authenticity. A chief 
obstacle was the lack of a mechanism or agreement to ensure access to BIN officials and 
documents. After several meetings with the president, on May 2, 2005 the parties signed a 
protocol in which BIN agreed to cooperate. The May 2 protocol led to interviews with six low-
ranking officials, but the information collected was incomplete and largely limited to general 
procedures.  
</p>
<p> 
Three senior officials refused to be interviewed: Muchdi, former BIN chief A.M. Hendropriyono 
and Col. Bambang Irawan (a retired Indonesian special forces officer who witnesses said was on 
the flight, but not the passenger list). These officials appeared to use delaying tactics until the 
TPF&#8217;s mandate ran out. Muchdi, Hendropriyono, and Irawan negotiated meetings and then failed 
to appear due to missed planes, unexpected travel, or other reasons. Hendropriyono was invited 
on three occasions, Muchdi four times, and Irawan twice. BIN also failed to provide numerous 
documents requested by TPF<b>.</b> 
 
The police investigation made little headway in building a case against Pollycarpus, and did not 
include an investigation of who planned and ordered the murder.  Although the Indonesian 
government reportedly learned from the Dutch as early as 28 October 2004, about the cause of 
death, few actions were taken until later that year, despite the need to preserve crime scene 
evidence and to prevent the routine deletion of phone records. The police did question airline 
employees, family members, and others who came into contact with Munir. After the TPF found 
links to Garuda and BIN, police interviewed officials from both institutions. However, the police 
interviews were mostly brief and insubstantial, and resulted in a single weak indictment. 
 
The police identified Pollycarpus as a suspect on 18 March 2005 and a warrant for his arrest and 
detention was issued the following day. No further action has been taken against other suspects, 
despite evidence and courtroom testimony indicating others&#8217; involvement. The TPF found 
evidence that two Garuda senior officials, Vice-President for Corporate Security Ramelgia 
Anwar, and Executive Director Indra Setiawan had assisted Pollycarpus through the provision of 
documents. Anwar and Secretary to the Chief of Pilots Rohainil Aini were summoned by the 
police for questioning in March 2005. The two crew members, Oedi Irianto and Yeti Susmiarti, 
were also questioned at police headquarters on April 6, 2005, and later named as suspects, but 
never indicted. 
 
Anwar and Aini were named in the forgery charges against Pollycarpus, and the two crew 
members were named in the murder charge. The participation of all four is described in the 
verdicts of the District Court and the Appeals Court. But police never submitted dossiers on 
either the crew members or the senior officials to prosecutors so that they could be charged.  
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 148 
 
For all of the above factors, the TPF concluded that the police team was unwilling, rather than 
unable to solve the crime. A recent reshuffle of the investigation team underscores the problem. 
On 12 September 2006 President Yudhoyono promised to &#8220;revitalize&#8221; the investigation under 
police Brig. General Suryadharma. But Suryadharma had already served that role and been 
replaced due to his inaction. 
 
I would like to commend your Excellency&#8217;s Government for establishing the TPF to conduct 
investigations into the killing of Munir Said Thalib. This is all the more important that, as your 
Excellency is aware, there are allegations that Munir &#8212;who was the director of the &#8220;Commission 
for Disappeared Persons and Victims of Violence (Kontras) and the director Jakarta-based 
human rights group imparsial &#8212; may have been targeted for his human rights activities, as 
suggested by evidence relating to the involvement of high-ranking intelligence officials in his 
death. 
</p>
<p> 
As you are aware, under human rights law, States have a legal duty to ensure as well as respect 
the right to life in all circumstances.  (<i>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</i>, Arts. 
2, 4, 6).  States are legally responsible for extrajudicial executions that are committed by 
Government agents or that are committed by persons or groups operating with official 
knowledge or acquiescence.  In addition, States are legally obligated to take all appropriate 
measures to deter, prevent and punish private persons and armed groups who commit 
extrajudicial executions.  These obligations require States to investigate &#8211; with a view to 
prosecution &#8211; alleged violations of the right to life promptly, thoroughly and effectively through 
independent and impartial bodies.  (CHR resolution 2004/37, paras. 4&#8211;6; Human Rights 
Committee, General Comment 31; E/CN.4/2005/7, paras. 65&#8211;76).  The obligation to investigate 
extrajudicial executions is not a pro forma requirement.  Depending on the manner in which it is 
conducted, an investigation either will play a critical role in ensuring the right to life in the face 
of violence or, instead, will contribute to impunity.   
</p>
<p> 
In light of the allegations received, I would like to call the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to particular aspects of the duty to investigate.   
 
Human rights law requires investigations to be conducted by independent and impartial bodies.  
(CHR resolution 2004/37, para. 5; Human Rights Committee, General Comment 31, para. 15).  
In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the 
standards provided by the <i>United Nations Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions</i>.  Principle 11 notes that normal 
investigative procedures may be inadequate when there are complaints regarding their 
impartiality and provides that in such circumstances, &#8220;Governments shall pursue investigations 
through an independent commission of inquiry or similar procedure&#8221;.  Regardless whether an 
investigation is conducted through established investigative procedures or through an 
independent commission of inquiry, interference by individuals who are potentially implicated 
must be prevented, the investigation&#8217;s report must be made public, and the Government must 
bring to justice those found responsible.  (Principles 15&#8211;18).  It is important to emphasize that 
measures taken to ensure an investigation&#8217;s independence and impartiality do not reflect any pre-
judgment of the allegations received in a particular case.  Independence and impartiality are 
required in all cases out of respect for the rule of law.

The principal responsibility for investigating a murder case undoubtedly belongs to the organs of 
a State&#8217;s domestic criminal justice organs.  However, there comes a point at which it may be 
necessary for national measures to be supplemented with international assistance.  In the case of 
Munir Said Thalib, this point has been reached, and I would respectfully suggest that the 
Government seeks international assistance in conducting the investigation into his murder. 
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention.  Without in any way wishing to pre-judge the 
accuracy of the information received, I would be grateful for a reply to the following questions: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2. Please provide a copy of the final report and recommendations of the Presidential Fact-
</p>
<p>Finding team established in December 2004 as well as a copy of the 3 October decision of 
the Indonesian Supreme Court overturning Pollycarpus&#8217; conviction.

<p> 3. What is the current status of legal proceedings against individuals whose names appear in: 
</p>
<p>(a) the indictment of Pollycarpus, (b) the District and Appeals&#8217; Court&#8217;s decision convicting 
Pollycarpus, and (c) media accounts of the TPF findings?  Do any of these individuals, 
including Garuda crew, Garuda officials, and BIN officials, remain under investigation? Are 
there any plans to charge them? 
</p>
<p>  
</p><p>4. Please explain why key recommendations of the Presidential Fact-Finding team appear to 
</p>
<p>have been ignored by the police and the attorney general&#8217;s office? Is your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government planning to establish an independent body to audit the police investigation and 
Attorney General&#8217;s response to Munir&#8217;s murder? 
</p>
<p> 
5. Are there any plans to request international technical assistance to further the investigation? 
 
<b>Response of the Government of Indonesia dated 19 January 2007 
</b> 
The Government provided the following clarifications on the case concerning Munir Said Thalib 
and Pollycarpus Budhari Priyanto. 
 
The Government of Indonesia must once again retiterates its commitment to the promotion and 
protection of human rights at all levels of society. The Government has, in this regard, taken 
various steps to ensure that the national human rights institutions adhere to constitutional 
modalities, as well as to ratified international conventions and national laws.  
 
There have in fact been numerous efforts undertaken on the part of the Government, working 
within Indonesia and in collaboration with various experts to shed some light into the precise 
sequence of events leading to Munir&#8217;s death and on the genuine culprits who have so far evaded 
justice. This has incited a great deal of speculation and allegations relating to the investigative 
process. The legal integrity of the judicial proceedings have been scrutinized with deep suspicion 
and questioned while attempts have been made to exert international pressure on the 
investigations. 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 150 
 
It must be understood that this process has been time consuming as layer upon layer of evidence 
has been gathered, verified and examined by various experts. At the same time this was 
happening, criminal proceedings whereby the main suspect in Munir&#8217;s death, Mr Pollycarpus 
Budihari Priyanto were being undertaken. The latter has since been prosecuted under the national 
judicial system, only to have yet again, question raised on the legal proceedings. 
 
On the judicial proceedngs indicting Mr. Priyanto, his case was taken to the central Jakarta 
district court and then to the supreme court, who by virtue of a case review later rules by 
majority on 3 October 2006, that his conviction for premeditated murder under article 340 of the 
KHUP could not be upheld as there was insufficient evidence and no testifying witnesses 
proving his culpability. However, the supreme court reaffirmed that Mr. Priyanto&#8217;s conviction 
for violating article 263, section 2 of the criminal code, on the falsification of documents would 
be upheld and they maintained his two-year jail sentence. 
 
The decision of the panel of judges is exempt from government interference. This is in 
accordance with law 14/1970, which clearly states that judges are independent and free from all 
influence emanating from governmental authorities. This independence is further reinforced by 
the Constitution, in which article 24 of the constitution of 1945, clearly guarantees that the 
judiciary is exempt from interference from the executive. In its decision-making process and 
while following the precepts of impartiality, the Supreme Court therefore also has the power to 
enforce law and justice as it deems fit. Nonetheless the legal proess has not been exhaustive 
since the possibility to reopen  the case, with new evidence, is still possible. Our understanding is 
that the police is currently in the process of drafting a response to the decision by the supreme 
court. 
 
On the international front, Indonesia has been working in collaboration with various international 
experts at various intervals from the beginning of this case. The President, as you may be aware, 
inititally set up an independent fact-finding team, the Tim Pencari Fakta (TPF) in December 
2004 (by virtue of Presidential decree 111/2004) with the task of establishing and compiling a 
report on their findings. At the time, a large number of witnesses were interviewed, including 
among others, the personnel of the national carrier, Garuda. The final conclusions and 
recommendations were later presented to the President in June 2005, which was within months 
of the conviction of Mr. Priyanto at the High Court level for the murder of Mr. Thalib. 
 
Since then, the Government of Indonesia has not discarded the possibility of international 
assistance in furthering its investigative processes. In actual fact, and according to the National 
Police Chief, general Sutanto, the government has most recently requested the help of the US 
Federal bureau of investigation and the Dutch Police who will be providing input into certain 
forensic matters. The Government is well aware that in its investigations, the police may require 
foreign technical assistance where there are no local experts in a certain field. In connection with 
this, the government is still trying to overcome some administrative difficulties in obtaining 
mutual legal assistance from the Dutch authorities, and technical difficulties in investigating 
video-data items from Singapore. 
 
Quite apart from these efforts, the President has also ordered another fact-finding team to 
recommence investigations into this case. The team will be headed by Brigadier General 
Suryadharma Nasution and the number of skilled investigators has also been increased. Contrary </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 151 
 
to some reports, the government has never replaced Brigadier General Suryadharma as chief of 
the investigation team. 
 
The cooperation of all the independent experts, police and intelligence forces has ensured that 
various witnesses and suspects, were questioned and/or detained on their possible involvement in 
this crime. The house of representatives has since endorsed recommendations that there should 
be new investigations by an independent investigative team into Munir&#8217;s murder. The President 
has reaffirmed that the legal process into Munir&#8217;s death has never stopped and efforts to find the 
culprits have been reinvigorated with the creation of the new investigative team that will follow 
up the results of the old investigation and also work on new leads. The police spokesman, 
inspector general purwoko affirmed in September 2006, that this new team would not only focus 
on information provided by Mr. priyanto but would also look for new evidence. 
 
Indeed, it has been the government&#8217;s task and focus for sometime now to uncover the 
masterminds behind this murder and who have for so long, have remained at large. Further, it 
should be clear that while this process may be painstakingly difficult, it in no way lessens the 
government&#8217;s commitment to human rights and justice, nor does it impige on the government&#8217;s 
intentions to honour its international obligations. In this regard, the usual law enforcement 
institutions should be left to carry out their normal functions of enquiry and prosecution, while 
the judicial institutions should be allowed to make rulings and prosecutions within the 
framework of national legal norms. 
 
<b>Islamic Republic of  Iran: Death Sentence of Rostam Tajik 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Non-respect of international standards relating to the imposition of capital 
punishment 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> 1 male (juvenile offender, foreign national) 
<b> 
Character of reply:</b> No response 
<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission 
on Human Rights. 
<b> 
Urgent appeal dated 8 December 2005 
</b> 
I would like to bring to the attention of Your Excellency&#8217;s Government the situation of <b>Rostam 
Tajik</b>, a 20-year-old Afghan national. He is scheduled for execution on 10 December 2005 for 
the May 2001 murder of Ms. Nafiseh Rafi'i, a crime he allegedly committed when he was less 
than 18 years old.  
</p>
<p> 
According to the information I have received, Rostom Tajik was an apprentice with Ms. Rafi&#8217;i&#8217;s 
husband. In May 2001, he reportedly went into the couple's house with the intention to burgle it. 
However, once inside, he killed Nafiseh Rafi&#8217;i and cut the throat of her 11-year-old daughter, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 152 
 
whose screams alerted the neighbours. Rostam Tajik fled the scene. The daughter was taken to 
the hospital for treatment where her life was saved. Rostam Tajik was later arrested in Qazvin, 
west of Tehran. He was sentenced to <i>qisas</i> (retribution specified by the victim's family) by 
Branch 9 of the General Court of Esfahan for the murder of Ms. Rafi'i. The sentence was 
reportedly upheld by the Supreme Court.  
</p>
<p>  
If the information I have received is accurate, there would be grounds for serious concerns. As 
Your Excellency is aware of, this is not the first case of juvenile offender being sentenced to 
death and/or facing imminent execution I have received so far this year. Indeed, you will recall 
that I had addressed this issue in previous correspondence with the Government of Your 
Excellency, some of which you have provided partial responses to (see letter dated 9 February 
2005, 21 April 2005, and joint communication sent on 7 August 2005 with the Chairperson of 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child).  
</p>
<p> 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I would like to draw your 
attention once again to the fact that the execution of Rostom Tajik and any further executions of 
juvenile offenders are incompatible with the international legal obligations of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran under various instruments which I have been mandated to bring to the attention 
of Governments. The right to life of persons below eighteen years of age and the obligation of 
States to guarantee the enjoyment of this right to the maximum extent possible are both 
specifically expressed in Article 6 of the <i>Convention on the Rights of the Child</i>. Besides, Article 
37(a) expressly provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed by 
persons below eighteen years of age.  In addition, Article 6(5) of the <i>International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights</i> provides that the death penalty shall not be imposed for crimes 
committed by persons below eighteen years of age.  
</p>
<p> 
In this connection, I would also remind your Excellency of the discussions of this issue that took 
place between your Government and the Committee on the Rights of the Child in January 2005, 
in which the delegation stated that all executions of persons who had committed crimes under the 
age of 18 had been halted. This was reiterated in a note verbale from the Permanent Mission of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran on 8 March 2005 to the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights in which it was stated: 
</p>
<p> 
&#8220;<i>In recent years the enactment of the death penalty for individuals aged under18 has 
been halted and there has been no instance of such punishments for the category of 
youth. The legal ban on under-aged capital punishment has been incorporated into the 
draft Bill on Juvenile Courts, which is at present before parliament for ratification</i>.&#8221; 
 
</p>
<p>I would respectfully urge the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to take all necessary 
measures to comply with international human rights law and to prevent executions which are 
inconsistent with accepted standards of international human rights law. These measures were, in 
my view, accurately reflected in the recommendations issued by the United Nations Committee 
on the Rights of the Child, which called on Iran in January 2005 to &#8220;immediately suspend the 
execution of all death penalties imposed on persons for having committed a crime before the age 
of 18, to take the appropriate legal measures to convert them to penalties in conformity with the 
provisions of the Convention and to abolish the death penalty as a sentence imposed on persons </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 153 
 
for having committed crimes before the age of 18, as required by article 37 of the Convention.&#8221; 
(See CRC/C/15/Add. 254, 28 January 2005, at para. 30). 
</p>
<p> 
Finally, I would respectfully reiterate my requests for a comprehensive and detailed indication of 
the details of individuals who have been sentenced to death for crimes committed when they 
were less than eighteen years of age, even if such sentences have not yet been confirmed by the 
Supreme Court. These requests were contained in the above-mentioned previous 
communications sent to the Government of Your Excellency, in relation to the situation of at 
least 30 individuals under the age of 18 who were reportedly sentenced to death and were held in 
juvenile detention centres in Tehran and Raja&#8217;I Shahr. It is regrettable that no response has yet 
been received.

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran.  However, the SR would reiterate that, in light of the importance attached to the 
issue and the need for accuracy and certainty, he would be most grateful if the Government could 
provide a copy of Ms. Nazanin&#8217;s birth certificate, passport or other official document confirming 
that she was over 18 at the time of the crime. 
<b> 
Urgent appeal dated 10 February 2006 sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture and Special Rapporteur on violence against women. 
 
</b>We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received 
regarding <b>Ms. Nazanin</b>, aged 18, who has reportedly been sentenced to death for a homicide 
committed when she was seventeen. According to the information we have received, on 3 
January 2006, Nazanin was sentenced to death for murder by a criminal court, after she 
reportedly admitted stabbing to death one of three men who attempted to rape her and her 16-
year-old niece in a park in Karaj in March 2005. She was seventeen at the time. Her sentence is 
subject to review by the Court of Appeal, and if upheld, to confirmation by the Supreme Court. 
 
In this connection, we would like to draw your attention to the positive developments in a 
similarly situated case recently raised with your Excellency&#8217;s Government by the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. In note no. 331-2/3459, dated 17 
January 2006, your Excellency&#8217;s Government informs the Special Rapporteur that &#8220;according to 
information received from the Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran legal counsels of Ms. 
Darabi appealed to the Supreme Court and raised the issue of her age at the time of the crime. On </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 154 
 
this basis the Supreme Court has overturned the sentence and has referred it to the<b> </b>Juvenile Legal 
Center for due consideration. 
 
We wish to welcome the steps taken in Ms. Darabi&#8217;s case. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to ensure on its own motion that Ms. Nazanin&#8217;s age at the time of the offence is 
taken into account in appeals proceedings and the death sentence overturned, whether or not her 
lawyer raises the issue. It would appear that only this course of action will ensure compliance of 
your Government with its international human rights obligations.  
 
<b>Response of the Government of Islamic Republic of Iran </b>dated 22 February 2006 to an urgent 
appeal dated 10 February 2006<b> 
</b> 
With reference to the letter dated 10 February 2006 of the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, 
Summary or Arbitrary Execution, the Special Rapporteur on the Question of Torture and the 
Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, Its Causes and Consequences, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran has the honour to inform the Special Rapportuers that according to information 
received from the Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ms. Nazanin was born in 1986. She, 
along with her niece, has committed murder about 9 months ago, when she was over 19 years of 
age. According to the records of the court, the crime has been committed based on personal 
.reasons and not in self defense as it has been reported to the Special Rapporteurs. 
 
She has gone through due legal proceeding and the Criminal Court of the province bas reached 
its verdict, but the sentence must be presented to the Supreme Court and upon confirmation of 
the latter, it must be signed by the Head of the Judiciary. Therefore the case is still open and 
under consideration. 
 
<b>Follow-up letter dated 17 march 2006</b> to the urgent appeal dated 10 February 2006 
 
I wish to refer to you letter dated 22 February 2006 in response to my communication of 10 
February relating to the case of ms. Nazanin in which you mentioned that this person was born in 
1986 and that &#8220;she has committed murder about 9 months ago, when she was over 19 years of 
age&#8221;. 
 
I greatly appreciate the information which your Excellency&#8217;s Government has supplied in this 
particular case. Because of the importance attached to the issue and the need to accuracy and 
certainty, I would be most grateful if you could provide me with a copy of her birth certificate, 
passport or other official document confirming that she was over 18 at the time of the crime. 
 
<b>Additional response of the Government of Islamic Republic of Iran</b> dated 16 May 2006 to an 
urgent appeal dated 22 Feburary 2006<b> 
</b> 
With reference to its note verbale No. 3865 dated 22 February 2006, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran has the honour to inform the Special Rapporteurs that the court has ruled out self defense 
and sentenced Ms. Nazanin to retaliation. The sentence has been referred to the Supreme Court 
for final decision. Should the Supreme Court endorse the verdict, the case will be referred to an 
ad hoc commission of reconciliation to acquire the consent of the victim's heirs to commute the </p>

yet completed and the verdict stays for the time being.

<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided the Government of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran regarding the execution of Hojjat Zamani and the death sentences of Valiallah 
Feyz Mahdavi, Saeed Masuri, and Gholamhossein Kalbi.   
 
However, the SR would note that the information provided does not reflect the thorough 
investigation of allegations that confessions were extracted with torture or that due process rights 
were violated during trial proceedings.   
 
In addition, the SR would note that the information provided does not address a number of the 
more general issues raised in his communications, including the rules and practices governing (i) 
the handing over of mortal remains to the families of those executed and (ii) the scheduling of 
executions and the information provided death row inmates, their families, their lawyers and the 
public at large with regard to executions. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal dated 22 February 2006 sent with the Special Rapporteur on Torture 
</b> 
We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received 
regarding four members of the People&#8217;s Mojahedin of Iran (PMOI) sentenced to death after 
having been allegedly tortured in pre-trial detention. One of the men, Mr. <b>Hojjat Zamani</b>, was 
reportedly recently executed, while the other three, Messrs. <b>Valiallah Feyz Mahdavi</b>, <b>Saeed 
Masuri</b>, and <b>Gholamhossein Kalbi</b>, are said to be at imminent risk of execution. 
 
Hojjat Zamani, aged 30, was most recently detained in Ghordasht prison in Karaj. We have 
received reports that intelligence agents removed Hojjat Zamani from his ward on 6 February 
2006. He was hanged the following morning at Ghordasht Prison.  
 
Hojjat Zamani was the subject of two communications by us to your Excellency&#8217;s Government, 
on 24 September 2004 and 12 May 2005. In those communications, we expressed the concern 
that Hojjat Zamani might have been sentenced to death following a trial in which his right to 
effective counsel was denied, in particular because judicial officials did not cooperate with his 
appointed lawyer. We also brought to your Government&#8217;s attention reports that he was tortured 
in Evin Prison in order to force him to confess to the national security-related offences he was </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 156 
 
convicted of. We urged your Excellency&#8217;s Government to suspend the capital punishment 
against him until the allegations of torture had been thoroughly investigated and all doubts in this 
respect dispelled. We received no response to our queries. (Your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
replied to our communications on 24 May and 8 August 2005, but this reply only referred to the 
case of Esmaeil Mohammadi). 
 
Valiallah Feyz Mahdavi, Saeed Masuri, and Gholamhossein Kalbi are members of the People&#8217;s 
Mojahedin of Iran sentenced to death on national security related charges.  They are also held at 
Ghordasht prison. Their death sentences have reportedly been confirmed by the Supreme Court. 
 
We would further like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received 
regarding Mr. Esmaeil Mohammadi. He was the subject of two urgent appeals sent on 8 
September 2004 and 12 May 2005. In those communications, we brought to your Excellency&#8217;s 
attention allegations that his death sentence was based on a confession extracted by torture. As in 
the case of Hojjat Zamani, we urged your Excellency&#8217;s Government to suspend the capital 
punishment against him until the allegations of torture had been thoroughly investigated and all 
doubts in this respect dispelled. Your Excellency&#8217;s Government replied on 24 May and 8 August 
</p><p>2005. In the latter communication, your Government informed us that he had been sentenced to 
death &#8220;after due legal process&#8221;, but that &#8220;[n]evertheless, the sentence has been put on hold after 
further consideration&#8221;. We have received reports that Esmail Mohammadi was executed on 3 
September 2005 (i.e. less than a month after your assurances), in Oroumiye Prison, in western 
Iran. Some days later, his family went to the prison to visit him, but were told that he had been 
executed. They were reportedly given his clothes and personal effects, but not his body. 
 
We have recalled the principles applicable under international law to these cases in numerous 
communications to your Government, including those in the cases of Hojjat Zamani and Esmaeil 
Mohammadi of 8 September 2004 and 12 May 2005. These include that there is an absolute 
prohibition on torture; that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of 
torture shall not be invoked in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as 
evidence that the statement was made; that in capital punishment cases, the obligation to observe 
rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) admits of no exception; and that these guarantees include the 
right not to be compelled to confess guilt and the right to adequate time and facilities for the 
preparation of one&#8217;s defence. 
 
In light of the apparent lack of transparency with regard to the process followed in the cases of 
Hojjat Zamani and Esmaeil Mohammadi between confirmation of the death sentence by the 
Supreme Court and their execution, we would like to additionally draw your attention to the fact 
that a person&#8217;s due process rights and the right to be treated humanely do not come to an end 
with the imposition of the death sentence. A lack of transparency regarding the post-conviction 
process and timetable for execution implicates two sets of rights.  The first is that the failure to 
provide notice to the accused of the timing of his execution may undermine due process rights.  
Most notably, in addition to &#8220;the right to his conviction and sentence being reviewed by a higher 
tribunal&#8221; (ICCPR Article 14(5)) &#8211; which Hojjat Zamani and Esmaeil Mohammadi were 
reportedly able to exercise &#8211; the death row prisoner has &#8220;the right to seek pardon or commutation 
of the sentence&#8221; (ICCPR Article 6(4)).  The uncertainty and seclusion inflicted by opaque 
processes compromise this right.  In addition, and regardless of the actual due process </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 157 
 
consequences, to conceal from someone the facts of their preordained fate will constitute 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  There are, of course, legitimate interests in 
security and privacy that necessarily limit access to death row and the publicity accorded to some 
information.  However, these interests can and must be accommodated without violating rights. 
 
Moreover, for the prisoner and for his or her family a lack of transparency in what is already a 
harrowing experience &#8212; waiting for one&#8217;s execution &#8212; can result in &#8220;inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment&#8221; within the meaning of Article 7 of the ICCPR.  The views of the 
Human Rights Committee in a recent decision that responded to an individual complaint of the 
mother of an executed Belarusian prisoner illustrate this matter. The Human Rights Committee 
found that &#8220;[t]he complete secrecy surrounding the date of execution, and the place of burial and 
the refusal to hand over the body for burial have the effect of intimidating or punishing families 
by intentionally leaving them in a state of uncertainty and mental distress.&#8221;  This amounted to 
inhuman treatment in violation of Article 7 of the ICCPR (Human Rights Committee, 
Communication No. 886/1999: Belarus, para. 10.2, 77th Sess., April 28, 2003, 
CCPR/C/77/D/886/1999).   
 
We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that the rights under international law of Valiallah Feyz Mahdavi, Saeed Masuri, and 
Gholamhossein Kalbi are respected. This can only mean  
 
(i) providing full information to the three men, their families and lawyers, as well as to us 
about their outstanding remedies against capital punishment, and about the process to be 
followed up to their execution; 
 
(ii) reviewing the fairness of their trial, including whether the right to assistance by counsel 
was respected at all stages, whether there were periods of incommunicado detention, and 
whether allegations of torture have been thoroughly investigated and all doubts in this respect 
dispelled; 
 
(iii) suspension of the capital punishment against the three men until the two requirements 
above have been fully met.  
 
In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate an expeditious response on the initial 
steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government, in addition to subsequent updates on 
developments in these cases. 
</p>
<p> 
Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on 
Human Rights and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to 
clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the 
Commission, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following 
matters: 
</p><p> 
1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary with regard to the executions of Hojjat 
Zamani and Esmaeil Mohammadi accurate? 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 158 
</p><p> 
2. What rules govern the scheduling of executions and the information of death row 
inmates, their families, their lawyers and the public at large with regard to executions? 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>3. Why was Esmaeil Mohammadi&#8217;s family denied hand-over of his mortal remains? And 
has the family of Hojjat Zamani been officially informed of his execution and been handed over 
his body? 
</p>
<p> 
We would further like to reiterate the questions asked in our communication of 12 May 2005, 
which have remained unanswered in your Government&#8217;s communications of 24 May and 8 
August 2005. 
 
<b>Response of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran dated 15 March 2006 
</b> 
With reference to letter dated 22 February 2006 of the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, 
Summary or Arbitrary Executions and the Special Rapporteur on the Question of Torture, the 
Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran has the honour to enclose herewith the 
information received from the Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
 
1- Mr. Esmaeil Mohammmadi: According to the local judicial authority of Western 
Azerbaijan, Mr. Esmaei1 Mohammadi had been charged with terrorist armed activities 
which resulted in the murder of an individual by the name of Ebrahim Badeh Bedast. After 
legal proceeding he had been sentenced to execution. Based on his appeal, his sentence was 
put on hold for further consideration. Appellate court rejected his appeal and the verdict 
was carried out after legal formalities 
 
2- Mr. Hojjat Zamani<b>: </b>He has been charged with bombing the property of the Tehran 
Revolutionary Court that caused 3 casualties and 22 injured, possession of illegal weapons, 
terrorist activities, escaping from the prison and illegal departure from the country. He was 
sentenced to execution. The verdict bas been upheld by the Supreme Court and was carried 
out in the presence of the victims' families. 
 
3- Mr. Feyz Mahdavi had undergone military training in Iraq and bas gone back to Iran 
carrying explosives. He was charged with measures against internal security of the state 
and sentenced to execution, He has not appealed the verdict and thus it was upheld by the 
Supreme Court, however the sentence has not been carried out and it is still pending for 
consideration for his amnesty. 
 
4- Mr. Saeed Masuri and Gholamhossein Kalbi have been charged with measures against 
internal security of the state due to their participation in terrorist activities of MKO 
terrorist group and possession of illegal weapons raid the Ministry of information and the 
seat of the Supreme Leader. They have been sentenced to execution but their case has been 
sent to relevant authorities for possible amnesty. The verdict has been so far stayed.<b> 
 
Urgent appeal dated 10 May 2006 
</b></p>
<p>  
We would like to draw the attention of your Government to new information we have received 
regarding <b>Valiollah Feiz Mahdavi</b> who is said to be at imminent risk of execution. We remind </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 159 
 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government that we already intervened in this case in our communication 
dated 22 February 2006. 
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, Valiollah Feiz Mahdavi was arrested in 2001 by 
Intelligence Ministry agents and charged with undermining national security and attempting to 
join the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran in Iraq. He was kept in solitary confinement for 
546 days, during which time he was interrogated and subjected to torture. He was reportedly kept 
in a little, dimly lit cell and when moved for any purpose he was shackled, cuffed and 
blindfolded. Valiollah Feiz Mahdavi was sentenced to death by the 26th branch of the 
Revolutionary Court in Tehran. At his trial, he reportedly rejected all the charges against him and 
had no legal representation. He is now being held in Gohardasht prison in Karaj. It has been 
brought to our attention that over the past two weeks, the prison chief and his executive deputy 
told Valiollah Feiz Mahdavi that he would be executed during the Persian New Year holidays.  
</p>
<p> 
As your Excellency will be aware, the principles applicable under international law to this case 
include the absolute prohibition of torture; moreover, any statement which is established to have 
been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked in any proceedings, except against a person 
accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made. We also recall that in capital 
punishment cases the obligation to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in 
Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) admits of no 
exception; and that these guarantees include the right not to be compelled to confess guilt and the 
right to adequate time and facilities for the preparation of one&#8217;s defence. 
</p>
<p> 
Finally, we wish to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that the death row prisoner has the 
right to &#8220;seek pardon or commutation of the sentence&#8221; (ICCPR art 6 (4)) and that the failure to 
provide notice to the accused of the timing of his execution may compromise this right.   
</p>
<p> 
In our previous communication, we asked your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
measures to review the fairness of Valiollah Feiz Mahdavi&#8217;s trial, including whether the right to 
assistance by counsel was respected at all stages, whether there were periods of incommunicado 
detention, and whether allegations of torture have been thoroughly investigated and all doubts in 
this respect dispelled. Your Excellency&#8217;s response dated 15 March 2006 did not provide 
information relating to the concerns we had raised and mentioned that Feiz Mahdavi was 
charged with measures against internal security of the state and sentenced to be executed; it also 
explained that Valiollah Feiz Mahdavi&#8217;s sentence had not been carried out and that it was still 
pending for consideration of an amnesty.  
</p>
<p>  
In view of the urgency of the matter, we urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to stay Valiollah 
Feiz Mahdavi&#8217;s execution until the allegations of torture and unfair trial have been thoroughly 
investigated and all doubts in this respect dispelled.

<b>Response of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran dated 29 June 2006 to an 
urgent appeal dated 10 May 2006 
</b></p>
<p> 
With reference to the letter dated 10 May 2006 of the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, 
Summary or Arbitrary Executions and the Special Rapporteur on the Question of Torture, the 
Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran has the honour to draw the attention of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 160 
 
Special Rapporteurs to its note verbale No. 4174 of 15 March 2006 in which the Mission 
stated: &quot;Mr. Feyz Mahdavi has undergone military training in Iraq and has gone back to Iran 
carrying explosives. He was charged with measures against internal security of the state and 
sentenced to execution. He has not appealed the verdict and thus it was upheld by the Supreme 
Court, however the sentence has not been carried out and it is still pending for consideration 
for his amnesty&quot;. 
 
It is worth adding that a process of amnesty for him has been initiated by relevant department 
in the Office of Public Prosecutor and the case is under consideration for this purpose. The 
sentence would not be carried out until this process reaches a clear conclusion on the case. 
 
It is also to be noted that the seriousness of the crime (undergoing military training by Iraqi 
regime of Saddam Hussein aiming the security of the state, and carrying explosives in a 
suitcase) has to be taken into account. He has been charged by the competent court (the only 
authority legally authorized to do this in the system of justice in Iran) and there has been no 
record of him being tortured, held in incommunicado or deprived from legal defense.

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission 
on Human Rights. 
<b> 
Urgent appeal dated 13 March 2006 
</b></p>
<p>  
I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received regarding 
<b>Khaled Hardani</b> and his two brothers-in-law <b>Shahram </b>and <b>Farhang Pour Mansouri</b> who have 
been sentenced to death for their attempt in hijacking an aircraft in January 2001. Reports 
indicate that at the time of hijacking, Shahram Pour Mansouri was aged 17.  
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, Khaled Hardani was one of 11 members of an extended 
family who attempted to commandeer a scheduled flight between the southern Iranian cities of 
Ahvaz and Bandar Abbas, and force it to fly to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. Security 
guards already on board ended the hijack attempt by shooting Khaled Hardani while the plane 
was still on the runway at Ahvaz. Khaled Hardani had persuaded Shahram and Farhang 
Pourmansouri's to board the plane without telling them his plans, and they reportedly only 
intervened to help him as the security guards opened fire. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 161 
 
</p>
<p> 
The three men were sentenced to death on charges of &quot;acts against national security&quot; (eqdam 
&#8216;aleyhe amniyat) and Moharebeh, or enmity with God, rather than charges relating specifically to 
hijacking an aircraft. 
</p>
<p> 
The death sentences have been upheld by the Supreme Court, while the Amnesty and Clemency 
Commission (Komisyon-e &#8216;Afv va Bakhshoudegi) has rejected an application for a pardon from 
their lawyer. 
</p>
<p> 
The Head of the Judiciary ordered the executions of all three men to be stayed because of 
Shahram Pour Mansouri&#8217;s age. In this context, I urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure 
that because of his age at the time of the offence the death sentence is commuted in conformity 
with the relevant international human rights obligations undertaken by your Government. The 
execution of a person for a crime committed while a juvenile would clearly violate the terms of 
both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child. 
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all such 
cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on these cases to the Commission, I 
would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations. I would appreciate a response on 
these matters before any irreversible steps are taken in relation to the fate of the accused 
individuals. I undertake to ensure that your Government&#8217;s response is accurately reflected in the 
reports I will submit to the Commission on Human Rights for its consideration.

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has failed to

<b>Urgent appeal dated 30 June 2006 
</b></p>
<p>  
I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received regarding 
Messrs. <b>Jaafar Sawari</b>, <b>Risan Sawari</b> and <b>Abdulredha Nawaseri</b>, three men reportedly 
sentenced to death and at imminent risk of execution.  
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 162 
 
According to the reports received, Jaafar Sawari, Risan Sawari and Abdulredha Nawaseri were 
sentenced to death or had their death sentences confirmed by Branch 3 of the Revolutionary 
Court in Ahvaz on 10 June 2006. It would appear that the three men and others were tried on 
charges related to bomb explosions in Ahvaz City in June and October 2005, which killed at 
least 14 people, as well as explosions at oil installations. They were among nine men shown 
making a confession of responsibility for these terrorist attacks on Khuzestan Provincial TV on 1 
March 2006. Among them were also Mehdi Nawaseri and Ali Awdeh Afrawi, who were hanged 
in public the following morning.  
 
Reports indicate that the lawyers of Jaafar Sawari, Risan Sawari and Abdulredha Nawaseri and 
their co-accused were not allowed to adequately prepare the defense of their clients: they were 
notified of the trial date only one or two days in advance, and could not study their clients' files 
fully. Moreover, they were not allowed to meet in private with their clients despite their requests 
to this effect. Seven of the lawyers who appeared before Branch 3 of the Revolutionary Court in 
this case brought these shortcomings of the proceedings to the attention of the president of the 
court in writing, but it would appear that their complaint has remained without any effect. 
Because of the secrecy reportedly surrounding the trial, my sources have not been able to inform 
me about the precise procedural posture of the cases of Jaafar Sawari, Risan Sawari and 
Abdulredha Nawaseri, whether they have appealed the death sentence, and about what remedies 
they still have at their disposal. 
 
While I am fully aware of the serious nature of the crimes these three men have been found 
guilty of, I respectfully remind your Excellency that &#8220;in capital punishment cases, the obligation 
of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the 
(International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) admits of no exception&#8221; (Little v. Jamaica, 
communication no. 283/1988, Views of the Human Rights Committee of 19 November 1991, 
para. 10). Relevant to the cases at issue, these guarantees include the right to adequate time and 
facilities for the preparation of one&#8217;s defence and the right to communicate in private with 
counsel of one&#8217;s own choosing. 
 
Article 14 also enshrines the right of every criminal defendant to a &#8220;public hearing&#8221; and requires 
that &#8220;any judgment rendered in a criminal case [&#8230;] be made public&#8221;. While the courts may 
exclude the public &#8220;from all or part of a trial&#8221; where publicity would imperil national security 
under the specific circumstances of the case at hand, a trial implicating a national security 
interest does not automatically justify a wholly secret trial.  Moreover, secrecy may never extend 
beyond the hearing itself. The requirement that the judgment be made public allows only the 
narrowest of exceptions which clearly find no application in the case at issue.  
 
I urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights 
under international law of Jaafar Sawari, Risan Sawari and Abdulredha Nawaseri are respected. 
Considering the irremediable nature of capital punishment, this can only mean suspension of the 
death sentence against the three men until the complaints regarding their right to be assisted by 
counsel in the adequate preparation of their defense have been thoroughly investigated and all 
doubts in this respect dispelled.

In view of the urgency of the matter, I would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government, including confirmation that Jaafar Sawari, Risan Sawari and 
Abdulredha Nawaseri are still alive. 
 
Moreover, it is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on 
Human Rights and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to 
clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on these cases to the 
Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the 
following matters: 
 
1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
 
2. Please provide full details with regard to the limitations allegedly placed on the lawyers 
assisting Jaafar Sawari, Risan Sawari and Abdulredha Nawaseri in the consultations with their 
clients and in the preparation of the defense. Please explain how the lawyers&#8217; complaint in this 
regard has been dealt with. 
 
3. Please provide details regarding the publicity of the trial of Jaafar Sawari, Risan Sawari 
and Abdulredha Nawaseri and of the sentences imposed on them. Please elaborate on the steps 
taken to make information about the trial, judgment and sentence available to the public in Iran. 
 
4. Please provide details concerning the current procedural posture of the cases of Jaafar 
Sawari, Risan Sawari and Abdulredha Nawaseri, on the legal remedies already exercised by 
them and those still open to them to challenge their conviction and the sentence imposed.

Urgent appeal dated 2 August 2006 
</b>&#61472; 
I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received regarding 
Messrs <b>Yahia Nasseri</b>, <b>Nazem Boraihi</b>, <b>Abdolemam Zaeri</b>, <b>Abdolzahar Olichi</b>, <b>Hamza 
Sawaeri</b>, <b>Ali Helfi</b> and <b>Zamel Bawi</b> who were reportedly sentenced to death and are at 
imminent risk of execution. According to the information received: </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 164 
 
</p>
<p> 
They were sentenced to death by the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Ahwaz on 7 and 8 
June. They are believed to be at imminent risk of execution as they are awaiting an 
execution order from the &#8220;Supreme Court&#8221; in Tehran. The seven men were tried on 
charges related to last October bombings in Ahwaz and other cities in Khuzestan 
province. Reports indicate that the only evidence presented by the prosecutors related to 
issues such as advocating a boycott of the last presidential elections, writing and 
managing university newspapers and advocating human rights of Arab minority and 
hence &quot;endangering the security of the state&quot;. Other charges included distributing CDs 
containing human rights reports published by the Ahwaz Human Rights Organization, the 
United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Amnesty International and Human Rights 
Watch.   
 
</p>
<p>Concern is also expressed that they were tried in secret. Therefore, I do not know whether the 
men have appealed their death sentence and which remedies they had at their disposal.  
</p>
<p> 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I respectfully remind your

rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the (International Covenant on

independent and impartial tribunal established by law. 
</p>
<p> 
Article 14 enshrines the right of every criminal defendant to a &#8220;public hearing&#8221; and requires that 
&#8220;any judgment rendered in a criminal case [&#8230;] be made public&#8221;. While the courts may exclude

<b>Letter of allegation sent on 31 August 2006 
 
</b>I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received regarding 
the reported trial on charges carrying capital punishment of 22 Ahwazi Arab activists. According 
to the information received, the following 20 men and two women were arrested by your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government in June 2006: <b>Ali Motirijejad</b> (m), <b>Abdullh Solymani</b> (m), <b>Mlik 
Banitamimt </b>(m), <b>Abolamir Farjaolh Chaabi</b> (m), <b>Mohammad Chaabpour </b> (m), <b>Khalaf

<b>Abdolreza Sanawati </b> (m), <b>Said Hamydan </b> (m), <b>Fahimeh Esmaili Badawi </b> (f), <b>Toameh Chaab</b>

<b>Mohammad Sawari </b> (m), and <b>Abdolreza Salman Delfi </b> (m). 
</p>
<p> 
It is my understanding that they are accused of having received training in Iraq by officials of the 
United States of America, the United Kingdom and Israel, and of having returned to Iran with 
the intent to destabilize the country, to sabotage oil installations and to attempt to overthrow 
Your Government. They are allegedly being tried in secret. According to the reports received, 
the competent prosecutor-general, Mr. Iraj Amirkhani, has given the official news agency ISNA 
an interview announcing that he was seeking the death penalty for all the accused. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 166 
 
</p>
<p> 
It is not my general practice to write to Governments with regard to cases of criminal defendants 
who have not been sentenced to death yet. In the present case, however, due to the secrecy 
surrounding these proceedings, I see myself forced to write to you already at this stage. My 
concerns are heightened by the failure of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to reply to the concerns 
I raised in letters of 30 June and 2 August 2006 regarding 10 further Ahwazi activists (Yahia 
Nasseri and Others) reportedly sentenced to death after a secret trial by the Islamic 
Revolutionary Court in Ahwaz on 7 and 8 June. 
</p>
<p> 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported above, I respectfully 
remind your Excellency that &#8220;in capital punishment cases, the obligation of States parties to 
observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the (International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR) admits of no exception&#8221; (Little v. Jamaica, 
communication no. 283/1988, Views of the Human Rights Committee of 19 November 1991, 
para. 10). Relevant to the cases at issue, these guarantees include the right to a fair and public 
hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law, as well as the 
assistance of a lawyer. 
</p>
<p> 
Article 14 enshrines the right of every criminal defendant to a &#8220;public hearing&#8221; and requires that 
&#8220;any judgment rendered in a criminal case [&#8230;] be made public&#8221;. While the courts may exclude 
the public &#8220;from all or part of a trial&#8221; where publicity would imperil national security under the 
specific circumstances of the case at hand, a trial implicating a national security interest does not 
automatically justify a wholly secret trial.  Moreover, secrecy may never extend beyond the 
hearing itself. The requirement that the judgment be made public allows only the narrowest of 
exceptions which clearly find no application in the case at issue.  
</p>
<p> 
Please be assured that I fully understand the gravity of the charges reportedly raised against the 
22 men and women. The right to life and the restrictions on the use of the death penalty 
enshrined in Article 6(2) ICCPR, however, do not permit any derogation, even &#8220;in times of 
public emergency which threatens the life of the nation&#8221; (Article 4 ICCPR). 
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, in addition to charges of &#8220;destabilizing the country&#8221;, 
&#8220;sabotage of oil installations&#8221; and &#8220;attempt to overthrow the Government&#8221;, the 22 men and 
women are charged with the offense of &#8220;mohareb&#8221;, which carries the death penalty. It is my 
understanding that &#8220;mohareb&#8221; can be translated as &#8220;being at war with God&#8221;. I am concerned that 
this charge, which according to my information in Iran is waged against political dissidents, 
critics of the Government and persons accused of espionage, might not be sufficiently well-
defined to satisfy the very strict standards of legality set by Article 6(2) ICCPR for the 
imposition and execution of the death penalty. Indeed, in order for sentence of death to be 
imposed &#8220;in accordance with the law&#8221;, the law in question must be sufficiently precise to clearly 
allow distinction between conduct punishable with the capital sentence and conduct not so 
punishable. The concept of a &#8220;fair trial&#8221; similarly requires that the elements of the crime charged 
be known in sufficient detail to the defendant for him to be able to effectively address them.  
</p>
<p> 
I urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights 
under international law of the above-named 22 persons are respected. Should their trial still be in 
course, I would ask you to ensure that their right to a fair trial, to an appeal and to seek pardon </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 167 
 
are fully guaranteed. In the event that they already have been sentenced to death, considering the 
irremediable nature of capital punishment, this could only mean suspension of the death sentence 
until the complaints regarding their right to a fair and public hearing by a competent, 
independent and impartial tribunal established by law have been thoroughly investigated and all 
doubts in this respect dispelled. 
</p>
<p> 
In view of the urgency of the matter, I would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government, including confirmation that the 22 persons are still alive. 
</p>
<p> 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all 
cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on these cases to the Human Rights 
Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following 
matters: 
 
1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
 
2. Please provide details regarding the information made publicly available in relation to the

3. Please provide details of any avenues of appeal already exercised by the defendants and 
those still open to them to challenge their conviction and sentence. 
 
4. Please provide details concerning the legal definition of &#8220;mohareb&#8221; in Iranian law. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal dated 13 November 2006 with the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers and Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
</b></p>
<p> 
On 31 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
wrote a letter to your Excellency&#8217;s Government, drawing attention to information he had 
received regarding the reported trial on charges carrying capital punishment of 22 Ahwazi Arab 
activists arrested by the Government in June 2006: Ali Motirijejad (m), Abdullh Solymani (m), 
Mlik Banitamimt (m), Abolamir Farjaolh Chaabi (m), Mohammad Chaabpour (m), Khalaf 
Khozairi (m), Alireza Asakereh  (m), Majed Albog Hbaish (m), Ghasem Salamat (m), Abdolreza 
Sanawati (m), Said Hamydan (m), Fahimeh Esmaili Badawi (f), Toameh Chaab (m), Nasser 
Farajolah Kia (m), Majid Mazaal (m), Jalil Moghadam (m), Mehdi Saad Nasab (m), Hoda 
Hedayati Rezaie (Hawashemi) (f), Sharif Asei Nawaseri (m), Jalil Boraihi (m), Mohammad 
Sawari (m), and Abdolreza Salman Delfi (m). 
</p>
<p> 
At the time, we expressed our concern about reports indicating that they were being tried in 
secret and that the competent prosecutor-general had announced that he was seeking the death 
penalty for all the accused. That communication unfortunately remains unanswered by your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government.  
</p>
<p> 
Today, we have received additional information according to which on 9 November 2006 the 
Head of the Judiciary in Khuzestan Province, Mr. Abbas Jaafari Dowlatabadi, announced that 
the Supreme Court has confirmed the death sentence of ten of the defendants mentioned above, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 168 
 
namely <b>Ali Motirijejad</b> (m), <b>Abdullh Solymani</b> (m), <b>Mlik Banitamimt</b> (m), <b>Abolamir 
Farjaolh Chaabi</b> (m), <b>Mohammad Chaabpour</b> (m), <b>Khalaf Khozairi</b> (m), <b>Alireza Asakereh</b> 
(m), <b>Majed Albog Hbaish</b> (m), <b>Ghasem Salamat</b> (m), and <b>Abdolreza Sanawati</b> (m). Iranian 
media have reportedly announced that the confessions of the 10 men will be broadcasted on 
Khuzestan TV tonight, 13 November 2006, and that their executions will be held in public, 
probably on 14 or 15 November 2006. 
</p>
<p> 
We have further received information which corroborates the concerns expressed in the letter of 
31 August 2006. Allegedly, all ten men were tortured into making false confessions. Their 
lawyers were not allowed to see them prior to their trial and they were given access to the 
prosecution case only hours before the start of the trial. The trial was held in secret. The lawyers 
for the defendants, Khalil Saeedi, Mansur Atashneh, Dr Abdulhasan Haidari, Jawad Tariri, Faisal 
Saeedi and Taheri Nasab), were arrested for having complained about violations of the relevant 
laws in the course of the trials and charged with threatening national security.  
</p>
<p> 
Without prejudging the accuracy of the allegations reported above, we would like to recall the 
principles set forth in the letter of 31 August 2006: in capital punishment cases, the obligation of 
States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) admits of no exception. The right 
of every criminal defendant to a &#8220;public hearing&#8221; requires that &#8220;any judgment rendered in a 
criminal case [&#8230;] be made public&#8221;. While the courts may exclude the public &#8220;from all or part of 
a trial&#8221; where publicity would imperil national security under the specific circumstances of the 
case at hand, a trial implicating a national security interest does not automatically justify a 
wholly secret trial.  Moreover, secrecy may never extend beyond the hearing itself. The 
requirement that the judgment be made public allows only the narrowest of exceptions which 
clearly find no application in the case at issue. 
</p>
<p> 
Relevant to the cases at issue, the right to a fair trial further includes the guarantee of &#8220;adequate 
time and facilities for the preparation of [one&#8217;s] defence and to communicate with counsel&#8221; 
(Article 14(3)(b)). This guarantee would be seriously violated if, as alleged, the lawyers were not 
allowed to see the defendants prior to their trial and the defendants and their lawyers were given 
access to the prosecution case only hours before the start of the trial. Moreover, while we are not 
in a position to express any opinion about the charges of &#8220;threatening national security&#8221; 
reportedly brought against the lawyers and their arrest, we note that the pressure and intimidation 
created by such charges is difficult to reconcile with the right to effective legal assistance and to 
a fair hearing. 
</p>
<p> 
Of equal concern are the allegations that the defendants were forced under torture into signing a 
confession. The alleged denial of access to their lawyers during the pre-trial phase and the 
circumstance that the broadcasting of their confessions on TV on the eve of their execution 
would appear to be the only element of their case not shrouded in secrecy do not contribute to 
dispelling this concern.  
</p>
<p> 
Finally, in the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8217; 
communication of 31 August 2006, he had raised some questions with regard to the charge of 
&#8220;mohareb&#8221; (&#8220;being at war with God&#8221;) brought against the defendants. He expressed the concern 
that this charge, which according to his information in Iran was waged against political </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 169 
 
dissidents, critics of the Government and persons accused of espionage, might not be sufficiently 
well-defined to satisfy the very strict standards of legality set by Article 6(2) ICCPR for the 
imposition and execution of the death penalty. As the other requests for information and 
questions put in the previous communication, this one as well remains unanswered. 
</p>
<p> 
We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the 
rights under international law of Ali Motirijejad (m), Abdullh Solymani (m), Mlik Banitamimt 
(m), Abolamir Farjaolh Chaabi (m), Mohammad Chaabpour (m), Khalaf Khozairi (m), Alireza 
Asakereh (m),  Majed Albog Hbaish (m), Ghasem Salamat (m), and Abdolreza Sanawati (m) are 
respected. Considering the irremediable nature of capital punishment, this can only mean 
suspension of the execution until the complaints regarding their right to a fair and public hearing 
by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law have been thoroughly 
investigated and all doubts in this respect dispelled. 
</p>
<p>

<b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission 
on Human Rights. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal dated 2 October 2006 </b>sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture and Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences<b> 
</b> 
In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we 
have received regarding six women, namely <b>Shamameh Ghorbani</b>, <b>Kobra Najjar</b> and <b>Soghra 
Mola&#8217;i</b> who have been sentenced to death by stoning for adultery.  
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received: 
 
Shamameh Ghorbani (also known as Malek), arrested in June 2005, was sentenced to 
execution by stoning for adultery by a court in Oromieh in June 2006. She is reportedly 
held in Oromieh prison. Her brothers and husband reportedly murdered a man that they 
found in her house, and she too was nearly killed after they stabbed her with a knife. 
Shamameh Ghorbani&#8217;s case is reportedly being re-examined. 
 
Kobra Najjar was allegedly forced into prostitution by her husband, a heroin addict who 
was violent towards her. In 1995, after a severe beating by her husband, she told one of 
her regular customers that she wanted to kill her husband. The customer allegedly 
murdered her husband after Kobra Najjar took him to an arranged meeting place. He was 
sentenced to death, but he was pardoned by the victim&#8217;s family, to whom he paid diyeh 
(blood money).  Kobra Najjar was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for being an 
accomplice to the murder of her husband, and execution by stoning for adultery. She was 
scheduled to be executed after serving her prison sentence, which was finished two years 
ago. She has reportedly written to the Judicial Commission for Amnesty to ask for her 
sentence of execution by stoning to be commuted, and is awaiting a reply. Kobra Najjar is 
detained in Tabriz prison and is at imminent risk of execution. 
 
Soghra Mola&#8217;i was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment for being an accomplice to the 
murder in January 2004 of her husband Abdollah, and to execution by stoning for 
adultery. During interrogation she said that she was subjected to domestic violence by her 
husband and that she did not kill him. She added that on the night of the incident after 
Alireza killed her husband, she ran away with him because she was scared to stay at 
home, thinking that her brothers-in-law would kill her. Alireza was sentenced to death for 
the murder of Soghra Mola'i&#8217;s husband, and to 100 lashes for &quot;illicit relations&quot;. The 
sentences are pending examination by the Supreme Court. It is believed that Soghra 
Mola&#8217;i is detained in Reja'i Shahr prison, Karaj, near Tehran. 
 
</p>
<p>Although the death penalty is not prohibited under international law, we would like to remind 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government that it must be regarded as an extreme exception to the 
fundamental right to life, and must as such be interpreted in the most restrictive manner. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 171 
 
Accordingly, it is crucial that all fair trial and other protections provided for in international 
human rights law are fully respected in proceedings relating to capital offences.  
</p>
<p> 
It is our view that the death penalty as applied in these cases does not fall within the category of 
the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; for which international law countenances its possible application. It is 
generally understood that this category should not be defined as going beyond intentional crimes 
with lethal or extremely grave consequences (paragraph 1 of the Safeguards guaranteeing 
protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, Economic and Social Council 
resolution 1984/50 of 25 May 1084). In its General Comment No. 6, the United Nations Human 
Rights Committee has stated that &#8220;the expression &#8216;most serious crimes&#8217; must be read restrictively 
to mean that the death penalty should be a quite exceptional measure&#8221;.  Similarly, that 
Committee has observed that the restriction encapsulated in that phrase cannot be interpreted as 
permitting the imposition of the death penalty &#8220;for crimes of an economic nature, for corruption 
and for adultery, or for crimes that do not result in loss of life&#8221; (CCPR/C/28/Add.15, 3 August 
2003, paragraph 8). 
</p>
<p> 
We would also like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to Resolution 2005/39 of the 
Commission on Human Rights, which reminded Governments that corporal punishment, can 
amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or even to torture. We would also like to 
draw your attention to the report of the Special Rapporteur on torture to the 60th session of the 
General Assembly, in which he, with reference to the jurisprudence of UN treaty bodies, 
concluded that any form of corporal punishment is contrary to the prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. He also noted that States cannot 
invoke provisions of domestic law to justify violations of their human rights obligations under 
international law, including the prohibition of corporal punishment and called upon States to 
abolish all forms of judicial and administrative corporal punishment without delay (para.28 
A/60/316). Both the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture have called 
for the abolition of judicial corporal punishment. In paragraph 5 of General Comment No. 20 
(1992), the Human Rights Committee stated that the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment must 
extend to corporal punishment, including excessive chastisement ordered as punishment for a 
crime.   
</p>
<p> 
Furthermore, we would like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to article 4 (b) of the United 
Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which stipulates that States 
should pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating violence 
against women and, to this end, should refrain from engaging in violence against women. We 
would also like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention article 4 (c) and article 4 (d) of the 
United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which notes the 
responsibility of states to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and, in accordance with 
national legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by 
the State or by private persons. To this end, States should develop penal, civil, labour and 
administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs caused to 
women who are subjected to violence. Women who are subjected to violence should be provided 
with access to the mechanisms of justice and, as provided for by national legislation, to just and 
effective remedies for the harm that they have suffered. States should, moreover, also inform 
women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms. (Adopted by General 
Assembly resolution 48/104 on 20 December 1993). </p>

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iraq has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
<b> 
Letter of allegation dated 14 March 2006 
 
</b>I have been following the reports regarding the barbaric bomb-attack on the al-Askari shrine in 
Samarra on 22 February 2006 and the following events with great concern and would like to 
offer my condolences at the terrible loss of life and destruction, particularly of religious sites, 
your country has witnessed in the course of the last three weeks. As Special Rapporteur on 
summary executions, I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I 
have received concerning a wave of killings of persons belonging to the Sunni community on 22 
and 23 February 2006.  I am of course aware that the further increase in violence since 22 
February has resulted in the killing of numerous Iraqis belonging to the Shiite community as 
well. The reason I am raising my concerns and seeking information from you with regard to 
these executions is that the armed groups reportedly responsible for them are alleged to have 
links to the Ministry of Interior of your Excellency&#8217;s Government, and because there are specific 
reports that the security forces failed to protect the victims. Among the numerous incidents 
reported, I would like to draw your attention to the attack on the so-called Palestinian compound 
in Baghdad, the attack on the Basra headquarters of the Iraqi Islamic Party, and the abduction of 
twelve prisoners from the Al Mina detention centre in Basra with the subsequent execution of 
eleven of them.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 173 
 
 
On 22 February 2006 at about 10.30 a.m., militiamen wearing black clothes arrived in several 
vehicles and attacked the Al Baladiya neighbourhood, where many Palestinians reside (known as 
the &#8220;Palestinian compound&#8221;).  The militia headed first to the Mohammed Abdul Ra'ouf mosque, 
firing at civilians and killing an unspecified number of them.  Subsequently, the militia went 
inside the mosque, planted explosives and detonated them, destroying the mosque. Later on, 
other groups of similarly clad armed men headed to the Al Qods mosque, located at about 1 km 
from the place of the first incident. They shot at the building, entered the mosque and abducted 
an employee, Mr. Jamal Mohammed.  He was later found dead at the Medico Legal Institute, his 
face burned. The militias painted messages on the walls of the building: &#8220;Now is your turn 
Wahabis.  Praying in the mosque is now forbidden for Wahabis&#8221;. The militia went to the Imam's 
office with the intention of planting explosives, but were prevented from doing so by armed 
residents of the area, who defended the mosque for about 30 minutes.  15 minutes after the 
attackers withdrew, the police arrived. It would appear that the police were near the area during 
the incidents but only intervened once the militias withdrew. Residents identify the attackers as 
belonging to the Mehdi Army led by Moqtada al-Sadr, but officials of Mr. al-Sadr&#8217;s party have 
denied involvement of their organization.  
 
On 22 February 2006 at 8:30 p.m., a group of masked men (reports vary as to their precise 
number, some reports speaking of 70 men) came to the Al Mina detention center in Basra. They 
were dressed in black, wore bullet-proof vests, and were armed with pistols, rifles and rocket 
propelled grenade launcher (RPGs). The men went to a cell holding Iraqi and foreign Sunni 
Muslims detained on charges of terrorism. According to some reports, the armed men identified 
themselves as members of the Iraqi police intelligence and claimed to have authority to remove 
the prisoners. Ten of the twelve prisoners were killed and their bodies dumped on the streets 
along the Hay al Hussayn part of the city. Their names, as reported to me, are  
 
<b>Mohamed Amin Jassim</b> &#8211; a citizen of Iraq 
<b>Mohamed Saleh Abdurahman</b> &#8211; a citizen of Iraq 
<b>Nabil Hareth Faris</b> &#8211; a citizen of Iraq 
<b>Sinan Mahmood Abdulwahab</b> &#8211; a citizen of Iraq 
<b>Mukhtiar</b> &#8211; a citizen of Iraq 
<b>Ferej Saad Allah</b> &#8211; a citizen of Egypt 
<b>Abdul Rahim Mohamed Abdul Rehim</b> &#8211; a citizen of Egypt 
<b>Waleed Mohamed</b> &#8211; a citizen of Tunisia 
<b>Mohamed Ben Hassan Ben Kassim</b>&#8211; a citizen of Tunisia 
<b>Basse Saleh Jamil</b> &#8211; a citizen of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
<b>Mohammed Abdulahi Mohamed</b> &#8211; a citizen of Libya 
<b>Mejat Istiyan</b> &#8211; a citizen of Turkey  
 
Two men are said to have survived and were reportedly returned to the detention centre.  
 
On 23 February 2006 at 1.30 p.m., approximately one hundred persons dressed in black attacked 
the Basra headquarters of the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP). Some of the witnesses identified the 
attackers as members of the Badr Organisation, a militia affiliated with the political party 
Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, while others described them as belonging to 
the so-called Mehdi Army. After an exchange of fire, the building was set ablaze, forcing </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 174 
 
everybody inside to go to the roof of the building. Two IIP members were injured in the attack 
and were taken to a hospital. Some hours later, men in black clothing abducted the two injured 
IIP members from the hospital and assassinated them.  
 
Under international human rights law, and in particular under articles 2 and 6 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the three incidents described above involve the 
responsibility of your Excellency&#8217;s Government at a number of levels.  
 
First and foremost, reports suggest that in some instances the perpetrators of extrajudicial 
killings belong in fact to the forces of the Ministry of Interior or of the Ministry of Defence. In 
particular, the Mehdi Army and the Badr Organisation are reported to be active within the police. 
In this respect, I am also aware of reports according to which perpetrators dressed in police 
uniforms but in fact unrelated to the police are responsible for killings. The circumstance that 
some of the executions have been carried out by perpetrators impersonating police officers 
should not, however, serve as a reason to take the reports alleging executions perpetrated by 
actual police officers less seriously. 
 
Secondly, reports suggest that even where there is no direct participation of personnel belonging 
to the forces of the Ministry of Interior or of the Ministry of Defence, there are various forms of 
collusion between the security forces and the militias suspected of carrying out these attacks, in 
particular the Mehdi Army and the Badr Organisation. This is of course the case when officials 
hand over prisoners to militiamen. As to the attacks on the civilian population and Sunni 
organizations and mosques, they show a degree of organization and reveal that the perpetrators 
have access to resources and equipment (vehicles, weapons, some form of uniform, bullet-proof 
vests). Moreover, while it is reported that in some instances the Iraqi police and Army intervened 
to protect the population, mosques and funeral processions from such attacks, in other cases the 
security forces clearly failed in their duty to protect the population against the militias, arriving 
only after the aggression was completed, or withdrawing too early and allowing the assault to 
resume. 
 
International human rights law requires your Government to take immediate steps to disarm all 
militias operating in Iraq. Where militias or their individual members have been lawfully 
integrated into the security forces, your Government must ensure that they are under the effective 
control of the competent authorities and act under the official, constitutional chain of command. 
The reported incidents, and all other incidents of similar gravity, must be thoroughly and 
independently investigated, both with a view to clarifying to what extent the perpetrators 
belonged to or acted in collusion with the security forces, and in order to bring those responsible 
to justice. I have received reports that several inquiries have been started into previous cases of 
executions similar to those described above, but that they have been languishing without 
producing results whenever there are indications that security forces or militias connected to 
political parties in power are implicated. Clearly, in order to re-establish trust in the security 
forces and their readiness to protect all citizens (and other inhabitants) of Iraq, reports of killings 
involving the security forces must be given priority and be investigated all the more vigorously.  
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on this case to </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 175 
 
the Commission or the future Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation 
and your observations on the following matters: 
 
1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? Please provide detailed information 
on the investigations carried out to clarify these incidents, in particular the allegations of direct 
involvement or collusion by the security forces. 
 
2. Please provide the details of all the steps taken to disarm the militias active in Iraq, or &#8211; 
where their members have been lawfully integrated into the security forces &#8211; to ensure that they 
operate within the law and under the lawful chain of command, as well as to hold their members 
and commanders accountable.  
 
3. Please provide details of all the criminal investigations and prosecutions carried out to 
bring those responsible for the executions described above to justice. 
 
4. Have the victims of the incidents described above or their families been compensated? 
 
I undertake to ensure that your Government&#8217;s response to each of these questions is accurately 
reflected in the report I will submit to the Commission on Human Rights for its consideration. 
 
In closing this communication I would like to reiterate that the fact that I am raising with your 
Government the cases described in this letter, and not incidents of equally deadly and 
condemnable terrorist attacks on security forces or civilians, does certainly not lie in any 
discrimination between the victims of the attacks. But your Government&#8217;s responsibility to 
protect the right to life of all the persons subject to its jurisdiction is all the more relevant and 
pressing, both in law and from a political point of view, when there are reports of participation in 
the killings of personnel belonging to the security forces and to militias connected to political 
parties in government.

<b>Urgent appeal sent on 7 July 2006 
</b> 
I am writing in relation to the trial of <b>Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti</b> <b>and others</b> before the 
Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal in the so-called <i>Dujail </i>case. According to the information 
received, the most recent developments are that on 19 June 2006 the Chief Trial Prosecutor 
demanded the death sentence for Saddam Hussein, his half-brother Barzan al-Tikriti and the 
former Vice-President, Taha Yassin Ramadan. Three days later, the bullet-ridden corpse of one 
of Saddam Hussein&#8217;s defense lawyers, Mr. Khamis Al-Obeidi, who had been abducted from his 
home on 21 June 2006, was found. It is my understanding that the trial is now adjourned to 10 
July, when the defence will deliver its final arguments and the court will retire to consider its 
verdict.  
</p>
<p> 
As your Excellency&#8217;s Government is aware, international law &#8211; in particular the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Iraq is a State party &#8211; does not ban the 
death penalty but attaches strict and vitally important procedural guarantees to its exercise.  
</p>
<p> 
One such limitation is that &#8220;in capital punishment cases, the obligation of States parties to 
observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the (ICCPR) admits of 
no exception&#8221; (<i>Little v. Jamaica</i>, communication no. 283/1988, Views of the Human Rights 
Committee of 19 November 1991, para. 10). Your Excellency&#8217;s Government is well aware of the 
serious concerns raised with regard to the compliance of the trial of Saddam Hussein with the 
requirements of a fair trial &#8211; not the least, that the murder of three of his defence lawyers casts 
some doubt on the full enjoyment of the right to &#8220;adequate time and facilities for the preparation 
of his defence&#8221; and to &#8220;defend himself &#8230; through legal assistance of his own choosing&#8221; (Article 
14(3) ICCPR, letters (b) and (d), mirrored in Article 19(4), letters (b) and (d) of the Law on the 
Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal). As the first instance trial is drawing to its conclusion and the 
Appeals Chamber will have the jurisdiction to hear appeals on the grounds of &#8220;error of 
procedure&#8221; (Article 25(1) of the Law on the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal), I do not wish to 
pursue these concerns at the present stage.  
</p>
<p> 
My concern in the present letter is with Article 27(2) of the Law, the first sentence of which 
reads: &#8220;No authority, including the President of the Republic, may grant a pardon or reduce the 
penalties issued by this Tribunal.&#8221; This provision would appear to be irreconcilable with 
paragraph 4 of Article 6 ICCPR, providing that &#8220;[a]nyone sentenced to death shall have the right 
to seek pardon or commutation of the sentence. Amnesty, pardon or commutation of the sentence 
of death may be granted in all cases.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> 
I am also gravely concerned about the second sentence of Article 27(2), providing that 
&#8220;[p]enalties shall be enforced within thirty days of the sentence or decision reaching finality.&#8221; 
Considering the irremediable nature of capital punishment, this provision would appear to fail to 
take into account the numerous serious legal issues which, as the experience of other countries 
retaining the death penalty shows, can and do arise even after a death sentence has become 
&#8220;final&#8221;.  A period of thirty days does not provide sufficient time for the defence or for the wheels 
of justice to respond adequately to any subsequent issues that might be raised. 
</p>
<p> 
An additional consideration concerns the desirability of ensuring that the defendants are able to 
stand trial for at least the most serious crimes of which they have been accused.  While there may </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 177 
 
be no formal obligation in international law to refrain from executing someone duly convicted of 
a most serious crime and sentenced to death before they can be tried on other charges, the 
interests of promoting accountability and justice would weigh strongly in favour of ensuring that 
the accused in the present proceedings are brought to court in relation to a reasonable cross 
section of the gravest charges against them.  I note in this regard that your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government has reportedly announced that a second trial against Saddam Hussein and six co-
defendants is scheduled to begin on 21 August 2006. In this trial the accused are to be judged, 
including on charges of genocide, for their alleged role in Operation Anfal, a campaign which is 
said to have killed an estimated 100,000 Kurdish citizens of Iraq in 1987-88. Proceeding with the 
rapid carrying out of a death sentence in such circumstances would seem to be incompatible with 
the interests of the community at large, and of the victims in particular, in securing a careful 
consideration of the charges in court. 
</p>
<p> 
I accept of course that it will not be possible to try all the crimes against humanity and war 
crimes committed since 17 July 1968 by the regime led by Saddam Hussein, and that there are 
other transitional justice mechanisms available, such as truth commissions. Nonetheless, I 
consider that the provision mandating execution within thirty days unnecessarily undermines the 
efforts of victims of the atrocities committed by Saddam Hussein&#8217;s regime to promote 
accountability. 
</p>
<p> 
In the light of the above considerations, I urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to use the time 
provided by the completion of the first instance trial and the (possible) appeals proceedings in 
the <i>Dujail </i>case to repeal Article 27(2) of the Law on the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal, or 
amend it as necessary to bring it in compliance with your Government&#8217;s obligations under 
international law. As set forth above, this will require providing for the right to seek pardon or 
commutation of the sentence for convicts sentenced to death, as well as for adequate time to 
effectively exercise this right.

We would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we have received concerning 
59 men reportedly tortured to death or executed after having been tortured, apparently by 
security forces of your Excellency&#8217;s Government. According to the information received: 
 
</p>
<p>As he was leaving a mosque in Al-Huria district, Baghdad, following prayers on an 
unspecified date in May 2005, <b>Taha Mohammad Sulaiman Al Meshehdani </b>was 
arrested together with five others by members of the Iraqi Rapid Reaction Force riding in 
vehicles with the insignia of the National Guards. He was taken to the Ministry of 
Interior Detention Centre. Having received no news of his whereabouts, 19 days later his 
family discovered that his body was in the Medico-Legal Institute, found among six 
others dumped in the Al-Sha&#8217;ab district. His body exhibited wounds inflicted as a result 
of a power drill, his vertebrae and bones in his legs and hands were broken. Death 
reportedly occurred the day after he was arrested. 
</p>
<p> 
On 14 May 2005, <b>Salah Hassan Mosa</b>, <b>Yahya Hassan Mosa</b>, <b>Khalid Al-Azzawi</b>, <b>Salah 
Ibrahim</b>, <b>Nariman Mahmoud</b>, <b>Khudair Khamees</b>, <b>Naseir Samir</b>, <b>Laith Al-Azawi</b>, <b>Ali 
Hussein</b>, and <b>Mohammed Hamid Rashid</b> were detained by the Police Special Forces 
Unit (Al-Borkhan) in the Al-Eskan area of Baghdad. They were found dead in the Al-
Gayarra district days later with torture signs on their bodies, including bullet holes and 
marks indicative of beating.   
</p>
<p> 
On 10 July 2005, officers of the Ministry of Interior searched the Seba Abkar district, 
Baghdad, and arrested men belonging to the Arab Sunni community, including<b> Shiekh 
Dhiaa Muhmood Al-Jenabi</b>, <b>Abdulsalam Abdul-Aziz</b>, <b>Amer Husain Al-Meshhedani</b>, 
<b>Ayad Dawood Selman</b>,<b> Selman Dawood Selman</b>, <b>Hadi Zbala</b>, <b>Foua&#8217;ad Salem 
Tawfeek Al-Kaisi</b>, <b>Ala&#8217;a Salem Tawfeek Al-Kaisi</b>, <b>Ali Noree Aifan</b>, <b>Mushtaq

of the victims found the bodies in the Medico-Legal Institute. The bodies bore signs of 
injuries, including wounds caused by power drills, gun shot wounds to the head, acid-
induced injuries, and facial mutilation, such as missing eyes.

<p> 
On 24 August 2005, about 80 persons belonging to the Sunni community were detained 
in Al-Huria district, Baghdad, by the Police Special Forces Unit (Al-Borkhan Unit). They 
included  <b>Mohamed Ali Hamed Al-Mashhadaniy</b>, <b>Waleed Ali Hamed  Al-

Hamadiy Al-Dulaimi</b>,<b> </b>and <b>Mohammed Alawi Abass Al-Ubaidiy</b>. On 28 August 2005, 
the bodies of 36 of the persons detained on 24 August in Al-Huria were found in Kut 
province. On 29 August 2005, a relative of other victims identified another 50 bodies in 
the Medico-Legal Institute, Baghdad, as belonging to persons arrested on 24 August in 
Al-Huria. The bodies bore signs of injuries, including acid-induced injuries, gun shot 
wounds to the head, missing teeth, punctures, missing skin, broken hands, and facial 
mutilation, such as missing eyes. The police have refused to release information as to 
where they found the bodies which were delivered to the Medico-Legal Institute. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>Ahmad Shaker Mahmoud</b>, aged 37, <b>Omar Khalil Abed</b>, aged 30, and <b>Shaker 
Mahmoud Ali</b>, aged 66, all of Baghdad, were detained by members of the Al-Mehdi 
Army following the bombing of two Shiite shrines in Samara on 22 February 2006. On 
23 February 2006, their bodies were found dumped in the Kasra-Wattash district, 
Baghdad, bearing signs of torture. Ahmed Shaker&#8217;s left eye was missing, his back 
appeared to be burned by an iron, and his body bore puncture wounds made by a power 
drill. Omar Khalil&#8217;s neck exhibited power drill injuries; and Shakir Mahmoud had marks 
indicative of beatings.  
</p>
<p> 
<b>Mosa&#8217;b Abdul Sattar Abdul Jabbar</b>, aged 25,<b> </b>member of a counseling committee at the 
Muslim Scholars&#8217; Foundation, Baghdad, was deprived of his freedom by men riding in 
three cars belonging to the Ministry of Interior on his way to Al-Tasfeerat (the Iraqi 
Police Center), where he was going to visit one of the detainees. On 30 May 2006, the 
body of Mosa&#8217;b Abdul Sattar was found in the Medico-Legal Institute bearing signs of 
torture: acid burns on his face and body and power drill holes on his legs. It seems also 
that his head was squeezed with a metal compressor until his eyes came out of their 
sockets. 
</p>
<p> 
In none of the above cases have investigations led to the arrest of the suspected 
perpetrators and the initiation of criminal proceedings against them, nor has any of the 
victims&#8217; families received compensation. 
</p>
<p> 
While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to draw your 
Government&#8217;s attention to the fundamental principles applicable under international law to these 
incidents. Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 
enshrines the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of one&#8217;s life. Article 7 ICCPR and Article 1 of 
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment proscribe torture and inhuman or degrading treatment.  
 
In all cases, except for the death of Ahmad Shaker Mahmoud, Omar Khalil Abed, and Shaker 
Mahmoud Ali, the reports indicate that the victims were last seen alive when they were deprived 
of their freedom by members of your Government&#8217;s security forces. Under these circumstances, 
human rights law establishes a rebuttable presumption of State responsibility for the violation of 
the rights to life and physical and mental integrity. 
 
Also, article 12 of the Convention Against Torture requires the competent authorities to 
undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 180 
 
that torture has been committed, and its article 7 requires State parties to prosecute suspected 
perpetrators of torture. The Commission on Human Rights has stressed in Resolution 2005/39 
(paragraph 3) &#8220; that all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment must be promptly and impartially examined by the competent national authority, that 
those who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of torture must be held responsible and 
severely punished, including the officials in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited 
act is found to have been committed, and [has taken] note in this respect of the Principles on the 
Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Principles) as a useful tool in efforts to combat torture&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 
Analogous obligations arise for your Government from the death of the men named in the case 
summaries above. As stated in the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of 
Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, international law requires your Government to 
carry out &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation[s] of all suspected cases of extra-legal, 
arbitrary and summary executions&#8221; (Principle 9). As noted by the Commission on Human Rights 
in Resolution 2005/34 (paragraph 4), this includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice 
those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or 
their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order 
to &#8230; prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. We would like to stress that, because of the 
above-mentioned presumption of State responsibility for deaths in custody, the obligation to pay 
compensation to the family members arises and remains even if it was not possible to clarify the 
circumstances of the death and the identity of the perpetrators. 
 
In drawing your Government&#8217;s attention to these principles of international law, we are of course 
aware of the difficult situation prevailing in Iraq at present and at the time of the alleged 
incidents, particularly the ongoing armed conflict in some parts of the country, the nearly daily 
barbaric attacks by terrorists and the activities of sectarian militias kidnapping and killing 
civilians on a daily basis. In this respect, we would like to recall the following considerations by 
the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions in his letter to your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government of 14 March 2006, a letter that has regrettably remained unanswered: 
</p>
<p> 
&#8220;First and foremost, reports suggest that in some instances the perpetrators of 
extrajudicial killings belong in fact to the forces of the Ministry of Interior or of the 
Ministry of Defence. In particular, the Mehdi Army and the Badr Organisation are 
reported to be active within the police. In this respect, I am also aware of reports 
according to which perpetrators dressed in police uniforms but in fact unrelated to the 
police are responsible for killings. The circumstance that some of the executions have 
been carried out by perpetrators impersonating police officers should not, however, serve 
as a reason to take the reports alleging executions perpetrated by actual police officers 
less seriously. 
</p>
<p> 
International human rights law requires your Government to take immediate steps to 
disarm all militias operating in Iraq. Where militias or their individual members have 
been lawfully integrated into the security forces, your Government must ensure that they 
are under the effective control of the competent authorities and act under the official, 
constitutional chain of command. The reported incidents, and all other incidents of similar 
gravity, must be thoroughly and independently investigated, both with a view to clarifying </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 181 
 
</p>
<p>to what extent the perpetrators belonged to or acted in collusion with the security forces, 
and in order to bring those responsible to justice. I have received reports that several 
inquiries have been started into previous cases of executions similar to those described 
above, but that they have been languishing without producing results whenever there are 
indications that security forces or militias connected to political parties in power are 
implicated. Clearly, in order to re-establish trust in the security forces and their readiness 
to protect all citizens (and other inhabitants) of Iraq, reports of killings involving the 
security forces must be given priority and be investigated all the more vigorously.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 
It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on Human Rights, 
reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly and extended by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to 
report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation 
and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above case summaries accurate?  
 
2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
examinations, and judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to these 
cases. If no inquiries have taken place or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
 
3. In the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, please provide the full details of 
any prosecutions which have been undertaken. Have penal, disciplinary or administrative 
sanctions been imposed on the alleged perpetrators? 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>4. Please provide the details of all the steps taken to disarm the militias active in Iraq, or &#8211; 
where their members have been lawfully integrated into the security forces &#8211; to ensure that they 
operate within the law and under the lawful chain of command, as well as to hold their members 
and commanders accountable.  
 
5. Have the families of the victims in the incidents described above compensated? Please 
provide details. 
</p>
<p> 
In closing this communication, we would like to stress that we are aware that the victims in all 
the incidents described above would appear to belong to the Sunni community. The fact that we 
are raising with your Government the cases described in this letter, and not incidents of equally 
deadly and condemnable terrorist attacks on security forces or Shiite civilians, does certainly not 
lie in any discrimination between the victims of the attacks. But your Government&#8217;s 
responsibility to protect the right to life of all the persons subject to its jurisdiction is all the more 
relevant and pressing, both in law and from a political point of view, when there are reports of 
participation in the killings of personnel belonging to the security forces and to militias 
connected to political parties in government.

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iraq has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
<b> 
Urgent appeal sent on 27 October 2006. 
 
</b>In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we 
have received regarding <b>Mohammad Munaf Mohammad al-Amin</b>, who holds dual American 
and Iraqi citizenship, <b>Yusuf Munaf Mohammad al-Amin</b>, <b>Salam Hikmat Mohammad 
Farhan al-Qassir</b>, <b>&#8216;Abd al-Jabbar &#8216;Abbas Jasim al-Salman</b>, <b>&#8216;Omar Jasim Mohammad &#8216;Ali 
al-Salman</b>, and <b>Ibrahim Yassin Kadhim Hussain al-Jibouri</b>. 
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, the six men named were sentenced to death by the 
Central Criminal Court of Iraq (CCCI) on 12 October 2006 for their alleged involvement in the 
kidnapping of three Romanian journalists in Iraq. The trial, which considered the case of all six 
defendants at the same hearing, is reported to have lasted about one hour. All six defendants face 
execution if the Court of Cassation upholds the CCCI&#8217;s verdict.  The men were reportedly 
tortured and threatened in pre-trial detention.  
</p>
<p> 
Mohammad Munaf Mohammad al-Amin is currently being held by the US armed forces at Camp 
Cropper near Baghdad airport. He has been in US custody since his capture in May 2005, under 
an agreement which allows pre-trial detainees awaiting criminal prosecution in Iraqi courts to be 
held in detention centres run by the Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I). He was reportedly held 
for months in US custody as a security internee before appearing before the CCCI. He is alleged 
to have subsequently made statements at Iraqi preliminary hearings admitting to having 
participated in the kidnapping of the journalists, but retracted his confession at trial. He claims 
that the confession was made after he received threats of violence and sexual assault against him 
and his family. 
</p>
<p> 
Mohammad Munaf Mohammad al-Amin is due to be transferred imminently to Iraqi custody. He 
has an application pending before a US district court for a temporary restraining order to prevent 
his transfer to Iraqi custody, on the grounds that his right to a fair trial may have been violated. 
However, the US government has argued that the US courts do not have jurisdiction in the case.  
</p>
<p> 
Muhammad Munaf Mohammad al-Amin was born in Iraq, and emigrated to the USA in 1990. In 
2001 he moved to Romania with his Romanian wife and three children. He accompanied the 
three kidnapped Romanian journalists to Iraq, acting as a guide and interpreter. The journalists 
were held for two months before being released unharmed during a military rescue operation in 
May 2005. Muhammad Munaf Mohammad al-Amin was arrested during the rescue operation, 
and was accused of posing as a kidnap victim and of involvement in the kidnapping plot. He 
denies these charges.   </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 183 
 
</p>
<p> 
The other five defendants are in Iraqi custody. Three of them have reportedly been tortured by 
being beaten with cables and the use of electric shocks in various parts of their bodies. However, 
their complaints were not considered by the court, and no investigation into the alleged torture is 
believed to have been initiated.  
</p>
<p> 
While we are fully aware of the most serious nature of the crimes these men have been found 
guilty of, we respectfully remind your Excellency that &#8220;in capital punishment cases, the 
obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in 
Article 14 of the (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) admits of no exception&#8221; 
(Little v. Jamaica, communication no. 283/1988, Views of the Human Rights Committee of 19 
November 1991, para. 10). Relevant to the cases at issue, these guarantees include the right not 
to be compelled to confess guilt and the right to adequate time and facilities for the preparation 
of one&#8217;s defence.  
</p>
<p> 
We also recall that Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/39 urges States to ensure that 
any statement, which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked 
in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made. This principle is an essential aspect of the right to physical and mental integrity set forth, 
inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p> 
Furthermore, we would like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to Resolution 2005/39 of the 
Commission on Human Rights reminded Governments that corporal punishment can amount to 
cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or even to torture. We would also like to draw your 
attention to the report of the Special Rapporteur on torture to the 60th session of the General 
Assembly, in which he, with reference to the jurisprudence of UN treaty bodies, concluded that 
any form of corporal punishment is contrary to the prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. He also noted that States cannot invoke 
provisions of domestic law to justify violations of their human rights obligations under 
international law, including the prohibition of corporal punishment and called upon States to 
abolish all forms of judicial and administrative corporal punishment without delay (para.28 
A/60/316). Both the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture have called 
for the abolition of judicial corporal punishment. In paragraph 5 of General Comment No. 20 
(1992), the Human Rights Committee stated that the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment must 
extend to corporal punishment, including excessive chastisement ordered as punishment for a 
crime of as an educative or disciplinary measure.   
</p>
<p> 
We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the 
rights under international law of the six men above are respected. This can only mean suspension 
of the capital punishment until the allegations of torture have been thoroughly investigated and 
all doubts in this respect dispelled. Moreover, international law requires that the accountability of 
any person guilty of subjecting these men to torture is ensured.  
</p>
<p> 
In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on 
Human Rights and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to 
clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the 
Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the

<p> 
1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
 
2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the allegations that

<b>Ireland: Death in Custody of Terence Wheelock 
 
Violation alleged: </b>Death in custody 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> 1 male 
<b> 
Character of reply:</b> Largely satisfactory response 
<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates the response provided by the Government of Ireland 
and would appreciate receiving the results of the inquest when it has been completed. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation sent on 11 May 2006 
</b> 
In this connection, I would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information I have 
received regarding the death of <b>Terence Wheelock</b> on 2 June 2005 while he was in Garda 
custody. According to the information I have received, Terence Wheelock, along with three 
others, was arrested at 12.10pm on the 2nd June, 2005, for an offence under Section 112, Road 
Traffic Acts (unauthorized taking of a vehicle). Two of those arrested were detained at Mountjoy 
Garda Station, while Wheelock and one other were detained at Store Street Garda Station 
arriving there at 12.20pm. He was placed in a cell at 12.25pm and between that time and 2.40pm 
he was checked in his cell on five occasions. On each visit, police report that all was found to be 
in order. At 2.40pm on checking the cell, Wheelock was not visible through the inspection hatch. 
The Garda on duty entered the cell and found Wheelock unconscious following an attempt to </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 185 
 
hang himself.  He could not be revived and was rushed to the Mater Hospital where he died three 
months afterwards, in September 2005, without having regained consciousness.  
 
Concerns have been raised in relation to the handling of this case by the Garda. It has been 
brought to my attention that Terence Wheelock was allegedly assaulted by police officers during 
his arrest. Once he was found unconscious, emergency aid was not immediately requested. In 
addition, Wheelock was reportedly taken out of his cell before the arrival of the medical 
personnel, contrary to basic first aid requirements. Other reports indicate that he had bruises and 
marks on his head and body. It has also been reported that the cell in which Wheelock was 
placed was forensically cleaned up despite a court order prohibiting such action.  
</p>
<p> 
My understanding is that the circumstances of his death are now subject of an enquiry as 
Detective Superintendent Oliver Hanley, Dun Laoghaire Garda Station, was appointed to 
examine the circumstances surrounding this incident. 
</p>
<p> 
Without in any way pre-judging the accuracy of the allegations I have received, I would like to 
receive information from your Government in relation to the results of the above mentioned 
inquiry. I am aware of the Garda regulations on the treatment of persons in Garda custody which 
your Government has shared with me further to my September 2005 request on the Garda 
S&#237;och&#225;na records of people who have died in custody. I would be grateful if your Government 
could indicate the extent to which these regulations were followed in the case of Terence 
Wheelock. 
<b> 
Response of the Government of Ireland dated 3 July 2006 
 
</b>Request for information on the death of Mr. Terence Wheelock by the UN Special Rapporteur on 
Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions 
 
<i>Background 
</i> 
1. The late Terence Wheelock was found hanging in his cell in Store Street Garda (police) 
Station in Dublin on 2 June, 2005. He was removed to hospital where he died a little more than 
three months later. 
<i> 
Investigation 
</i> 
2. A Detective Superintendent from outside the relevant Garda Division was appointed 
immediately after the incident to carry out a detailed investigation into all the circumstances 
surrounding Mr. Wheelock's arrest, detention and removal to hospital. 
 
The Garda authorities furnished the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a 
report on the matter and a copy of the Superintendent's investigation file was received on 2 
February, 2006. The file had also been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions who 
issued instructions that no prosecution should ensue. 
 
The Garda Superintendent's report concludes that the Criminal Justice Act 1984 (Treatment of 
Persons in Custody in Garda Sioch&#226;na Stations) Regulations, 1987 were fully complied with. In </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 186 
 
particular a custody record was completed, a notice of his rights was given to Mr. Wheelock and 
these rights were explained to him, a solicitor was contacted on his behalf, he was placed in a 
single cell and he was visited at approximately 30 minute intervals. There was no evidence of ill 
treatment 
<i> 
Further Developments 
</i> 
5. In the week following the incident, in the interest of health and safety of other persons who 
could be placed in the cell, renovations, including recessing the alarm buzzer panel into the cell 
wall were carried out. Photographs were taken of the ligature in situ before that work was carried 
out. The Garda Sioch&#226;na do not have knowledge of the Court Order referred to in the Special 
Rapporteur's correspondence. Furthermore, in September 2005, approximately 3 months after the 
incident, solicitors for the Wheelock family wrote to the Department expressing surprise that 
remedial works had been carried out. No reference was made in that correspondence to the 
existence of a Court Order. 
 
6. An inquest into Mr. Wheelock's death is ongoing at present. An inquest is an independent 
statutory inquiry to ascertain the cause of death and the Coroner has statutory duties and powers, 
including the power to call witnesses. The Coroner cannot consider questions of civil and 
criminal liability. Copies of the statements made in connection with the Gardaa Superintendent's 
investigation have been made available by the Garda Commissioner to the Coroner. The Minister 
for Justice Equality and Law Reform has offered financial assistance to the Weelock family to 
facilitate their legal representation at the inquest. He has also indicated that he will consider the 
matter further when the Inquest has been completed and a verdict returned. 
<i> 
Further information 
 
</i>7. Should the Special Rapporteur require further information the Irish authorities stand ready to 
assist in that regard.

I would like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s attention to our correspondence, (reflected in my report 
to the Commission on Human Rights E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.1 p. 122-125), relating to the death in 
custody of <b>Brian Rossiter</b> in a cell in Clomel Garda Station in September 2002.  In its response, 
your Excellency Government informed that an independent inquiry of the case was being 
conducted by Hugh Hartnett whose final report was to be published by the Minister for Justice, 
Equality and Law Reform. 
</p>
<p> 
As further indicated my observations I have made in my report, I would be grateful if your 
Government could provide me with a copy of Mr. Hartnett&#8217;s report.  
 
<b>Israel: Deaths of Civilians in the Gaza Strip 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Deaths due to attacks by the military 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> More than 170 persons 
<b> 
Character of reply:</b> No response (recent communication) 
<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving a response concerning these allegations. 
<b> 
Letter of allegation dated 30 November 2006 
 
</b>I am writing to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to express my concern about recent incidents 
involving the killing of civilians in the Gaza strip and Israel. I am also writing a letter to the 
Palestinian Authority, a copy of which is enclosed with this letter. 
 
According to reports received, on 8 November 2006 artillery shells fired by the Israeli Defense 
Forces at a cluster of houses in Beit Hanun in the Gaza Strip killed 18 Palestinians, including 14 
women and children. On 22 November 2006, Israeli Defense Forces reportedly killed a woman 
in her 30s and a 16-year-old boy, in addition to two gunmen from Hamas. On 24 November 
2006, in Beit Lahiya an Israeli Defense Forces sniper reportedly killed a 10-year-old boy, Abdel 
Aziz Salman. 
 
These three incidents are just a few recent examples of the consistently rising death toll since 
Israeli Defense Forces re-entered the Gaza Strip following the capture of Cpl Shalit. According 
to statistics of the non-governmental organization Physicians for Human Rights, between 28 
June and 27 October 2006 Israeli military action in the Gaza Strip directly caused the death of 
247 persons and the injury of another 996. 155 of the 247 dead (corresponding to more than 63 
percent) were civilians. According to the same statistics, 337 of those wounded, i.e. more than a 
third, were children. 
 
I do not consider it necessary to recall in any detail here the overall body of norms and principles 
of international humanitarian law and international human rights law applicable to the conduct of 
military operations by the Israeli Defense Forces in the Gaza Strip in general and to the incidents 
mentioned above in particular. These include several principles specifically aimed at minimizing </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 188 
 
civilian deaths in the course of military operations, such as the principle of distinction, the 
prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, the principle of proportionality, and the obligation to take 
all feasible precautions to avoid, and in any event to minimise, incidental loss of civilian life.  
 
I would like to recall, as noted in my 2006 annual report to the Commission on Human Rights, 
that &#8220;[t]he State obligation to conduct independent and impartial investigations into possible 
violations does not lapse in situations of armed conflict and occupation&#8221; (E/CN.4/2006/53, para. 
37). This includes the obligation, whenever a State receives allegations that someone has 
committed or ordered a grave breach - such as the &#8220;wilful killing&#8221; of a protected civilian<b> </b>&#8211; to 
investigate the matter and either try the suspected perpetrator before its own courts or extradite 
him to another State that has made out a prima facie case.<b> </b>Should the perpetrator be found guilty, 
the State must impose an effective penal sanction (ibid., para. 34). 
 
With respect to these obligations, I would like to learn: 
 
(i) whether your Government maintains statistics of the number of civilians the Israeli 
</p>
<p>Defense Forces have killed in the Gaza Strip since 28 June 2006; 
 
(ii) how many of these civilian deaths have been investigated, and whether such 
</p>
<p>investigations were carried out only internally by the Israeli Defense Forces or also by 
other authorities; 
</p>
<p> 
(iii) the outcome of the investigations your Excellency&#8217;s Government has carried out into the 
</p>
<p>reported killing of more than 170 civilians in the Gaza Strip since the end of June 2006; 
 
(iv) in my letter to your Government requesting a visit of 16 June 2006 I had expressed 
</p>
<p>particular concern &#8220;about the reported recent intensification of rocket fire on Israel from 
Gaza, the explosion killing seven civilians on a beach north of Gaza City on 9 June 2006, 
and the 11 June 2006 rocket attack by the Israeli Defence Forces on a vehicle allegedly 
carrying artillery and explosives, which resulted in the death of two Islamic Jihad 
militants and nine civilians&#8221;. Has your Government carried out independent 
investigations into the 9 and 11 June 2006 incidents (in addition to the internal IDF 
investigations) in the meantime? With what results? 
</p>
<p> 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and extended by the Human Rights Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. 
Since I am expected to report on these incidents to the Council, I would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the above matters. I undertake to ensure that your 
Government&#8217;s response to each of these questions is accurately reflected in the report I will 
submit to the Human Rights Council for its consideration. Please note that in order to include 
your Government&#8217;s response in my next report to the Human Rights Council, I would need to 
receive it before 15 January 2007. 
 
In the light of the reports received and of the questions these reports raise, I also would like to 
reiterate my request to conduct a visit to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories at the 
earliest possible date. The Palestinian Authority has indicated its consent to my request. I am </p>

confident that such a visit could take place in the same constructive spirit as my recent visit to 
Israel from 10 to 14 September 2006.

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Jamaica has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
<b> 
Letter of allegation dated 9 December 2005 </b>sent with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders<b> 
</b> 
I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received concerning 
<b>Lenford &#8216;Steve&#8217; Harvey</b>, Jamaica Aids Support for Life, an organization dedicated to preserving 
the dignity and rights of persons living with HIV/AIDS and providing education on related 
issues. 
 
</p>
<p>According to the information received, on 30 November 2005, at approximately 1:00 am, 
at least four assailants forcibly entered the home of Lenford Steve Harvey.  They 
reportedly tied him up, along with two other persons in the residence, and stole a number 
of possessions.  They then abducted Lenford Steve Harvey and took him away in his 
company car.  His body was found in a rural area miles from his home with gunshot 
wounds in his back and head. 
</p>
<p> 
Grave concern is expressed that the killing of Lenford Steve Harvey was related to his 
human rights work for Jamaica Aids Support for Life and his work for marginalized 
people and people living with HIV/AIDS in Jamaica and the Caribbean.   
 
</p>
<p>While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I would like to refer Your 
Excellency's Government to the fundamental principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right 
and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect 
Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 
and 2 which state that everyone has the right individually or in association with others, to 
promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms at the national and international levels&#8221; and that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility 
and duty to protect, promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter 
alia, by adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social, 
economic, political and other fields, as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that all 
persons under its jurisdiction, individually and in association with others, are able to enjoy all 
those rights and freedoms in practice&#8221;.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 190 
 
</p>
<p> 
Furthermore, I would like to bring your Excellency&#8217;s attention to the following provisions, and 
in particular:  
</p>
<p> 
&#8220;- article 12 paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration which provide that the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, 
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de 
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a 
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the Declaration. 
In this connection, everyone is entitled, individually and in association with others, to be 
protected effectively under national law in reacting against or opposing, through peaceful 
means, activities and acts, including those by omission, attributable to States that result in 
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as acts of violence 
perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the enjoyment of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 
I urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms 
of the aforementioned person are respected and accountability of any person guilty of the alleged 
violations ensured. I also request that your Government adopts effective measures to prevent the 
recurrence of these acts.  
 
Moreover, it is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on 
Human Rights and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to 
clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on these cases to the 
Commission, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following 
matters: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
 
2. Has a complaint been lodged?  
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical

<b> 
Follow-up letter dated 17 October 2006 </b>(to a letter of allegation sent on 16 November 2004)<b> 
 
</b>I would like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s attention to our correspondence, (reflected in my report

The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Kyrgyzstan has failed to cooperate with

<b>Letter of allegation dated 1 September 2006 </b>jointly with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of

</p>
<p> 
We would first like to assure you that we are conscious of the fact that States&#8217; obligation to 
protect and promote human rights requires them to take effective measures to combat terrorism. 
Further, we would like to underline that States must ensure that any measure taken to combat 
terrorism complies with their obligations under international law, in particular international 
human rights, refugee and humanitarian law. We view our mandates as Special Rapporteurs as a 
device to support and advise States in protecting and promoting human rights and fundamental 
freedoms while countering terrorism.  </p>

</p>
<p> 
We would like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention to the case of Mr.<b> 
Mohammadrafiq Kamoluddin, </b>imam of a mosque in the city of Kara-Suu, Mr. <b>Ayubkhodja 
Shahobidinov</b> and Mr. <b>Fathullo Rahimov</b>. According to the allegations we have received:   
</p>
<p> 
On 6 August 2006, the above-mentioned individuals were killed in the city of Osh as the 
result of an alleged counter terrorism operation, led by the National Security Service of 
Kyrgyzstan, in cooperation with the security forces of Uzbekistan. It has been reported 
that these individuals were suspected members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan 
and were planning to carry out a terrorist attack on the territory of the State of 
Uzbekistan. Other reports highlight that it was not alleged that Mr. Mohammadrafiq 
Kamoluddin was a member of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan or that he was 
involved in the commission of terrorist acts. 
</p>
<p> 
Without in any way implying any conclusion as to the facts of the case, I should like to appeal to 
your Excellency to seek clarification of these facts and circumstances.  I wish to remind you that 
while Governments have a responsibility to protect their own citizens and those of other States 
against the excesses of non-State actors or other entities, General Assembly resolution 59/191, in 
its paragraph 1, stresses that: &#8220;States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism 
complies with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, 
refugee and humanitarian law&#8221;, as does Security Council resolution 1456 (2003) in its paragraph 
</p><p>6. In this respect, I wish to stress my concern that empowering Governments to identify and kill 
&#8220;known terrorists&#8221; places no verifiable obligation upon them to demonstrate in any way that 
those against whom lethal force is used are indeed terrorists, or to demonstrate that every other 
alternative has been exhausted. (See the Report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions to the 61st Commission on Human Rights, E/CN.4/2005/7, at 
par. 41). 
 
We would also like to appeal to your Excellency's Government to ensure the right to freedom of 
religion or belief in accordance with the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief and article 18 of 
the Universal Declaration on Human Rights as well as of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. 
</p>
<p> 
Since we are expected to report to the Human Rights Council on all cases brought to our 
attention, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following 
matters: 
</p>
<p>    
</p><p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? In particular, does your 
</p>
<p>Government acknowledge that these killings were the result of a counter-terrorism 
operation carried out by your security forces on 6 August 2006? 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2. On what basis was it decided to kill, rather than capture, these three individuals? What 
</p>
<p>rules of national and international law does your Excellency&#8217;s Government consider to 
govern these incidents? Did the Government of Uzbekistan agree to carry out this 
operation with your Excellency&#8217;s Government? What rules of international law does your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government consider to govern this joint action? </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

3. Does your Excellency&#8217;s Government intend to provide compensation to the families of

<p>the three individuals killed in this operation? If so, what steps have been taken in this 
direction? 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>4. Please indicate what the legal basis for qualifying an individual or an entity as &#8220;terrorist&#8221; 
</p>
<p>under the law of Kyrgyzstan is. Please also indicate what the consequences are of such 
qualification. In this specific instance, what evidence did your Excellency&#8217;s government 
have at its disposal to determine that these individuals were in fact alleged terrorists? 
Were these individuals aware that this determination had been made?  
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>5. Lastly, please indicate what evidence your Excellency&#8217;s government had at its disposal to

crimes these were.  
 
</p>
<p>We remain at your disposal with regard to any questions or requests for any assessment that your

Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic: Killing of Hmong People near Vang Vieng

Subject(s) of appeal: </b>At least 26 persons

Character of reply:</b> Largely satisfactory response 
<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur notes the information provided by the Government of the Lao People&#8217;s 
Democratic Republic. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation dated 27 June 2006 
</b> 
I would like to bring your attention to reports I have received regarding <b>the killing of ethnic 
Hmong people</b> by governmental troops in northern Vientiane province.  The deadly attack, 
which is alleged to have taken place some 20 kilometres northeast of the tourist town of Vang 
Vieng on 6 April 2006, claimed the lives of at least 26 people, reportedly mostly women and 
children. Another four people were wounded.  
 
According to the information received, governmental troops launched their assault in the 
morning hours while the victims, reportedly unarmed, were searching for food outside of their 
hiding places in the jungle.  
</p>
<p> 
In raising my concerns with regard to the killing of civilians by military assault, I am aware of 
the existence of armed Hmong rebel groups that carry out attacks against governmental forces. 
However, I would like to bring to your attention that concerns have been expressed for the safety 
of the civilians that belong to Hmong groups living in hiding, some of whom are reportedly 
surrounded by Lao army units, struggling to find food and with no access to medical care.  
</p>
<p> 
Without pre-judging the accuracy of the allegations received, I would like to refer Your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which 
provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the person. 
</p>
<p> 
I would also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensue that all deaths that 
occurred in connection with the operation of 6 April 2006 are promptly, independently and 
thoroughly investigated in accordance with the United Nations Principles on the Effective 
Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions.  This principle 
was reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human Rights in Resolution 2005/34 on 
&#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;the 
obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Commission added that this obligation 
includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate 
compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to &#8230; prevent the recurrence of such 
executions&#8221;.  
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on this case to 
the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on 
the following matters: 
 
(i) Are the facts alleged above accurate? If not so, please describe the investigations carried 
</p>
<p>out to ascertain that the allegations are ill-founded. 
 
(ii) Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
</p>

civilians in northern Vientiane province. 
</p>

(iii) Please indicate whether compensation has been provided to the families of the victims. 
<b> 
Response of the Government of the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic 
</b> 
With reference to your letter of 27 June 2006, I wish to inform you that the allegation of the Lao 
People's Army troops killing ethnic Hmongs in the vicinity of Vangvieng district, Vientiane 
province on 6 April 2006 is simply groundless and non.-existent. It represents just a twin of the 
fabricated 2004 TV footage contending that &quot;about 30-40 LPA troops had raped and slain 5 
Hmong girls&quot;. 
 
In view of the foregoing renewed allegation, I would like to further clarify as follows: 
 
Since the proclamation of the Lao PDR in 1975, the Government has exerted every effort in 
leading the country to consolidate security and stability, heal wounds of the protracted and 
devastating aggressive war with special emphasis on economic revival and development, thus 
gradually improving the living conditions of our multi-ethnic people and moving the country out 
of the traps of abject poverty and backwardness. Thanks to an effective resettlement programme 
put in place by the Government, as part of its efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable 
development, more and more people of various ethnic groups are moving out from the rugged 
and isolated mountain areas to join in the development village project. Yet, it is inevitable that 
there would be bandits shooting and looting commercial and passenger vehicles on some 
occasions during the past years. At present, however, those thugs are so constrained that they are 
no longer in a position to carry out their banditry acts en route. There is no opposition party or 
anti-government force whatsoever in the Lao PDR. 
 
Despite the incredible information and unreasonable complaint from some anonymous foreigners 
who could not identify the source and witness of the case, except a reference to just &quot;it was 
reported as such&quot;, the Lao Government urgently formed an investigation team comprising of 
officials from the Ministry of National Defense and Ministry of Public Security to conduct 
inquiry into the allegation, in cooperation with the District Security and Military Commands as 
well as the District and Village authorities and local people and report the findings to the 
government. After thorough investigation, it was found that no one was aware of the incident. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 196 
 
Nor was there any evidence or sign of an attack and civilian casualties of any kind. Moreover, 
there has been no communication dispatched by the local people to any concerned authorities. 
Had there been any such incident as claimed, what pretext could they have got for justifying their 
ignorance? This reality has led the Lao authorities concerned to the conclusion that the alleged 
incident is false, groundless and non-existent, and is proved to be merely a fabrication made up 
by some malevolent outfits abroad to harm the reputation of the Lao People's Army. The 
fabricated story was also premeditated to cause concern and fear to foreign tourists and visitors 
who love natural sceneries and have interest in the Lao PDR's tourism attractions, particularly in 
the neighbourhood of the tourist town of Vanvieng. The Lao PDR Government and people as 
well as inhabitants of the District reaffirm that there are no Hmong or other ethnic resistance 
forces in Laos. The authorities and people of the district are well aware that the so-called 
individuals or civilians hiding in the jungle do not exist. Although there are some population 
living sparsely in the rugged mountain regions who had hidden themselves from the horrible 
bombardments by the imperialist aggressors during the war time remaining,  . . they are in no 
way sieged by LPA troops. Conversely they are participating increasingly in the development 
village or development village group projects in line with policy of the Government. 
 
Given the lack of evidence and victims of the alleged incident reported by the investigation team, 
there were no requests for medical examination or individual inquiry and no casualties -
whatsoever. Therefore, no compensation has been paid to any person 
 
The Lao People's Army is highly disciplined, committed to protect the people's lives and 
properties as well as to assist them in earning their livings and improving their living conditions. 
In carrying out their duties the Lao People's Army is bound to stringently follow its military rules 
and regulations, staying alert of machinations of evil-minded individuals aimed at driving a 
wedge between the people and the Army. Up tell now, no complaint or lawsuit regarding the 
incident has been filed to the Lao government or its relevant agencies either at the local or the 
central levels. This indicates that the allegation is flawed and fictional. 
 
We sincerely hope that the clarifications mentioned above would help the international 
community and various organs of the United Nations to realize this case and trust the Lao 
People's Army, a highly disciplined and well-trained armed force with a high moral standard, 
which grew up from the age-long struggle for national independence and freedom of the Lao 
multi-ethnic people, and is presently tasked to safeguard peace and security of the Lao people 
and contribute to socio-economic development of the country.

Urgent appeal dated 31 October 2006 sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture</b> 
</p>
<p> 
We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received 
concerning a serious incident which took place in the Tripoli Abu Salim Prison, which reportedly 
led to the death of one prisoner and the injuring of at least nine others.  According to the 
allegations received, on 4 October 2006, some 190 prisoners were brought back to Abu Salim 
Prison following a hearing at a court in Tripoli. Upon their return to the Abu Salim prison, some 
of the prisoners started to protest and an altercation ensued with the prison guards. The prison 
administration called in security forces from outside the prison to assist the guards in order to 
control the situation. Between 2pm and 3pm law-enforcement officials reportedly fired tear-gas 
grenades and live ammunition at some of the prisoners. A prisoner, <b>Hafed Mansur Al-Zwai</b>, 
received a bullet to the head and died shortly afterwards. Nine other prisoners, <b>Rida Al-Hariri</b>, 
<b>&#8216;Abd Al-Mun&#8217;em Ahmad &#8216;Abd Al-Rahman</b>, <b>Hafed Al-Amani</b>, <b>Fadlallah Al-&#8216;Arabi</b>, <b>Al-
Sanussi Al-Bashari</b>, <b>Ayman Al-Busufi</b>, <b>Ashraf Al-Fazzani</b>, <b>&#8216;Abd Al-Wahab Al-Katshi</b> and 
<b>Khaled Al-Mansuri</b>, were injured and taken to hospital for treatment. Most of them received 
bullet wounds and are reportedly still be in a serious condition. 
</p>
<p> 
Abdallah Senoussi, a top security official, reportedly told the detainees to reveal the name of the 
detainee who had informed the media about the incident by the end of 9 October, telling them 
that all detainees would be attacked if they failed to do so. 
</p>
<p> 
Without in any way implying any conclusion as to the facts of the case, we urge your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to protect the physical and mental 
integrity of all the prisoners and guarantee that the practices of law-enforcement officials inside 
Abu Salim prison are consistent with international human rights standards, such as the UN Code 
of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and 
Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.  
</p>
<p> 
Principle 4 of the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Officials, 
provides that, &#8220;Law enforcement officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, 
apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force and firearms.&#8221;  Furthermore, 
Principle 5 provides that, &#8220;Whenever the use of force and firearms is unavoidable law

<p> 
Concerning the ultimatum given to the prisoners to reveal the name of the detainee who 
&#8220;informed the media&#8221; of the incidents in  Abu Salim prison, we would like to stress that each 
Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. </p>

This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.We would also like to draw your Government&#8217;s 
attention to paragraph 8 of Resolution 2005/39 of the Commission on Human Rights. Paragraph 
8 reminds Governments that, as described in article 1 of the Convention against Torture, which 
your Government acceded to in 1989, intimidation and coercion, including serious and credible 
threats, as well as death threats, (&#8230;) can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or to 
torture. 
</p>
<p> 
Furthermore, we would also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure that all 
deaths that occurred in connection with the incidents in the Abu Salim prison on 4 October 2006 
are promptly, independently and thoroughly investigated in accordance with the United Nations 
Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary 
Executions.  This principle was reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human Rights in 
Resolution 2005/34 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all 
States have &#8220;the obligation (&#8230;) to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all 
suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Commission added that 
this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, (&#8230;) to 
grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and to 
adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to (&#8230;) prevent the 
recurrence of such executions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 
It is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Commission on Human Rights 
and extended by the Human Rights Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. 
Since we are expected to report on this case to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful 
for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1.  Are the facts alleged above accurate? If not so, please describe the investigations carried 
out to ascertain that the allegations are ill-founded. 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2.  Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the death of Mr. Hafed 
Mansur Al-Zwai and the prisoners that were injured during the incidents in Abu Salim prison.

<p> 
3.  Please indicate whether compensation has been provided to the families of the victims 
 
<b>Response of the Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya dated 13 November 2006 
</b> Revolt by a number of prisoners at the Abu Salim Reform and Rehabilitation Institute. 
 
The Department of Public Prosecutions launched an investigation into the incidents that occurred 
at the Abu Salim Reform and Rehabilitation Institute on Wednesday, 4 October 2006, where a 
number of prisoners and detainees staged a revolt.  The Department of Public Prosecutions took 
all the steps required by law, questioning security personnel and guards of the officer class and 
other ranks.  It also questioned inmates who were not involved in the incident.  The investigation 
revealed that several detainees being held at the Institute while on trial had returned from a 
session at which the court had decided to defer consideration of their case until a later date, at the </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 199 
 
request of the defence.  When they entered the Institute, they occupied a number of 
administrative offices and threatened to set fire to them.  At the same time, they incited the other 
prisoners to join them and moved towards the main entrance which they proceeded to occupy, 
jeopardizing the security and safety of the Institute as well as the safety of prisoners, guards and 
prison staff.  The officer in charge of the Institute went to the men to try to restore calm and 
convince them to return to their cells.  They attempted to assault him and a number of police 
guards, several of whom were injured.  The management had to call the General Security 
Department for reinforcements.  After a major effort, the General Security contingent and a 
group of guards managed to get back into the Institute.  At this point, the prisoners started to pelt 
the police with stones and pieces of iron that they had stolen from the site of the company 
carrying out maintenance work at the Institute.  A number of men climbed the walls and 
windows in a bid to escape, compelling the guards on the roofs and at the main entrances to 
discharge their weapons in order to gain control of the situation.  As a result, three prisoners 
received injuries of different kinds and were taken to hospital.  The General Security officers 
who had been called in to help with the protection of the Institute made a great effort to force the 
prisoners back into their cells.  Direct clashes between the police and the prisoners ensued, with 
the police being bombarded with iron pieces, screwdrivers and water pipes.  In the clashes, eight 
policemen were injured, two of them slightly and the six others with various injuries, for which 
they were hospitalized.  The names of these persons are: 
</p><p> 
1. Muhi al-Din Ashur al-Sabuni, second lieutenant, General Department of General Security 
 
2. Mohammed Izz al-Din Salim bin Farj, policeman, General Department of General 
Security 
 
3. Murad Ali al-Ziyyani, policeman, General Department of General Security 
 
4. Mohammed Bashir Ghayth Hamid, policeman, General Department of General Security 
 
5. Al-Najih Khalifah Abdallah, assistant officer, Internal Security Department 
 
6. Usamah Khalifah Abdallah, corporal, Internal Security Department 
 
After the prisoners had returned to their cells, one person was found lying on the floor.  Upon 
examination, he was found to be dead. 
 
The investigation showed that the dead prisoner, Hafiz Mansur al-Zawi, had been imprisoned in 
connection with case No. 120/98.  The pathologist&#8217;s report indicated that the cause of death was 
a single injury sustained when the head of the deceased had collided with a body, cracking the 
skull and precipitating a fatal haemorrhage.  The report ruled out a gunshot wound as the cause 
of death.  The relatives of the deceased were notified of the death and of the conclusions of the 
medical report and the Department of Public Prosecutions ordered that the body be released to 
the family for burial. 
 
According to the investigation, three prisoners had been injured, namely: 
 
1. Ayman Ali al-Busayfi </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 200 
 
 
2. Al-Sanusi Mohammed al-Bashari 
 
3. Fadlallah Mohammed al-Mughayrbi 
 
These persons sustained various injuries and were taken to hospital for treatment.  The 
Department of Public Prosecutions took their statements. 
 
The investigation will continue until the testimony of prisoners associated with, or involved in 
the incident, and that of some of the Institute&#8217;s personnel has been heard.  The medical report has 
been annexed to the case file. 
 
The persons who carried out these acts are known Islamic extremists who were arrested and 
investigated in the course of recent years.  They were charged with belonging to a proscribed 
organization, carrying out acts of murder, sabotage and terrorism, stealing weapons, forging 
passports and documents, and killing foreigners.  They were originally tried before the People&#8217;s 
Court, but when that Court was abolished, pursuant to Act No. 7/2006, their case was transferred 
to the Criminal Court, a court which specializes in dealing with terrorist crimes, organized 
killings and sabotage and which was established by the Judicial Authority Act No. 51/1976.  The 
Court held several sessions in 2005-2006. The Prosecutor-General personally oversaw the 
conduct of the investigation and the application of due process.  He entrusted Mohammed Abd 
al-Wahhab Salim, Chief of the Department of Public Prosecutions for southern Tripoli, with the 
investigation.

Libyan Arab Jamahiriya: Disappearances from Abou Slim Prison 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Disappearance; Non-respect of international standards relating to the 
imposition of capital punishment 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> 3 males 
<b> 
Character of reply:</b> No response (recent communication) 
<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving a response concerning these allegations. 
<b> 
Urgent appeal dated 30 November 2006 
 
</b>I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received concerning 
the disappearance of <b>Ali Omar Al Gamoudi</b>, <b>Aissa Bachir Al Magrahi</b> and <b>Aboubekr Khelifa 
Al Rabbah</b> from the Abou Slim prison.  
</p>
<p> 
The three men were sentenced to death on 21 December 2004 and were detained since then at the 
Abou Slim prison. According to the information received, they initiated a hunger strike after the 
security forces intervened inside the prison on 4 October 2006, which resulted in one casualty </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 201 
 
and 9 wounded among the detainees (incident for which I sent a communication to your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government on 31 October 2006). 
</p>
<p> 
The three men were reportedly taken away by security forces on 23 October 2006 to an unknown 
destination. To date, their families ignore their whereabouts as they have not been transferred to 
any other place of detention. Fears have been expressed that they might have been executed in 
retaliation for their involvement in the hunger strike. 
</p>
<p> 
Without wishing to prejudge the accuracy or otherwise of the facts reported, I would like to draw 
your attention to the fact that a person&#8217;s due process rights and the right to be treated humanely 
do not come to an end with the imposition of the death sentence. A lack of transparency 
regarding the post-conviction process and timetable for execution implicates two sets of rights.  
The first is that the failure to provide notice to the accused of the timing of his execution may 
undermine due process rights. Most notably, in addition to &#8220;the right to his conviction and 
sentence being reviewed by a higher tribunal&#8221; (ICCPR Article 14(5) the death row prisoner has 
&#8220;the right to seek pardon or commutation of the sentence&#8221; (ICCPR Article 6(4)).  The 
uncertainty and seclusion inflicted by opaque processes compromise this right.  In addition, and 
regardless of the actual due process consequences, to conceal from someone the facts of their 
preordained fate will constitute inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p> 
Moreover, for the prisoner and for his or her family a lack of transparency in what is already a 
harrowing experience &#8212; waiting for one&#8217;s execution &#8212; can result in &#8220;inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment&#8221; within the meaning of Article 7 of the ICCPR.  The views of the 
Human Rights Committee in a recent decision that responded to an individual complaint 
illustrate this matter. The Human Rights Committee found that &#8220;[t]he complete secrecy 
surrounding the date of execution, and the place of burial and the refusal to hand over the body 
for burial have the effect of intimidating or punishing families by intentionally leaving them in a 
state of uncertainty and mental distress.&#8221; This amounted to inhuman treatment in violation of 
Article 7 of the ICCPR (Human Rights Committee, Communication No. 886/1999: Belarus, 
para. 10.2, 77th Sess., April 28, 2003, CCPR/C/77/D/886/1999).   
</p>
<p> 
In view of the urgency of the matter, I therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all 
measures to guarantee that the rights under international law of Ali Omar Al Gamoudi, Aissa 
Bachir Al Magrahi and Aboubekr Khelifa Al Rabbah are respected.  
</p>
<p> 
I would also appreciate if your Excellency&#8217;s Government could provide full information relating 
to the detainees&#8217; whereabouts.

<b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Malaysia has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
<b> 
Letter of allegation dated 6 March 2006</b> sent with the Special Rapporteur on the human rights 
situation of migrants<b> 
</b> 
We would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to information we have 
received alleging the killing of <b>five migrant workers</b> by agents from the Department of 
Immigration belonging to a volunteer service known as &#8220;RELA&#8221;.  
 
According to the information received the bodies of five migrant workers were recovered from a 
lake in Selayang area of Malaysia's capital city of Kuala Lumpur from 11 to 13 February 2006 
following a raid by the RELA immigration officials. Two of the five bodies were recovered from 
the lake - a flooded open cast-mining pit - late on 11 February 2006 and the remaining three on 
12 and 13 February 2006.  
 
According to eyewitnesses, in the early hours of 11 February 2006, the Immigration Department 
conducted a raid on Selayang&#8217;s open market where many migrants work. Migrant workers were 
heard screaming for help while RELA officers shouted that they would kill the migrants if they 
ran away.  
 
We are aware that the Malaysian government has issued a statement in which it refuted these 
allegations and explained that the operation carried out by RELA officers went smoothly and 
involved only the checking of the documents of foreign workers, some of whom managed to run 
away.  
 
Our understanding is that autopsies were conducted on four of the bodies on 13 February 2006 
while the fifth one, identified as being Mr. Zaw Oo, a Burmese migrant, was not taken to hospital 
and was buried immediately. Reports indicate that the bodies showed no signs of stab or slash 
wounds and that they were too badly decomposed to be able to tell whether they had been beaten 
with batons, such as those carried by RELA volunteers.  
 
The overall circumstances of these deaths and the way in which they have been presented by 
some observers serve to emphasize the importance of ensuring that a thorough investigation be 
undertaken and that it not be left to the officials involved or those working closely with them.  
Ideally an independent investigation, based on thorough police and forensic work would be 
undertaken, and the results made public. 
 
In this regard we note the importance attached by international human rights law to 
investigations being conducted in a prompt and effective manner in such situations (CHR 
resolution 2004/37, para 6; Human Rights Committee, General Comment 31, para. 15). 
Similarly, Principle 9 of the United Nations Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions provides that the purpose of the 
investigation shall be to determine the cause, manner and time of death, the person responsible, 
and any pattern or practice which may have brought about that death. It shall include an adequate </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 203 
 
autopsy, collection and analysis of all physical and documentary evidence and statements from 
witnesses. The investigation shall distinguish between natural death, accidental death, suicide 
and homicide.  
 
It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on Human Rights 
to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since we are expected to report on this case 
to the Commission, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the 
following matters: 
 
1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? Please provide the names and 
casualties that resulted from the operation.  
 
2. Given the allegations that the &#8220;RELA&#8221; personnel are members of a volunteer reserve who 
reportedly lack adequate training, command and accountability, please provide details about their 
chain of command, especially in relation to their relationship with the Malaysian immigration 
department. 
 
3. What were the aims of this operation?  
 
4. Please provide a copy of the rules of engagement that were in effect during this operation. 
 
5. Please provide the details and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
examinations, and judicial or other inquiries that may have been carried out by the competent 
authorities in relation to this case as well as the steps taken to ensure that the provisions 
contained in the aforementioned international legal instruments are respected.

En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente de Su Gobierno la informaci&#243;n que 
hemos recibido sobre el abogado y defensor de derechos humanos <b>Dante Almaraz</b>.  De acuerdo 
a dicha informaci&#243;n: 
</p>
<p> 
El 26 de enero de 2006 Dante Almaraz fue asesinado con un arma de fuego por hombres 
no identificados, mientras conduc&#237;a en el centro de Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, Estado de Chihuahua. 
En efecto, seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, en dicha fecha el veh&#237;culo del Sr. Almaraz  fue 
interceptado por otro veh&#237;culo tripulado por varios hombres no identificados, quienes le 
dispararon en repetidas ocasiones. Durante dicho ataque result&#243; herido uno de sus 
acompa&#241;antes. La Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de Derechos Humanos ya hab&#237;a ordenado al 
Estado de M&#233;xico tomar todas las medidas necesarias para proteger la integridad de 
Dante Almaraz. 
 
Dante Almaraz era un reconocido abogado defensor de derechos humanos de Ciudad 
Ju&#225;rez. Antes de su muerte hab&#237;a defendido a V&#237;ctor Javier Garc&#237;a Uribe, quien al parecer 
habr&#237;a sido torturado con el fin de que confesara la autor&#237;a del homicidio de 8 mujeres en 
</p><p>2001. El Sr. Garc&#237;a Uribe fue condenado a 50 a&#241;os de prisi&#243;n. Asimismo, seg&#250;n la 
informaci&#243;n recibida, la familia de Dante Almaraz habr&#237;a recibido varias amenazas 
an&#243;nimas de muerte, con el fin de que &#233;ste no continuara con la defensa del Sr. Garc&#237;a 
Uribe. Este &#250;ltimo fue liberado como resultado de un recurso de apelaci&#243;n. 
 
Por otra parte, otro abogado que particip&#243; en la defensa de los acusados del caso de los 8 
homicidios en Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, Mario Escobedo Anaya,  habr&#237;a resultado muerto en una 
persecuci&#243;n llevada a cabo por la polic&#237;a en Febrero 2002. Su defendido, el Sr. Gustavo 
Gonz&#225;lez Meza, muri&#243; en prisi&#243;n en el a&#241;o 2003.   
</p>
<p> 
Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n del 
Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre las Directrices de los Principios b&#225;sicos sobre la funci&#243;n de los 
abogados, adoptados por el Octavo Congreso de las Naciones Unidas sobre Prevenci&#243;n del 
Delito y Tratamiento del Delincuente, La Habana, 27 de agosto a 7 de septiembre de 1990 y en

para evitar que se repitan tales hechos. 
 
Tambi&#233;n quisi&#233;ramos instar al Gobierno de su Excelencia a que adopte todas las medidas 
necesarias para garantizar el derecho de la persona mencionada a no ser v&#237;ctima de cualquier 
forma de violencia por cuestiones de g&#233;nero, discriminaci&#243;n y abuso. A este fin, quisi&#233;ramos 
llevar a la atenci&#243;n de su Excelencia la Declaraci&#243;n sobre la eliminaci&#243;n de la violencia contra la 
mujer, aprobada por la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, que establece que la mujer 
tiene derecho, en condiciones de igualdad, al goce y la protecci&#243;n de todos los derechos humanos 
y libertades fundamentales en las esferas pol&#237;tica, econ&#243;mica, social, cultural, civil y de cualquier 
otra &#237;ndole. Entre estos derechos figuran, (a) el derecho a la vida; (b) el derecho a la igualdad; (c) 
el derecho a la libertad y la seguridad de la persona; y (d) el derecho a igual protecci&#243;n ante la 
ley (art&#237;culo. 3). Adem&#225;s, tambi&#233;n estipula que todos los estados deber&#225;n proceder con la debida 
diligencia a fin de prevenir, investigar y, conforme a la legislaci&#243;n nacional, castigar todo acto de 
violencia contra la mujer, ya se trate de actos perpetrados por el Estado o por particulares 
(art&#237;culo 4 (c)).  
</p>
<p> 
En este contexto, deseamos llamar tambi&#233;n la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de Su Excelencia para que 
considere las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n sobre el derecho y el deber de 
los individuos, los grupos y las instituciones de  promover y proteger los derechos humanos y las 
libertades fundamentales universalmente reconocidas y en particular los art&#237;culos 1 y 2. Estos 
establecen,  respectivamente, que toda persona tiene derecho, individual o colectivamente, a 
promover y procurar la protecci&#243;n y realizaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades 
fundamentales en los planos nacional e internacional y que es la responsabilidad primordial y el 
deber de todos los Estados de proteger, promover y hacer efectivos todos los derechos humanos, 
adoptando las medidas necesarias para crear las condiciones sociales, econ&#243;micas, pol&#237;ticas y de 
otra &#237;ndole, as&#237; como las garant&#237;as jur&#237;dicas requeridas para que toda persona sometida a su 
jurisdicci&#243;n, individual o colectivamente, pueda disfrutar en la pr&#225;ctica todos esos derechos y 
libertades.  
 
Es nuestra responsabilidad de acuerdo con los mandatos que nos han entregado la Comisi&#243;n de 
Derechos Humanos, los cuales  han sido reforzados por las resoluciones pertinentes de la 
Asamblea General, intentar conseguir clarificaci&#243;n sobre los hechos llevados a nuestra atenci&#243;n.  
En nuestro deber de informar sobre esos casos a la Comisi&#243;n, estar&#237;amos muy agradecidos de 
tener su cooperaci&#243;n y sus observaciones sobre los siguientes asuntos:

En relaci&#243;n con la tercera pregunta, se informa que la necropsia se realiz&#243; el mismo d&#237;a de los

determinaron que la causa de la muerte hab&#237;a sido una laceraci&#243;n encef&#225;lica y choque 
hipovol&#233;mico consecutivo a heridas producidas por proyectiles de arma de fuego en cr&#225;neo, cuello 
y torax.  
 
En lo concerniente a la cuarta pregunta, se exponen los siguientes datos: 
 
La Directora de Atenci&#243;n a V&#237;ctimas del Delitos, y personal especializado en materia de 
psicolog&#237;a, estuvieron pendientes de brindar el apoyo necesario a los deudos desde et momento en 
que la autoridad recibi&#243; noticias del hecho. Adem&#225;s, se les acompa&#241;&#243; durante et proceso de 
identificaci&#243;n y en las exequias. 
 
El 31 de enero de 2006, la Procuradora General de Justicia se reuni&#243; con los parientes del Lic. 
Sergio Dante Almaraz, para informarles acerca de la investigaci&#243;n y para presentarles a los 
encargados de realizarla, asimismo, se les ha brindado informaci&#243;n oportuna de los progresos 
realizados dentro de la investigaci&#243;n. 
 
El Ministerio P&#250;blico determin&#243;, para efectos de protecci6n y con fundamento en lo ordenado en et 
articulo 120, inciso a) del C&#243;digo de Procedimientos Penales del Estado de Chihuahua, establecer 
las medidas particulares de vigilancia de los domicilios de los familiares del Lic. Sergio Dante 
Almaraz Mora. 
 
Se han practicado diversas diligencias con el objeto de recolectar las pruebas pertinentes para la 
comprobaci&#243;n de la probable responsabilidad de quien perpetr&#243; el delito; para tal efecto, se han 
recabado diversos testimonios y se han establecido diversas l&#237;neas de investigaci&#243;n. 
 
Para responder a la &#250;ltima pregunta, le informo que, ya que a&#250;n no se ha ejercido la acci&#243;n penal 
en contra de ninguna persona, no es procedente el otorgamiento de la reparaci&#243;n del da&#241;o, pero en 
cuanto se haya cumplido con los requisitos establecidos por la ley, et Ministerio P&#250;blico 
promover&#225; lo necesario para que se haga efectiva la reparaci&#243;n del da&#241;o. </p>

Observaciones del Relator Especial 
 
</b>El Relator Especial lamenta que el Gobierno de M&#233;xico no haya cooperado con el mandato 
otorgado al Relator Especial por la Asamblea General y la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos.<b>  
</b> 
<b>Llamamiento urgente del 1 de septiembre de 2006 
 
</b>Quisiera llamar la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre la informaci&#243;n que he recibido en relaci&#243;n con 
los actos de intimidaci&#243;n en contra de la madre y las hermanas de <b>S&#243;crates Tolentino Gonz&#225;lez 
Genaro</b>, quien muri&#243; bajo custodia policial en Zapotitl&#225;n Tablas, estado de Guerrero, en enero 
de 2004. 
 
Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 14 de julio de 2006, dos agentes de la polic&#237;a municipal fueron 
detenidos por el homicidio de S&#243;crates Gonz&#225;lez Genaro. A partir de esta fecha,  la madre del 
se&#241;or Genaro, Luc&#237;a Genaro, as&#237; como sus 5 hijas, habr&#237;an sido v&#237;ctimas de amenazas y actos de 
intimidaci&#243;n. 
 
El 17 de julio de 2006, tres desconocidos se habr&#237;an presentado en el domicilio de <b>Luc&#237;a 
Genaro</b>. Como ella se encontraba ausente, los desconocidos le habr&#237;an dejado un mensaje con 
sus vecinos, mensaje en el que le informaban de las detenciones, le pon&#237;a una cita para el d&#237;a 
siguiente y la amenazaban dici&#233;ndole que si no asist&#237;a algo malo podr&#237;a sucederle. <b> 
</b> 
El 19 de julio, dos hombres sin identificar acudieron a la casa del sobrino de Luc&#237;a Genaro y le 
preguntaron por una joven rubia que a veces se alojaba all&#237;. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, 
cuando el sobrino de Luc&#237;a Genaro se neg&#243; a responder, los dos hombres le dijeron que 
secuestrar&#237;an a la joven si su madre no colaboraba con ellos. Luc&#237;a Genaro cree que los hombres 
buscaban a su hija,  <b>Erika Gonz&#225;lez Genaro</b>, cuya apariencia coincide con la descripci&#243;n hecha 
por los dos desconocidos. 
 
El 23 de julio, tres hombres sin identificar habr&#237;an presentado en la casa de Luc&#237;a Genaro pero al 
no encontrarla se habr&#237;an marchado. 
</p>
<p> 
Es importante se&#241;alar que esta no es la primera vez que la familia de S&#243;crates Gonz&#225;lez Genaro 
es v&#237;ctima de amenazas y actos de intimidaci&#243;n. A trav&#233;s de una carta enviada a su gobierno el 2 
de junio del 2004, mi predecesora en este mandato sobre ejecuciones extrajudiciales, sumarias o 
arbitraras,<b> </b>la Sra. Asma Jahangir<b>, </b>ya hab&#237;a expresado su preocupaci&#243;n con relaci&#243;n a las 
m&#250;ltiples amenazas de muerte que la familia del Se&#241;or Genaro habr&#237;a recibido en el 2004 por 
parte de miembros de la  polic&#237;a municipal. </p>

En este contexto, me gustar&#237;a instar a su gobierno a adoptar sin demora todas las medidas 
necesarias para garantizar la seguridad del los familiares del Se&#241;or Genaro. A este respecto, me 
permito llamar su atenci&#243;n sobre los Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n 
de las ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, Resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 del 24 de mayo de 
1989 del Consejo Econ&#243;mico y Social. En particular, llamo la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre el 
principio15 seg&#250;n el cual  &#8220;Los querellantes, los testigos, quienes realicen la investigaci&#243;n y sus 
familias ser&#225;n protegidos de actos o amenazas de violencia o de cualquier otra forma de 
intimidaci&#243;n. Quienes est&#233;n supuestamente implicados en ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o 
sumarias ser&#225;n apartados de todos los puestos que entra&#241;en un control o poder directo o indirecto 
sobre los querellantes, los testigos y sus familias, as&#237; como sobre quienes practiquen las 
investigaciones&#8221;. 
 
Igualmente, quisiera llamar la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre los principios 9 y 19 de  los 
Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones extralegales, 
arbitrarias o sumarias. De acuerdo  a estos dos principios, los Gobiernos deben proceder a una 
investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de todos los casos en que haya sospecha de tales 
ejecuciones o amenazas; publicar en un informe las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; y 
velar por que sean juzgadas las personas que la investigaci&#243;n haya identificado como 
participantes en tales ejecuciones, en cualquier territorio bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n.  
 
De acuerdo con el mandato que nos ha entregado la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos, mandato 
reforzado por las resoluciones pertinentes de la Asamblea General, es nuestra responsabilidad 
intentar conseguir clarificaci&#243;n sobre los hechos llevados a nuestra atenci&#243;n.  En nuestro deber 
de informar sobre esos casos al Consejo de Derechos Humanos, estar&#237;amos muy agradecidos de 
tener su cooperaci&#243;n y sus observaciones sobre los asuntos siguientes: 
 
1.  &#191;Son exactos los hechos referidos?  
 
2. Si fueron presentadas quejas o denuncias,  &#191;cuales  han sido las respuestas  a las mismas 
y  las acciones referidas en las respuestas? 
 
3.  Por favor, proporcione los detalles as&#237; como los resultados de las &#250;ltimas diligencias 
judiciales o de otro tipo, realizadas en relaci&#243;n a la muerte del Sr. S&#243;crates Tolentino Gonz&#225;lez 
Genaro. 
 
4.    Por favor, indique si alguna compensaci&#243;n  ha sido  otorgada a la familia del se&#241;or S&#243;crates 
Tolentino Gonz&#225;lez Genaro. A este respecto, me gustar&#237;a se&#241;alar que la presunci&#243;n de la 
responsabilidad estatal en casos de muerte bajo custodia significa, <i>inter alia, </i>que los Estados 
deben suministrar reparaci&#243;n a las familias de las v&#237;ctimas, en ausencia de pruebas de que el 
Estado no fue responsable de la muerte bajo custodia. 
 
6.   &#191;Cuales son las acciones tomadas o planeadas para garantizar la seguridad del los familiares 
del Se&#241;or S&#243;crates Tolentino Gonz&#225;lez Genaro y prevenir la repetici&#243;n de tales incidentes en el 
futuro?

Observaciones del Relator Especial 
 
</b>El Relator Especial lamenta que el Gobierno de M&#233;xico no haya cooperado con el mandato 
otorgado al Relator Especial por la Asamblea General y la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos.<b>  </b>El 
Relator Especial nota con precocupaci&#243;n que a pesar de haber mandado tres comunicaciones 
durante un per&#237;odo de dos meses, continuan muriendo manifestantes debido al uso excesivo de la 
fuerza por parte de las fuerzas de seguridad.  
<b> 
Carta de alegaci&#243;n del 12 de Septiembre de 2006 </b>mandada con el Relator Especial sobre la 
tortura<b> 
</b> 
En el ejercicio de nuestros mandatos respectivos, deseamos poner en su conocimiento las 
denuncias que hemos venido recibiendo con relaci&#243;n a violaciones de derechos humanos 
cometidas por presuntos miembros de las fuerzas de seguridad del Estado, durante el mes de 
Agosto de 2006 en Oaxaca. 
 
Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, se teme que las fuerzas de seguridad hayan sido responsables de 
la muerte de por lo menos dos personas desde el 10 de agosto. De acuerdo a nuestras fuentes, ese 
d&#237;a, el Sr. <b>Jos&#233; Jim&#233;nez Colmenares</b> habr&#237;a fallecido y varias personas habr&#237;an resultado 
heridas, luego de que presuntos polic&#237;as dispararan  en varias ocasiones contra la multitud que 
participaba en una marcha pac&#237;fica. De manera similar, el 22 de agosto, el Sr. <b>Lorenzo San 
Pablo Cervantes</b> habr&#237;a muerto debido a un disparo en la espalda, despu&#233;s de que presuntos 
miembros de las fuerzas de seguridad abrieran fuego contra unos manifestantes que se 
encontraban en la radiodifusora &#8220;la Ley 710&#8221;.  
 
De acuerdo a la informaci&#243;n que hemos recibido, las fuerzas de seguridad tambi&#233;n habr&#237;an sido 
responsables de malos tratos y torturas infligidas a ciudadanos en Oaxaca.  
 
El 10 de agosto, el bi&#243;logo <b>Ramiro Arag&#243;n P&#233;rez</b> y los Sres. <b>Elionai Santiago S&#225;nchez</b> y <b>Juan 
Gabriel R&#237;os</b>, habr&#237;an sido detenidos y golpeados por presuntos agentes ministeriales que 
viajaban en veh&#237;culos sin placas. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, los agresores casi estrangularon 
al Sr. Sanchez y lo golpearon en el abdomen, las costillas y la cara. Posteriormente, los tres 
hombres habr&#237;an sido entregados a la Procuradur&#237;a del estado de Oaxaca, quien los acus&#243; de 
posesi&#243;n ilegal de armas de fuego. El 12 de Agosto, el Sr. Sanchez y el Sr. Rios quedaron en 
libertad bajo fianza, pero el Sr. Ramiro Arag&#243;n Perez continua detenido en la prisi&#243;n de Zimatl&#225;n 
de Alvarez y se teme que pueda ser sometido a torturas o malos tratos. Los tres hombres afirman 
que los cargos en su contra son falsos.

El 17 de Agosto, habr&#237;a sido detenido el Sr. Renato Cruz Morales, L&#237;der de la Central Campesina 
Cardenista en su oficina ubicada en la ciudad de Tuxtepec. El Sr. Cruz habr&#237;a sido trasladado a 
Veracruz, donde se le habr&#237;a torturado y posteriormente se le habr&#237;a amenazado para que no 
denunciara lo sucedido. Tanto la Procuradur&#237;a General de la Rep&#250;blica como la Procuradur&#237;a 
General del Estado dicen desconocer los hechos. Sin embargo, testigos habr&#237;an se&#241;alado que el 
se&#241;or Cruz fue detenido por polic&#237;as ministeriales. El se&#241;or Cruz, habr&#237;a sido dejado en libertad 
gracias a la intervenci&#243;n de un Diputado Federal y de varias organizaciones. 
  
Con relaci&#243;n a estos incidentes, nos gustar&#237;a se&#241;alar que no es la primera vez que recibimos 
denuncias sobre violaciones de derechos humanos cometidas en Oaxaca durante este a&#241;o. A 
trav&#233;s de tres cartas enviadas a su Gobierno el 29 de junio, el 15 de Agosto y el 29 de Agosto de 
2006, el Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n, 
ya hab&#237;a manifestado su preocupaci&#243;n por el clima de violencia que se vive actualmente en 
Oaxaca y de manera particular, por los ataques contra varios medios de comunicaci&#243;n, 
periodistas y miembros o simpatizantes de la Asamblea Popular del Pueblo de Oaxaca (APPO).      
 
En estas circunstancias, y sin implicar de antemano una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos aqu&#237; 
descritos,  nos gustar&#237;a instar  a su Gobierno a que tome todas las medidas necesarias para 
impedir que se cometan nuevos actos de violencia en el estado de Oaxaca.  
 
Igualmente, nos gustar&#237;a llamar la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre algunos principios 
fundamentales del derecho internacional, que resultan particularmente relevantes en el contexto 
de esta carta.   
 
Con relaci&#243;n a la muerte de los Se&#241;ores Jos&#233; Jim&#233;nez Colmenares y Lorenzo San Pablo 
Cervantes, nos permitimos llamar la atenci&#243;n sobre  los Principios relativos a una eficaz 
prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, resoluci&#243;n 
1989/65 del 24 de mayo de 1989 del Consejo Econ&#243;mico y Social. En particular, llamamos la 
atenci&#243;n sobre los principios 9 y 19 seg&#250;n los cuales, los Gobiernos deben proceder a una 
investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de todos los casos en que haya sospecha de tales 
ejecuciones o amenazas; publicar en un informe las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; y 
velar por que sean juzgadas las personas que la investigaci&#243;n haya identificado como 
participantes en tales ejecuciones, en cualquier territorio bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n.  
 
Con respecto a aquellos incidentes en los que presuntos miembros de las fuerzas de seguridad 
habr&#237;an disparado en varias ocasiones contra los participantes de una marcha pac&#237;fica, nos 
permitimos recordar los principios 4 y 5 de los Principios B&#225;sicos sobre el Empleo de la Fuerza y 
de Armas de Fuego por los Funcionarios Encargados de Hacer Cumplir la Ley. Seg&#250;n el 
principio 4 &#8220;Los funcionarios encargados de hacer cumplir la ley, en el desempe&#241;o de sus 
funciones, utilizar&#225;n en la medida de lo posible medios no violentos antes de recurrir al empleo 
de la fuerza y de armas de fuego&#8221;. En esta misma perspectiva, el principio 5 recuerda que 
&#8220;Cuando el empleo de las armas de fuego sea inevitable, los funcionarios encargados de hacer 
cumplir la ley,  a) Ejercer&#225;n moderaci&#243;n y actuar&#225;n en proporci&#243;n a la gravedad del delito y al 
objetivo leg&#237;timo que se persiga; b) Reducir&#225;n al m&#237;nimo los da&#241;os y lesiones y respetar&#225;n y 
proteger&#225;n la vida humana; c) Proceder&#225;n de modo que se presten lo antes posible asistencia y 
servicios m&#233;dicos a las personas heridas o afectadas; d) Procurar&#225;n notificar lo sucedido, a la 
menor brevedad posible, a los parientes o amigos &#237;ntimos de las personas heridas o afectadas&#8221;. </p>

Elionai Santiago S&#225;nchez, Juan Gabriel R&#237;os y Renato Cruz Morales, nos gustar&#237;a llamar la

la Resoluci&#243;n 2005/39 de la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos. El p&#225;rrafo 3 de dicha resoluci&#243;n, 
destaca en particular que &#8220;todas las denuncias de torturas u otros tratos o penas crueles, 
inhumanos o degradantes deben ser examinadas sin dilaci&#243;n y de manera imparcial por las 
autoridades nacionales competentes y que quienes instigan, ordenan, toleran o perpetran actos de

ha cometido el acto prohibido, deben ser declarados responsables de sus actos y severamente 
castigados&#8221;.

<b>Carta de alegaci&#243;n del 30 de octubre de 2006</b> mandada con el Relator Especial sobre la tortura<b> 
</b> 
En el ejercicio de nuestros mandatos respectivos, deseamos poner en su conocimiento las 
denuncias que hemos venido recibiendo con relaci&#243;n a violaciones de derechos humanos </p>

cometidas por presuntos miembros de las fuerzas de seguridad del Estado, durante el mes de 
octubre de 2006 en Oaxaca. 
 
Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, El 14 de octubre, varios desconocidos dispararon contra un grupo 
de simpatizantes de la Asamblea Popular del Pueblo de Oaxaca (APPO) que se encontraban 
protestando. El <b>Sr. Alejandro Garc&#237;a Hern&#225;ndez</b> muri&#243; como consecuencia de los disparos y 
otras dos personas resultaron heridas. Seg&#250;n nuestras fuentes, uno de los desconocidos que 
dispar&#243; contra los manifestantes perdi&#243; su billetera en la huida, incidente que habr&#237;a permitido 
identificarlo como miembro del ej&#233;rcito.  
 
Por otro lado, el 8 de octubre, el estudiante <b>Pedro Garc&#237;a Garc&#237;a</b> habr&#237;a quedado en libertad 
bajo fianza despu&#233;s de permanecer una semana detenido en una prisi&#243;n de Tlacolula, estado de 
Oaxaca. Seg&#250;n se nos informa, mientras se encontraba detenido, el Sr. Pedro Garc&#237;a Garc&#237;a fue 
golpeado en repetidas ocasiones y amenazado de violaci&#243;n. Al Sr. Garc&#237;a se le detuvo por robo y 
porte de arma, pero este &#250;ltimo cargo fue posteriormente retirado. Se alega que los cargos en 
contra del Sr. Garc&#237;a son falsos y se sospecha que pueden hab&#233;rsele imputado por motivos 
pol&#237;ticos.  
  
Nos gustar&#237;a se&#241;alar que no es la primera vez que recibimos denuncias sobre este tipo 
violaciones de derechos humanos en el estado de Oaxaca. Precisamente, 12 de Septiembre de 
este a&#241;o, enviamos una carta a su Gobierno con relaci&#243;n a la muerte de los Se&#241;ores<b> Jos&#233; 
Jim&#233;nez Colmenares y Lorenzo San Pablo Cervantes </b>debido a disparos efectuados por 
presuntos miembros de las fuerzas de seguridad. En esa oportunidad tambi&#233;n se puso en

torturas a las que habr&#237;an sido sometidos los Se&#241;ores <b>Ramiro Arag&#243;n P&#233;rez, Elionai Santiago 
S&#225;nchez, Juan Gabriel R&#237;os</b> y <b>Renato Cruz Morales</b> mientras se encontraban bajo custodia 
policial.  
 
A trav&#233;s de una carta enviada el 22 de Agosto de 2006, el Gobierno de su Excelencia nos 
inform&#243; que intentaba solucionar por la v&#237;a del di&#225;logo el conflicto social que se vive en el 
Estado de Oaxaca, y que se encontraba implementando acciones tendientes a favorecer el 
acercamiento entre el Gobierno de Oaxaca, el magisterio e integrantes de la APPO (p&#225;rr. 8).  
 
Quisi&#233;ramos dejar constancia de nuestro agradecimiento al Gobierno de Su Excelencia por la 
informaci&#243;n proporcionada y saludar sus esfuerzos para encontrar una soluci&#243;n pac&#237;fica a este 
conflicto. Sin embargo, le recordamos que aun no hemos recibido respuesta a nuestra carta del 
12 de septiembre y que continuamos recibiendo nuevas denuncias  provenientes de Oaxaca.  
</p>
<p> 
En estas circunstancias, y sin implicar de antemano una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, hacemos un 
llamado al  Gobierno de Su Excelencia para que nos proporcione informaci&#243;n detallada sobre las 
medidas adoptadas para garantizar la investigaci&#243;n de las violaciones mencionadas en esta carta 
y en aquella del 12 de septiembre, as&#237; como el procesamiento y castigo de las personas 
responsables de dichas violaciones. Igualmente, quisi&#233;ramos conocer las acciones 
implementadas por su Gobierno para que este tipo de incidentes no se repitan. 
 
A este respecto, nos gustar&#237;a llamar la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre los Principios relativos a

y sobre el p&#225;rrafo 3 de la Resoluci&#243;n 2005/39 de la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos. El p&#225;rrafo 
3 de dicha resoluci&#243;n estipula que &#8220;todas las denuncias de torturas u otros tratos o penas crueles, 
inhumanos o degradantes deben ser examinadas sin dilaci&#243;n y de manera imparcial por las 
autoridades nacionales competentes y que quienes instigan, ordenan, toleran o perpetran actos de 
tortura, incluidos los funcionarios encargados del lugar de detenci&#243;n donde se determine que se 
ha cometido el acto prohibido, deben ser declarados responsables de sus actos y severamente 
castigados&#8221;. 
 
De acuerdo con el mandato que nos ha entregado la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos, mandato 
reforzado por las resoluciones pertinentes de la Asamblea General, es nuestra responsabilidad 
intentar conseguir clarificaci&#243;n sobre los hechos llevados a nuestra atenci&#243;n.  En nuestro deber

De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida: 
</p>
<p> 
El 29 de octubre de 2006 <b>Alberto Jorge L&#243;pez Bernal</b> muri&#243; a consecuencia del impacto que 
sufri&#243; por una bomba de gas lacrim&#243;geno en el est&#243;mago, durante su participaci&#243;n en una 
manifestaci&#243;n de la Asamblea Popular de los Pueblos de Oaxaca (APPO). 
</p>
<p> 
El 27 de octubre <b>Bradley Wheyler</b>, camar&#243;grafo de la agencia de prensa &#8220;Indymedia&#8221; muri&#243; 
cuando cubr&#237;a una manifestaci&#243;n de la mencionada APPO a consecuencia de un disparo en el 
pecho, supuestamente disparado cuando miembros de la polic&#237;a municipal, de la alcald&#237;a, y de la 
seguridad p&#250;blica abrieron fuego contra una barricada levantada por los manifestantes.  
 
Durante los enfrentamientos del mismo  27 de octubre, <b>Osvaldo Ram&#237;rez</b>, fot&#243;grafo del diario 
&quot;Milenio&quot;, result&#243; herido en la pierna en un tiroteo. 
 
Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, quisi&#233;ramos hacer un llamamiento 
al Gobierno de su Excelencia para que tome  las medidas necesarias para asegurar que el derecho 
a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n sea respetado, de acuerdo con los principios enunciados 
en el art&#237;culo 19 de la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de los Derechos Humanos, y reiterados en el 
art&#237;culo 19 del Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos: &quot;Nadie podr&#225; ser molestado a 
causa de sus opiniones. Toda persona tiene derecho a la libertad de expresi&#243;n; este derecho 
comprende la libertad de buscar, recibir y difundir informaciones e ideas de toda &#237;ndole, sin 
consideraci&#243;n de fronteras, ya sea oralmente, por escrito o en forma impresa o art&#237;stica, o por 
cualquier otro procedimiento de su elecci&#243;n&quot;.  
</p>
<p> 
Sin implicar de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los incidentes descritos, deseamos llamar la 
atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la 
Declaraci&#243;n Universal de Derechos Humanos  y el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y 
Pol&#237;ticos. Los art&#237;culos 3 y 6 de estos instrumentos garantizan a todo individuo el derecho a la 
vida y a la seguridad de su persona y disponen que este derecho sea protegido por la ley y que 
nadie sea arbitrariamente privado de su vida. 
 
Consideramos apropiado tambi&#233;n hacer referencia a  la resoluci&#243;n 2005/38 de la Comisi&#243;n de 
Derechos Humanos, la cual insta a los estados a que garanticen que las v&#237;ctimas de violaciones al 
derecho a la libertad de expresi&#243;n puedan interponer recursos eficaces para investigar 
efectivamente las amenazas y actos de violencia, as&#237; como los actos terroristas, dirigidos contra 
los periodistas, incluso en situaciones de conflicto armado, y llevar ante la justicia a los 
responsables de esos actos, para luchar contra la impunidad. 
</p>
<p> 
Dicha resoluci&#243;n tambi&#233;n reafirma que el derecho de reuni&#243;n pac&#237;fica y de asociaci&#243;n, adem&#225;s 
del derecho a participar en la direcci&#243;n de los asuntos p&#250;blicos guardan una estrecha relaci&#243;n con 
el derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y expresi&#243;n, y en este contexto llama a los Estados a que 
adopten todas las medidas necesarias para poner fin a las violaciones de estos derechos, y creen 
las condiciones necesarias para impedir tales violaciones. 
</p>
<p> 
Quisi&#233;ramos instar a su Gobierno que adopte todas las medidas necesarias  para proteger los 
derechos y las libertades de las personas mencionadas e  investigar, procesar e imponer las </p>

sanciones adecuadas a cualquier persona responsable de las violaciones alegadas. Quisi&#233;ramos 
asimismo instarle a que tome las medidas eficaces para evitar que se repitan tales hechos.

llamamos la atenci&#243;n sobre los principios 9 y 19 seg&#250;n los cuales, los Gobiernos deben proceder 
a una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de todos los casos en que haya sospecha de

<b>Carta de alegaci&#243;n mandada el 12 de septiembre de 2006 </b>con el Relator Especial sobre la 
tortura<b>  
</b> 
Deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n de su gobierno con relaci&#243;n a la muerte en detenci&#243;n del Sr. <b>Jes&#250;s 
Hern&#225;ndez P&#233;rez</b> y las alegaciones de malos tratos y/o torturas que se le habr&#237;an infligido.  
 
Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 22 de julio de 2006, alrededor de las 8:50 p.m, el Sr. <b>Jes&#250;s 
Hern&#225;ndez P&#233;rez</b>, ind&#237;gena <i>tsotsil</i>, habr&#237;a fallecido en el Centro de Readaptaci&#243;n Social 
(CERESO) No. 14, en el municipio de Cintalapa, Chiapas. De acuerdo a nuestras fuentes, el 
subdirector del Centro habr&#237;a dicho a la esposa del Sr. Hernandez, la Sra. Elena L&#243;pez P&#233;rez, que 
su esposo hab&#237;a fallecido debido a &#8220;una comida que le hab&#237;a ca&#237;do mal&#8221;.  
 
El cad&#225;ver de l Sr. Hernandez habr&#237;a sido entregado a su esposa el 23 de julio de 2006. Seg&#250;n la 
informaci&#243;n recibida, la Sra. Elena L&#243;pez P&#233;rez habr&#237;a observado que ten&#237;a un  &#8220;<i>moret&#243;n&#8221;</i> en la 
boca y &#8220;<i>rasgu&#241;os&#8221;</i> en la cara. Por otro lado, el acta de defunci&#243;n entregada a la viuda se&#241;alar&#237;a 
que fue un tipo de defunci&#243;n: &#171; <i>violenta</i> &#187;, lo cual hace temer a los familiares del  Sr. Jes&#250;s 
Hern&#225;ndez P&#233;rez, que su muerte  haya sido la consecuencia de malos tratos y/o actos de tortura 
perpetrados dentro del Penal. 
 
En estas circunstancias,  nos permitimos se&#241;alar que a trav&#233;s de una carta enviada a su Gobierno 
el 25 de julio de 2006, el Relator Especial sobre la tortura ya hab&#237;a manifestado su preocupaci&#243;n 
con relaci&#243;n a una serie de incidentes ocurridos al interior del CERESO n&#176; 14, incidentes en los 
que  varios reclusos habr&#237;an sido agredidos de manera verbal y f&#237;sica por otros internos con la 
anuencia de las autoridades penitenciarias. 
 
En este contexto y sin implicar de antemano una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, deseamos instar a 
su Gobierno a que investigue la muerte de Sr.<b> </b>Jes&#250;s Hern&#225;ndez P&#233;rez e imponga las sanciones 
adecuadas a cualquier persona que se halle responsable. A este respecto, llamamos la atenci&#243;n de 
su gobierno sobre  los Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las 
ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 del 24 de mayo de 1989 del 
Consejo Econ&#243;mico y Social. En particular, llamamos la atenci&#243;n sobre los principios 9 y 19 
seg&#250;n los cuales, los Gobiernos deben proceder a una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e 
imparcial de todos los casos en que haya sospecha de tales ejecuciones o amenazas; publicar en 
un informe las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; y velar por que sean juzgadas las personas 
que la investigaci&#243;n haya identificado como participantes en tales ejecuciones, en cualquier 
territorio bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n.  
  
Igualmente me permito llamar la atenci&#243;n de su gobierno sobre el Pacto Internacional de 
Derechos Civiles y pol&#237;ticos, seg&#250;n el cual nadie podr&#225; ser privado de la vida arbitrariamente. 
Cuando el Estado detiene a un individuo, este debe proteger los derechos del detenido con gran 
diligencia. Como consecuencia, cuando un individuo muere bajo custodia del Estado, existe una 
presunci&#243;n de la responsabilidad estatal. A este respecto, me permito recordar la conclusi&#243;n del 
Comit&#233; de Derechos Humanos con relaci&#243;n a la muerte bajo custodia en el caso <i>Dermit Barbato 
v. Uruguay (</i>comunicaci&#243;n 84/1981): &#8220; Si bien el Comit&#233; no puede llegar a una conclusi&#243;n 
definitiva sobre si Hugo Dermis cometi&#243; suicidio, fue impulsado a cometerlo o fue muerto de 
otro modo mientras estaba encarcelado, la conclusi&#243;n ineludible es la de que, en cualquier 
circunstancia, las autoridades uruguayas fueron responsables, por acci&#243;n u omisi&#243;n, de no haber </p>

adoptado medidas adecuadas para proteger su vida conforme exige el p&#225;rrafo 1 del art&#237;culo 6 del 
Pacto &#8220; 
 
Finalmente, quisiera instar al Gobierno de su Excelencia a tomar todas las medidas necesarias 
para garantizar las condiciones m&#237;nimas de seguridad y de respeto de la integridad f&#237;sica y 
psicol&#243;gica de todas las personas que se encuentran detenidas en el Centro de Readaptaci&#243;n 
Social (CERESO) No. 14. A este respecto, llamamos la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre las Reglas 
m&#237;nimas para el tratamiento de los reclusos, adoptadas por el Consejo Econ&#243;mico y Social en sus 
resoluciones 663C (XXIV) del 31 de julio de 1957 y 2076 (LXII) del 13 de mayo de 1977,  as&#237; 
como sobre el Conjunto de Principios para la protecci&#243;n de todas las personas sometidas a 
cualquier forma de detenci&#243;n o prisi&#243;n, adoptado por la Asamblea General en su resoluci&#243;n 
43/173 del 9 de diciembre de 1988. 
   
Es nuestra responsabilidad, de acuerdo con los mandatos que nos ha entregado la Comisi&#243;n de 
Derechos Humanos y que est&#225;n reforzados por las resoluciones pertinentes de la Asamblea 
General, intentar conseguir clarificaci&#243;n sobre los hechos llevados a nuestra atenci&#243;n. En nuestro

Le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial appr&#233;cie les renseignements fournis par le Gouvernment du Maroc sur son 
engagement de respecter le droit international relatif aux questions d&#8217;immigration et d&#8217;asile. Le 
Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial note cependant que ces renseignements ne r&#233;futent ni ne r&#233;pondent aux 
all&#233;gations selon lesquelles les agents des forces de l&#8217;ordre marocaines sont responsables des morts 
de migrants survenues en septembre 2005.  
<b> 
Communication envoy&#233; le 7 octobre 2005 </b>avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur les droits de l'homme 
des migrants  
 
Dans le cadre de nos mandats, nous sommes charg&#233;s d&#8217;analyser les informations que nous 
recevons concernant des all&#233;gations de violations des droits de l&#8217;homme. Dans ce contexte, nous 
aimerions attirer l&#8217;attention de votre gouvernement sur des all&#233;gations re&#231;ues dans le courant du 
mois de septembre 2005 relatives &#224; une s&#233;rie d&#8217;incidents au cours desquels plusieurs migrants 
d&#8217;origine subsaharienne seraient morts suite &#224; des blessures par balle ou des mauvais traitements 
inflig&#233;s par les forces de l&#8217;ordre que surveillent les fronti&#232;res entre Ceuta et Melilla avec le 
Maroc.  
 
Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 29 ao&#251;t 2005, vers les 2 heures du matin un groupe d&#8217;environs 
cinquante migrants aurait tent&#233; de traverser clandestinement la fronti&#232;re qui s&#233;pare le Maroc et la 
ville autonome de Melilla (Espagne) en se divisant en trois groupes d&#8217;environ 16 personnes. La 
tentative aurait &#233;t&#233; violemment repouss&#233;e par des membres de la garde civile espagnole qui 
aurait utilis&#233; du mat&#233;riel anti-&#233;meute. Cependant, huit membres du groupe auraient r&#233;ussi &#224; 
traverser la fronti&#232;re.  
 
Selon les rapports re&#231;us, des agents de la garde civile espagnole auraient battu les migrants 
restants avec la crosse de leurs fusils et avec des matraques &#233;lectriques avant de les renvoyer en 
territoire marocain par une porte de service situ&#233;e entre les points &#171; A7 &#187; et &#171; A8 &#187; sur la 
fronti&#232;re entre Melilla et le Maroc. Joseh Abunaw Ayukabang, un camerounais de 17 ans, aurait 
&#233;t&#233; transport&#233; par ses compagnons vers un bosquet o&#249; il serait d&#233;c&#233;d&#233; &#224; la suite des coups re&#231;us.  
 
Un d&#8217;entre eux, soutenu par d&#8217;autres membres du groupe, serait mort peu apr&#232;s son retour sur le 
territoire marocain. Le migrant mort aurait &#233;t&#233; identifi&#233; comme &#233;tant Joseph Abunaw 
Ayukabang, un citoyen camerounais de 17 ans. Le jeune aurait &#233;t&#233; victime de coups r&#233;p&#233;t&#233;s au 
ventre inflig&#233;s par un des membres de la garde civile, avant d&#8217;&#234;tre expuls&#233; par la porte de service 
de la fronti&#232;re.  
 
Des t&#233;moins auraient indiqu&#233; qu&#8217;ils auraient vu le corps sans vie de l&#8217;autre migrant bless&#233; pr&#232;s 
de la barri&#232;re et que le cadavre aurait &#233;t&#233; r&#233;cup&#233;r&#233; par des membres de la gendarmerie 
marocaine. Cependant, ils n&#8217;auraient pas r&#233;ussi &#224; s&#8217;approcher suffisamment du corps pour 
l&#8217;identifier.  
 
D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues, les autorit&#233;s de l&#8217;h&#244;pital de Nador auraient &#233;mis un 
communiqu&#233; confirmant l&#8217;existence d&#8217;un seul corps.  
 
Nous avons &#233;galement re&#231;u des renseignements concernant la mort, survenue le 12 septembre 
2005 &#224; l&#8217;h&#244;pital communal de Melilla, d&#8217;un migrant d&#8217;origine subsaharienne qui aurait &#233;t&#233; bless&#233; </p>

par des agents des forces de l&#8217;ordre marocains le 8 septembre 2005. D&#8217;autres sources indiquent 
cependant que le migrant se serait bless&#233; accidentellement le m&#234;me jour.  
 
Nous avons &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; inform&#233; de la mort d&#8217;un migrant d&#8217;origine subsaharienne qui aurait &#233;t&#233; 
bless&#233; &#224; la gorge puis transf&#233;r&#233; le 15 septembre 2005 &#224; l&#8217;h&#244;pital communal de Melilla. 
 
Enfin, cinq personnes seraient d&#233;c&#233;d&#233;es &#224; la suite de blessures par balle lors de la tentative de 
quelques 500 &#224; 600 migrants de traverser en masse la fronti&#232;re entre le Maroc et la ville de Ceuta 
le 29 septembre 2005. Par ailleurs, huit personnes auraient &#233;t&#233;s transport&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;h&#244;pital de 
T&#233;touan pour des blessures par balles en caoutchouc, mat&#233;riel anti-&#233;meute qui serait utilis&#233; par la 
garde civile espagnole. Il semble que lors de cet incident, des membres des forces de l&#8217;ordre 
marocaines se serait align&#233;es devant la fronti&#232;re et auraient tir&#233; sur les migrants avec des fusils. 
 
Il est de notre responsabilit&#233;, en vertu des mandats qui nous ont &#233;t&#233; confi&#233;s par la Commission

<b>R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement du Maroc du 11 janvier 2007 </b>&#224; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation du 7 octobre 
2005 (see E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.1, pp. 144-147) 
 
Dans sa lutte contre la migration ill&#233;gale, le Maroc exerce un droit l&#233;gitime qui consiste &#224; veiller au 
respect de sa l&#233;gislation interne en mati&#232;re d'entr&#233;e et de s&#233;jour des &#233;trangers sur son territoire, en 
plein respect des droits de l'Homme et des libert&#233;s fondamentales. 
</p>
<p> 
II est &#224; rappeler que la loi 02-03 du 11 novembre 2003, relative &#225; l'entr&#233;e et au s&#233;jour des &#233;trangers au 
Maroc, &#225; l'&#233;migration et l'immigration irr&#233;guli&#233;res, accorde toutes les garanties n&#233;cessaires aux 
&#233;trangers et conf&#233;re une protection particuli&#233;re aux cat&#233;gories vuln&#233;rables, notamment, les femmes 
enceintes et les mineurs. Elle conforte ainsi les dispositions du Code P&#233;nal qui incrimine la 
discrimination bas&#233;e sur la race, l'ethnie, la langue ou la religion. 
 
Dans le cadre de la responsabilit&#233; r&#233;gionale partag&#233;e, le Maroc a organis&#233;, avec ses moyens propres, 
des ponts a&#233;riens d'envergure qui ont permis, depuis 2004, le rapatriement vers leurs pays d'origine 
de plus de 6.600 migrants irr&#233;guliers, sur la base du volontariat, dans le respect de la dignit&#233; des </p>

ont toujours exprim&#233; leur gratitude &#225; notre pays pour tous les efforts d&#233;ploy&#233;s. 
 
De m&#234;me, l'Organisation Mondiale pour les migrations a organis&#233; un pont a&#233;rien pour le 
rapatriement vers leur pays d'origine, de plusieurs migrants irr&#233;guliers. Les repr&#233;sentants de cette 
Organisation ont pu constater le respect par le Maroc de tous les droits des migrants irr&#233;guliers et se 
sont assur&#233;s du caract&#232;re volontaire du rapatriement, de m&#234;me qu'ils ont visit&#233; les installations et les 
dispositifs mis en place par le Gouvernement marocain en faveur de ces personnes avant leur 
rapatriement. 
 
II y a lieu de signaler qu'aucune plainte n'a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;e aupr&#233;s des autorit&#233;s marocaines comp&#233;tentes 
concernant des all&#233;gations de mauvais traitement d'immigr&#233;s irr&#233;guliers. 
 
Concernant la question des r&#233;fugi&#233;s, le Maroc respecte pleinement ses engagements internationaux, 
mais souligne qu'une majorit&#233; des demandeurs d'asile sont fondamentalement des migrants 
&#233;conomiques. 
</p>
<p> 
Ce point a &#233;t&#233; largement discut&#233; avec des responsables du HCR qui ont admis, le bien fond&#233; de la 
position marocaine au sujet du risque majeur que peut constituer l'octroi syst&#233;matiquement du 
certificat d'enregistrement &#225; tout demandeur d'asile sur l'encouragement de l'afflux de migrants 
ill&#233;gaux, de m&#234;me qu'ils ont affirm&#233; l'intention de leur Organisation &#224; am&#233;liorer le syst&#232;me 
d'enregistrement en vigueur et &#224; faire preuve davantage de rigueur dans l'octroi des certificats. Ils ont 
aussi pr&#233;cis&#233; qu'ils allaient diligenter une enqu&#234;te pour d'&#233;ventuels actes de corruption visant &#225; 
faciliter l'obtention de ces certificats. 
 
Le Maroc adh&#232;re &#224; l'ensemble des instruments juridiques internationaux ayant pour vocation la 
protection des droits des migrants et l'am&#233;lioration de l'efficience des syst&#232;mes juridiques nationaux 
en la mati&#233;re. 
 
La gestion de la probl&#233;matique migratoire ne peut &#234;tre confin&#233;e dans une logique d'incrimination 
d'un seul pays pour r&#233;gler une question qui rel&#232;ve fondamentalement de la responsabilit&#233; r&#233;gionale

<b>Letter of allegation dated 22 August 2006 
 
</b>I would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government information I have 
received, according to which, on 1 January 2005, <b>Julencio Gove</b> was shot by a policeman in the 
Southern city of Matola.  Allegedly, 21 year old Gove was killed in the Matola neighborhood of 
T3 after he attempted to intervene on behalf of a young woman who was being beaten by 
policemen on the street.   
 
According to the information received, Gove was on his way home when he came across this 
incident.  He was threatened by an armed policeman who warned him not to interfere.  When 
Gove insisted on advocating for the young woman, he was fatally shot by a policeman.   
 
In this connection, I would like to remind Your Excellency&#8217;s government of the fundamental 
principles that apply to such an incident under international law.  Article 6 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his 
life.  Law enforcement officials may employ lethal force only when there is no alternative and 
doing so is strictly unavoidable to protect life.  (Human Rights Committee, Suarez de Guerrero 
v. Colombia, Communication No. 45/1979, para. 13.3; UN Basic Principles on the Use of 
Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, &#167; 9.)  Otherwise, an execution is &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; and, as 
such, unlawful whenever an individual is killed by state agents outside the framework of a final 
judgment rendered by a competent court reached through a trial respecting the norms of due 
process (Articles 6 and 14).   
 
When an extrajudicial execution is committed by state agents, the State incurs legal obligations: 
to effectively investigate the violation, to prosecute and punish those responsible, to provide 
compensation to the victim&#8217;s family, and to adopt all necessary measures in order to prevent 
future violations.  (HRC, General Comment 31; Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions; CHR resolution 2005/34, para. 
5). 
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly to seek to clarify all such 
cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on these cases to the Commission, I 
would be grateful for your cooperation and observations on the following matters: 
 
1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2. Please provide the details and results of any investigation, medical examination (autopsy), 
</p>
<p>and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this incident.

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Myanmar has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
<b> 
Letter of allegation dated 15 may 2006 sent with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in Myanmar 
 
</b>In this connection, we would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s attention information we have 
received regarding the situation of ethnic minority villagers in northern Kayin (Karen) state and 
in the east of an area known as Bago Division, in eastern Myanmar. According to the information 
received the villagers are at risk of human rights violations following a recent escalation in 
counter-insurgency operations against the Karen National Union (KNU) - an armed ethnic 
minority opposition group. Reports indicate that civilians have been forcibly relocated and that 
several civilians, including women and children, may have been extra-judicially killed. 
Individuals are also reported to have been tortured by the army. 
 
For several weeks, thousands of civilians have reportedly been fleeing their homes to hide in the 
forest or seek asylum in Thailand. In the ongoing military operations in Kayin state, villages 
have reportedly been attacked and ordered by the Myanmar military, or <i>tatmadaw</i>, to relocate as 
part of the its tactics to break alleged links between armed opposition groups and the local 
civilian population. It has been brought to our attention that some individuals have been warned 
that the army will exercise a shoot-on-sight policy against those who attempt to return.  In 
addition, the army has reportedly destroyed houses, livestock and crops, depriving people of 
food and shelter. 
 
Concerns have been expressed that counter-insurgency operations will continue to intensify as 
the Myanmar authorities reportedly stated in April 2006 that the government has taken &#8220;security 
measures&#8221; against the KNU and that places where &#8220;destructive elements&#8221; can hide were being 
cleared. 
 
Without pre-judging the accuracy of the accounts received, we would like to refer your 
Excellency's Government to the fundamental principles set forth in the <i>Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights</i> and the <i>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</i>. Articles 3 and 6 of 
these instruments, respectively, provide that every individual has the right to life and security of 
the person, that this right shall be protected by law and that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived 
of his or her life.  
 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 223 
 
We also wish to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that &#8220;shoot-on-sight policies&#8221; are a deep 
and enduring threat to human rights-based law enforcement approaches. We urge your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to instruct its security forces to immediately prohibit any shoot on 
sight policy and comply with the United Nations Basic principles on the Use of Force and 
Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. These Principles note, inter alia, that law enforcement 
officials should &#8220;as far as possible apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force 
and firearms&#8221; and that &#8220;in any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when 
strictly unavoidable in order to protect life&#8221;. We would also like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s 
attention to the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, adopted by the General 
Assembly resolution 34/169 (1979) which more succinctly stresses the limited role for lethal 
force in all enforcement operations.  
</p>
<p> 
We would also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure that all deaths that 
occurred in connection with the above mentioned operations are promptly, independently and 
thoroughly investigated in accordance with the United Nations Principles on the Effective 
Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions.

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Namibia has failed to cooperate with the

<b>Letter of allegation sent on 17 August 2006 
</b>  
I would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information I have received concerning the 
lack of progress in the investigations concerning the death of Mr. <b>Lazarus Kandara</b>, a 
businessman who died of gunshot wounds while in police custody nearly a year ago, on 25 
August 2005.  
 
It is my understanding that on 23 August 2005 Mr. Kandara, the CEO of the asset management 
company Avid Investment Corporation, was heard in a liquidation inquiry before the High Court 
in Windhoek. In his long testimony, he made allegations seriously incriminating himself and 
implicating senior SWAPO and government officials in a major corruption scandal. The 
following day, Mr. Kandara was arrested in the High Court on charges of theft and fraud. He was 
taken into custody by the police&#8217;s Serious Crime Unit. After initial registration, Mr. Kandara was 
taken home by three officers of the Serious Crime Unit in order to collect a mattress, blankets, 
clothes and medication. From there, the Serious Crime Unit officers took him to the Windhoek 
police station. Before entering the police station, however, Mr. Kandara was shot under 
circumstances that have not yet been clarified. According to statements issued by the police in 
the days following the incident, Mr. Kandara had pulled out a Baretta 9mm gun, which he 
apparently had hidden under a blanket wrapped around his shoulders, and had aimed it at the 
three police officers who were escorting him. He changed his mind, however, and turned the gun 
on himself, shooting himself through the heart at pointblank range.  
 
In the following days, the Commanding Officer of the Police's Complaints and Discipline 
Division carried out an internal investigation into the death of Mr. Kandara upon instructions 
from the Inspector General of the Police. The investigation report of 8 September 2005 found 
that Mr. Kandara had committed suicide, but that his possession of a firearm was due to the 
negligence of the Serious Crime Unit members who were involved in his arrest and escorted him 
to his house and back to the police station. Mr. Kandara&#8217;s lawyer reportedly alleges that he had 
warned the officers of the Serious Crime Unit that Mr. Kandara had expressed the intention of 
committing suicide in the moments before being taken into custody at the court house. The 
Inspector General decided the suspension of the Serious Crime Unit officer in charge. The three 
Serious Crime Unit officers who had escorted Mr. Kandara remained in service. 
 
At the beginning of September 2005, a judicial inquest was started into the death of Mr. Kandara 
as well. Hearings were held from 22 to 27 March 2006. On 26 June 2006, however, the High 
Court vacated the inquest on procedural grounds (the magistrate had restricted the legal 
representation of the police officers during the inquest) and ordered that it must restart from the 
beginning. 
 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I would like to draw your 
Government&#8217;s attention to the fundamental principles applicable under international law to this 
case. Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that no one 
shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. When the State detains an individual, it is held to a 
heightened level of diligence in protecting that individual&#8217;s rights.  As a consequence, when an 
individual dies in State custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility. In this respect, I 
would like to recall the conclusion of the Human Rights Committee in a custodial death case 
(<i>Dermit Barbato v. Uruguay</i>, communication no. 84/1981 (1990)): </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 225 
 
 
</p>
<p>&#8220;While the Committee cannot arrive at a definite conclusion as to whether Hugo Dermit 
committed suicide, was driven to suicide or was killed by others while in custody; yet, the 
inescapable conclusion is that in all the circumstances the Uruguayan authorities either by 
act or by omission were responsible for not taking adequate measures to protect his life, 
as required by article 6 (1) of the Covenant.&#8221; 
 
</p>
<p>International law further requires from your Government a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial 
investigation&#8221; into all cases of custodial death (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective 
Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions).  
 
The delays in determining the dynamics of and responsibility for Mr. Kandara&#8217;s death are all the 
more a matter of concern in the light of reports that Kandara&#8217;s death is being used by Dr. Sam 
Nujoma, the President of SWAPO, in public threats against political opponents. According to 
reports I have recently received, during a public meeting held at the Nathaniel Maxuilili Centre, 
Babylon Township, Windhoek, on the afternoon of 30 July 2006, Dr. Nujoma threatened the 
leadership of the Ex-PLAN Combatants Committee (an association of veterans of the People&#8217;s 
Liberation Army of Namibia, PLAN), by stating that &#8220;[t]hose who are demanding compensation 
are bandits just like Kandara. They must remember that we still have guns, and those of you who 
side with them, we will shoot you&#8221;. This threat was understood as being directed primarily 
against the President of the Ex-PLAN Combatants Committee, Ms. Ruusa Malulu. (I am aware 
that the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression brought these threats to your Government&#8217;s attention in a communication 
dated 11 August 2006). 
</p>
<p> 
Moreover, it is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on 
Human Rights, reinforced by the appropriate resolution of the General Assembly, and extended 
by the Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am 
expected to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 
1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
 
2. Please provide an update on the current status of the inquest into Mr. Kandara&#8217;s death 
and of the disciplinary proceedings against the four officers of the Serious Crime Unit involved.  
 
3. Have any criminal prosecutions been undertaken in relation to Mr. Kandara&#8217;s death? 
 
4. Please indicate whether compensation has been paid to the family of Mr. Kandara. In 
relation to this question, I would like to point out that the above-mentioned presumption of State 
responsibility for cases of custodial death means, <i>inter alia</i>, that States must make reparations to 
the families of victims absent proof the State has no responsibility for the custodial death.   
 
5. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any inquiry into the threats 
uttered by Dr. Nujoma on 30 July 2006 and of any security measures adopted in favour of Ms. 
Rusulu.

<b>Nepal: Death in Custody of Maina Sunuwar 
</b> 
<b>Violation alleged:</b> Death in custody 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> 1 female (minor); 5 males 
<b> 
Character of reply:</b> No response 
 
<b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Nepal has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation dated 22 August 2006 
</b> 
I am writing about the cases of Colonel Bobby Khatri, Captain Sunil Adhikari and Captain Amit 
Pun.  According to the information that I have received, they were convicted on 27 September 
2005 on charges relating to the death of a fifteen-year-old student, <b>Maina Sunuwar</b>.  
 
The alleged facts regarding the killing are disturbing.  Witnesses claim security forces personnel 
went to Miss Sunuwar&#8217;s home in Kharelthok Village Development Committee, Kavre district, 
the morning of 17 February 2004, looking for her mother. As her mother was not there, they 
detained Miss Sunuwar and told her father to bring his wife to the Shanti Gate Army Barracks 
the next day. However, when the family went to the barracks, personnel there claimed not to 
know of Miss Sunuwar. It later emerged she had died in custody, allegedly after being tortured.  
 
I have learned that a court martial sentenced Col. Khatri, Captain Adhikari and Captain Pun to 
six-months detention, also imposing a total fine of 100,000 rupees on the three officers and 
declaring them ineligible for promotion for one to two years. However, I have been informed that 
the three officers were released immediately following the court martial decision because of time 
spent in pre-trial detention.  
 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I am deeply concerned that the 
sentence imposed by the court martial may not be proportionate to the gravity of the crimes 
committed.  I note the obligation of States Parties to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR) to fully investigate and bring to justice the perpetrators of arbitrary 
executions (ICCPR Arts. 2, 6; Human Rights Committee (HRC), General Comment 31 (2004), 
para. 18).  While I am aware of the current state of unrest in Nepal, I would emphasize that these 
obligations apply at all times, including during armed conflicts and other states of emergency 
(ICCPR Art. 4; HRC, General Comment 29, para. 15).   
 
The obligation to prosecute and punish is not a mere formality. Inadequate punishment for grave 
human rights violations does an injustice to the victims and contributes to a culture of impunity 
that leads to further violations. The light sentences imposed upon Col. Khatri, Captain Adhikari 
and Captain Pun raise the issue of impunity with particular urgency. 
 </p>

What is especially distressing is that Miss Sunuwar&#8217;s case does not seem to be an isolated 
incident.  Miss Sunuwar&#8217;s case is only one of several reported to me and to other United Nations 
organs.  For example, I refer you to the five unexplained deaths reported to the United Nations 
Committee Against Torture during its 35th session in November 2005, attached as an annex to 
this letter.  
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly to seek to clarify all such 
cases brought to my attention.  Since I am expected to report on these cases to the Commission, I 
would be grateful for your cooperation and observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 
(i) Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 
(ii) Please provide the text of the final judgment of the court martial in Miss Sunuwar&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>case, the text of the decision with respect to the sentence, and any records of the 
proceedings that your Excellency&#8217;s Government might be able to make available to 
me. 
</p>
<p> 
(iii) Please provide information concerning the guidance provided to members of the 
</p>
<p>Royal Nepalese Army with respect to the treatment of detainees. 
 
</p>
<p>(iv) Please provide an explanation of the source of authority for the Royal Nepalese 
Army&#8217;s powers of arrest and detention over civilians and copies of any relevant 
statutory instruments; in particular, I would like to know whether such powers are 
authorized under provisions of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Control and 
Punishment) Ordinance (TADO), the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Control and 
Punishment) Act (TADA), or some other instrument. 
</p>
<p> 
(v) I understand that the court martial has asked your Excellency&#8217;s Government to pay 
</p>
<p>150,000 rupees in reparations to Miss Sunuwar&#8217;s family. I would be grateful if you 
would confirm that they have received the compensation.

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur appreciates the additional information provided by the Government of 
Nepal with respect to the deaths of Reena Rasail and Subhadra Chaulagain.   
 
The SR welcomes the efforts that the Government has made to end impunity for these crimes by 
providing compensation to the victims&#8217; kin and by prosecuting members of the military 
responsible for their deaths.  Nevertheless, the SR would note that the Government should make 
every effort to ensure that the sentences imposed by courts martial are proportionate to the 
gravity of the crimes committed. 
 
The Special Rapporteur remains concerned that he has received no clarification of the case of 
Tasi Lama.

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates the preliminary information provided by the Government of 
Nepal.  However, the SR is concerned that in certain cases the information fails to clarify the 
allegations made.     
 
Regarding Bishwanath Parajuli, Tomnath Poudel, Dhan Bahadur, Devendra (Mukesh), 
Mohanchandra Gautam, Ram Chandra Karki (Umesh), Shailendra Yadav (Tarakeshwar) and 
Sherman Kuber (Kunwar), the SR regrets that the Government's response states that the security 
forces were &quot;compelled&quot; to open fire without fully clarifying why it was necessary to do so. 
 
Regarding Bouyamal Mura Kawari, Ram Narayan Sada, Chaturdev Chaudhary, Ramesh 
Khadka, Dilip Bk, Sagar Limbu and Hari Gautam, the SR notes that the Government&#8217;s claim that 
&#8220;[a]ll legal documents were duly completed&#8221; provides no information to the SR as to the legality 
of the incident. 
 
Regarding Ram Prasad Yadav, the SR notes that the Government&#8217;s conclusion that &#8220;he is 
believed to be killed by the terrorists&#8221; is unsubstantiated and requires further investigation by the 
Government. 
 
Regarding Rajendra Karki, the SR notes that the Government&#8217;s conclusion that &#8220;[t]here is no 
information of arrest and beating of Mr. Karki&#8221; is unsatisfactory and requires further 
investigation by the Government. 
 
Regarding the numerous cases identified as still under investigation (Lai Kaji Gurung, Laxman 
Pun, Lok Bahadur Pun, Prithvi Gautam, Ramnarayan Yadav, Sher Bahadur Budha), the SR looks 
forward to receiving the results of those investigations.

Nigeria: Killings by the Police in Umuhaia, Abia State 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Deaths due to attacks or killings by the security forces 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> 16 males (1 minor) 
<b> 
Character of reply:</b> Allegations rejected but without adequate substantiation 
<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of Nigeria.  
However, the SR is concerned that the account provided does not appear to reflect a thorough 
investigation conduct by persons independent of those alleged to be responsible. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation dated 20 September 2006 
</b></p>
<p> 
In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have 
received regarding recent report of extrajudicial killings by the police. According to the 
information received, in August 2006 four individuals were shot by police officers in Umuhaia in 
Abia State. The police claimed that the four men were suspected armed robbers and that they </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 238 
 
were killed in a shoot-out. Twelve other suspects, including a 13 year old boy, were detained 
during the same raid and were transferred to the Abia State police headquarters. On 10 August at 
9 am, the police reportedly brought them out into the grounds of the Abia State police 
headquarters and made them sit on the ground in full view of journalists and other spectators. 
Reports indicate that some of the suspects were displaying gun shot wounds.  
</p>
<p> 
On Friday 11 August, the dead bodies of the twelve suspected armed robbers were seen dumped 
outside the morgue at a government hospital. Sources have reported that the bodies were brought 
in by the police.  
</p>
<p> 
The police public relations officer in charge of the Abia State Police Command reportedly said to 
the media that he was not aware of the deaths and that he thought the suspects were still being 
interrogated.  
</p>
<p> 
If these allegations were correct, there would be ground for serious concern. Moreover it would 
demonstrate a continuing pattern of the practice to which I drew attention in the report I have 
submitted following my country visit to Nigeria (see E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.4, para 8-18).  
</p>
<p> 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I would like to draw your 
Government&#8217;s attention to the fundamental principles applicable under international law to this 
case. Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that no one 
shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life.  
</p>
<p> 
As mentioned in my report (see E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.4, para. 43-47), it is entirely unacceptable 
that there are so many cases of alleged &#8220;armed robbers&#8221; killed by police officers before or after 
being taken into custody. The problem lies in part in the elevation of armed robbery to the level 
of capital offence as provided in Police Order No. 237. As I have explained in my report, this 
gives a justification to shoot to kill any person who has committed a capital offence and is 
seeking to flee. I wish to reiterate my recommendation that Public Order be amended 
immediately to bring it into conformity with the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and 
Firearms by Law Officials. The resulting emphasis should be on proportionality, on the use of 
lethal force as an absolute last resort, and only &#8220;when strictly unavoidable in order to protect 
life&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 
I would also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure that all deaths that 
occurred in connection with the incidents in the Abia State police headquarters are promptly, 
independently and thoroughly investigated in accordance with the United Nations Principles on 
the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions.  
This principle was reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human Rights in Resolution 2005/34 
on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;the 
obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Commission added that this obligation 
includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate 
compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary 
measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to &#8230; prevent the recurrence of such 
executions&#8221;.

<b>Response of the Government of Nigeria dated 21 November 2006 to a letter of allegation 
dated 2 September 2006 
</b> 
The Government provided information in response to an allegation letter on alleged extrajudicial 
killings by the police in Abia State of Nigeria. On 8th August 2006, following a tip-off that a 
dangerous robbery gang was in a town called Bende in Urnuahia, a team of operatives from the 
Abia State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) trailed them to their hideout. However, 
before the police team arrived, they fled, abandoning their rifles and other robbed items. The 
police team further trailed them to their new location at Obokobe in Umuahia North Local 
Government Area of Abia State. Upon sighting the police, the suspected robbery gang opened 
fire and police responded in self defence. During the fierce exchange of gunfire, three of the 
armed robbery suspects died on the spot while nine others sustained various degrees of injury 
from the shootout. Before they could be given medical attention, the remaining nine suspects, 
who survived the shootout died as a result of the injuries they sustained. Their corpses were 
thereafter deposited at the Federal Medical. Centre, Umuahia for post mortem. 
</p>
<p> 
Contrary to the allegations, the number of persons involved in the incident was twelve (12) as 
against the sixteen (16) reported in some newspapers. It is also erroneous that there was a 
thirteen (13) year old among the deceased armed robbery suspects as they were all adults. 
 
On the day of the incident, the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abia State, granted a press 
interview on the incident and since then, no press statement was issued by the police.

<b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Nigeria has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal dated 30 October 2006 
 
</b>I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received regarding 
Mr. <b>Shuaybu Yahaya</b> and Mr. <b>Sule Mai Tukwane</b> who have been sentenced to death for 
sodomy. 
 
According to the information received, on 29 June 2006 Shuaybu Yahaya and Sule Mai 
Tukwane were sentenced to be stoned to death for sodomy by the Gwarzo upper Sharia court, 
Kano State. They have reportedly not appealed their convictions and are currently held at the 
Central Kano prison.  
</p>
<p> 
If these allegations are correct, there would be grounds for serious concern. As I noted in the 
report following my visit to Nigeria (see E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.4, para .26-38), the 
characterization of sodomy as a capital offence leading to death by stoning is contrary to 
Nigerian federal law and to applicable international law. Sodomy cannot be considered to be one 
of the &#8216;most serious crimes&#8217; for which the death penalty may be prescribed. It is generally 
understood that this category should not be defined as going beyond intentional crimes with 
lethal or extremely grave consequences (paragraph 1 of the Safeguards guaranteeing protection 
of the rights of those facing the death penalty, Economic and Social Council resolution 1984/50 
of 25 May 1084). In its General Comment No. 6, the United Nations Human Rights Committee 
has stated that &#8220;the expression &#8216;most serious crimes&#8217; must be read restrictively to mean that the 
death penalty should be a quite exceptional measure&#8221;. Similarly, that Committee has observed 
that the restriction encapsulated in that phrase cannot be interpreted as permitting the imposition 
of the death penalty &#8220;for crimes of an economic nature, for corruption and for adultery, or for 
crimes that do not result in loss of life&#8221; (CCPR/C/28/Add.15, 3 August 2003, paragraph 8). 
</p>
<p> 
In accordance with the recommendations contained in my report on Nigeria (see 
E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.4, para 104), I call upon the Federal Government to underscore the fact 
that the imposition of the death penalty for offences such as sodomy is unconstitutional. 
</p>
<p> 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights, 
and extended by the Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. 
Without in any way pre-judging the accuracy of the information received, I would be grateful for 
a reply to the following questions: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2. If Shuaybu Yahaya and Sule Mai Tukwane have in fact been sentenced to death for the 
offence of sodomy, how does Your Excellency&#8217;s Government consider that to be consistent with 
the applicable international legal standards?

</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Pakistan has failed to cooperate with the

<b> 
Urgent appeal dated 16 December 2005 
</b></p>
<p>  
I would like to bring to the attention of Your Excellency&#8217;s Government the situation of Mr. 
<b>Shahzad</b>, Mr. <b>Muhammad Ashraf</b>, Mr. <b>Umer Hayat</b> and Mr. <b>Mubarak Ali </b>who are reportedly 
scheduled to be hanged on 21 December 2005 in Faisalabad District Jail, Punjab province.  
</p>
<p> 
According to the information I have received, the four men were found guilty by the Faisalabad 
Anti-Terrorism Court of gang-raping a Christian girl in Faisalabad in 1999. They have exhausted 
all possibilities of appeal that were available to them. 
</p>
<p> 
I have been informed that the laws relevant to this case are currently being challenged in a 
petition pending before the Federal Shariat Court.  The legal challenge reportedly relates both to 
the validity of a death sentence imposed pursuant to Section 10(4) of the Zina Ordinance VII and 
to the competence of Anti-Terrorism Courts over charges of rape. 
</p>
<p> 
I urge your Excellency's Government to stay these executions pending a final judgment on the 
petition.  Especially when the right to life is at stake, the strictest attention must be given to the 
due process of law.  It was to that end that the international community formulated Safeguards 
guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty in Economic and Social 
Council resolution 1984/50 (25 May 1984).  As you know, these Safeguards affirm that 
&#8220;[c]apital punishment may only be carried out pursuant to a final judgement rendered by a 
competent court&#8221; (paragraph 5) and that  &#8220;[c]apital punishment may be imposed only for a crime 
for which the death penalty is prescribed by law at the time of its commission&#8221; (paragraph 2).  I 
understand that a final judgment was rendered in the cases of Mr. Shahzad, Mr. Muhammad 
Ashraf, Mr. Umer Hayat and Mr. Mubarak Ali.  However, inasmuch as both the competence of 
the court that rendered those judgments and the validity of their statutory basis within the 
domestic legal order are currently being challenged, respect for the norms of due process and the 
right to life dictates that these men should not be executed prior to a final judgment on the 
pending petition. 
</p>
<p> 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention.  Without in any way wishing to pre-judge the

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur appreciates the preliminary information provided by the Government of 
Pakistan with respect to the cases of Shehar Banu, Ali Nawaz Brohi, and their children.  The SR 
would request that he be informed of the results of the Government&#8217;s investigations into these 
cases. 
<b> 
Letter of allegation dated 3 February 2006 </b>sent with Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences<b> 
 
</b>We would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we have received concerning 
the murders of <b>Shehar Banu</b>, her husband <b>Ali Nawaz Brohi</b>, her 5-year old son <b>Liaquat Ali</b> and 
her 3-years old daughter <b>Hanifa</b>. According to information received,  
 
</p>
<p>Shehar Banu and their two children were shot and killed in their home village of 
Mohammad Bux Odhu, Taluka Garhi Khero, District Jacobabad, Sindh Province on 4 
January 2006. The murders were allegedly committed by Shehar Banu&#8217;s brothers 
Sikandar and Qaisar and their accomplices Sain Bux, Ghulam Rasool, Qalandar Bux and 
Niaz. The alleged perpetrators also shot and severely injured Ali Nawaz Brohi. He was 
taken to Larkana Hospital where the same perpetrators later allegedly attacked Ali Nawaz 
Brohi again and killed him.  
</p>
<p> 
Eight years earlier, Shehar Banu had married Ali Nawaz Brohi against her family&#8217;s will. 
Subsequently, the married couple fled their hometown of Ratodero, District Larkana to 
live in Mohammad Bux Odhu. Sources allege that Sikandar and Qaisar committed the 
murders with the intent to restore their family&#8217;s &#8220;honour,&#8221; which they considered 
tarnished by Shehar Banu&#8217;s decision to exercise her right to choose her husband and 
marry. 
</p>
<p> 
Reportedly, neither Sikandar, nor Qaisar nor any of their accomplices have been arrested 
and all six men remain at large. 
</p>
<p> 
Without in any way implying any conclusions as to the facts of the case and while appreciating 
that the alleged murders may still be under investigation, we call on your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to ensure that the perpetrators of this and other so-called &#8220;honour killings&#8221; are 
prosecuted and appropriately punished taking into account the grave nature of their crimes. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

We would also like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental principles set 
forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. Articles 3 and 6 of these instruments, respectively, provide that every individual 
has the right to life and security of the person; that this right shall be protected by law and that 
no-one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. We would also like to refer Your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women, which calls on States Parties to take all appropriate measures to modify the social and 
cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of 
prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of inferiority or the 
superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women (Art. 5(a)). 
Furthermore, and in accordance with developing standards of international law and human rights 
protection, the United Nations General Assembly adopted by consensus the Declaration on the 
Elimination of Violence against Women in its resolution 48/104 of 20 December 1993. The 
Declaration stipulates that all States Parties should exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate 
and, in accordance with national legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether 
those acts are perpetrated by the State or by private persons (Art. 4(c)). 
 
We urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and 
freedoms of the aforementioned persons are respected and accountability of any person guilty of 
the alleged violations ensured. We also request that your Government adopts effective measures 
to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
 
Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on 
Human Rights and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to 
clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the

<b> 
Letter of allegation dated 7 March 2006</b> sent with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism<b> 
</b> 
We would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s attention information we have received regarding 
three incidents of air strikes by United States unmanned aircraft against targets in Pakistan, each 
of them resulting in the death of several civilians. We have written to the Government of the 
United States of America in this matter as well. 
 
On 5 November 2005, an unmanned aircraft operated by the US Central Intelligence Agency 
(CIA) fired a missile at a house in North Waziristan, Pakistan (no further details of the location 
reported). The CIA had received information that al-Qaeda operative <b>Hamza Rabia</b>, a citizen of 
Egypt alleged to have been involved in an attempt on the life of President Pervez Musharraf in 
December 2003, was staying there with his wife and children. While an overall <b>eight persons, 
including his wife and children</b>, were reportedly killed in the attack, Hamza Rabia managed to 
escape with an injured leg. 
 
On 1 December 2005, an unmanned drone operated by the CIA fired a missile at a house in the 
village Haisori, near the town of Mir Ali, North Waziristan, about 30 kms from the Afghani 
border, killing five persons. It would appear that the dead are <b>Hamza Rabia</b>, two other foreign </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 245 
 
men, and the 17-year-old son and an eight-year-old nephew of the owner of the house. While 
officials of your Excellency&#8217;s Government stated that the blast resulting in the deaths was caused 
by explosives handled or stored in the house, reports indicate that residents of the area saw an 
unmanned aircraft fire a missile at the house and recovered fragments of the missile. 
  
In the early morning hours of 13 January 2006 a remote-piloted Predator aircraft of the United 
States security services launched a strike with &#8220;Hellfire&#8221; missiles on the village of Damadola in 
the Bajaur Agency, North Western Pakistan, close to the border with Afghanistan. Reports 
indicate that US Predator drones were circling the area of Damadola village during the three days 
preceding the missile strike. The attack is reported to have killed <b>18 persons, including women 
and children</b>. The target of the strike reportedly was <b>Ayman al-Zawahri</b>, who is commonly 
referred to as the &#8220;number two&#8221; of al-Qaeda. He was reportedly expected at a dinner in 
Damadola on the evening of 12 January 2006. However, he appears not to have been in the 
village at the time of the attack. Your Government is reported to have stated that 5 senior al-
Qaeda figures were among those killed, including a chemical and explosives expert, <b>Midhat 
Mursi al-Sayed alias Abu Abu Khabab, Abu Obaidah al-Misri</b>, allegedly al-Qaeda chief of 
operations for Afghanistan&#8217;s eastern Kunar province, and Ayman al-Zawahiri&#8217;s son-in-law 
<b>Abdur Rehman al-Maghribi</b>. However, the reports we have received indicate that the bodies of 
the five &#8220;Arab fighters&#8221; killed in the strike were pulled out of the rubble and taken away from the 
scene soon after the strike, so that only the bodies of 13 Pakistani victims could be identified.  
 
It is our understanding that the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is authorized to operate 
such Predator operations under presidential authority signed after the September 11, 2001 
terrorist attacks. As to your Government&#8217;s position, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions noted in his letter to you of 1 September 2005, concerning the 
death on 8 May 2005 of Mr. Haitham al-Yemeni, that his understanding is that your 
Government's Information Minister, Sheik Rashid Ahmed, reportedly denied at the time that any 
such incident had ever happened near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. In a similar vein, your 
reply to the mentioned letter, dated 17 October 2005, states that &#8220;a car blew up with an explosion 
&#8230; resulting in the killing of a local and an unidentified foreigner&#8221; without further elaborating on 
the causes of that explosion. With regard to the incident in Haisori of 1 December 2005, as noted 
above your Government&#8217;s position reportedly was that the deaths were caused by the explosion 
of explosives stored in the house. With regard to the incident in Damadola on 13 January 2006, 
however, media reports suggest that your Excellency&#8217;s Government attributes the deaths to a 
missile fired by a US aircraft. Your Government&#8217;s Prime Minister, Mr. Shaukat Aziz, is reported 
to have publicly stated that such attacks are not acceptable to Pakistan. 
 
In connection with these conflicting reports, we would also express our concern at information 
received regarding Mr. Hayatullah Khan, a reporter for the Urdu-language daily &quot;Ausaf&quot; and 
photographer for the European Press Photo Agency, who reportedly found and reported evidence 
that the deaths in Haisori village on 1 December 2005 were caused by a US air strike, thus 
contradicting your Government&#8217;s official version of the events. He was abducted by armed men 
on 5 December 2005, in Mir Ali, North Waziristan, and has since then remained unaccounted for. 
An official at the Governor's House in Peshawar, however, is reported to have recently told 
journalists who were protesting in favor of Hayatullah Khan&#8217;s release: &#8220;The more noise you 
make, the more you prolong Hayatullah's captivity&#8221;. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 246 
 
clarify the whereabouts of Mr. Khan and to ensure that his rights to life, physical integrity, 
personal freedom and freedom of expression are respected.  
 
We wish to remind you that while Governments have a responsibility to protect their own 
citizens and those of other States against the excesses of non-State actors or other entities, the 
UN GA Resolution 59/191, in its paragraph 1 stresses that &#8220;States must ensure that any measure 
to combat terrorism complies with their obligation under international law, in particular 
international human right, refugee and humanitarian law&#8221;. In this respect, we wish to stress our 
concern that empowering Governments to identify and kill &#8220;known terrorists&#8221; places no 
verifiable obligation upon them to demonstrate in any way that those against whom lethal force 
is used are indeed terrorists, or to demonstrate that every other alternative has been exhausted. 
(See the Report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to 
the 61st Commission on Human Rights, E/CN.4/2005/7, at par. 41). 
 
Without in any way wishing to pre-judge the accuracy of the information received, we would be 
grateful for a reply to the following questions.   
 
1.  Are the above reports accurate? In particular, does your Excellency&#8217;s Government accept 
that there were three air strikes by unmanned CIA drones on targets in Pakistan on 5 November 
2005, 1 December 2005, and 13 January 2006, as described above? 
 
2.  On what basis was it decided to kill, rather than capture, Ayman al-Zawahri? On what 
basis was it decided to kill, rather than capture, Hamza Rabia? 
 
3.  What rules of international law does your Excellency&#8217;s Government consider to govern 
these incidents? If your Excellency's Government considers the incidents to have been governed 
by humanitarian law, please clarify which treaty instruments or customary norms are considered 
to apply. 
 
4.  What procedural safeguards, if any, were employed to ensure that these killings complied 
with international law? 
 
5. Did the Government of Pakistan agree to the killing of Hamza Rabia and Ayman al-
Zawahri? More in general, does the Government of Pakistan agree to the United States carrying 
out air strikes against targets in Pakistan in order to kill terrorism suspects?  
 
6.  In case your Excellency&#8217;s Government did not consent to these air strikes, what steps 
were taken to investigate the incidents and hold those responsible accountable? 
 
7. Does your Excellency&#8217;s Government intend to provide compensation to the families of 
the persons killed in these air strikes? If so, what steps have been taken in this direction?

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Pakistan has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation dated 16 March 2006 
 
</b>I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received regarding 
the killing of civilians in allegedly indiscriminate military attacks by security forces in the Dera 
Bugti district of Balochistan. 
 
On 17 March 2005, at least 43 non combatants were killed by Frontier Corps forces in Dera 
Bugti town. Reports vary as to what caused the outbreak of violence, but it would appear that it 
was triggered by a group of armed tribesmen blocking a military convoy at a crossing outside 
Dera Bugti town. Thereafter, Frontier Corps forces stationed in Dera Bugti launched an attack 
lasting several hours on the town, including a neighbourhood inhabited mostly by Hindus, with 
rocket launchers and machine guns, killing at least 43 non combatants (a list of their names is in 
the annex to this letter). Reports indicate that among the combatants the casualties might have 
been eight on the Government side and around 20 among the armed Bugti tribesmen. None of 
the reports received identify any military necessity underlying the attack on the neighbourhoods 
where the civilian deaths occurred, and according to my knowledge, your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government has not provided any explanation of a military rational underlying the attack.  
 
While unique in its gravity, the attack of 17 March 2005 appears not to be an isolated incident. 
On the contrary, reports indicate that since 30 December 2005 the use of rocket launchers, 
gunship helicopters and other heavy weaponry by the Frontier Corps against civilian targets has 
become regular. From 31 December 2005 to 10 January 2006, such attacks have reportedly killed 
11 men, 11 women and 19 children in Dera Bugti, Loti, Jori, and other places in the area (a list of 
the alleged victims is in the annex). As a result of these attacks, 85 percent of the population of 
Dera Bugti town (approximately 25,000) have left the town, there is no water or electricity 
except in very few locations and schools are closed.  
 
I would further like to draw the attention of your Government to allegations of retaliatory 
extrajudicial execution of persons held captive by security forces in Dera Bugti. On 11 January 
2006, at the Pattar Nala the Frontier Corps raided a hamlet and burnt down several dwellings. On 
their return, three Frontier Corps soldiers were injured by the explosion of a land mine. While the 
soldiers were transported to Sui hospital, a raid was conducted on the same hamlet. The Frontier 
Corps apprehended 12 local men (names in the annex) and took them to the Frontier Corps 
headquarters in Dera Bugti. Around 4 p.m., news reached the headquarters that the three soldiers 
had died of their injuries at the hospital. In reaction thereto, the Frontier Corps soldiers 
summarily executed all 12 persons in their custody. They then sent for their families to collect 
the dead bodies. Some women went but were sent back by the Frontier Corps and asked to send 
their male family members. On 15 January 2006, two old men of the tribe (names in the annex) </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 248 
 
went to the Frontier Corps headquarters. They did not return. The next day all 14 bodies were 
handed to an official in Dera Bugti, who delivered the bodies to the families. 
 
In raising my concerns with regard to the killing of civilians by rocket fire and other forms of 
military action, I am aware of the existence of armed tribal militias in Balochistan which carry 
out attacks against governmental forces and infrastructure. I am also aware that a compound of 
the Nawab Akbar Bugti, a tribal leader accused by your Government of commanding substantial 
militia, is located in the town of Dera Bugti. 
 
I would like to recall, however, that international humanitarian law requires parties to an armed 
conflict to distinguish at all times between combatants and civilians, and to direct attacks only 
against combatants (Rules 1 and 7 of the Customary Rules of International Humanitarian Law 
identified by the International Committee of the Red Cross); acts or threats of violence the 
primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited (Rule 
2); attacks by bombardment which treat as a single military objective a number of clearly 
separated and distinct military objectives located in a city, town, village or other area containing 
a similar concentration of civilians or civilian objects are prohibited (Rule 13); launching an 
attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage 
to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete 
and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited (Rule 14). 
 
I have drawn your attention to applicable rules of international humanitarian law because the 
reports received suggest that your Government is currently waging an armed conflict against 
rebel forces in some parts of Balochistan, including Dera Bugti district. Assuming, however, that 
the situation in Dera Bugti district was a question of &#8220;law and order&#8221; and did not constitute an 
armed conflict, as reportedly argued by your Excellency&#8217;s Government, the lack of any 
justification for the reported lethal attacks against civilians with rockets and other heavy military 
equipment would appear all the clearer.  
 
As to the alleged shooting of 14 men in custody of the security forces in retaliation for the death 
of three soldiers on 11 and 15 January 2006, it would appear that there cannot be any possible 
justification for the killings under either international human rights or humanitarian law. 
Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, applicable in the case of armed conflict 
not of an international character, prohibits the killing of any person taking no active part in an 
armed conflict, such as persons in captivity. 
 
Whether the legal framework is that of law enforcement or that of an internal armed conflict, in 
order to assess whether the use of lethal force was proportionate and thus justifiable, there must 
be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the 
Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This 
principle was reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human Rights in Resolution 2005/34 on 
&#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;the 
obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Commission added that this obligation 
includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate 
compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 249 
 
measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to &#8230; prevent the recurrence of such 
executions&#8221;.  
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on this case to 
the Commission, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the 
following matters: 
 
(i) Are the facts alleged above accurate? If not so, please describe the investigations carried 
out to ascertain that the allegations are ill-founded. 
 
(ii) Does your Excellency&#8217;s Government consider that it is engaged in an armed conflict with 
rebel forces in Dera Bugti district, Balochistan? 
 
(iii) With regard to the rocket attacks or shelling resulting in the death of non-combatants, 
please describe the investigations carried out to determine whether the use of force was lawful, 
and if not so, the action undertaken to bring those responsible to justice. 
 
(iv) With regard to the alleged summary execution of 14 men held in captivity by the Frontier 
Corps in Dera Bugti on 11 and 15 January 2006, please describe the action undertaken to 
investigate the matter and bring those responsible to justice. 
 
(v) Have the families of the victims of the attacks described above received compensation?

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Pakistan has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
<b> 
Urgent appeal dated 10 May 2006 
</b>  
I would like to draw your attention to information I have received regarding Mr. <b>Mirza Tahir 
Hussain</b>, a man sentenced to death whose execution is reportedly scheduled for 1 June 2006.  
 
According to the information received, the facts of the criminal case against Mirza Tahir Hussain 
involve the death of a taxi driver more than 17 years ago, on 17 December 1988. Some courts 
have found that Mirza Tahir Hussain murdered the taxi driver, while others gave credence to the 
defense version that the taxi driver was fatally injured when his gun went off in the scuffle that 
followed his attempts to sexually assault Mirza Tahir Hussain under the threat of his gun.  
 
Mirza Tahir Hussain was sentenced to death in 1989 at the Sessions Court in Islamabad.  
Following an appeal, this sentence was quashed by the Lahore High Court. The case was 
returned to the Sessions Court where Mirza Tahir Hussain was sentenced to life imprisonment in 
1994. Following a second appeal, the Lahore High Court dismissed this sentence in 1996, and 
Mirza Tahir Hussain was acquitted of all charges against him. 
 
A week later, Mirza Tahir Hussain&#8217;s case was referred to the Federal Shariat Court on charges 
including robbery involving murder, which falls under Islamic offences against property. The 
case against Mirza Tahir Hussain was reopened, and in 1998, he was sentenced to death by the 
Federal Shariat Court. The Supreme Court upheld the judgment in 2003 and dismissed a further 
appeal in 2004. The President rejected a petition for clemency in 2005.  
 
International law does not prohibit the death penalty, but it mandates that it must be regarded as 
an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be interpreted in the most 
restrictive manner. As a consequence, in capital punishment cases the &#8220;right to a fair and public 
hearing &#8230; in the determination of &#8230; any criminal charge&#8221;, enshrined in Article 10 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, must be observed particularly scrupulously. A hallmark 
of the right to a fair trial in criminal cases is the principle of ne bis in idem, i.e. &#8211; in the words of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights &#8211; the principle whereby &#8220;[n]o one shall 
be liable to be tried or punished again for an offence for which he has already been finally 
convicted or acquitted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of each country.&#8221; While I 
am aware that Pakistan is not a State party to the Covenant, this principle can be considered to be 
a general principle of international law which finds expression in Article 13 of the Constitution 
of Pakistan which provides that &#8220;No person (a) shall be prosecuted or punished for the same 
offence more than once &#8230;&#8221;. 
 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 253 
 
I understand that the murder of which Mirza Tahir Hussain is accused has been characterized in 
a slightly different fashion in the charges formulated against him before the Federal Shariat 
Court.  Nonetheless, it would appear that the Shariat Court did in effect try him anew for the 
same offence which had been the subject of the proceedings before the Sessions Court and the 
Lahore High Court. The legal defect would be all the greater if, as has been reported to me, the 
distinctive element of the charges brought against him in the Shariat Court was the accusation of 
&#8220;robbery&#8221;, which was later on dismissed entirely by that same court. To sum up, Mirza Tahir 
Hussain appears to be at risk of being punished again for an offence of which he has already 
been finally acquitted by Pakistan&#8217;s judicial system, in violation of the obligations of your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government under both international and Pakistani law. 
 
In view of the irrevocable nature of the death penalty, I therefore urge your Government not to 
proceed with the execution.  This question requires a thorough re-examination in order to ensure 
that the relevant laws have been complied with. In view of the urgency of the matter, I would 
appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government. 
 
Moreover, it is my responsibility under the mandates provided to me by the Commission on 
Human Rights and reinforced by the appropriate resolution of the General Assembly, to seek to 
clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on this case to the Human 
Rights Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following 
matters: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 
2. Please explain how the Government of Pakistan seeks to ensure that the principle of ne 
bis in idem, as recognized in both Pakistani and international law, is upheld in relation to the 
concurrent jurisdiction of the ordinary secular court system and the Federal Shariat Court. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal dated 18 August 2006 
</b> 
I would like to refer to a communication I sent your Excellency&#8217;s Government on 10 May 2006 
concerning Mr. <b>Mirza Tahir Hussain</b>, a man sentenced to death whose execution was, at the 
time, scheduled for 1 June 2006. I was relieved to learn that your Government has twice 
postponed the execution of Mirza Tahir Hussain, most recently until 1 September 2006, in order 
to allow his family more time to seek a pardon from and to offer monetary compensation to the 
family of the alleged murder victim. 
 
These welcome efforts of your Government, however, do not address the serious legal concerns I 
raised in my communication of 10 May 2006, which has regrettably remained without a reply. 
As you will recall, these concerns relate to the preoccupation that the trial of Mirza Tahir 
Hussain before the Federal Shariat Court, which reportedly imposed the death sentence against 
him after he had been acquitted by the Lahore High Court, violates the principle of non bis in 
idem enshrined in both international law and the Pakistani Constitution.  
 
I therefore again urge your Government to indefinitely suspend the execution of Mirza Tahir 
Hussain and to initiate a thorough re-examination of the case in order to ensure that the relevant </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

domestic and international law has been complied with. In view of the urgency of the matter, I 
would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government.

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Pakistan has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
<b> 
Letter of allegation dated 5 July 2006 with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion 
or belief. 
</b> 
We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received 
concerning Mr. <b>Abdul Sattar Gopang</b> who was reportedly stabbed to death while he was on 
trial on blasphemy charges at the District and Session Court of Muzzafargarh on 16 June 2006.  
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, his murder was instigated by Maulana Abdul Rasheed, 
and carried out by five members of his seminary. Two of the perpetrators were subsequently 
captured by bystanders and handed over to the police while two policemen who allegedly tried to 
overpower the attackers were injured.  
</p>
<p> 
Mr. Abdul Sattar Gopang worked as a tax collector for the union council in Jatoi town, 
Muzzafargarh. Mr. Rasheed, in charge of a seminary, had not been paying his toll tax and had 
verbally threatened Mr. Gopang when asked to do so. On 13 March 2006, Mr. Rasheed again 
refused to pay his toll tax. He then went to the police and filed a fabricated case of blasphemy 
against Mr. Gopang. 
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, Mr. Rasheed allegedly told members of his seminary that 
they would go to heaven if they killed Mr Gopang for having committed blasphemy. Concerns 
have been expressed that fabricated blasphemy charges are possible as a consequence of the 
Blasphemy Laws (295-B, 295-C, 298-C). 
</p>
<p> 
To date, it is our understanding that the three remaining perpetrators remain at large and that no 
charges have been brought in connection with the murder of Mr. Gopang.  
</p>
<p> 
While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we should like to appeal to 
your Excellency to ensure that the death of Mr. Abdul Sattar Gopang is promptly, independently 
and thoroughly investigated in accordance with the United Nations principles on the effective 
prevention and investigation of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions.  
</p>
<p> </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 255 
 
We urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that accountability of any 
person guilty of the murder of Mr. Gopang. We also request that your Government adopts 
effective measures to prevent the recurrence of killings such as the above described. 
</p>
<p> 
It is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all cases 
brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the Human Rights 
Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following 
matters in relation to each of the cases referred to above: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2. Has a complaint been lodged? 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>3. What was the nature of the blasphemy charges brought against Mr. Gopang?  What 
safeguards exist in the current law to prevent unfounded allegations from forming the basis of 
blasphemy prosecutions?  
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>4. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
examinations, and judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to this 
case. If no inquiries have taken place or if they have been inconclusive please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>5. In the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, please provide the full details of 
any prosecutions which have been undertaken; Have penal, disciplinary or administrative 
sanctions been imposed on the alleged perpetrators? 
</p>
<p> 
6. Please indicate whether compensation has been provided to the family of Mr. Gopang.

<b>Letter of allegation dated 2 June 2006</b> with the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 256 
 
In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we have 
received concerning a sharp increase in reports of killings of human rights activists who are 
believed to be targeted for their activities for the promotion of human rights. According to the 
information we have received, more than thirty killings of human rights defenders have taken 
place during the first quarter of 2006 alone. The cases listed in the annex to this letter are 
illustrative of this broader tendency and share certain common elements: a majority of victims 
are reported to have been shot at point-blank range by unidentified gunmen. Besides, none of 
these killings has reportedly been investigated and perpetrators remain at large. Reports also 
indicate that this figure is only indicative of a much higher criminal rate against human rights 
activists who continue to carry out their work in an increasingly dangerous environment.  
 
In this connection, we regret that your Excellency&#8217;s Government has failed to provide us with 
sufficient information as requested in our letters -sent over the last two years- with regard to the 
thorough investigation of such killings and the outcome of relevant criminal and judicial 
proceedings.  
 
While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we urge your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to take effective measures against impunity to deter and prevent further 
assassinations of human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p> 
In this respect, we would like to recall that, as reiterated in Commission on Human Rights 
Resolution 2005/34 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), all States have 
&#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, to identify and bring to justice those responsible, 
&#8230; and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to bring 
an end to impunity and to prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. This obligation, affirmed 
also in the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee (<i>see</i>, e.g. the Committee&#8217;s views in 
<i>Arhuacos v. Colombia</i>, Communication no. 612/1995, &#167; 8.8.), is indeed part and parcel of the 
obligation to respect and protect the right to life enshrined in Article 3 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights.  
 
We would also like to refer Your Excellency's Government to the fundamental principles set 
forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of 
Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state that everyone has the right individually 
or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels&#8221; and that &#8220;each State has 
a prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote and implement all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all 
conditions necessary in the social, economic, political and other fields, as well as the legal 
guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction, individually and in 
association with others, are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice&#8221;.  
 
Furthermore, we would like to bring your Excellency&#8217;s attention to the following provisions, and 
in particular:  
</p>
<p> </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 257 
 
- article 12 paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration which provide that the State shall take all necessary 
measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in 
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse 
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate 
exercise of the rights referred to in the Declaration. In this connection, everyone is entitled, 
individually and in association with others, to be protected effectively under national law in 
reacting against or opposing, through peaceful means, activities and acts, including those by 
omission, attributable to States that result in violations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the 
enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions also wishes to remind 
your Excellency&#8217;s attention that, to date, he has not received a response to his request for a fact-
finding mission. If accepted, a visit would allow him to examine <i>in situ</i> questions relating to 
impunity and to formulate pertinent recommendations with the objective of strengthening the 
protection of the right to life.  
 
It is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all 
cases brought to our attention. Since we am expected to report on these cases, we would be 
grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters:

Killing of Mr. Rico Adeva 
</p><p> 
1. Are the facts alleged in the summary of the case accurate? </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 261 
 
 
It was alleged in the communication that: 
 
&quot;On 15 Apri12006 Mr. Rico Adeva was shot and killed while he and his wife were on their way to 
Talisay, Negros Occidental, when three armed men blocked their way. It is reported that the armed

</p>
<p>examinations, and judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to 
this case. If no inquiries have taken place or if they have been inconclusive, please explain 
why. 
</p>
<p> 
For a better understanding of the issues at hand, it is essential to discuss the procedure involved in 
the prosecution of criminal offenses under the domestic criminal justice system. 
 
The usual domestic procedure begins with a police investigation of the case. Thereafter, a criminal 
complaint is filed against the person who was found by the police to have committed the offense. 
 
The complaint is filed before the municipal/city prosecutor's office (of the Department of Justice) 
or in place where there are no prosecutors, before the municipal trial court judge of the place where 
the criminal act was alleged to have been committed. 
 
The prosecutor or the municipal trial court judge, then conducts a preliminary investigation or 
examination of the complaint. In the course of the investigation or examination, the prosecutor or 
the judge calls upon the complainant, the person being accused of the offense, and their witnesses 
to determine the veracity of the complaint. If the prosecutor or the judge is satisfied that there is 
reasonable ground to believe that the crime charged has been committed and that the accused is 
probably guilty thereof, lie recommends the filing of a criminal case before the trial court. After the 
filing of the criminal complaint (which is also called an &quot;information&quot;), trial on the case ensues. 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 262 
 
During trial, the accused is accorded all the rights due an accused under the Constitution, such as, 
but not limited to the following: the right to be presumed innocent; right to counsel; right to be 
informed of the accusation against him; right to speedy, impartial and public trial; right to confront 
witnesses against him; and the right to compel the attendance of witnesses in his behalf. Upon the 
conclusion of trial, the trial court which heard the case will make a finding on the guilt of the 
accused and impose civil sanctions if it finds the accused guilty of the crime charged. 
 
In the present case, the killing of Mr. Adeva is pending preliminary investigation before the 
prosecutor's office. 
</p><p> 
4. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken. Have 
</p>
<p>penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions been imposed on the alleged perpetrators? 
 
Inasmuch as the killing of Mr. Adeva is still pending preliminary investigation, the question 
relating to the imposition of sanctions against the supposed perpetrators cannot be answered at this 
instance. 
</p><p> 
5. Please indicate whether compensation has been provided to the victim or to the family of 
</p>
<p>the victim. 
 
As mentioned above, the killing of Mr. Adeva is still pending preliminary investigation; hence the 
question relating to the payment of compensation to the family of Mr. Adeva cannot be answered 
at this instance.

8 February 2005 in Sitio Latil, Barangay Colonsabak, Kiblawan, Davao del Sur. The alleged 
perpetrators of these acts were under the command of Lieutenants Robert Betita and Josue Erie. 
 
</p>
<p>According to new communications we have recently received, the Office of the 
Ombudsman for the Militar and Other Law Enforcement Office (MOLEO) has incurred 
in serious delays in resolving the complaint filed against the two military lieutenants and 
their men. We have been informed that the Ombudsman allegedly failed to act on a 
resolution submitted by the Office of the Prosecutor on 15 June 2005 concerning the 
killing of the Bulane brothers. We have been informed that under the existing procedure, 
complaints against the military should be submitted to the Ombudsman's Office for 
appropriate action whether or not the case should be filed in court. The MOLEO's delay 
thus would leave the perpetrators of those serious crimes remain in impunity.

<b>Philippines: Impunity for Killings of Leftist Activists

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur appreciates the preliminary information from the Government of the 
Philippines regarding its investigation into the death of Isaias Sta. Rosa and its prosecution of 
those suspected of killing Victor Olayvar.  He also appreciates being informed that the deaths of 
Ceasar Quimco and Napoleon Bautista are being investigated.  The Special Rapporteur would 
request that the Government inform him of the results of each of these proceedings. 
 
The Special Rapporteur would also observe that it would seem especially problematic that even 
the identities of those suspected of killing Isaias Sta. Rosa have yet to be established.  The 
difficulties in solving that case would appear relatively minor.  There were witnesses, the body 
of one suspect was found at the scene, that suspect was a member of the Army, and, according to 
an undisputed allegation, was carrying a signed mission order.  The Special Rapporteur would 
suggest that it is crucial to ensure that the investigation into this and other cases is independent of 
those alleged to have been involved and that witness are provided the necessary security. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation dated 15 September 2006</b> sent with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

<b> 
</b>We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received 
regarding the extrajudicial killings of Pastor<b> Isaias Sta. Rosa</b>, <b>Ceasar Quimco</b>, <b>Victor Olayvar</b>, 
and <b>Napoleon Bautista</b> allegedly by members of the military. 
 
According to the information received, Pastor<b> Isaias Sta. Rosa</b>, a United Methodist Church 
religious worker and a member of the leftist Kilusang Magbubukid ng Bicol (Peasant Movement 
of Bicol), was killed in Barangay (village), Malobango, Daraga, Albay. On 3 August 2006, 
several armed men reportedly entered the house of Pastor Sta Rosa and ordered all those inside 
to drop to the floor. They then grabbed Pastor Isaias and beat him while trying to force him to 
admit that he was in fact a person named &quot;Elmer&quot;. Pastor Isaias allegedly denied being that 
person and told them to check his identification card. 
 
According to our source, Pastor Isaias was then taken outside. When his family was certain that 
the armed men had left, they rushed outside. His family found the dead body of Pastor Isaias 
lying in a nearby creek, some 40-50 meters away from their residence. He reportedly suffered six 
gunshot wounds in his chest, thigh and foot.  
 
According to the information received, this case appears to involve the military, given that the 
body of an alleged perpetrator was found next to the Pastor&#8217;s body. The local police have 
identified the body as being that of Corporal Lordger Pastrana. The following items were found 
on his body: an identification card showing that he was a member of the Army's 9th Infantry 
Division (ID), based in Pili, Camarines Sur; a 45-caliber pistol; a cellular phone allegedly taken 
from Sta. Rosa's house; and a mission order detailing the operation he was part of and signed by 
Major Earnest Mark Rosal. 
 
Corporal Pastrana is believed to have been one of the armed men who entered the house of 
Pastor Isaias, but it is thought that he was accidentally shot by his own men while Pastor Sta. 
Rosa was trying to escape. The Corporal reportedly received a bullet in the right side of his body. 
 
On 22 August 2006, <b>Ceasar Quimco</b> was killed in Barangay (village), Ipil, Carmen, Cebu. 
According to our source, Mr. Quimco had received death threats and his family was being 
harassed by elements of the Army&#8217;s 78th Infantry Battalion. It is reported that Mr Quimco had a 
conflict with two military attached to the said Battalion. 
 
On 7 September 2006, <b>Victor Olayvar</b> was shot dead by armed men riding on a motorcycle at 
Bridge Caban, Barangay (village), Cantubod, Danao. At the time of his death, Mr. Olayvar was 
an active leader of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan or Bayan-Bohol. He was also the former 
president of HUMABOL (Bohol Peasant Organisation) from 1997 to 2000. Mr. Olayvar is 
believed to have been targeted by the military in Bohol as he was been threatened by elements of 
the 302nd Brigade.  
 
According to the information received, the same day the death body of <b>Napoleon Bautista</b> was 
found in Barangay (village) Pungo, Calumpit, Bulacan. His hands were tied with wire and his 
feet had torture marks. He suffered two gunshot wounds to his head and back. According to our 
source, on 30 August 2006, Mr. Bautista was abducted together with his wife, allegedly by 
elements connected to the military. His wife was released a day after she was abducted while her </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 269 
 
husband remained disappeared.  Napoleon Bautista was a member of Samahang Bantay 
Palaisdaan, a group of fishermen that belongs to a national organisation of fishermen 
Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (Pamalakaya). El Sr. Bautista was 
amongst those who survived the Mendiola massacre in 1987. In that incident, government forces 
reportedly opened fire at a crowd of peasants and protesters killing several of them while they 
were holding a protest demanding land reform.  
 
We are gravely concerned by the increase in reports of extra-judicial killings in the Philippines. 
Indeed, more than 50 killings have taken place since January 2006, many of which were brought 
to your attention in our letters sent to your Government in 2006. In the Annex to this letter you 
will find the latest cases of alleged extra-judicial executions which have been brought to our 
attention. The cases are illustrative of this broader tendency and share certain common elements: 
witnesses have reported victims being shot dead by unidentified men, with suspected links to the 
military police, and other security forces. The principal targets of the shootings are political 
opponents (in particular left-wing party activists), human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers, 
community leaders, and union workers who speak out against the authorities. According to the 
information received, the lack of effective investigation and prosecution of perpetrators creates a 
climate of impunity which further fuels human rights violations and extrajudicial killings. 
 
While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we urge your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to take effective measure against impunity to deter and prevent further 
assassinations political activists.  
 
In this respect, we would like to recall that, as reiterated in Commission on Human Rights 
Resolution 2005/34 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), all States have 
&#8220;the obligation (&#8230;) to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, to identify and bring to justice those responsible, 
(&#8230;) and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to bring 
an end to impunity and to prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. This obligation, affirmed 
also in the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee (<i>see</i>, e.g. the Committee&#8217;s views in 
<i>Arhuacos v. Colombia</i>, Communication no. 612/1995, &#167; 8.8.), is indeed part and parcel of the 
obligation to respect and protect the right to life enshrined in Article 3 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights.  
 
We would also would like to refer your Excellency's Government to the fundamental principles 
set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of 
Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state that everyone has the right individually 
or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels&#8221; and that &#8220;each State has 
a prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote and implement all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all 
conditions necessary in the social, economic, political and other fields, as well as the legal 
guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction, individually and in 
association with others, are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice&#8221;.  
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 270 
 
Furthermore, we would like to bring your Excellency&#8217;s attention to the following provisions, and 
in particular:  
 
- article 12 paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration which provide that the State shall take all necessary 
measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in 
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse 
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate 
exercise of the rights referred to in the Declaration. In this connection, everyone is entitled, 
individually and in association with others, to be protected effectively under national law in 
reacting against or opposing, through peaceful means, activities and acts, including those by 
omission, attributable to States that result in violations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the 
enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions also wishes to remind 
your Excellency&#8217;s attention that, to date, he has not received a response to his request for a fact-
finding mission. If accepted, a visit would allow him to examine <i>in situ</i> questions relating to 
impunity and to formulate pertinent recommendations with the objective of strengthening the 
protection of the right to life.

and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all

The Government of the Philippines responded to a communication sent by the Special Rapporteur 
on 15 September 2006 concerning the alleged extrajudicial killings of Pastor Isaias Sta.Rosa, Mr. 
Ceasar Quimco, Mr. Victor Olayvar, and Mr. Napoleon Bautista. 
 
The case of Mr. Ceasar Quimco, killed in Barangay Ipil, Carme, Cebu on 22 August 2006, is still 
under investigation by the Philippine National Police- Police Regional office (PNP-PRO) 7. 
Meanwhile, the case of Mr. Napoleon Bautista, killed in Barangay Pungo, Calumpit, Bulacan on </p>

30 August has been referred by the Philippine National Police- Directorate for Investigations and 
Detective Management (PND-DIDM) to PNP-PRO 3 for in depth investigation. 
 
Alleged extrajudicial killings of Pastor Isaias Sta.Rosa, Mr. Ceasar Quimco, Mr. Victor Olayvar, 
and Napoleon Bautista. 
 
Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? 
 
</p>
<p>Pastor Isaias Sta. Rosa 
 
The shooting incident that resulted in the death of Pastor Isaias Sta. Rosa together with Cpl. 
Lordger G. Pastrana, member of the Philippine Army, transpired on 30 august 2006 in Barangay 
Malobago, Daraga, Albay. Preliminary investigation by Philippine National Police-Police Regional 
Office (PNP-PRO) 5 revealed that Cpl. Pastrana together with unidentified suspects forcibly 
dragged Pastor Sta. Rosa outside his residence and successive gunshots were heard afterwards. The 
suspects took the mobile phone, laptop computer and undetermined amount of money from the 
victim. Investigators recovered from the crime scene, near the body of Cpl. Pastrana, one mobile 
phone believed to be taken from the daughter of the victim, brown wallet containing ID and other 
documents of Cpl. Pastrana, 1 cal. 45 pistol with silencer and a magazine loaded with 6 live 
ammunitions. 
 
Pastor Sta. Rosa was a high-ranking member of <i>Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas </i>holding a high 
position in the National Democratic Front. Investigators from PNP-PRO 5 are still conducting in-
depth investigation regarding said killing. 
 
 Victor Olavvar 
 
The alleged killing of Mr. Victor Olayvar, Chairman of <i>Hiukbong Maguumang Bolanon 
</i>(HUMABOL) on 07 September 2006, at Barangay Cantubod, Danao, Bohol is believed to be 
motivated by purging, as his own comrades in the Communist Party of the Philippines/New 
People's Army/National Democratic Front (CPP/NPA/NDF) ordered the killing of Mr. Olayvar. 
 
Based on the accounts of the witnesses, the suspects were identified as Rolando Torres, Marlou 
Betas and Neil Logronio. Mr. Torres was arrested on 11 September 2006 and recovered from him 
was the red motorcycle apparently used in the killing of Mr. Olayvar. 
 
A case of murder was filed against all suspects before the Bohol Provincial Prosecutor's Office 
under I.S. No. 06-2860. 
 
Please provide the details, and where available the results of any investigation, medical

According to the information received: 
 
The 18 men named above have been sentenced to death for their alleged involvement in an 
attempted coup that did not cause any casualty. They were arrested at different times in the mid- 
to late- 1990s for their involvement in a failed attempt to overthrow the government of the Amir 
in 1996. All 18 men were sentenced to life imprisonment at their trial before a lower Court in 
February 2000, but after taking their case to the Court of Appeal, they received death sentences 
in May 2001.  
 
Concern has been expressed that they were sentenced to death following a trial that may have 
fallen short of international fair trial standards. Following their arrest, many of the 18 men were 
held incommunicado until their trial hearings began. Some of them alleged that they had been 
tortured in order to force them to &quot;confess&quot;. 
</p>
<p> 
It is our understanding that their only remaining option is to have their sentences commuted by 
the Amir of Qatar who also has the power to pardon, grant clemency or ratify death sentences. 
</p>
<p> 
If these allegations were correct, there would be grounds for serious concern. We would like to 
remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that the death penalty must be regarded as an extreme 
exception to the fundamental right to life and that it must therefore be applied in the most 
restrictive manner. While we are fully aware of the most serious nature of the crime the 18 men 
named above have been found guilty of,  it is crucial that all fair trial and other protections 
provided for in international human rights law are fully respected in proceedings relating to 
capital offences.  Accordingly, we respectfully remind your Excellency that &#8220;in capital 
punishment cases, the obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a 
fair trial set out in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights admits 
no exception&#8221; (Little v. Jamaica, communication no. 283/1988, Views of the Human Rights 
Committee of 19 November 1991, para.10). Relevant to the case at issue, these guarantees 
include the right not to be compelled to confess guilt. 
 
We also recall that Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/39 urges States to ensure that 
any statement, which is established to have been made as a result of torture, shall not be invoked 
in any proceedings. This principle is an essential aspect of the right to physical and mental 
integrity set forth, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from 
Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.

We have further been informed that two other men, Bakhit Marzouq al-&#8216;Abdallah and Shaikh 
Hamad bin Jassem bin Hamad al-Thani, who were also sentenced to death in relation to the 
attempted coup, were recently granted a royal pardon and released in January and September 
2005 respectively.  
 
In this context, we urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that the rights under international law of the 18 men above mentioned are respected. 
Considering the irremediable nature of capital punishment, this can only mean suspension of the 
death sentence until the allegation of torture have been thoroughly investigated and all doubts in 
this respect dispelled. Finally, international law requires that the accountability of any person 
guilty of subjecting these men to torture is ensured. 
 
It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all 
cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the Commission, 
we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of this case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
examinations and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the allegations that some of 
the above mentioned men were subjected to torture while in pre-trial detention. If no inquiries 
have taken place or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 
3. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken with 
regard to the alleged torture of the men above mentioned. Have penal, disciplinary or 
administrative sanctions been imposed on the perpetrators? 
 
<b>Response of the Government of Qatar dated 23 July 2006 
</b> 
The Government provided information relating to a letter of the Special Rapporteur dated 9 
February 2006 concerning 18 individuals convicted of taking part in an attempted coup. 
 
The Government assured the Special Rapporteur that it took great interest in the contents of the 
above-mentioned letter, as the subject of the promotion and protection of human rights is a 
cornerstone of the comprehensive reform policy on which Qatar has embarked. 
 
The Government informed that the names of some of the convicted persons are not correct.  The 
correct names are: Fahd Ali Abdullah Jasim al-Maliki; Salim Mubarak Salim Dahman; 
Mohammed Ali Mohammed Salman al-Muhannadi; Ibrahim Sa`d Isma`il; Hashan Salim Haziq 
al-Karabi; Hamad Ali Jahman al-Ghufrani al-Mirri; Abd al-Hadi Rashid Nasir Shafi`ah al-Mirri; 
Abd al-Hadi Jabir Hadi al-Rakib; Rashid Ali Jabir al-Araq al-Mirri; Jabir Salih Jabir Jallab al-
Mirri; Jabir Ali Jabir Anan al-Awir al-Mirri; Hamad Mohammed Abduh Al-Mirri; Abd al-Hadi 
Ali Hamad Hadhnah al-Mirri; Jabir Hamad Jabir Jallab al-Mirri; Mohammed Lami` Ali Salih 
Jahman; Rashid Nasir Ali al-Liwa&#8217;; Fawaz Ali Mohammed Salman al-Muhannadi; Buran Ali 
Ja`mal; and Buran Al Kalib. 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 278 
 
Apart from Buran Ali Ja`mal and Buran Al Kalib, who are Saudi nationals, and Rashid Nasir Ali 
al-Liwa&#8217;, who has his original Saudi nationality (the nationality of his father), the rest of the 
convicted men named in your letter are Qatari nationals, according to the documents attached to 
the case file. 
 
As for Fawaz Ali Mohammed Salman al-Muhannadi, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, not 
death. 
 
The public prosecutor brought a criminal prosecution before the court of first instance having 
charged the defendants with the following three offences: 
</p><p> 
1. An offence under article 64, paragraph 2, of the Qatari Criminal Code No. 14 of 1971 which is 
punishable by life imprisonment. 
 
2. An offence under article 65 of the Code which is punishable only by death. 
 
3. An offence under article 66, paragraph 2, of the Code which is punishable only by death. 
 
The court of first instance found the defendants guilty only of the first offence, and sentenced 
them to life imprisonment.  It acquitted them on the second and third counts. 
 
The public prosecutor and the convicted persons were not satisfied with the verdict and filed an 
appeal with the appeal court pursuant to article 114 of the Code of Criminal Procedures No. 15 
of 1971.  The public prosecutor asked for the death sentence to be imposed on the defendants for 
committing the second and third offences in addition to the first.  The convicted persons asked to 
be acquitted of the first count, as the case against them had not been proved. 
 
The appeal court concluded that on the first count, namely, that of attempting to remove the Emir 
from power, an offence which is punishable by life imprisonment under paragraph 2 of article 64 
of the Criminal Code, all 18 individuals named in your letter, including Fawaz Ali Mohammed 
Salim al-Muhannadi, were guilty.  Except for the latter, it further concluded that on the second 
count, that of bearing weapons against the State, an offence which is punishable by death under 
article 64 of the Code, the other 17 defendants were all guilty.  As for the third count, that of 
working for a foreign State and for persons intent on committing hostile acts against the State of 
Qatar, an offence which carries a penalty of death under article 66, paragraph 2, of the Code, the 
court found against only four of the persons named in your letter - Abd al-Hadi Jabir Hadi al-
Rakib, Jabir Hamad Jabir Jallab al-Mirri, Jabir Salih Jabir Jallab al-Mirri and Buran Al Kalib - 
who were also found guilty on the first and second counts. 
 
The conviction handed down by the courts of first and second instance were based on proper 
evidence that satisfied all legal standards and had been obtained from confessions which the 
defendants had made against themselves and each other.  The confessions were made freely and 
voluntarily before the court in the court building, and were supported by witness testimony given 
at trial.  As for the statements which the defendants made to the police during questioning, the 
court did not accept them without being perfectly convinced that they had been obtained without 
any form of coercion or duress.  The court replied, with arguments, to all the pleadings and </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 279 
 
defence arguments put forward by the defendants&#8217; lawyers and the appeal judgement No. 
642/2000 can be consulted. 
 
The court acted in accordance with international standards relating to the guarantee of a fair trial 
before ordinary courts in accordance with Qatari laws, and not before special or military courts.  
The court sessions were attended by representatives of international non-governmental 
organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, attending as observers. 
 
The judgment became final and cannot be appealed before any judicial body.  It remains for the 
Emir to exercise his power to confirm the judgment or grant an amnesty, as permitted by law. 
 
I should also like to inform you that the Qatari Constitution, which was adopted by a popular 
referendum held in 2003 and confirmed by the country&#8217;s beloved Emir in 2004, entered into 
force in June this year.  Chapter III, articles 34-58, are devoted to the protection of fundamental 
rights and freedoms.  The Constitution upholds the principle of the interdependence and 
indivisibility of human rights, and thus guarantees economic, social, cultural, civil and political 
rights.  Among the rights which the Constitution guarantees, we should like to mention, by way 
of example, equality before the law, non-discrimination, personal liberty, the right to a fair trial 
and the prohibition of torture. 
 
The rights recognized in the Constitution have been strengthened and promoted through the 
adoption of a series of laws and through the guarantees of the independence of the judiciary as an 
important mechanism and tool for the protection of human rights.  The constitutional and legal 
framework has been further strengthened by the creation of several institutions for the promotion 
and protection of human rights at the governmental level (for example, the Office of Human 
Rights at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Human Rights at the Ministry of 
the Interior) and at the civil society level (for example, the National Committee for Human 
Rights and the Qatari Foundation for the Protection of Children and Women). 
 
Allow me to assure you that we are mindful of our obligations vis-&#224;-vis international human 
rights treaties and standards, and we are working to implement them with the requisite 
transparency, believing as we do that the subject of human rights is the cornerstone of the 
comprehensive reform policy to which everyone aspires. 
 
In conclusion, we should like to assure you that we stand ready to respond to any other requests 
for clarification on this matter and on any other subjects of mutual concern, in the quest for the 
promotion and protection of human rights.

would request that he be informed of the results of the criminal proceedings to which the 
Government&#8217;s response refers. 
<b> 
Letter of allegation dated 21 April 2006</b> sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture<b> 
</b> 
In this connection, we would like to bring to your to your Government&#8217;s attention information 
we have received concerning <b>Umaev Ilman</b>, 22 years, <b>Umaev Anzor</b>, 33 years and <b>Umaev Issa</b>, 
52 years. According to the information received,  
 
</p>
<p>On 18 April at 5 am, these three persons together with Ilman Umaev's wife, Madina 
Umaeva, were arrested in Sayasan village, Nozhay-Yurtovskii District, Chechnya, in the 
house of Ilman Umaev by a division of fighters called &quot;Groza&quot;. When they were being 
taken, Issa Umaev was badly beaten and Anzor Umaev sustained grave injuries. Around 4 
pm the same day, Ilman and Anzor Umaev were found dead at a crossroad close to 
Sayasan village. They had been redressed as if they were separatists. The remaining two, 
the father and wife of one of the victims, were released.  
</p>
<p> 
While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to stress that 
each Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all 
persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture. We 
would also like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to Principle 4 of the UN Basic Principles 
on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Officials, which provides that, &quot;Law enforcement 
officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before 
resorting to the use of force and firearms.&#8221;  Furthermore, Principle 5 provides that, &#8220;Whenever 
the use of force and firearms is unavoidable law enforcement officials shall, (a) Exercise restraint 
in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the legitimate object to be 
achieved; (b) Minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve human life; (c) Ensure that 
assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured or affected persons at the earliest possible 
moment and (d) Ensure that relatives or close friends of the injured or affected person are 
notified at the earliest possible moment.&quot; (Adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on

<b>Response of the Government of the Russian Federation dated 24 November 2006</b> 
 
On 18 April 2006, in the settlement of Sayasan, in the Nozhai-Yurt district of the Chechen 
Republic, during the conduct of a targeted check, officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of 
the Chechen Republic came up against resistance from I.E. Umaev and A.A. Umaev, members 
of an illegal armed gang.  During the armed clash, two police officers, M. Ilyasov and U.I. 
Badidov, were wounded.  Firearms and other munitions were seized at the place of the 
encounter.  In response to this assault on the lives of law-enforcement officers, on 18 April 2006 
the Nozhai-Yurt district procurator&#8217;s office in the Chechen Republic instituted criminal case 
No. 62007 on the evidence of the commission of an offence under article 317 of the Criminal 
Code of the Russian Federation (Attack against the life of a law-enforcement officer). 
 
A.A. Umaev and I.E. Umaev were arrested and transferred to the town of Gudermes in the 
Chechen Republic, where they agreed to reveal their stash of weapons. 
 
Later that same day they were escorted by internal affairs officers of the Chechen Republic to the 
outskirts of the settlement Sayasan for the purposes of verifying evidence at the scene of the 
offence.  During the inspection of the scene, A.A. Umaev picked up a grenade and tried to throw 
it at the police officers.  The latter, acting both to prevent an explosion and to stop their detainees 
from escaping, opened fire with their standard-issue weapons, inflicting gunshot wounds on both 
A.A. Umaev and I.E. Umaev, from which both men later died on the spot. 
 
In response to this incident, on 12 May 2006, the procurator&#8217;s office of the Chechen Republic 
instituted criminal proceedings on the basis of evidence of the commission of offences under 
article 105, paragraph (a) (Murder) and article 286, paragraphs (b) and (c) (Exceeding official 
authority) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.  A range of investigative actions and 
detective work is currently being carried out. 
 
In addition, an in-house inquiry is being conducted by the internal security office in the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs of the Chechen Republic relating to the death of the Umaevs.

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of the Russian 
Federation.  The SR would request that he be informed of the results of the ongoing 
investigations and pending criminal proceedings to which the Government&#8217;s response refers.  As 
to the completed cases, the SR notes that the Government&#8217;s response failed to provide any 
information as to sentences for those convicted or compensation for the victims, as requested in 
the original communication of the SR. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation dated 30 October 2006 
</b></p>
<p> 
I would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information I have received regarding the 
killing of <b>Anna Politkovskaya</b> on 7 October 2006 whose body was found with two gunshots in 
the elevator of her apartment building. According to the information I have received, her murder 
appears to have been a contract killing and is believed to be linked to her investigative reports on 
human rights abuses by the Russian military in Chechnya. Ms. Politkovskaya was due to publish 
an investigative article on 9 October 2006 about torture and kidnappings in Chechnya based on 
witness accounts and photos of tortured bodies. 
I welcome President Vladimir Putin's public condemnation of the murder of journalist Anna 
Politkovskaya, and am aware that the Moscow General Prosecutor&#8217;s office has opened a murder 
investigation into her death. I call on your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure that the death of 
Ms Politkovskaya is promptly, independently and thoroughly investigated, in accordance with 
the United Nations principles on the effective prevention and investigation of extra-legal, 
arbitrary and summary executions. 
This killing is all the more concerning given the allegation that a total of 13 journalists have been 
killed in Russia since the year 2000 because of their reporting activities. Many of these cases 
appear to share common elements.  In particular, a majority of the victims are reported to have 
been shot or hit at point-blank range by unidentified gunmen in contract style murders. All 
journalists appear to have been targeted because of their attempts to investigate allegations of 
corruption or of human rights abuses in the Chechen conflict. According to the information 
received the investigations into these killings have been inconclusive and the perpetrators have 
not been found. 
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, <b>Igor Domnikov</b>, reporter and editor for the Moscow 
paper Novaya Gazeta, died on 12 May 2002 after being struck in the head with a heavy object in 
the entryway of his apartment building. It is believed that the assailant have mistaken him for 
Novaya Gazeta investigative reporter Oleg Sultanov, who lived in the same building and 
received threats after reporting on oil industry corruption.

</p>
<p> 
<b>Iskandar Khatloni</b>, a reporter for the Tajik language service of Radio Free Europe/Radio 
Liberty was attacked in his apartment in Moscow on 21 September 2000 by an axe-wielding

</p>
<p> 
<b>Sergey Ivanov</b>, director of the independent Lada-television company was shot five times in the

<p> 
<b>Adam Tepsurgayev</b>, a cameraman for Reuters, was shot at a neighbour&#8217;s house in Alkhan-Kala 
on 21 November 2000. During the first Chechen war, Tepsurgayev worked as a driver and fixer 
for foreign journalists. Later, he shot footage from the front lines. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>Eduard Markevich</b>, editor and publisher of the local newspaper Novy Reft, was found dead 
after being shot in the back on 12 September 2001 in Reftinsky. Novy Reft was known to often 
criticize local officials. Eduard Markevich was reportedly receiving threatening telephone calls 
and in 1998, two assailants had broken into his apartment and severely beat him.

<b>Natalya Skryl,</b> a business reporter from the Nashe Vremya newspaper in the south-western city 
of Rostov-on-Don, died after being struck a dozen times with a heavy object while she was 
returning home on 9 March 2002. She was investigating the struggle for control of a 
metallurgical plant.

<p> 
<b>Valery Ivanov</b>, an editor in chief of the Tolyattinskoye Obozreniye newspaper was shot eight 
times in the head at point-blank range outside his home in Togliatti on 29 April 2002. The 
newspaper was known for its investigative reports on crimes and government corruption.

<p> 
<b>Aleksei Sidorov, </b>editor in chief of the Tolyattinskoye Obozreniye newspaper, was stabbed in the 
chest with an ice pick near his apartment building in Togliatti on 9 October 2003. He was the 
second editor of Tolyattinskoye Obozreniye to be murdered in as many years. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>Dmitry Shvets, </b>deputy director-general of the independent television station TV-21 
Northwestern Broadcasting<b>, </b>was shot several times outside the station&#8217;s offices. His colleagues 
said that TV-21 had been receiving threats for critical reporting on several influential politicians.

While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I urge your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to take effective measures against what appears to be a consistent pattern of failure 
to prosecute and to take measures designed to prevent further assassination of journalists.  
 
In this respect, I would like to recall that, as reiterated in Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 2004/37 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), all States have 
&#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigation into all suspected cases of 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, to identify and bring to justice those responsible, 
&#8230; and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to bring 
an end to impunity and to prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. This obligation, affirmed 
also in the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committed (<i>see</i>, e.g. the Committee&#8217;s views in 
<i>Arhuacos v. Colombia,</i> Communication no. 612/1995, &#167; 8.8), is indeed part and parcel of the 
obligation to respect and protect the right to life enshrined in Article 3 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. 
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly and extended by the 
Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected 
to report on these cases, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the 
following matters:

<b>Response of the Government of the Russian Federation dated 23 January 2007 
</b> 
The Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations Office and 
Other International Organizations in Geneva presents its compliments to the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and, with reference to enquiry 
No. AL G/SO 214 (33-24) RUS 30/2006, submitted by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions, has the honour to transmit the attached information from the 
Russian Federation.  </p>

</p>
<p> 
The Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation takes this opportunity to convey to the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights the renewed assurances of its 
highest consideration. 
 Upon verification, it was found that criminal proceedings in connection with all the cases 
referred to in the enquiry were instituted in a timely manner. 
 
The murder in Moscow of I.A. Domnikov, head of the <i>Novaya Gazeta</i> special projects 
department, the murder in Tolyatti of S.A. Ivanov, director-general of the television channel 
TV-6 OAO AvtoVAZ, and the murder in Murmansk of D.V. Shvets, deputy director-general of 
TV-21, have now been solved. 
 
In the criminal proceedings in connection with the murder of S.A. Ivanov, 10 persons were 
found guilty and sentenced by the court.  Upon the completion of the investigation into the 
murder of I.A. Domnikov in May 2006, the criminal case was referred to the Supreme Court of 
the Republic of Tatarstan.  Following the death of V.G. Gallo, who had been accused of the

<p> 
En este contexto, deseamos poner en su conocimiento que en el ejercicio de nuestros mandatos 
respectivos, continuamos recibiendo informaci&#243;n sobre presuntas violaciones de derechos 
humanos en la frontera de Espa&#241;a con Marruecos. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida:  
 
</p>
<p>El 3 de julio de 2006, tres hombres murieron en la frontera del enclave espa&#241;ol de 
Melilla, en el norte de Marruecos, cuando trataban de entrar en Espa&#241;a. Uno de los 
hombres, identificado como de origen sub-sahariano, muri&#243; en el lado espa&#241;ol de la 
frontera aparentemente debido a una herida de bala. Las otras dos muertes ocurrieron en 
el lado marroqu&#237; de la frontera. Las v&#237;ctimas habr&#237;an sufrido heridas mortales al caerse de 
lo alto de la valla que delimita la frontera, aunque se desconoce la raz&#243;n por la que se 
cayeron. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida,  los 3 hombres que murieron formaban parte de 
un grupo de 32 personas que intentaban cruzar la frontera. Cinco integrantes del grupo 
habr&#237;an logrado saltar la valla  y entrar en Espa&#241;a, 7 habr&#237;an sido detenidos, y por lo 
menos 7 m&#225;s habr&#237;an resultado heridos, entre ellos una persona a la que se habr&#237;a dejado 
sangrando entre las dos vallas durante aproximadamente una hora.

II. Segunda cuesti&#243;n: informaci&#243;n sobre los incidentes del pasado 3 de junio de 2006. 
 
En relaci&#243;n con la segunda cuesti&#243;n, los relatores realizan una descripci&#243;n inicial de los hechos - 
seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n de que disponen - y formulan una serie de preguntas al Gobierno a fin de 
determinar su veracidad y conocer la realidad de lo sucedido.  
 
El relato preliminar es el siguiente: 
 
E13 de julio de 2006, tres hombres, murieron en la frontera del enclave espa&#241;ol de Melilla, en el 
norte de Marruecos, cuando trataban de entrar en Espa&#241;a. Uno de los hombres, identificado come 
de origen subsahariano, muri&#243; en et lado espa&#241;ol de la frontera, aparentemente debido a una 
herida de bala. Las otras dos muertes ocurrieron en et lado marroqu&#237; de la frontera. Las victimas 
habr&#237;an sufrido heridas mortales al caerse de lo alto de la valla que delimita la frontera, aunque 
se desconoce la raz&#243;n por la que se cayeron.  
 
Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, les 3 hombres que murieron formaban parte de un grupo de 32 
personas que intentaban cruzar la frontera. Cinco integrantes del grupo habr&#237;an logrado saltar la 
valla y entrar en Espa&#241;a, 7 habr&#237;an sido detenidos, entre ellos une persona a la que se habr&#237;an 
dejado sangrando entre las dos vallas durante aproximadamente una hora. 
 
Sobre estos hechos, los relatores plantean las siguientes preguntas: 
 
Primera pregunta: Son exactos les hechos referidos? Si no, para refutar estas alegaciones 
agradecer&#237;amos nos proporcionen Ios resultados de las diligencias efectuadas, Incluyendo las 
necropsias que eventualmente se hayan realizado&quot;. 
 
Los hechos referidos son totalmente inexactos. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n de que dispone esta 
Secretaria de Estado de Seguridad, en base a los informes emitidos par la Comandancia de la 
Guardia Civil de Melilla y la delegaci&#243;n del Gobierno en dicha ciudad los hechos sucedieron en 
la forma siguiente: 
<b> 
</b>a) Descripci&#243;n general de los incidentes 
 
El pasado 3 de julio de 2006, sobre las 5.13 horas, un grupo de entre 50 y 70 inmigrantes 
subsaharianos protagonizaron una tentativa de vulneraci&#243;n fronteriza &quot;en grupo&quot; del per&#237;metro 
fronterizo de Melilla por la zona comprendida entre et Paso fronterizo de Farhana y et Zoco Had. 
 
Los inmigrantes, que portaban para ello un gran n&#250;mero de escaleras artesanales y cuerdas 
provistas de ganchos met&#225;licos, se hab&#237;an reunido previamente en territorio marroqu&#237;  y, en 
concreto, a las afueras de la localidad de Farhana. 
 
Con objeto de no ser avistados por las Fuerzas de Seguridad y militares marroqu&#237;es, se 
aproximaron al per&#237;metro fronterizo a trav&#233;s del lecho del arroyo de Farhana que desemboca 
perpendicularmente en la valla que rodea la ciudad de Melilla 
 
Al llegar al vallado perimetral y antes de escalar la valla exterior con intenci&#243;n de saltar hacia et 
interior de nuestro pa&#237;s fueron avistados, desde territorio espa&#241;ol, par la Guardia Civil, lo que les </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 290 
 
oblig&#243; a desviarse en paralelo a la valla direcci&#243;n a la loma del Zoco Had, buscando otro lugar 
m&#225;s apropiado para intentar et salto. 
 
A unos 80 metros, colocaron las escalas sobre la valla exterior e intentaron superar et obst&#225;culo. 
En et momento de iniciar et sa1to intervinieron las Fuerzas do Seguridad marroqu&#237;es (Ej&#233;rcito y 
Fuerzas Auxiliares), que les conminaron a detenerse 
<b> 
</b>En ese momento se form&#243; un gran revuelo entre et grupo de inmigrantes, algunos de ellos fueron 
detenidos, en et lado marroqu&#237;; por los militares de aqu&#233;l pa&#237;s y la mayoria huy&#243; adentr&#225;ndose de 
nuevo en el territorio de Marruecos. 
 
b) Hechos sucedidos en territorio espa&#241;ol: 
 
Cinco de estos inmigrantes, lograron escalar la valle exterior y acceder al espacio entre-vallas del 
sistema anti-intrusi&#243;n. 
 
De ellos: 
 
Uno falleci&#243; en et transcurso de los incidentes- los miembros de la Guardia Civil que 
participaron en   el dispositivo observaron su Ca&#237;da desde lo alto de vallado, cuando se dispon&#237;a 
a saltar hacia et interior. Otro fue evacuado al Hospital Comarcal de Melilla por presentar 
heridas graves,<b> </b>y los otros tres fueron conducidos a la comandancia de la Guardia Civil a fin de 
llevar a cabo su identificaci&#243;n, toma de declaraci&#243;n  como testigos, puesta a disposici&#243;n judicial 
y posterior entrega en Comisar&#237;a del Cuerpo Nacional de Polic&#237;a, a efectos previstos par la 
legislaci&#243;n de extranjer&#237;a. 
 Un equipo m&#233;dico trasladado a la zona reconoci&#243; et cuerpo del inmigrante fallecido, decretando 
su muerte y detectando, como resultado de este primer reconocimiento una herida de unos 4 cms 
de di&#225;metro sin aparente orificio de salida, presumiblemente causado por et impacto de un 
proyectil Tras personarse la Autoridad Judicial y autorizar et levantamiento del cad&#225;ver, fue 
trasladado al dep&#243;sito municipal al objeto de practicar la correspondiente autopsia. 
 
El inmigrante herido,<b> </b>que seg&#250;n estas primeras apreciaciones padec&#237;a traumatismo abdominal 
abierto, fue evacuado al Hospital Comarcal de Melilla donde fue intervenido. Quir&#250;rgicamente, 
quedando ingresado en la U. C I del Hospital Comarcal, donde posteriormente se determinar&#237;a 
que las lesi&#243;n podr&#237;a tener su origen en una 'herida por arma de fuego &quot;.Los otros tres 
inmigrantes sufrieron apenas algunos rasgu&#241;os y lev&#237;simas contusiones. 
<b> 
</b>Por tanto: 
 El fallecimiento del inmigrante muerto en territorio espa&#241;ol no se debi&#243; a una ca&#237;da modal desde 
la valla. No es cierto que las heridas del inmigrante atendido en territorio espa&#241;ol fueran debidas 
a su ca&#237;da desde la valla. 
No es cierto que ning&#250;n herido haya permanecido por espacio de una hora desangr&#225;ndose entre 
las dos vallas. 
<b> 
 </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 291 
 
c) Hechos sucedidos en territorio marroqu&#237; 
<b> </b> Los relatores dan cuenta, en su escrito, del fallecimiento de otros dos inmigrantes en territorio 
marroqu&#237;. 
 
Corresponde a las Autoridades de aqu&#233;l pa&#237;s pronunciarse sobre estos hechos en base a las 
comprobaciones o investigaciones que sobre los mismos hayan efectuado. 
 
Segunda pregunta: Si fueron presentadas quejas o denuncias, cuales han sido las respuestas a las 
mismas y la acciones referidas en las respuestas? 
 
El Ministerio del Interior no tiene constancia de que haya sido presentada en Espa&#241;a denuncia ni 
queja alguna ni par las inmigrantes que participaran en las hechos ni por terceras personas u 
organizaciones en su nombre. En aplicaci&#243;n de las leyes espa&#241;olas se han abierto diligencias 
judiciales para la investigaci&#243;n de los hechos. En este momento se est&#225;n incoando las diligencias 
previas n&#250;mero 726106, par et Juzgado de Instrucci&#243;n n&#250;mero 2 de Melilla<i>, </i>que a&#250;n no han 
concluido. 
 
Tercera  pregunta:&quot;Por favor, proporcione las detalles, as&#237; coma los resultados, en casa de que 
sean disponibles, de las diligencias, judiciales o de otro tipo, realizadas en relaci6n con estas 
casas&quot;. 
 
Seg&#250;n se desprende de las actuaciones practicadas hasta et momento, de las que tiene 
conocimiento et Ministerio del Interior, pueden establecerse las siguientes conclusiones: 
 
Primero: El inmigrante fallecido y et inmigrante herido en territorio espa&#241;ol lo fueron, no como 
consecuencia de heridas producidas al caer desde et vallado, sino como consecuencia del 
impacto de proyectiles<i>. </i>Del cuerpo del inmigrante fallecido y de su vestimenta se extrajeron 
diversos fragmentos met&#225;licos. Sus caracter&#237;sticas, seg&#250;n las informes del Departamento de 
Bal&#237;stica, se corresponder&#237;an con las de un proyectil de los que monta <i>la </i>munici&#243;n met&#225;lica de 
percusi&#243;n central del calibre 7,62 mm. 
 
Seg&#250;n et informe m&#233;dico oficial sobre las lesiones que presentaba <i>et </i>herido y une vez realizado 
un TAC de control, se observa en et cuerpo &quot;un trayecto compatible con herida de arma de 
fuego, con orificio de entrada en et gl&#250;teo izquierdo, que perfora la gala iliaca izquierda, siendo 
et orificio de salida la herida incisa referida anteriormente (herida incisa en la fosa iliaca 
derecha) 
 
Segundo: La Guardia Civil no efectu&#243; los disparos que causaron la muerte al inmigrante 
fallecido en territorio espa&#241;ol y heridas graves a otro. 
 
Seg&#250;n se desprende de los informes del Departamento de Bal&#237;stica y de los cumplimentados par 
la Comandancia de la Guardia Civil en Melilla: 'Va persona fallecida recibid un &#250;nico impacto 
de proyectil por arma de fuego, del calibre 7 62 mn, con trayectoria ligeramente ascendente, y de 
atr&#225;s y a la derecha hacia delante<b> </b>e izquierda (...). Por tanto (..) la hip&#243;tesis m&#225;s que probable es 
que et origen del disparo<b> </b>se e establece en territorio marroqu&#237;; no pudiendo concretarse m&#225;s la 
trayectoria descrita por et proyectil': </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 292 
 
 
Las caracter&#237;sticas de los fragmentas encontrados no se corresponden con el tipo de munici&#243;n 
utilizado por la Guardia Civil. En un informe del Hospital de Melilla se recogen algunas de las 
manifestaciones realizadas por et herido al equipo m&#233;dico: &quot;cuando el paciente se encuentra en 
condiciones de explicar las circunstancias de su lesi&#243;n, refiere que ha sufrido et impacto de un 
disparo procedente de Marruecos cuando intentaba subir la valla del lado marroqu&#237;&quot;.  
 
En las declaraciones que el herido prest&#243; ante la unidad org&#225;nica de Polic&#237;a Judicial, manifest&#243; 
que &quot;recibi&#243; et disparo mientras trepaba con una escala la valla exterior del lado marroqu&#237;. De 
hecho, durante los incidentes, ninguno de los 35 guardias civiles que participaron en su control, 
desenfund&#243; ni utiliz&#243; sus armas cortas reglamentarias de dotaci&#243;n individual. S&#243;1o se emple&#243; 
por algunos de estos guardias civiles -los autorizados - material antidisturbios de modo 
disuasorio, en concreto lanzaron al aire pelotas de goma. No es posible, par tanto, que los 
impactos recibidos par los inmigrantes se debieran a la actuaci&#243;n de la Guardia Civil. Las 
anteriores son las conclusiones que pueden extraerse con la informaci&#243;n disponible hasta el 
momento.A&#250;n no se dispone del resultado de la autopsia ni se han concluido las diligencias 
judiciales.  
 
Cuarta pregunta: Por favor, proporcione las detalles de cualquier diligencia que haya sida 
emprendida 
 
Se han abierto actuaciones judiciales, en concreto, las diligencias previas n&#250;mero 720106, par et 
Juzgado de instrucci&#243;n n&#250;mero 2 de Melilla, a las que se ha hecho referencia. 
 
Quinta pregunta: indique si alguna compensaci&#243;n ha sida otorgada a las familias de las victimas: 
 
No se tiene constancia de que haya sida solicitada ni haya sida otorgada ning&#250;n tipo de 
compensaci&#243;n a las familias de las victimas. En cualquier caso, el inmigrante fallecido no ha 
podido ser identificado. 
 
Sexta Pregunta: Cuales son las acciones tomadas o planteadas para prevenir la repetici&#243;n de tales 
incidentes en et futuro? 
 
El cerramiento perimetral de la Ciudad y et sistema antiintrusi&#243;n instalado entre las dos vallas 
que lo configuran ha demostrado no resultar lesivo ni ser el agente causante de las incidentes del 
pasado 3 de julio. Tampoco lo ha sido la actuaci&#243;n de la Guardia Civil. 
 
A&#250;n as&#237; se han adoptado las dos siguientes decisiones: 
 
Para minimizar et riesgo que conlleva cualquier ca&#237;da accidental de un inmigrante al intentar 
saltar la valla fronteriza desde une altura de seis metros (que es la que tiene en su parte m&#225;s alta): 
 
El Ministerio del Interior ha dada instrucciones a la empresa constructora del sistema 
antiintrusion instalado entre las dos vallas para que compruebe la instalaci&#243;n y se lime o rebaje 
cualquier saliente o arista del sistema que sea detectada y se revistan (con capuchones de goma) 
aquellos elementos con las que puedan darse accidentalmente en el momento de dar el salto. 
 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 293 
 
Para minimizar et riesgo de que puedan producirse Incidentes durante los asaltos de inmigrantes 
a la doble valla garantizando a m&#225;s escrupuloso respeto a la indemnidad y a los derechos 
humanos de los asaltantes.  
 
El Ministerio del Interior ha pedido a la direcci&#243;n Subdirecci&#243;n General de Operaciones de la 
Guardia Civil que tenga previstas unas nuevas instrucciones de servicia para los agentes que 
vigilan el per&#237;metro fronterizo que, a la vez que recuerde, expresamente, los principios b&#225;sicos 
de actuaci&#243;n y de proporci&#243;n en el empleo de medios - que ya conocen perfectamente - sirvan 
para adaptar los procedimientos de intervenci&#243;n a las caracter&#237;sticas f&#237;sicas del nuevo 
cerramiento.

<b> 
Letter of allegation dated 16 January 2006 
</b> 
We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received

heavy stones. On the following morning, the body was taken to the Jaffna Teaching Hospital, 
where a post mortem was performed. The Judicial Medical Officer reportedly found stab wounds 
in her chest and near her hips and concluded that Tharshini had been raped before being killed. 
The medical report was submitted to the police, who submitted it to the Magistrate&#8217;s Court on 20 
December 2005. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has been at the crime scene and 
has heard the victim&#8217;s relatives.  
 
On 2 January 2006, around 7.45 pm, <b>Thangathurai Sivanantha</b>, <b>Logithasan Rohanth</b>, 
<b>Shanmugarajah Sajeenthiran</b>, <b>Manoharan Rajeehar</b>, and <b>Yogarajah Hemachandran</b>, five 
Tamil youths, were shot in Trincomalee near Dockyard Road. Two other Tamil youths 
(Pararajasingham Kokilaraj and Yogarajah Pookulanlon) sustained serious injuries in the 
incident. According to the information received, the young men were chatting on the road-side 
when from a passing three-wheeler a grenade was thrown at them, injuring them. Immediately </p>

thereafter, armed men arrived in a car and shot at five of the young men, three in the head and 
two in the abdomen and chest, causing their death. Some reports state that the killers arrived on a 
vehicle of the Sri Lankan armed forces. The dead bodies and the two injured persons were taken 
to the General Hospital, Trincomalee. The President has appointed a commission to investigate 
the deaths. 
 
As stated above, we do not prejudge the accuracy of the reports attributing the killings to your 
Government&#8217;s armed forces. Whoever might be responsible, however, international law demands 
that your Excellency&#8217;s Government carry out an impartial, expeditious, and effective 
investigation into the killings, and that those responsible be held to account under criminal law. 
Considering the not entirely implausible allegations of involvement of security forces in the 
killings, it is all the more urgent that the investigations not only are in fact impartial and 
independent, but also clearly appear to be so in the eyes of all communities in Sri Lanka. 
Moreover, considering the risk that these killings might lead (or already have led) to further, 
retaliatory killings, it is of paramount importance that the results of any inquiry be brought to the 
knowledge of the public expeditiously and in a transparent manner.  
 
With respect to the killing of Tharshini, we note with concern that before the signing of the 
Ceasefire Agreement there had been a series of incidents in which Tamil women were allegedly 
raped and killed by the security forces or died in consequence of grievous abuse.  These 
incidents had become a rarity in the last three years. It is therefore all the more imperative that 
this murder be rapidly and effectively investigated and prosecuted in order to nip any possible re-
emergence of this practice in the bud. 
 
It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all 
cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the Commission, 
we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p><p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summaries accurate? 
2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of the police investigations,

killings.

Response of the Government of Sri Lanka dated 30 June 2006 
 
</b>In its letter, the Government refered to the joint communication from the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary and Arbitrary Executions, Mr. Philip Alston (AL G/SO 214 (33-23) and the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, Ms. Yakin Ert&#252;rk

According to the allegations contained in communication No. G/S0214(33-23)G/SO214(89-11) 
LKA2/2006 dated 16 January 2003, Ilaiyathamby Tharshini, a woman aged 20 from 
Punguduthivu, Jaffna peninsula, was last seen alive on 16 December 2005 when she left her 
home at 6.15 p.m. directed towards the camp of the Sri Lankan Navy in Punguduthivu. Her </p>

body was found in a well on the following day. The Judicial Medical Officer had found stab 
wounds on her chest and concluded that Tharshini was raped before being killed.The initial 
investigations into this incident was carried out by the Kayts police and later taken over by the 
Criminal Investigation Division (CID) under the directions of the Inspector General of Police 
 
Initial investigations into the incident were hampered to a great deal due to agitation 
campaigns covertly organized by the LTTE and the interference by various Cher disruptive 
elements bringing frivolous and baseless accusations. The police were prevented from 
guarding the scene until the arrival of the Magistrate due to public agitations which resulted in 
tampering of evidence at the scene as well as destroying valuable evidence. The Magistrate 
was able to visit the scene only on 18.12.2005 (day alter the incident). Even at the time the 
Magistrate visited the scene there was a public agitation covertly organized by the LTTE. 
 
The Magistrate ordered the conduct of a post mortem inquiry and subsequent to this the Police 
were able to remove the body to the Jaffna Teaching Hospital. The post mortem conducted on 
the body of the deceased, revealed that death had been caused due to strangulation subsequent 
to committing vigorous rape. The Judicial Medical Officer, Jaffna, who conducted the autopsy 
on the body of the deceased, had obtained vaginal, anal and mouth swabs of the deceased as 
well as her nail clippings and pubic combings for the purpose of forensic examinations. 
 
Investigations 
 
During the initial investigations, the Kayts police recovered one rubber slipper and 
subsequently the CID recovered the other slipper in a thicket on the way to the house of the 
deceased. 
 
The CID during their investigation found the braces used by the deceased at the scene and it 
was identified by the mother and the relatives of the deceased. The CID recorded statements 
from a number of witnesses but none of them were able to give any information to the actual 
incident of rape or murder. Members of the public who were agitating near the scene of the 
crime had handed over a lady's underwear and a white coloured rope with one end tied to a 
concrete block as being recoveries made by them at the scene of the crime.A camouflage cap 
with No. 410836 similar to those used by the security forces had been handed over to the Kayts 
police by the Magistrate, Jaffna. 
 
Inquiries conducted by the CID with regard to the camouflage cap revealed that the number 
written in that corresponded to the regimental number of Cpl. W W N A K Weerasuriya of the 
8th battalion Gemunu watch of the Sri Lanka Army who is based in Batticoloa. Cpl. 
Weerasuriya who resides in Gampola had given a statement confirming that one of the two 
camouflage caps he had in his possession had got lost in November 2005. Cpl. Weerasuriya 
had admitted that he wrote his regimental number in the camouflage cap. His handwriting has 
been obtained and submitted for examination to the Examiner of Questioned Documents to 
confirm if his handwriting corresponded with that of the writing on the camouflage cap 
allegedly found at the scene of the crime. Inquiries are proceeding to ascertain as to how a 
camouflage cap issued to a soldier in Batticoloa could surface at the scene of crime in the 
Jaffna peninsula.

The security situation in the area has restricted the movements of the investigators in gathering 
of information and intelligence. The lack of cooperation by the public has also hindered the 
ongoing investigations. 
Judicial Proceedings 
 
The facts have been reported to the Magistrate Courts, Kayts under case No. B21312005 and 
the case will be called on 12th July 2006 to report the progress of investigations. A further 
investigation has been conducted by the Sri Lanka Navy due to public agitation and 
accusations leveled at the personnel of the Sri Lanka Navy. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Further inquiries are being conducted to identify and apprehend the culprits, in spite of the 
Jack of public cooperation and in th&#233; midst of campaigns and interferences by various fronts 
acting at the behest of the LTTE. 
 
<b>Response of the Government of Sri Lanka dated 30 June 2006 
</b> 
According to the allegations contained in communication No. G/S0214(33-23)G/S0214(89-11) 
LKA2/2006 dated 16 January 2003, refer to the murder of five Tamil youths named Thangathurai 
Sivanantha, Logithasan Rohanth Shanmugarajah Sajeenthiran, Manoharan Rajeehar and Yogarajah 
Hemachandran. Police investigations into the incident revealed that on 02.01.2006, at about 1945 
hrs. an explosion occurred followed by gunfire at Gandhi Statue Junction bordering Dock Yard 
Road and Koneswaran Temple Road. Five youths succumbed due to this incident of explosion and 
gunfire, whilst two other youths received grievous injuries. 
 
The deceased were: 
 
1. Shanmugarajah Sayendran 
2. Thangadurai Shivananda 
3. Manoharan Arrear 
4. Lihithadasan Rohanthan 
5. Yogarajah Hemachandran 
 
The injured are: 
 
1. Pararajasinghem Kovulraj 
2. Yoganandan Punkallohan 
 
Acting OIC/Harbour Police, Inspector of Police (IP) Sawahir visited the scene on receipt of 
information at about 2010 hrs. followed by Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Trincomalee 
(1). Detailed observations of the scene have been recorded by the Inspector and also by the ASP. 
The seven victims were dispatched to the Trincomalee Hospital by Police and of the seven, on 
admission, five were pronounced dead. The autopsy on the five deceased were conducted by Dr. 
Gamini Gunatunga, MO/General Hospital Trincomalee. According to the opinion of the doctor 
who held the post mortem examination the cause of deaths on all five deceased were due to fire </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 297 
 
arm injuries and there were also multiple blast injuries on their bodies. This confirmed the 
explosion part and the subsequent shooting. 
 
Police summoned Mr. Ramakamalan Magistrate Trincomalee and he too had made detailed 
observations of the scene, followed by subsequent several visits to the scene independently. During 
an extensive search of the scene conducted by the Police initially and thereafter, they recovered 
seven empty casings of 7.62 caliber, one unexploded hand grenade, the leaver of an exploded hand 
grenade, a motor cycle, several push cycles and a helmet. 
 
The Govt. Analyst was informed promptly by the Police to visit the scene of crime. From the time 
of the first visit by the Police until the arrival of the Govt. Analyst for the examination of the scene, 
the entire scene was placed under police guard. Certain productions from the crime scene relevant 
to the scientific examinations were taken charge by the Govt. Analyst. 
 
Two special teams headed by the Criminal Investigation Department and the anti Range Crime 
Division, Trincomalee recorded statements of ten civilians who were living and working in close 
proximity to the scene of incident. However, they were unable to give any descriptions of the 
assailants but only confirmed the hearing of an explosion and minutes later sounds of firing. 
 
In addition to above, the investigators recorded statements of 97 witnesses, including security 
forces and police personnel who were on road block duties along Dock Yard Road, Koneswaran, 
Temple Road, New Town Hall Junction, other deployments in the town area and the STF team 
who were the first to visit the scene subsequent to the explosion and sounds of gun fire. 
 
The statements of Tamil speaking witnesses were recorded by police officers who were conversant 
in Tamil language. 
 
This exercise was done in order to keep the inquiry open and transparent and the opportunity was 
given to all witnesses to divulge what they fully knew in the language they can read and 
understand giving an equal opportunity to tell all what they need to mention in their own language 
freely with no threat, inducement or promise to them. The 13 weapons issued to 12 STF personnel 
and the police officers were taken charge as it transpired that they were the first to visit the scene of 
crime, armed with weapons, soon after the explosion and gunfire. This was done as a process of 
elimination, denoting impartiality and as an exercise of transparency. 
The weapons that were issued to the security forces/police personnel who were on road block duties 
at the far end of Koneswaran Temple Road, Dock Yard Road, UC Junction, were examined for smell 
of gun powder and found negative. 
 
Several attempts were made immediately to record the statements of the two injured but they refused 
to make statements to the police until they made statements to the Magistrate. Their statements were 
recorded by the Magistrate on 8.1.2006 without the presence of the police. It was consequent to this 
that the police were able to obtain their statements in the presence of two ICRC officiais and their 
Tamil translator. 
 
These two statements were recorded by the police in Tamil giving an opportunity for them to narrate 
details of the incident and the events they witnesses, once again displaying transparency and 
impartiality, leading to the conduct of an independent inquiry. </p>

The police investigators requested the Hon. Attorney General the services of a senior official from 
the AG's Department to assist the court during the hearing of the inquest proceedings. Hon. 
Attorney General was represented by Deputy Solicitor General, Mr. Dappula de Livera and Senior 
State Counsel Mr. Damith Totawatta, during the inquest proceedings which commenced on 
16.01.2006 and ended on 18.01.2006. 
 
During the inquest proceedings the Magistrate, solicited evidence of independent witnesses in open 
Courts and if not willing to do so to come forward to give evidence in camera.  
 
On this request made by the Magistrate, five witnesses came forward and their statements were 
recorded by the Magistrate in open court. However, they failed to give any material relevant to the 
identification of assailants and/or provide any eyewitness account corresponding to the explosion 
or the shooting. Their statements also did not give any clues leading to further probing. 
 
Besides these witnesses, the statements of two injured youths, the Medical Officer and the security 
forces and police personnel who were manning the road blocks and the STF and police personnel 
who visited the scene were called by the Magistrate and their statements too were recorded by him 
during the inquest. On conclusion of inquest proceedings the Magistrate returned an open verdict 
and directed the police investigators to conduct further investigation. 
 
Statements of 97 civilians, injured persons and STF and police personnel were recorded by the 
investigating teams during a protracted inquiry. Since some suspicion was cast on the STF 
personnel and the IP from Trincomalee who accompanied them, all thirteen of them were arrested 
and were held in detention at the CID for a period of nearly two months. They were questioned at 
length and their statements verified. The positions taken up by them were that they were on road 
block duty at a point close to the scene in the Trincomalee town and they rushed to the scene 
having heard of the explosion and firing. They were detained until the receipt of the Government 
Analyst's report as the weapons they had at the time were sent to Govt. Analyst through courts. 
The Govt. Analyst reported that their weapons did not tally with the foreign body recovered from 
the deceased persons or with the empty casings of 7.62 found at the scene. There was also no other 
material disclosing their complicity. Hence, the detention orders severed on them were revoked 
and they were released on 12.04.2006.  
 
Further inquiries are being conducted with the aim of identifying those responsible for the said 
incident.

<b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Sri Lanka has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
<b> 
Letter of allegation dated 7 March 2006 
</b> 
In this connection, we would like to bring to your to your Government&#8217;s attention information 
we have received concerning <b>Lelwala Gamage Nandiraja</b>, aged 53, a physician.  According to 
the information received,  
 
</p>
<p>On 29 May 2005, he was arrested during the night at his home by two police officers 
wearing uniforms of the Weliweriya police and four other men in civilian clothing.  They 
entered the house and beat him all over his body before dragging him naked from the 
house to their vehicle.  On 30 May 2005, he was reportedly rushed to Gampaha District 
Government Hospital. He died of his injuries, although it is not clear whether he died 
before or after arriving at the hospital. According to the information received, it would 
appear that this is a case of mistaken identity.  The police had been looking for a 40 year 
old man named Lalewela Nandiraja on suspicion of theft and they mistakenly arrested 
Lelwala Gamage Nandiraja due to the similarities between his name and the name of the 
suspect.   
 
</p>
<p>Without prejudging the facts of the case, we should like to appeal to your Excellency to seek 
clarification regarding the ill-treatment and death of Lelwala Gamage Nandiraja.  In this regard, 
we would like to draw your Excellency's attention to Article 12 of the Convention Against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which requires the 
competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been committed. I would also like to draw your 
attention to Article 7 of the Convention Against Torture, which requires state parties to prosecute 
alleged offenders. With regard to the alleged killing of Lelwala Gamage Nandiraja, the same 
obligations arise under Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
 
We urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee the accountability of any 
person guilty of the alleged violations ensured. We also request that your Government adopts 
effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
 
Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on 
Human Rights and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to 
clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the 
Commission, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following

<b>Sri Lanka: Death Threats against Dr. K. Manoharan and Family

<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Sri Lanka has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal dated 21 March 2006 
</b></p>
<p>  
I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received regarding 
death threats against Dr. <b>K. Manoharan</b> and other family members of Manoharan Rajeehar, one 
of four youths who were allegedly shot by security forces in Trincomalee on 2 January 2006. As 
your Excellency will recall, I sent a communication to your Government on 16 January 2006 in 
which I called for an immediate and impartial investigation into these killings. I understand that 
a ministerial inquiry was set up at the Trincomalee Magistrate court and that it started its 
investigative work on 10 January 2006. 
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, as soon as Dr. K. Manoharan testified, he began to 
receive anonymous calls threatening to kill him and his family for having given evidence.  
Subsequently, unknown people have banged on his door and thrown stones onto the roof of his 
house. Unknown individuals, their faces concealed by motorcycle helmets, have come to his 
clinic and requested his services but have then refused to be examined by his wife who is also a 
medical practitioner. His sons are no longer able to attend school, as members of the security 
forces have intimidated them by calling them the brothers of the &#8220;late kottiya&#8221; (Tiger).  These 
threats have compelled him and his family to sleep away from home at different locations.  
However, since pictures of him and his sons were published in a local newspaper, it appears that 
even moving to another part of the country would not ensure their safety. 
</p>
<p> 
Recent events indicate that these death threats should be treated with the utmost seriousness.  In 
particular, Subramaniyam Sugirdharajan, a journalist from the Tamil-language newspaper Sudar </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 301 
 
Oli who had taken photos of the five students killed and reported on the incident, was killed on 
24 February 2006. 
</p>
<p> 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I would note that they 
implicate important legal standards.  First, human rights law requires States to provide effective 
protection to those whose lives are in danger.  Principle 4 of the Principles on the Effective 
Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (Economic and 
Social Council resolution 1989/65 of 24 May 1989) explains that: 
</p>
<p> 
Effective protection through judicial or other means shall be guaranteed to individuals 
and groups who are in danger of extra-legal, arbitrary or summary executions, including 
those who receive death threats. 
 
</p>
<p>Second, human rights law requires States to effectively investigate extrajudicial executions, and 
threats against witnesses undermine the effectiveness of investigations by deterring the 
cooperation of persons with relevant information.  Principle 15 elaborates on the measures 
required to ensure the integrity of such investigations:  
 
</p>
<p>Complainants, witnesses, those conducting the investigation and their families shall be 
protected from violence, threats of violence or any other form of intimidation. Those 
potentially implicated in extra-legal, arbitrary or summary executions shall be removed 
from any position of control or power, whether direct or indirect, over complainants, 
witnesses and their families, as well as over those conducting investigations. 
</p>
<p> 
These obligations are part and parcel of the requirement of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights that States ensure the right to life (Articles 2, 6(1)). 
</p>
<p> 
I urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all measures necessary to safeguard the lives of Dr. 
K. Manoharam and other family members of Manoharan Rajeehar. 
</p>
<p> 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, it is my responsibility under 
the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights and reinforced by the 
appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all such cases brought to my 
attention.  Since I am expected to report on these cases to the Commission, I would be grateful 
for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1.  Are the facts alleged in the summary of the cases accurate? If not, in order to refute these 
allegations, please provide details of any inquiries carried out. 
 
2.  Please provide information on the measures that have been taken to safeguard the lives of 
Dr. K. Manoharam and other family members of Manoharan Rajeehar. 
 
3.  Please provide information on the measures that have been taken to remove persons

<b>Urgent appeal dated 23 December 2005</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p> 
I would like to bring to the attention of Your Excellency&#8217;s Government the situation of Mr. 
<b>Bakhiet Mohamed Bakhiet</b> and Mr. <b>Abd Almalik Abdalla Mahmoud</b> who have reportedly 
been sentenced to death by the Special Criminal Court for the Events in Darfur sitting in Al-
Fashir.  
</p>
<p> 
According to the information I have received, the two men are lance corporals in the Sudanese 
army. Together with a third member of the military, they were accused of having tortured to 
death a man (named Adam Idris Mohamed Hatim) they had arrested on the suspicion of 
belonging to a rebel group. The three men were charged with murder under Article 130 of the 
1991 Penal Code of the Sudan. The trial before the Special Criminal Court for the Events in 
Darfur sitting in Al-Fashir began in June 2005 (case no. 408/2005). On 17 November 2005, the 
Special Criminal Court found Cpl Bakhiet Mohamed Bakhiet and Cpl Abd Almalik Abdalla 
Mahmoud guilty and sentenced them to death, acquitting the third defendant. According to the 
information I have received, the two corporals had two weeks to file an appeal against the 
judgment. 
</p>
<p> 
My predecessor as Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions stated 
in her report on the visit to the Sudan in June 2004 that &#8220;it is of the utmost importance that 
investigations be carried out to ascertain the details of the events in Darfur, including 
extrajudicial killings, and to bring the alleged perpetrators to justice&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/7/Add.2, &#167; 
60). In this respect, I welcome the trial and conviction of two soldiers of the Sudanese armed 
forces for the murder of a civilian.  
</p>
<p> 
At the same time, however, I would like to express my concern about the imposition of the death 
penalty in this case. As you know, although the death penalty is not prohibited under 
international law, it must be regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, 
and must as such be interpreted in the most restrictive manner. Therefore, it is crucial that all 
restrictions and fair trial standards pertaining to capital punishment contained in international 
human rights law are fully respected in proceedings relating to capital offences. As stated by the 
Human Rights Committee, &#8220;in capital punishment cases, the obligation of States parties to 
observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the [ICCPR] admits of 
no exception&#8221; (Little v. Jamaica, communication no. 283/1988, Views of the Human Rights 
Committee of 19 November 1991, para. 10).

<p> 
As I wrote in the Summary of information received regarding the follow-up to the 
recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in her Report on the visit to the Sudan, which 
I transmitted to Your Excellency&#8217;s Government as an attachment to my letter of 21 September 
2005, reports I have received indicate that international fair trial standards are not guaranteed in 
criminal proceedings before the Special Criminal Court for the Events in Darfur. In particular, 
there appears to be no rule clearly establishing the right not to be coerced to admit guilt (&#167;&#167; 66-
67 of the Summary). There also appears to be some lack of clarity surrounding the right to legal 
representation (&#167;&#167; 68-70 of the Summary). Finally, I am concerned by the reportedly very short 
dead line for appeals (two weeks), which risks compromising the effectiveness of the right to 
appeal. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
I urge your Excellency's Government to ensure that these concerns are given full consideration in 
the appeals proceedings or, should the appeal already have been decided, in any further 
proceedings in which the defendants might seek commutation of their sentence.  
</p>
<p> 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention.  Without in any way wishing to pre-judge the 
accuracy of the information received, I would respectfully request your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to provide me with details regarding the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 
- the composition of the court (number of professional and/or lay judges); 
 
- the duration of the proceedings since Cpl Bakhiet Mohamed Bakhiet and Cpl Abd 
</p>
<p>Almalik Abdalla Mahmoud were charged with the murder, and in particular of the trial hearings; 
 
- whether Cpl Bakhiet Mohamed Bakhiet and Cpl Abd Almalik Abdalla Mahmoud were 
</p>
<p>represented by counsel of their own choosing, how much time such counsel was afforded to 
prepare the defense, and whether there were any limitations on the right of counsel to 
communicate freely with the defendants (both before and during trial), to call witnesses in 
defense and to examine witnesses called by the prosecution; 
</p>
<p> 
- whether the guilty finding against Cpl Bakhiet Mohamed Bakhiet and Cpl Abd Almalik 
</p>
<p>Abdalla Mahmoud was based on an admission of guilt on their side, and if so, whether this 
admission was obtained during the pre-trial phase or in open court; 
</p>
<p> 
- whether the two weeks to file an appeal against the judgment run from the proclamation 
</p>
<p>of the sentence in court or from the delivery of the written judgment to the defendants; 
 
- whether the appeal has been decided, and if so what the outcome is; 
 
- what other procedural avenues are open to Cpl Bakhiet Mohamed Bakhiet and Cpl Abd 
</p>
<p>Almalik Abdalla Mahmoud against the execution of capital punishment; 
 
- whether your Excellency&#8217;s Government has investigated the question of command 
</p>
<p>responsibility of the superiors of the two lance corporals, and whether any prosecution of them is 
envisaged or under way; and, if not so, the reasons for this omission.

<b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Sudan has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation dated 6 March 2006 
</b> 
I would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s attention information I have received regarding attacks 
by the Sudanese armed forces and by Janjaweed militias on <b>civilian populations belonging 
mostly to the Masalit tribe</b> in areas of Chad bordering with the Sudan.  
 
According to the information received, between 5 and 11 December 2005 armed forces of the 
Sudan and Janjaweed militias attacked twenty-two villages in the prefecture of Goungour, eighty 
kilometers south of Adr&#233;. The governmental soldiers and vehicles were assisted by two attack 
helicopters, which fired rockets at civilian targets in the settlements attacked. Fragments of air-
to-ground rockets, shrapnel, stabilizing fins, and other ordnance reportedly gathered by the 
villagers and handed over to investigators corroborate these accounts. It is reported that a total of 
forty-five people were killed in the course of this wave of attacks. Moreover, livestock and food 
were stolen in large quantities. Among those summarily shot were civilians resisting looting. 
 
Between 16 December 2005 and 5 January 2006, Sudanese soldiers, police and Janjaweed militia 
attacked and looted forty villages (out of the eighty-five) in the prefecture of Borota, one 
hundred kilometers south of Adr&#233;. While the members of your Government&#8217;s forces were 
dressed the same way as Janjaweed militiamen, they were recognized by their faces by villagers 
in settlements close to the border with the Sudan. Your Government&#8217;s forces and the Janjaweed 
accompanying them killed twelve civilians in the course of this wave of attacks. The main 
purpose of the attacks, however, appears to have again been the looting of horses, cattle, grain 
and other goods. In this connection, it is reported that Antonov aircraft belonging to your 
Government were repeatedly seen flying over areas ahead of attacks by the ground forces, 
presumably gathering information on the location of cattle herds. 
</p>
<p> 
These two waves of attacks are, according to the reports received, only examples of an ongoing 
pattern of cross-border raids by Janjaweed militias (supported by the armed forces of your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government) into Chad, which have caused the displacement of an estimated 
20,000 persons within Chad, in addition to the refugees from the Darfur.  
</p>
<p> 
I am not aware of any reasons put forth by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to justify these 
alleged attacks on civilian populations in Chad. Insofar as these attacks were linked to your 
Government&#8217;s armed conflict with rebel forces active in the Darfur, I would like to recall the 
applicable principles of international humanitarian law. This body of law requires parties to an 
armed conflict to distinguish at all times between combatants and civilians, and to direct attacks 
only against combatants (Rules 1 and 7 of the Customary Rules of International Humanitarian 
Law identified by the International Committee of the Red Cross); acts or threats of violence the 
primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited (Rule 
2); attacks by bombardment which treat as a single military objective a number of clearly 
separated and distinct military objectives located in a city, town, village or other area containing 
a similar concentration of civilians or civilian objects are prohibited (Rule 13); launching an </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 306 
 
attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage 
to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete 
and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited (Rule 14). 
 
While the reported killings would appear to be in violation of the applicable law if your 
Government&#8217;s incursions (including those by militias whose operations are supported by your 
Government) pursued a military aim in the context of an armed conflict, it would be even harder 
to justify them under human rights law in the absence of an armed conflict.  
 
In this respect, I would also recall that State parties to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
can be held responsible for violations of rights under the Covenant where the violations are 
perpetrated by authorized agents of the State on foreign territory, &#8220;whether with the acquiescence 
of the Government of [the foreign State] or in opposition to it&#8221;. (See <i>Lopez v. Uruguay, 
</i>communication No.52/1979, CCPR/C/OP/1 at 88 (1984), paras. 12.1-12.3.)  
 
I therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to finally comply with its obligation to stop all 
attacks against the civilian populations, to disarm the Janjaweed militias and to stop supporting 
them. These obligations were set forth in the report submitted to the Commission on Human 
Rights by my predecessor after she visited the Sudan at your Government&#8217;s invitation twenty 
months ago (E/CN.4/2005/7/Add.2, para. 59). More importantly, they have been asserted by the 
Security Council in resolutions 1556 (2004), 1590 (2005), and 1591 (2005), and by the 
Commission on Human Rights in resolution 2005/82 on the situation of human rights in the 
Sudan.  
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on this case to 
the Commission or the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters. I undertake to ensure that your Government&#8217;s response is 
accurately reflected in the reports I will submit to the Commission on Human Rights for its 
consideration. 
 
(i) Are the allegations reported above accurate? If not so, please describe the investigations 
</p>
<p>carried out to ascertain that the allegations are ill-founded. 
 
</p>
<p>(ii) Does your Excellency&#8217;s Government consider that the operations of its armed forces and of 
the Janjaweed militias it acts in co-operation with in the Goungour and Borota prefectures 
of Chad are part of an armed conflict against Darfurian rebel forces? 
</p>
<p> 
Please describe any investigations carried out to determine whether the use of force by your 
Governments armed forces and the Janjaweed militias in the Goungour and Borota prefectures of 
Chad was lawful, and if not so, the action undertaken to bring those responsible to justice

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Sudan has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation dated 5 July 2006</b> sent with the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and 
Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of 
living<b> 
</b> 
In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we have 
received concerning an attack by security forces against a peaceful civilian gathering in Marawi 
on 22 April 2006, which reportedly resulted in the death of three civilians and serious injuries to 
numerous others.  
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, on 22 April 2006 villagers gathered in Amri school in 
Marawi to discuss how the building of a dam in the area has affected their livelihood. At 11 a.m., 
however, while the villagers were having breakfast in the school yard, security forces armed with 
machine guns and heavy artillery fired live ammunition into the crowd, killing three men and 
injuring over fifty persons. The persons killed are Mr. <b>Atta Al Sayed Al Khidir Al Mahi</b>, aged 
30, a farmer from Abu Haraze Village, Mr. <b>Yassin Mohamed Al Khair</b>, aged 20, a farmer from 
Al Sor village, and Mr. <b>Salah Al Faky Al Kheder</b>, aged 27, a farmer from Alsweage village. 
Moreover, following the attack, the security officers arrested and detained three of the villagers, 
charging them with waging war against the state, criminal mischief and assault. 
</p>
<p> 
We would like to enquire about the reasons that prompted your Government&#8217;s security forces to 
open lethal fire on a crowd of civilians gathered in a school yard, reportedly having breakfast. In 
this connection, we would like to refer your Excellency's Government to the fundamental 
principles applicable to such an incident under international law. Article 6 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Sudan is a State Party, provides that no one 
shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. As the Human Rights Committee has clarified, 
&#8220;arbitrarily&#8221; means in a manner &#8220;disproportionate to the requirements of law enforcement in the 
circumstances of the case&#8221; (Views of the Committee in the case <i>Su&#225;rez de Guerrero v. Colombia</i>, 
Communication no. 45/1979, &#167; 13.3). In order to assess whether the use of lethal force was 
proportionate to the requirements of law enforcement, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and 
impartial investigation&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This principle was reiterated 
by the Commission on Human Rights at its 61st session in Resolution 2005/34 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to 
conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Commission added that this obligation includes the 
obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation 
within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, 
including legal and judicial measures, in order to &#8230; prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 308 
 
It is reported that the incident is related to the construction of a dam that has resulted in the 
displacement of thousands of people along the riverbanks. Among the reportedly affected people 
are the Amri people, who have allegedly been in negotiations with the government over the past 
two years regarding resettlement sites. It is further reported that the project was carried out with 
no prior consultation with the communities, and that no provisions for compensation have been 
made for the loss of their houses and livelihoods. Your Excellency&#8217;s Government is reportedly 
insisting that the Amri people be relocated in Bayouda desert, an area they are refusing to move 
to.  
</p>
<p> 
In this respect, we would like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to article 11 paragraph 1 of 
the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, by which States parties recognize &quot;the 
right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate 
food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions&quot;, while 
pursuant to article 11 paragraph 2 they recognize that more immediate and urgent steps may be 
needed to ensure &quot;the fundamental right to freedom from hunger and malnutrition&quot;. The human 
right to adequate food is of crucial importance for the enjoyment of all rights. States have a core 
obligation to take the necessary action to mitigate and alleviate hunger as provided for in 
paragraph 2 of article 11.  
</p>
<p> 
Moreover, as your Excellency may be aware, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing has 
repeatedly drawn the attention of the Commission on Human Rights to the worrying practice of 
forced evictions worldwide. Forced evictions constitute prima facie violations of a wide range of 
internationally recognized human rights and large-scale evictions can only be carried out under 
exceptional circumstances and in full accordance with international human rights law. In view of 
this, the Special Rapporteur has recently developed a set of guidelines, presented in his most 
recent report to the Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2006/41) aiming at assisting States 
in developing policies and legislation to prevent forced evictions at the domestic level. 
</p>
<p> 
It is finally our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on Human 
Rights to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on this 
case to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters. We undertake to ensure that your Government&#8217;s response 
is accurately reflected in the reports we will submit to the Commission on Human Rights for its 
consideration. 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. Are the allegations reported above accurate? If not so, please describe the investigations 
carried out to ascertain that the allegations are ill-founded. 
 
2. What prompted the security forces to open fire on the crowd gathered in the school yard? 
 
3. Please describe any investigations carried out to determine whether the use of force by

undertaken to bring those responsible to justice.

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Sudan has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation dated 18 October 2006 
 
</b>I am writing in relation to the incidents which took place in January 2005 in Port Sudan. 
According to the information received, on 26 January 2005, peaceful demonstrators organized by 
members of the Beja ethnic group presented a list of demands to the Red Sea State Governor, 
asking him to respond to their memorandum within 72 hours. On 29 January, a second 
demonstration took place. Government security forces reportedly used live ammunition against 
demonstrators although they were allegedly only armed with sticks and stones. 
 
I have further been informed that the security forces also attacked houses outside the area of the 
demonstration, and reportedly threw grenades inside houses which wounded residents, including 
children. Reports indicate that at least <b>20 people were killed in the clashes</b>. A similar protest 
was reported in Kassala town, leading to arrest and the reported beating of two students by 
security forces. 
 
On 17 February 2005, the Sudanese Minister of Interior, Major-General Abdel Rahim Mohamed 
Hussein, set up a commission of inquiry headed by a judge to investigate the situation. It has 
completed its final report which has reportedly been submitted to the Government. However, to 
date the report has not been made public and no prosecutions are reportedly carried out.  
 
I have received reports indicating some victim&#8217;s families refused to accept diyah and as demand 
a serious investigation and prosecution. Other victims&#8217; families who were reportedly pressured 
by security forces to accept diyah received less important than initially promised.  
 
While I welcome the immediate establishment of a Commission of enquiry set up by the 
Ministry of Interior in February 2005, I would like to enquire about the reason why its findings 
have not yet been published and would be grateful if your Government could provide me with a 
copy of its final report. In this connection, I would like to refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to

<b>Letter of allegation dated 30 November 2006 
</b></p>
<p> 
I would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s attention information I have received regarding attacks 
by heavily armed militias (referred to as &#8220;Janjaweed&#8221;) on civilian populations of the Jebel 
Messeriya tribe in the Jebel Moon area of Western Darfur, near the border with Chad.  
 
According to the Sixth Periodic Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the situation of human rights in the Sudan (dated 3 November 2006), at sunrise on 29 
October 2006 more than 500 hundred armed men on horses and camels attacked the village of 
Khabesh (estimated population: 600). The report (&#167; 5) quotes witnesses of the attack who 
recount how the attackers announced their intention to &#8220;destroy&#8221; the village&#8217;s population and 
then proceeded to shoot and kill civilians in the village, particularly targeting male children. The 
attackers reportedly killed 22 inhabitants of Khabesh village and injured five more. The villagers 
tried to fend off the attackers with guns and killed six of them. 
  
On the same morning, around 6.30 am, a large group of similarly clad and equipped armed men 
attacked Hijilija IDP camp. From a distance, they launched rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) 
and other projectiles at the IDP camp. They then entered the camp and shot the inhabitants with 
Kalashnikov guns and assault rifles, killing twelve. As in Khabesh, the attackers stated their 
intention to destroy the civilian population and opened fire on unarmed women and children. The 
attackers further looted everything of value, loaded it onto camels and then left. 
  
Hashaba village was similarly attacked early in the morning on 29 October 2006 by 
approximately 60 armed men wearing green camouflage uniforms. The attack lasted until about 
9:00 am. Again the assault on the village was preceded by RPG fire from a distance. The 
attackers killed eight inhabitants and looted all the livestock and other valuables.  
 
Further attacks were carried out on villages named Hila Awin, Kiskis, Damara, Agra,Haskanita, 
Taif, all in the same area, resulting in further nine dead. 
 
The OHCHR Report estimates that overall fifty people were killed by the militiamen that 
morning. The report also states that &#8220;[e]yewitness testimony and lists provided by the 
communities indicate that the majority killed were young male children and elderly men. 
According to information gathered, 26 children were killed, and of those 21 were under the age 
of ten. Eight of the men killed were reportedly 70 years old or older.&#8221; Other reports concerning 
the same events provide higher estimates of the number of victims. 
 
The militias had reportedly built up their forces in the area over the period of a month, of which 
the authorities in West Darfur were aware. The Sudanese Armed Forces, who have a base nearby 
in Guzmino, did not take action. There are also troubling indications that Sudanese military 
personnel may have participated in the attacks, based on descriptions of some of the attackers. 
 
In addressing this communication to your Excellency&#8217;s Government, I am aware that members 
of rebel groups not supportive of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) are reported to be currently 
very active in the Jebel Moon area. Insofar as the attacks described above are linked to your 
Government&#8217;s armed conflict with rebel forces active in the Darfur, I would like to recall that 
international humanitarian law requires parties to an armed conflict to distinguish at all times </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 312 
 
between combatants and civilians, and to direct attacks only against combatants (Rules 1 and 7 
of the Customary Rules of International Humanitarian Law identified by the International 
Committee of the Red Cross).  
 
I welcome reports that, in response to the attacks of 29 October 2006 described above, the 
Governor of West Darfur established an Investigative Committee and promised to prevent 
similar events in the future. An inquiry by the local government into the events can have a 
significant impact, both to promote accountability and to prevent such attacks in the future, 
provided the investigative committee offers sufficient guarantees of independence, inspires some 
level of trust in the victims, and makes its findings public.  
 
Such an inquiry cannot, however, be a substitute for criminal investigations and prosecution. As 
noted in my 2006 annual report to the Commission on Human Rights, that &#8220;[t]he State obligation 
to conduct independent and impartial investigations into possible violations does not lapse in 
situations of armed conflict and occupation&#8221; (E/CN.4/2006/53, para. 37). This includes the 
obligation, whenever a State receives allegations that someone has committed or ordered a grave 
breach - such as the &#8220;wilful killing&#8221; of a protected civilian<b> </b>&#8211; to investigate the matter and either 
try the suspected perpetrator before its own courts or extradite him to another State that has made 
out a prima facie case.<b> </b>Should the perpetrator be found guilty, the State must impose an effective 
penal sanction (ibid., para. 34).  
 
Most importantly, I urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to finally comply with its obligation to 
disarm the Janjaweed militias. Your Excellency&#8217;s Government has repeatedly committed itself to 
do so, including in the N&#8217;Djamena Agreement and the Protocol between the Government of the 
Sudan (GOS), the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) and the Justice and Equality 
Movement (JEM) on the Enhancement of the Security Situation in Darfur. Numerous Security 
Council resolutions on the situation in the Sudan have called on your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
to respect this commitment, including resolutions 1556 (2004), 1564 (2004), 1590 (2005), 1591 
(2005) and 1714 (2006). The Commission on Human Rights has called on your Government to 
live up to this obligation in resolution 2005/82. My predecessor as Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions stressed this obligation in the report she submitted 
to the Commission on Human Rights after she visited the Sudan at your Government&#8217;s invitation 
in June 2004 (E/CN.4/2005/7/Add.2, para. 59), and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights 
situation in Sudan reiterated this in her 2006 report (E/CN.4/2006/111, para. 81).  
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and extended by the Human Rights Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. 
Since I am expected to report on this case to the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for 
your cooperation and your observations on the following matters. I undertake to ensure that your 
Government&#8217;s response is accurately reflected in the reports I will submit to the Commission on 
Human Rights for its consideration. 
 
(i) Are the allegations reported above accurate? If not so, please describe the investigations

<b>Syrian Arab Republic: Honour Killing of Huda Abu Assaly 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Impunity for honour killings 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> 1 female 
<b> 
Character of reply:</b> No response 
<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission 
on Human Rights. 
<b> 
Urgent appeal dated 22 August 2006 
</b> 
I am writing in relation to information that I have received about a continuing pattern of honour 
killings in the Syrian Arab Republic in which women are killed by a family member, usually 
because she has married outside her religion or because of suspicions of sexual impropriety.  
Most recently, I have received information regarding <b>Huda Abu Assaly</b>, who was stabbed and 
shot to death by her brother in late August for having married a Christian man. 
 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, there would be ground for 
serious concerns if they were correct. To the extent that honour killings are not met with 
stringent punishments, the State acquiesces in the practice. As a State Party to the <i>International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</i>, the Syrian Arab Republic has assumed the legal 
obligation to ensure the right to life by effectively punishing those who commit murder. Article 
6(1) recognizes that every human being has the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of his or her 
life. Article 2(1) requires the State to ensure to all individuals within its territory the rights 
recognized in ICCPR, without distinction as to sex. Article 2(2) elaborates that each State Party 
must undertake all necessary steps to adopt such laws or other measures as may be necessary to 
give effect to the rights recognized in the ICCPR. These obligations are not mere formalities: 
The punishments imposed may not be so lenient as to invite future violations.  As I noted in my 
report to the Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;Crimes, including murder, can also give rise to 
State responsibility in instances in which the State has failed to take all appropriate measures to 
deter, prevent and punish the perpetrators. . . .&#8221;  (E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 71.) 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 314 
 
In this context, I urge your Government to take all necessary measures to prevent and punish 
honour killings. 
 
While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the facts reports in this incident, it is my 
responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights to seek to 
clarify all cases brought to my attention.  Since I am expected to report on these cases to the 
Commission I would grateful for your responses to the following questions: 
</p><p>  
1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2. Please provide the details and results of any investigation, medical examination (autopsy), 
</p>
<p>and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this incident.   
</p><p> 
3. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions or disciplinary proceedings that have been 
</p>
<p>undertaken in connection with this incident.  Please include information on any penalties 
imposed. 
</p>
<p>  
4. If compensation has been provided to the family of the victim, what was its amount?   
 
I undertake to ensure that your Government&#8217;s response to each of these questions is accurately 
reflected in the report I will submit to the Commission on Human Rights for its consideration. 
 
<b>Thailand: Death Sentences of Wichai Somkhaoyai and Bualoi Posit 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Non-respect of international standards relating to the imposition of capital 
punishment 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> 2 males 
<b> 
Character of reply:</b> No response 
<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Thailand has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
<b> 
Urgent appeal dated 1 February 2006 
</b></p>
<p> 
I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received regarding 
the imposition of the death sentence against Messrs. <b>Wichai Somkhaoyai</b> and <b>Bualoi Posit</b>, the 
two men found guilty of the rape and murder of Katherine Horton, a tourist from the United 
Kingdom, on 1 January 2006. My concern with this case is raised by the extraordinary speed 
with which the two suspects were tried, convicted and sentenced to death. It is my understanding 
that Ms. Horton&#8217;s body was found on 2 January 2006, and Wichai Somkhaoyai and Bualoi Posit 
were arrested on 7 or 8 January 2006. By 9 January 2006 they had reportedly confessed to the 
crime. On 13 January 2006, the two men were tried at Surat Thani. According to the information 
received, the two men confessed to the police, and limited themselves to confirming their </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 315 
 
statements to the police at trial. Reports state that DNA samples were taken and matched with 
DNA traces found on the victim&#8217;s body. On 18 January 2006, the Surat Thani court delivered the 
guilty verdicts and sentenced Wichai Somkhaoyai and Bualoi Posit to death.  
 
Although the death penalty is not prohibited under international law, I would like to remind your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government that it must be regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental 
right to life, and must as such be interpreted in the most restrictive manner. Therefore, it is 
crucial that all restrictions and fair trial standards pertaining to capital punishment contained in 
international human rights law are fully respected in proceedings relating to capital offences. 
This includes the presumption of innocence, right to a trial by an independent and impartial 
tribunal and the right to adequately prepare one&#8217;s defence. &#8220;In capital punishment cases, the 
obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in 
Article 14 of the [ICCPR] admits of no exception&#8221; (<i>Little v. Jamaica</i>, communication no. 
283/1988, Views of the Human Rights Committee of 19 November 1991, para. 10). 
</p>
<p> 
It is in the light of these guarantees with which international law surrounds the imposition of the 
death penalty that I would raise my concerns regarding the extraordinary speed with which 
capital punishment has been imposed in this case. The fact that Wichai Somkhaoyai and Bualoi 
Posit have confessed the crime does not render their right to adequately prepare their defense and 
to receive a full and fair trial redundant. The speed with which the death penalty was imposed is 
all the more alarming in the light of the statements allegedly made by the Prime Minister of your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government before the sentencing, calling on the death sentence to be imposed 
because of the damage the crime caused to Thailand&#8217;s image.  
</p>
<p> 
I understand that the judgment and sentence against Wichai Somkhaoyai and Bualoi Posit will be 
reviewed by an appeals court, and urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure that the 
adequacy of the first instance trial is closely scrutinized in the course of those appeals 
proceedings. 
 
The Commission on Human Rights has consistently requested me and my predecessors as 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to monitor the 
implementation of all standards relating to the imposition of capital punishment. Without in any 
way pre-judging the accuracy of the information I have received, I would respectfully request 
Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to provide me with the following information regarding the 
criminal proceedings against Wichai Somkhaoyai and Bualoi Posit: 
</p>
<p> 
a) did they confess to the rape and murder in the presence of a lawyer acting on their behalf? 
 
b) how much time did the lawyers assigned to act on behalf of Wichai Somkhaoyai and Bualoi 
Posit have to prepare for the trial? 
 
c) details concerning the DNA evidence. 
</p>
<p> 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all such 
cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on this case to the Commission, I 
would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations. In addition to an expeditious first </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

reply, I would greatly appreciate being informed about the further developments in this case. I 
undertake to ensure that your Government&#8217;s response is accurately reflected in the report I will

J&#8217;ai l&#8217;honneur de m&#8217;adresser &#224; vous en ma qualit&#233; de  Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur les ex&#233;cutions 
extrajudiciaires, sommaires ou arbitraires conform&#233;ment &#224; la r&#233;solution de la Commission des 
Droits de l&#8217;Homme  2004/37. 
 
A cet &#233;gard, je souhaiterais attirer votre attention la mort le 11 mars 2006 de M. <b>Tarek Ayari</b>, (un 
commer&#231;ant &#226;g&#233; de 24 ans), suite au coup de manche de pioche qui lui aurait &#233;t&#233; ass&#233;n&#233; &#224; la t&#234;te 
par M. Bechir Rahali (dit Fella), chef du poste de police de la Cit&#233; Ennour, El Ouardia IV, Tunis. 
  
Selon les renseignements dont je dispose, M. Tarek Ayari aurait &#233;t&#233; pris en chasse au volant de sa 
voiture par le chef de poste M. Bechir Rahali dans le cadre d&#8217;une rafle op&#233;r&#233;e par les services de

abandonn&#233; sans secours. 
  
M. Tarek Ayari a &#233;t&#233; conduit par son fr&#232;re &#224; l&#8217;h&#244;pital Habib Thameur o&#249; il a &#233;t&#233; plac&#233; sous

d&#233;c&#232;s de leur fils. 
  
La d&#233;pouille a &#233;t&#233; transf&#233;r&#233;e par la police &#224; l&#8217;h&#244;pital Charles Nicole pour y &#234;tre autopsi&#233;e. Ses

<b> 
Letter of allegation sent on 23 January 2006 
</b> 
I would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s attention information I have received regarding the 
recent incidents that took place in the town of Semdinli, in the province of Hakkari.  
 
According to the information received, on 9 November 2005 the Umut Kitabevi bookshop was 
bombed in Semdinli, killing one man and injuring others. The suspected bomber and his 
accomplices were apprehended in their car as they were trying to escape. Reports indicate that 
weapons, along with several lists of names of political opponents, personal information about a 
number of individuals in Semdinli (including the bookshop owner&#8217;s name as well as his home 
and workplace map) were found in the vehicle.  
 
It has been brought to my attention that that the two men were plainclothes gendarmerie 
intelligence officers as revealed by the identity card they were bearing during the operation. The 
alleged bomber was charged for murder and placed in detention. Press reports subsequently 
disclosed that the man was a PKK informant, information which, to my knowledge, has not been 
officially denied by the authorities.  
 
I have been further informed that, as the prosecutor subsequently carried out a scene-of-crime 
investigation, the assembled crowd was fired upon from a car, resulting in the death of one 
civilian and injury of others. A gendarmerie special sergeant has been detained on charges of 
disproportionate use of force resulting in death. 
 
While I am aware that the Turkish Prime Minister, Justice Minister and Interior Minister have 
expressed strong determination to uncover all dimensions of this incident and to expend every </p>

effort in bringing the perpetrators to justice, I  would  like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to ensure that all deaths that occurred in connection with the Semdinli bookshop 
bombing are promptly, independently and thoroughly investigated in accordance with the 
Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary 
Executions. 
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all cases 
brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on these cases to the Commission, I would 
be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters:

2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
examinations and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the killings occurred around 
the bombing of the Semdinli bookshop.

The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of Turkey

<b>Letter of allegation dated 27 June 2006 
</b> 
I would like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s attention to information I have received regarding 
incidents that have taken place in several provinces of the South East and East regions of Turkey 
since 28 March 2006.  
 
According to the information received, violent riots erupted following the funerals of suspected 
militants of the PKK killed by the army in the Mus-Bingol area on 24 March 2006. Eleven 
civilians -including three children- were allegedly shot dead on 30 March as Turkish security 
forces opened fire and used tear gas and truncheons on protestors. Those killed include <b>Enez 
Atak</b> (8-years-old), <b>Ismail Erkek</b> (8-years-old), <b>Abdullah Duran</b> (9-years-old), <b>Mashsum 
Mizrak</b> (27-years-old), <b>Emrah Fidan</b> (17-years-old), <b>Mehmet Isikci</b> (19-years-old), <b>Halit 
Sogut</b> (18-years-old), <b>Tarik Ataykaya</b> (23-years-old), <b>Mehmet Akbulut</b> (18-years-old), 
<b>Mustafa Erylmaz</b> (22-years-old) and <b>Halil Aktas</b> (20-years-old). The situation in Diyarbakir </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 323 
 
was said to have been volatile and gendarme and police officers reportedly called in 
reinforcements from paramilitary and special commando forces. 
 
The violence also affected other provinces. In Batman, reports indicate that a child, <b>Fatih Tekin</b> 
(3-years-old), was reportedly killed by security forces on 29 March. In Kiziltepe, two civilians, 
<b>Ahmet Arac</b> (27-years-old) and <b>Mehmet Siddik Onder</b> (22-years-old) were reported to be 
killed by security forces in similar outburst of violence on 1 and 2 April 2006. <b> 
</b> 
Without pre-judging the accuracy of the accounts received, I would note the relevance in such 
situations of two international legal instruments designed to elaborate on the content of the 
human rights principles applicable in such situations.  The United Nations Basic Principles on 
the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials note, inter alia, that law 
enforcement officials should &#8220;as far as possible apply non-violent means before resorting to the 
use of force and firearms&#8221; and that &#8220;in any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be 
made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life&#8221;. And the Code of Conduct for Law 
Enforcement Officials, adopted by the General Assembly resolution 34/169 (1979), more 
succinctly stresses the limited role for lethal force in all enforcement operations.  
 
I would like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure that all deaths that occurred in 
connection with the above mentioned operations are promptly, independently and thoroughly 
investigated in accordance with the United Nations Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions. 
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all 
cases brought to my attention. Since I shall be reporting on these cases to the Human Rights 
Council I would by grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following

In connection with the incidents referred to in your letter of 27 June 2006 I am enclosing herewith 
an information note related to those incidents.

Incidents in Diyarbakir: 
 
During a counter-terrorist operation conducted by the security forces in Bing&#246;l on 25 March 
2006, 8 members of the terrorist organization PKK/KADEK originally from the provinces of 
Batman, Siirt, Adiyaman, Adana and Diyarbakir in Turkey lost their their lives during armed 
clashes with the security forces. 
<b> 
</b>Prior to the funerals of the terrorists in these provinces, the terrorist organization 
PKK/KADEK orchestrated a provocation campaign through the internet and its affiliated 
broadcasting organizations such as the ROJ TV. In these broadcasts, the leadership of the 
terrorist organization PKK/KADEK urged its supporters to turn the funerals into a series of 
provocative actions in order to display support for the terrorist organization PKK/KADEK, the 
deceased terrorists and their families. 
<b> 
</b>During the funeral of the terrorists in Diyarbakir on 28 March 2006, the traffic was disrupted 
by a gathering of 1,500 to 2,000 people who burned tires on the road, chanted slogans in 
support of the terrorist organization PKK/KADEK, displayed its symbols, flags, pictures of its 
chief and banners supporting the terrorist organization. The law enforcement officials 
repeatedly warned the crowd through megaphones to refrain from illegal demonstrations and 
actions, from slogans supporting terrorist organization and from displaying flags that 
symbolize terrorist organization. Despite these efforts, the group continued their illegal actions 
disturbing the public order until they reached the Yenik&#246;y Cemetery. The law enforcement 
authorities did not deliberately intervene in this unlawful procession in order to ensure the 
safety of children and elderly people in the group. 
<b> 
</b>However, after the funeral a group of 1,000 people continued to stage illegal protests and 
violently attacked the law enforcement officers who stood guard at the perimeter and their 
vehicles, hurling molotov cocktails, stones and batons. Therefore, the law enforcement 
authorities had to intervene with water cannons and tear gas to push back the crowd. The group 
then scattered into nearby streets and gathered in various parts of the province to again attack 
the security forces, public premises, banks, private property and work places, public and 
private vehicles, hurling molotov cocktails and stones that resulted in a large-scale damage. 
<b> 
</b>These acts of violence continued on 29, 30, 31 March and 1 April 2006 in various parts of 
Diyarbakir. During these incidents, a series of shootings from a Kalashnikov assault rifle and 
gunshots occurred in the streets near Medine Boulevard. 
<b> 
</b>In various parts of the province banks, their ATM machines, premises of provincial branches 
of several political parties and public buildings were violently attacked with stones and<b> </b>molotov 
cocktails and were looted. Vehicles belonging to law enforcement authorities, judges and 
citizens were also attacked and burned down. Furthermore, the private residences of 65 law 
enforcement officials were attempted to be invaded and were marked with specific signs in 
order to be later targeted by the terrorist organization. Within those 65 residences, a private 
residence of a law enforcement official was infact invaded and looted. The demonstrators used 
garbage containers and bricks of sidewalks on the roads as barricades while hurling molotov 
cocktails and disrupting the traffic. The Turkish flags at the official buildings were taken 
down. The demonstrators violently intruded into classes at the Universities, threatened the </p>

students not to attend the classes, bumed the tables and seats in the campuses. The authorities 
called for an immediate end to these incidents of violence and warned that they would have to 
intervene with water cannons and tear gas if they continued. Despite these warnings, the 
demonstrators responded with attacks against the law enforcement authorities, public 
buildings, banks, ATM machines, private work places, private and public vehicles with 
firearms, molotov cocktails, knives, stones and sticks. The public order was restored after the 
intervention of the law enforcement authorities. 
 
The following arms were confiscated from the demonstrators who were apprehended during 
the incidents. They were then transferred to the Criminal Police Laboratory for ballistic 
examination: 
 
1) 4 pistols of various types and calibers of pistols, 
 
2) 3 replica pistols, 
 
3) 6 chargers (for those pistols),  
 
4) 11 loaded cartridges, 
 
5) 26 blank cartridges, 
 
6) 4 unused molotov cocktails 
<b> 
</b>During the incidents in Diyarbakir, one gendarmerie soldier who stood guard at the perimeter 
around the premises of the Justice and Development Party was injured by a shot gun, 2 security 
officials were stabbed, 215 law enforcement officials were seriously wounded as a result of the 
violent attacks with molotov cocktails, stones, batons and sticks by the demonstrators. 
Furthermore, 4 medical personnel from the Emergency Clinic at the State Hospital, who were 
on duty to transfer the injured persons on the streets to the hospital, sustained serious injuries 
and their ambulance was seriously damaged, as a result of the attacks with molotov cocktails 
and stones by the demonstrators. 2 members of the press who were attacked by the 
demonstrators with stones and molotov cocktails were also seriously injured. 
<b> 
</b>75 persons whose work places, shops or vehicles were destroyed during the demonstrations, 
lodged formal complaints with the Police Headquarters for the damages and losses they had 
sustained. After their statements were taken, they were transferred to the judicial authorities 
and the Loss Assessment Commissions of the Office of Governor 
 
It was established that Halit S&#246;g&#252;t, Emrah Fidan, Tank Atakay, Mehmet Isik&#231;i, Abdullah 
Duran, Enes Ata, Mahsum Mizrak, Mehmet Akbulut and Mustafa Eryilmaz lost their lives 
during the incidents. The Office of the Chief Public Prosecutor has initiated investigations in 
connection with their deaths, registered with the Initial Investigation Registry No. 2006/520, 
2006/525, 2006/474, 2006/475, 2006/476, 2006/485, 2006/486, 2006/490 and 2006/504. The

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Turkey has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation dated 27 June 2006 
</b> 
I would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to killings of unarmed 
villagers by village guards in southeast Turkey. According to the reports I have received, the 
village guard system is giving rise to some of the most serious human rights violations, which 
prevents displaced persons from returning to their former homes. 
 
In the past four years village guards have killed at least eleven unarmed villagers, and attacked or 
threatened with death many others. The cases are outlined below. Five of those killed were 
displaced villagers who had recently returned. 
 
<b>Yusuf Abdurrahim</b> and <b>Abdulsamet &#220;nal</b> of Nureddin village, Mu&#351; province, were reportedly 
killed by village guards, on July 9, 2002. The &#220;nal family had been expelled in 1994 when 
security forces destroyed the village, but on July 1, 2002, the family had applied to the local 
governor and gendarmerie for permission to stay temporarily in their village to gather their hay 
crop. According to an eyewitness, village guards came and argued with Yusuf &#220;nal, saying that 
he could not sell the hay. Village guards then beat Yusuf &#220;nal and attacked other members of the 
family. There was a melee, and the eyewitness ran off with members of the &#220;nal family to 
nearby Konakkuran gendarmerie station. Gunshots were heard, and Yusuf, his son and his 
brother were killed. Fourteen village guards were arrested in connection with the killings; four 
years later the trial continues. 
 
Under pressure to join the village guard system, the Tekin family of U&#287;rak village, near Bismil 
in Diyarbak&#305;r province, left their homes in 1994. As soon as they left, neighboring village guards 
moved into the Tekin family&#8217;s houses, and began farming their fields. The Tekin family moved 
back to U&#287;rak on September 26, 2002, but within hours of their return village guards attacked </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 328 
 
the family, killing <b>Nezir Tekin</b>, <b>Ikram Tekin</b>, and five-year-old <b>Agit Tekin</b>, and gravely 
wounding six other members of the family. Ten village guards were charged with the killings 
and are now on trial at Diyarbak&#305;r Criminal Court No. 3. 
 
&#350;<b>emsettin Sar&#305;han</b>, &#350;<b>amil Sar&#305;han</b>, <b>Remzi Sar&#305;han</b>, <b>Mustafa Sar&#305;han</b>, and <b>Ali Sar&#305;han</b> from 
Akpazar village in A&#287;r&#305; province had not been displaced. They seem to have been targeted for 
their longstanding refusal to serve as village guards. According to a survivor, on July 31, 2004, 
the Sar&#305;hans were grazing flocks in the high pasture when two village guards came to their tent 
and invited &#350;amil Sar&#305;han to tea. An argument broke out, and the two village guards machine-
gunned the family. Five village guards are currently on trial at Do&#287;ubeyaz&#305;t Criminal Court for 
the killing of the Sahiran family.  
 On March 19, 2005 <b>Selahattin G&#252;nbay</b>, a thirteen-year-old boy and two of his relatives were 
grazing sheep near the village of D&#252;zce, near Nusaybin in Mardin province, when village guards 
warned them not to graze their animals in that area. When Selahattin G&#252;nbay took no notice, one 
of the village guards shot him dead with an automatic weapon. Four village guards were arrested 
in connection with the killing and are awaiting trial. 
 
I would also like to draw your attention to the following cases of extremely serious violence by 
village guards that have also been brought to my attention. Although non-lethal, these acts must 
be reported and cannot remain unpunished. 
 On October 20, 2004, village guards from a neighboring village next to Ba&#287;g&#246;ze took 
<b>Abdurrahman Ayd&#305;n</b> from his house to a nearby pasture. There, a waiting gendarmerie officer 
accused Ayd&#305;n of sheltering PKK militants. According to Ayd&#305;n&#8217;s account, when he threatened 
to complain to an international human rights organization, the gendarmerie officer started to beat 
him, and ordered the village guard to kill him. Village guards ordered Ayd&#305;n to undress. When 
he refused, they tore his clothes, and attempted to strip him naked. He resisted, and they beat him 
with the butts of their rifles and kicked him, as a result of which he was bedridden for three days. 
Ayd&#305;n later learned that his cousin Resul Ayd&#305;n had been subjected to a similar assault.  
 
On the night of November 29, 2004, five village guards from Ta&#351;l&#305;&#231;ay&#305;r village, near Karl&#305;ova in 
Bing&#246;l province, accompanied by five plainclothes persons (one of whom he recognized as a 
gendarmerie officer), raided <b>Kamer </b>&#350;<b>emci</b>&#8217;s house in Akta&#351; settlement of Kaynarp&#305;nar village. 
&#350;emci reported that one of the village guards immediately accused him of feeding armed 
militants, insulted him, and threatened to break his teeth. The group fired shots into the ground 
between his wife and his son &#214;&#287;ren &#350;emci, and beat his son and another villager, Mehmet A&#231;&#305;&#287;. 
The village guards and plainclothes officers occupied &#350;emci&#8217;s house for two days while carrying 
out an operation in the area. During that time, the guards demanded food and threatened violence 
if Semci&#8217;s family refused. &#350;emci made a formal complaint, but learned in February 2005 that the 
local prosecutor had decided not to prosecute. 
 
On June 12, 2005, village guards from Ta&#351;l&#305;&#231;ay&#305;r were again accompanied by gendarmes when 
they raided Burmata&#351; claiming that Burmata&#351; villagers were sheltering PKK militants. The 
gendarmes and village guards allegedly beat <b>Nebahat Mert, Naima Sayak, Song&#252;l Mert, 
Belk&#305;s Bi&#231;er, Z&#252;beyde Mert, Aziz Mert, Atik Mert, Yakup Mert, &#214;zal Sayak, </b>&#304;<b>smet Sayak,</b> 
and <b>Celalettin Mert.</b> The female villagers were reportedly insulted, and the security forces fired </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 329 
 
shots at random around the village, killing livestock. No PKK militants were found in the 
village, and no villagers were arrested. The villagers submitted a complaint to a local sub-
governor, but according to the villagers this official tore up their complaint. A complaint to the 
local gendarmerie allegedly produced a threat from the gendarmerie to burn the village. 
 
On February 17, 2005, two provisional village guards whom <b>Kaz&#305;m </b>&#350;<b>en </b>knew drove up to his 
house in Kumg&#246;l&#252; village, near Silvan, Diyarbak&#305;r province and told him that their father had 
summoned him. According to his account, the village guards took him to a deserted valley 1.5 
kilometers from the village and beat him severely. &#350;en complained to the gendarmerie, but was 
told that &#8220;if you do not abandon your complaint against these people we will find a way to have 
you found guilty and punished.&#8221; Kaz&#305;m &#350;en dropped his complaint, but later decided to make the 
attack and threats public. 
 
<b>Hasan Keren</b>, forced out of Cevizli village in Mardin province in 1994, reported that since 
returning to his home in 2000, he and his family had been subjected to attacks by village guards 
who were unlawfully using their land. On January 29, 2004, following a dispute about grazing 
animals, Keren was beaten by village guards, resulting in injuries to his eyes, head and back that 
required hospital treatment and fifteen days recuperation. Keren reported the incident to the 
Mardin public prosecutor, who opened an investigation, which is apparently still pending at this 
writing. 
 
On June 1, 2005, villager <b>N.Y.</b> (identity withheld) of D&#252;zpelit hamlet, Ba&#287;c&#305;lar village near 
Kulp, reported that village guards from Kulp had occupied the 5,625 hectare high pasture of 
Serespi (Teli Meskisi), owned by N.Y.&#8217;s family for more than a century. Since 1991 village 
guards have been renting the land out to a third party. When N.Y. attempted to use the land in 
2005, he was threatened by relatives of these guards. In May 2005, while traveling to a wedding, 
N.Y. and his family were attacked by village guards, who shot and wounded a member of the 
party with a pistol. Two village guards were arrested in connection with the shooting; as of this 
writing it is unclear whether they are being prosecuted. 
 
It is my understanding that the system of village guard has been widely condemned by various 
intergovernmental bodies. Its abolition has been recommended by my predecessor, Ms. Asma 
Jahangir, after she visited your country   (see E/CN.4/2002/74/Add1, paragraph 125), as well as 
by the Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons, Mr. Francis Deng, in the aftermath of his country visit (see 
E/CN.4/2003/86/Add 2, paragraph 42). As your Excellency is aware, the European Court of 
Human Rights has also made numerous judgments against Turkey with respect to village guard 
abuses. In May 2005, <i>in Acar and Others v. Turkey</i>, the court found the Turkish government 
responsible for violating the right to life of six villagers from &#199;alp&#305;nar near Midyat in Mardin 
province on April 14, 1992. The Court also held that the authorities failed to carry out an 
adequate and effective investigation into the said deaths and wounding. 
 
Despite this condemnation, the village guard system remains in place. To date, I am aware that 
very few of its members responsible for abuses have been prosecuted and sentenced. I recall 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government that human rights law imposes a duty on States to investigate 
alleged violations of the right to life &#8220;promptly, thoroughly and effectively through independent </p>

It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Turkmenistan has failed to cooperate 
with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on 
Human Rights. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal dated 19 September 2006</b> sent with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 
We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received 
regarding the death in custody of Ms <b>Ogulsapar Muradova</b>, a prominent human rights activist 
associated with the Turkmenistan Helsinki/Foundation (THF) and journalist for Radio Free 
Europe/Radio Liberty, for whom two urgent appeals were already sent to your Government on 
29 June and 24 July 2006.  
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, Ms Muradova was arrested in mid-June on accusations of 
&#8220;subversive activities, along with Mr. Amankurban Amanklychev and Mr. Sapardurdy Khajiev, 
two other human rights defenders both members of the THF.  
</p>
<p> 
Mr. Amanklychev had been arrested on June 16, 2006 by police officers, when he was working 
on a documentary with two French production companies, dealing with the deterioration of the 
health and education systems in Turkmenistan, and the personality cult of the President of the 
Republic. Mr. Khajiev and Mrs. Muradova were arrested on June 18, 2006, at their homes. They 
all remained detained incommunicado in a National Security Service pre-trial detention centre 
for more than two months, during which they were reportedly subjected to ill-treatments. 
Besides, they were never notified about the charges against them, nor their lawyers, and were not 
allowed to meet them. 
</p>
<p>  
On June 19, 2006, the highest authorities&#8217; representatives, such as the President of the Republic 
and the National Security Minister, publicly accused the three defendants of having conspired 
with foreigners in order to destabilize the State. 
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, their trial took place in camera. Indeed, the lawyers were 
denied access to Court, as they were kicked out by soldiers just before the hearing, while trying </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 332 
 
to meet their clients. As a consequence, only the Prosecutor and the defendants were allowed to 
attend the hearing, which lasted just a few minutes. Moreover, the Court building and the streets 
leading to it were cordoned off by armed soldiers, preventing the defendants&#8217; relatives and 
supporters from coming in. 
</p>
<p> 
On August 25, 2006, the Azatlyk District Court of Ashgabat respectively condemned Mrs. 
Muradova and Mr. Amanklychev to a six-year and a seven-year prison terms, while Mr. Khajiev 
was sentenced to a seven-year term in a high-security prison. All three were sentenced for 
&#8220;illegally possessing ammunitions&#8221; (article 287-2 of the Criminal Code), on the basis that police 
officers would have found some arms in Mr. Amanklychev&#8217;s car. The three defendants decided 
to appeal this verdict on August 29 and 30, 2006.  
</p>
<p> 
In the morning of 14 September 2006, members of the security forces came to the house of Ms 
Muradova and took her three children, Sana, Maral and Berdy Muradova, to the morgue where 
they were asked to sign a document identifying and reclaiming Ms. Muradova&#8217;s body.  The 
siblings requested an examination of the body by an independent doctor, which was reportedly 
denied. According to reports, they went to the United States Embassy and returned with an 
American representative who was permitted to accompany them to view their mother&#8217;s body 
which bore signs of ill treatment, with various wounds in the head and the neck. 
</p>
<p> 
Reports indicate that Ms. Muradova&#8217;s children are under surveillance and that their phone line 
has been cut. They reportedly approached the police who refused to acknowledge their 
complaint. Concerns are expressed for the security of Ms Muradova&#8217;s children as there has been 
no further contact with them since their telephone line got cut off.  
</p>
<p> 
Without in any way implying any conclusion as to the facts of the case, we should like to appeal 
to your Excellency to ensure that the death of Ms. Muradova is promptly, independently and 
thoroughly investigated in accordance with the United Nations Principles on the effective 
Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions. We would also 
like to draw your Excellency's attention to Article 12 of the Convention Against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which requires the competent 
authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that torture has been committed.   
</p>
<p> 
We would further like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to article 4 of the Convention 
Against Torture which requires States Parties to ensure that all acts of torture are offences under 
its criminal law and to make the offences punishable by appropriate penalties.  In this regard I 
would also like to draw your attention to article 12 of the Convention Against Torture, which 
requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever 
there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been committed, and article 7 of the 
Convention Against Torture, which requires States Parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of 
torture. We would also like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to paragraph 3 of  Resolution 
2005/39 of the Commission on Human Rights which, &#8220;Stresses in particular that all allegations 
of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment must be promptly and 
impartially examined by the competent national authority, that those who encourage, order, 
tolerate or perpetrate acts of torture must be held responsible and severely punished, including 
the officials in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited act is found to have been </p>

committed, and takes note in this respect of the Principles on the Effective Investigation and 
Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
(the Istanbul Principles) as a useful tool in efforts to combat torture;&#8221;.   
 
We would also like to draw the attention of your Government to paragraph 9 of Resolution 
2005/39 of the Commission on Human Rights, which reminds all States that &#8220;prolonged 
incommunicado detention may facilitate the perpetration of torture and can in itself constitute a 
form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards 
concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person.&#8221; 
 
In this connection, we would like to refer your Excellency's Government to the fundamental 
principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and 
Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state that everyone has the right 
individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and 
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels&#8221; 
and that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote and implement all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting such steps as may be necessary 
to create all conditions necessary in the social, economic, political and other fields, as well as the 
legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction, individually and in 
association with others, are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice&#8221;.  
 
Furthermore, we would like to bring your Excellency&#8217;s attention to the following provisions, and 
in particular:  
</p>
<p> 
- article 6 points b) and c) which provides that everyone has the right, individually and in 
</p>
<p>association with others as provided for in human rights and other applicable international 
instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge 
on all human rights and fundamental freedoms; to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the 
observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, 
through these and other appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matter. 
</p>
<p> 
- article 12 paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration which provide that the State shall take all 
</p>
<p>necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, 
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or 
de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or 
her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the Declaration. In this connection, everyone is 
entitled, individually and in association with others, to be protected effectively under national 
law in reacting against or opposing, through peaceful means, activities and acts, including those 
by omission, attributable to States that result in violations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the 
enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p> 
In addition, we should like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps 
to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression of the above mentioned persons, in 
accordance with fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and reiterated in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 334 
 
Rights which provide that &quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this 
right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers&quot;.  
</p>
<p> 
We urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that accountability of any 
person guilty of the murder of Ms. Muradova is ensured in accordance with Article 7 of the 
Convention Against Torture. We also urge your Government to ensure that any dependents are 
provided with appropriate compensation in accordance with Article 14 of the Convention 
Against Torture. We also request that your Government adopts effective measures to prevent the 
recurrence of killings such as the above described.  
</p>
<p> 
It is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all 
cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the Commission, 
we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters in

<b>Uganda: Death in Custody of Abdu Semugenyi 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Death in custody 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> 1 male 
<b> 
Character of reply:</b> No response 
<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Uganda has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation dated 8 August 2006</b> sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture<b> </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 335 
 
 
We would like to bring to your to your Government&#8217;s attention information we have received 
concerning <b>Abdu Semugenyi</b>, a 55-year-old businessman, who was reportedly tortured to death 
in a government &quot;safe house&quot; maintained by the Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force in Kampala.  
 
According to the information received, security agents arrested Abdu Semugenyi in April 2006, 
along with another man, while they were driving in the village of Ntoroko, near Kasese in 
western Uganda. It would appear that his arrest was motivated by suspected links with the Allied 
Democratic Forces, a rebel group. The two men were then transferred to the Karugutu barracks 
of the Uganda Peoples' Defense Force in western Uganda and from there taken to a so-called 
&#8220;safe house&#8221; maintained by the Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force in Kololo, a neighborhood of 
Kampala. There Abdu Semugenyi was subjected to torture by state security agencies. On 4 May 
2006 he died of electrocution.  
 
The authorities first denied holding Semugenyi. Subsequently, however, they claimed that he 
was killed while trying to escape. The authorities have so far refused to hand over his body to his 
family. 
 
Without in any way implying any conclusion as to the facts of the case, we would like to stress 
that each Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of 
all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. We would in particular like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to paragraph 9 of 
Resolution 2005/39 of the Commission on Human Rights, which reminds all States that 
&#8220;prolonged incommunicado detention may facilitate the perpetration of torture and can in itself 
constitute a form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and urges all States to respect the 
safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person.&#8221; Also, article 12 of the 
Convention Against Torture requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and 
impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been 
committed, and its article 7 requires State parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. 
</p>
<p> 
Furthermore, we would like to recall paragraph 3 of  Resolution 2005/39 of the Commission on 
Human Rights which, &#8220;Stresses in particular that all allegations of torture or other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment must be promptly and impartially examined by 
the competent national authority, that those who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of 
torture must be held responsible and severely punished, including the officials in charge of the 
place of detention where the prohibited act is found to have been committed, and takes note in 
this respect of the Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Principles) as a 
useful tool in efforts to combat torture&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 
We would also like to refer Your Excellency's Government to the fundamental principles 
applicable under international law to deaths in custody or on the occasion of purported attempts 
to escape from custody. Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
provides that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. As the Human Rights 
Committee has clarified, &#8220;arbitrarily&#8221; means in a manner &#8220;disproportionate to the requirements 
of law enforcement in the circumstances of the case&#8221; (Views of the Committee in the case </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 336 
 
<i>Su&#225;rez de Guerrero v. Colombia</i>, Communication no. 45/1979, &#167; 13.3). In order to assess 
whether the use of lethal force was proportionate to the requirements of law enforcement, there 
must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the 
Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This 
principle was reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human Rights in Resolution 2005/34 on 
&#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;the 
obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Commission added that this obligation 
includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate 
compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary 
measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to &#8230; prevent the recurrence of such 
executions&#8221;. 
 
We therefore urge your Government to hand over the body of Abdu Semugenyi to his family and 
to initiate an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his death, with a view to taking all 
appropriate disciplinary and prosecutorial action and ensuring accountability of any person guilty 
of the alleged violations, as well as to compensate the family. We also request that your 
Government adopts effective measures to prevent the recurrence of such acts of torture, i.e. 
primarily to immediately proceed to closing all so-called &#8220;safe houses&#8221; where detainees are held 
incommunicado, releasing the detainees or handing them over to the authorities and the facilities 
competent under the criminal procedure law. We would finally suggest that &#8211; in addition to 
criminal investigations into the circumstances of the death of Abdu Semugenyi &#8211; your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government institute an independent commission of inquiry into the general 
question of safe houses run by security forces, currently and in the recent past. 
</p>
<p> 
Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on 
Human Rights and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to 
clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the 
Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the

<b>United Arab Emirates: Death Sentence of Shahin &#8216;Abdul Rahman 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Non-respect of international standards relating to the imposition of capital 
punishment 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> 1 male (foreign national) 
<b> 
Character of reply:</b> No response 
<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United Arab Emirates has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission 
on Human Rights. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation dated 16 June 2006 
 
</b>I am writing to you in relation to <b>Shahin &#8216;Abdul Rahman</b>, a foreign national, who has been 
sentenced to death by stoning by a Shari&#8217;a (Islamic) court in the Emirate of Fujairah on 10 June 
2006. Shahin &#8216;Abdul Rahman, whose nationality has not been communicated to me, was 
sentenced for committing adultery after he was allegedly found naked in bed with Asma Bikham 
Bijam, a domestic worker. The couple was denounced by Asma Bikham Bijam&#8217;s employer who 
reportedly called the police when he realised that they were in bed in his house. Shahin &#8216;Abdul 
Rahman who is a married man, reportedly admitted to having a sexual relationship outside 
wedlock with Asma Bikham Bijam. Reports indicate that she was sentenced to receive 100 
lashes in addition to a one-year prison term.  
</p>
<p> 
I would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that the death penalty must be regarded as 
an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life and that it must therefore be applied in the 
most restrictive manner. Accordingly, it is crucial that all fair trial and other protections provided 
for in international human rights law are fully respected in proceedings relating to capital 
offences.  
</p>
<p> 
It is my view that the death penalty as applied in this case does not fall within the category of the 
&#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; for which international law countenances its possible application.  It is 
generally understood that this category should not be defined as going beyond intentional crimes 
with lethal or extremely grave consequences (paragraph 1 of the Safeguards guaranteeing 
protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, Economic and Social Council 
resolution 1984/50 of 25 May 1084). In its General Comment No. 6, the United Nations Human 
Rights Committee has stated that &#8220;the expression &#8216;most serious crimes&#8217; must be read restrictively 
to mean that the death penalty should be a quite exceptional measure&#8221;.  Similarly, that 
Committee has observed that the restriction encapsulated in that phrase cannot be interpreted as 
permitting the imposition of the death penalty &#8220;for crimes of an economic nature, for corruption 
and for adultery, or for crimes that do not result in loss of life&#8221; (CCPR/C/28/Add.15, 3 August 
2003, paragraph 8).

It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Without in any way wishing to pre-judge the 
accuracy of the information received, I would be grateful for a reply to the following questions: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2. If Mr Shahin &#8216;Abdul Rahman has in fact been sentenced to death for the offence of 
adultery how does Your Excellency&#8217;s Government consider that to be consistent with the 
applicable international legal standards? 
</p>
<p> 
3. Please provide statistics as to the number of persons sentenced to death and the number 
executed in the past three years for the offence of adultery.

The Special Rapporteur finds it necessary to also respond to the issues raised by the Government 
regarding the scope of the mandate that he has been granted: 
 
(1) With respect to the question raised by the Government regarding whether it was appropriate 
for the Special Rapporteur to &#8220;respectfully urge [it] to put the execution of Jaime Elizalde on 
hold until the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has adopted its report concerning 
his petition&#8221;, the Special Rapporteur would note that calling to the attention of States the 
importance of procedural protections in preventing the violation of human rights norms 
pertaining to capital punishment is clearly within his mandate. 
 
(2) With respect to the question raised by the Government regarding whether it was appropriate 
for the Special Rapportuer to refer to the American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of Man, 
the Special Rapporteur would note that the mandate has been defined in terms of a phenomenon 
&#8212; extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions &#8212; that was of concern to the Commission and 
now to the Council rather than by reference to a particular legal regime. 
 
(3) With respect to the suggestion by the Government that it would &#8220;avoid redundancy and 
increase efficiency&#8221; to apply the principle of not examining matters already subject to 
examination under another international human rights procedure, the Special Rapporteur 
observes that there is an important distinction between judicial and other procedures and that the </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 339 
 
non-duplication rule does not apply to the latter.  Moreover, the Special Rapporteur would note 
that it if difficult to see how his communication was superfluous when the Government did in 
fact elect to disregard the requests of the other procedure and proceed to execute person 
concerned. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal dated 31 January 2006 
</b>  
I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received regarding 
the execution of Mr<b>. Jaime Elizalde</b>, which is reportedly scheduled for today. I understand that 
Mr. Elizalde was sentenced to death by a court in Texas in 1994 for the murder of two men. His 
conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal, and the execution was re-scheduled at least 
once. 
 
Although the death penalty is not prohibited under international law, I would like to remind your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government that it must be regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental 
right to life, and must as such be interpreted in the most restrictive manner. Therefore, it is 
crucial that all restrictions and fair trial standards pertaining to capital punishment contained in 
international human rights law are fully respected in proceedings relating to capital offences. It 
would appear that Mr. Elizalde has petitioned the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
and that his case is currently pending before the Commission. According to the information I 
have received, the Commission has adopted a precautionary measure requesting your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government not to proceed with the execution as long as the case is pending.  
 
I am aware that your Excellency&#8217;s Government has taken the position that the Commission does 
not have the authority to make requests for precautionary measures to non-States Parties to the 
American Convention on Human Rights, such as the United States. Nonetheless, I would remind 
you of the Commission&#8217;s position that &#8220;it is beyond question that the failure of an OAS member 
state to preserve a condemned prisoner's life pending review by the Commission of his or her 
complaint undermines the efficacy of the Commission's process, deprives condemned persons of 
their right to petition in the inter-American human rights system, and results in serious and 
irreparable harm to those individuals.  For these reasons, the Commission has determined that a 
member state disregards its fundamental human rights obligations under the OAS Charter and 
related instruments when it fails to implement precautionary measures issued by the Commission 
in these circumstances.&#8221; (Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Report No. 1/05, 28 
January 2005, <i>Roberto Moreno Ramos v. United States</i>, para. 79). As the Commission has 
pointed in its Resolution No. 1/05 of 8 March 2005, &#8220;[p]recautionary measures are issued in 
compliance with the Commission&#8217;s functions to promote and defend human rights, as set forth in 
Articles 106 of the OAS Charter, 41 of the American Convention on Human Rights, and 18 of 
the Statute of the IACHR.  The juridical basis for the precautionary measures is found in the 
obligation of States to respect and ensure the human rights of all persons subject to their 
jurisdiction, and the general practice of compliance with them on the part of the great majority of 
States is based on the existing understanding of their binding nature.&#8221;  
 
I therefore respectfully urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to put the execution of Jaime 
Elizalde on hold until the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has adopted its report 
concerning his petition.

<b>Response of the Government of the United States of America dated 24 March 2006 
 
</b>This letter responds to your correspondence of January 31, 2006, requesting information 
regarding the case of Jaime Elizalde, Jr. and that the execution of Jaime Elizalde be &quot;put.... on 
hold until the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has adopted its report concerning 
his petition.&quot; Mr. Elizalde was accused of a heinous crime, capital murder, for the deaths of two 
men. A jury of his peers found Mr. Elizalde guilty of capital murder, and a Texas judge 
sentenced him to death. Following exhaustive review of his claims by several federal and state 
trial and appellate courts in the United States, on January 31, 2006, Mr. Elizalde was executed. 
The United States Government provides the following additional information regarding Mr. 
Elizalde<b> 
 
</b>On November 5, 1994, Mr. Elizalde fatally shot victims Juan Guajardo and Marcos Vasquez 
outside a Houston bar. The manager of the bar witnessed Mr. Elizalde first shoot Mr. Guajardo 
in the head and then shoot Mr. Vasquez as lie turned to run away. A second witness saw Mr. 
Elizalde flee with a gun. In March 1997, a Texas jury of his peers found Mr. Elizalde guilty of 
capital murder. The jury then weighed aggravating factors concerning Mr. Elizalde's criminal 
history and his involvement in prison assaults, and concluded that he posed a continuing threat to 
society. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Article 37.071 (in order to impose the death sentence, the jury 
must conclude &quot;there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence 
that would constitute a continuing threat to society&quot;). The trial judge then sentenced him to 
death. 
 
On direct appeal, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Mr. Elizalde's conviction 
and sentence. Elizalde v. State, No. 72,813 (Tex. Crim. App. July 5, 1999). 
 
On April 11, 2001, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied Mr. Elizalde's petition for a 
writ of habeas corpus. Mr. Elizalde filed a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court of 
the Southern District of Texas on February 25, 2002, and later filed an amended petition on 
December 2, 2002. Alter responsive pleadings by the State and Mr. Elizalde, the District 
Court denied relief and the opportunity to appeal. Elizalde v. Cockrell, No. H-02-0745 (S.D. 
Tex. Apr. 16, 2003). Mr. Elizalde then requested permission of the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Fifth Circuit to appeal. The Fifth Circuit denied the appeal on March 8, 2004. Elizalde v. 
Dretke, 362 F.3d 323 (5th Cir. 2004). Mr. Elizalde subsequently petitioned the U.S. Supreme 
Court for a writ of certiorari, which was denied on October 4, 2004. Elizalde v. Dretke, 543 
U.S. 849 (2004). 
 
On January 20, 2006, Mr. Elizalde filed a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus based on 
mental incapacity. The petition was denied by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on 
January 30, 2006. Ex Parte Jaime Elizalde, WR-48957-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 30, 2006). 
Mr. Elizalde's application to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to file a 
successive writ based on mental incapacity was denied on January 31, 2006. In re Jaime 
Elizalde, No. 06-20072 (5th Cir. 2006). 
<b> 
</b>On January 27, 2006, Mr. Elizalde also sought in U.S. District Court a stay of execution 
based on the use of lethal injection under 42 U.S.C. u 1983. The court denied it sua sponte. 
Elizalde v. Livingston, No. 06-297 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 27, 2006) (unpublished). Mr. Elizalde's </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 341 
 
appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals was denied on January 31, 2006. Elizalde v. Livingston, 
No. 0670002, (5th Cir. 2006) (unpublished). His subsequent appeal to the U.S. Supreme 
Court was denied on January 31, 2006. Elizalde v. Livingston, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 1078 (U.S. 
Jan. 31, 2006). Mr. Elizalde was executed on January 31, 2006. 
<b> 
</b>Under Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR): 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>In countries which have not abolished the death penalty, sentence of death may be 
imposed only for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law in force at the 
time of the commission of the crime and not contrary to the provisions of the present 
Covenant and to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of 
Genocide. This penalty can only be carried out pursuant to a final judgment rendered 
by a competent court. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b>ICCPR, Article 6(2). The United States has not chosen to abolish the death penalty. The use of 
the death penalty in the United States is a decision left to democratically elected governments at 
the federal and individual state levels and continues to be the subject of vigorous and open 
discussion among the American public. 
<b> 
</b>Mr. Elizalde was convicted of capital murder for the intentional killing of two men, one of the 
most serious crimes possible under the law in force in the United States or anywhere else in the 
world. See Tex. Penal Code u 19.03 (Capital murder is a higher offense than murder, 
manslaughter, or criminally negligent homicide, and is reserved for certain categories of murder, 
including the murders of two or more individuals). As detailed above, his conviction was upheld 
on appeal, and his many motions for relief were exhaustively reviewed by state and federal 
appellate and trial courts. Mr. Elizalde not only received &quot;a final judgment rendered by a 
competent court&quot; in accordance with Article 6(2) of the ICCPR, but also received the full 
panoply of procedural due process protections available to him under United States law. Thus, in 
view of the gravity of Mr. Elizalde's crime and the procedural review he received with due 
process of law, the United States has complied with relevant international obligations. 
<b> 
</b>As acknowledged in your letter of January 31, 2006, &quot;the death penalty is not prohibited under 
international law.&quot; The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or 
Arbitrary Executions does not encompass capital punishment that is imposed only for the most 
serious crimes and is fully within the bounds of due process and consistent with a State Party's 
obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
<b> 
</b>In addition to the substantive points made above, as the Special Rapporteur is aware, this matter 
is pending before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). The IACHR is 
considering the filing of the United States in this case, including inter alia our position that the 
IACHR does not have jurisdiction to issue a request for precautionary measures to the United 
States, which is not a State Party to the American Convention on Human Rights, and otherwise 
has jurisdiction only to make recommendations to non-States Parties. The United States for this 
and other reasons declines any request for precautionary measures. The Special Rapporteur is 
additionally advised that recommendations of the IACHR are, as the name suggests, 
recommendations only and are not binding on a State. See, e.g., Fourth Summit of the Americas 
Plan of Action paragraph 62 (&quot;To continue supporting and strengthening the functioning of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 342 
 
bodies of the Inter-American System of Human Rights, promoting ...due consideration of the 
recommendations of the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights...&quot;). 
<b> 
</b>We additionally underscore that the mandate of the Special Rapporteur does not extend to issues 
regarding the competence and jurisdiction of the IACHR nor the American Declaration on the 
Rights and Duties of Man. 
 
Further, the United States would like to underscore the principle applied in international human 
rights mechanisms not to examine the same matter that is being examined under another 
international human rights procedure. While we appreciate that this may not be a rule of the 
special procedures, we point this out to the Special Rapporteur in an effort to avoid redundancy 
and increase efficiency in use of the limited resources of the special procedures. See Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 5.2(a); European 
Convention on Human rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Article 35(2)(b). 
 
<b>United States of America: Targeted Killing of Haitham al-Yemeni

<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur appreciates the detailed legal arguments provided by the Government of 
the United States of America.  However, the arguments it provides for not clarifying the facts 
surrounding the death of Haitham al-Yemeni are not persuasive, as discussed in the SR&#8217;s 
communication dated 30 November 2006 (below). 
<b> 
Allegation letter sent on 26 August 2005</b>, reproduced from E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.1, pp. 264&#8211;
265<b> 
</b> 
Letter of allegation sent in relation to information received that Haitham al-Yemeni, an alleged 
al-Qaeda senior figure, was killed on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on or around the 10 May 
2005 by a missile fired by an un-manned aerial drone operated by the US Central Intelligence 
Agency. Mr. al-Yemeni had reportedly been under surveillance for more than a week by US 
intelligence and military personnel. Reports indicate that the Predator drone, operated from a 
secret base hundreds of kilometers from the target, located and fired on him in Toorikhel, 
Pakistan, an area where Pakistani forces had allegedly been looking for al-Qaeda leader, Osama 
Bin Laden. It is my understanding that the CIA is authorized to operate such Predator operations 
under presidential authority signed after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  
 
According to the information received, although Mr. al-Yemeni was not listed by that name 
neither in the FBI&#8217;s, nor in Pakistan&#8217;s, &quot;most wanted&quot; list, the active surveillance of his activities 
would suggest that he was playing an important role inside the al-Qaeda organization. It has been 
suggested that those undertaking the surveillance were hoping that he would lead them to Osama </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 343 
 
bin Laden. However, after Abu Faraj al-Libbi, another suspected al-Qaeda leader, was arrested 
by Pakistani authorities a month before, it is reported that a decision was taken to kill Mr. al- 
Yemeni for fear that he would go into hiding and thus be lost track of. My understanding is that 
the CIA reportedly refused to comment on the situation. Similarly, Sheik Rashid Ahmed, 
Pakistan's Information Minister denied that any such incident had ever happened near the 
Pakistan-Afghanistan border.  
 
In drawing the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to this information and seeking 
clarification thereof, I am fully aware of the stance taken by your Government in correspondence 
with my predecessor with respect to the mandate&#8217;s competence regarding killings that are said to 
have occurred within the context of an armed conflict (I refer to your Government&#8217;s letters dated 
22 April 2003 and 8 April 2004). As I have explained in my Report to the 61st Commission on 
Human Rights, however, both the practice of the General Assembly and of the independent 
experts successively holding the mandate since its creation in 1982 make it clear that questions 
of humanitarian law fall squarely within the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate (See E/CN.4/2005/7, 
at par. 45).  
 
In the light of these considerations, I would reiterate my concern that empowering Governments 
to identify and kill &#8220;known terrorists&#8221; places no verifiable obligation upon them to demonstrate 
in any way that those against whom lethal force is used are indeed terrorists, or to demonstrate 
that every other alternative has been exhausted. (See E/CN.4/2005/7, at par. 41). I would also 
recall that the Human Rights Committee has held that a State party can be held responsible for 
violations of rights under the Covenant where the violations are perpetrated by authorized agents 
of the State on foreign territory, &#8220;whether with the acquiescence of the Government of [the 
foreign State] or in opposition to it&#8221;. (See <i>Lopez v. Uruguay, </i>communication No.52/1979, 
CCPR/C/OP/1 at 88 (1984), paras. 12.1-12.3.)  
 
Finally, I wish to stress that, while Governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens 
against the excesses of non-State actors or other entities, efforts to eradicate terrorism must be 
undertaken within a framework clearly governed by international human rights law as well as by 
international humanitarian law.  
 
Without in any way wishing to pre-judge the accuracy of the information received, I would be 
grateful for a reply to the following questions:  
 
1. What rules of international law does your Excellency&#8217;s Government consider to govern this 
incident? If your Excellency's Government considers the incident to have been governed by 
humanitarian law, please clarify which treaty instruments or customary norms are considered to 
apply.  
 
2. What procedural safeguards, if any, were employed to ensure that this killing complied with 
international law?  
 
3. On what basis was it decided to kill, rather than capture, Haitham al-Yemeni?  
 
4. Did the government of Pakistan consent to the killing of Haitham al-Yemeni?

<b>Response of the Government of the United States of America dated 4 May 2006 
 
</b>This letter responds to your correspondence of August 26, 2005 requesting information 
regarding Haitham al-Yemeni, an alleged A1 Qaida senior figure, who was allegedly killed on 
the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on or around May 10, 2005 by a missile fired by an un-
manned aerial drone. The United States has no comment on the specific allegations regarding 
the May 2005 incident concerning Mr. al-Yemeni. The United States recalls its response of 
April 14, 2003 to a similar request for observations regarding an alleged aerial drone incident 
(E/CN.4/2003/G/80). The United States respectfully submits that inquiries related to 
allegations stemming from military operations conducted during the course of an armed 
conflict with Al Qaida do not fall within the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. The conduct 
of a government in legitimate military operations, whether against Al Qaida operatives or any 
other legitimate military target, would be governed by the law of armed conflict. Nevertheless, 
as a matter of courtesy, we provide the following information: 
<b> 
</b>Immediately following the attacks of September 11, 2001 against the United States, most of 
the world, including the United Nations Security Council and NATO, condemned these attacks 
as a &quot;threat to international peace and security,&quot; recognized the inherent right of individual and 
collective self-defense, and expressed determination to combat by all means threats to 
international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. NATO's North Atlantic Council 
determined on October 2, 2001, that the September 11th attack was directed from abroad by 
the world-wide terrorist network of Al Qaida and &quot;shall therefore be regarded as an action 
covered by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, which states that an armed attack on one or 
more of the Allies of Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.&quot; 
Foreign Ministers of the States Parties to the 1947 Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal 
Assistance (&quot;the Rio Treaty&quot;), likewise resolved on September 21, 2001, that &quot;these attacks 
against the United States are attacks against all American states and that in accordance with all 
the relevant provisions of the ... [Rio Treaty]... and the principle of continental solidarity, all 
States Parties to the Rio Treaty shall provide effective reciprocal assistance to address such 
attacks and the threat of any similar attacks against any American state, and to maintain the 
peace and security of the continent.&quot; 
<b> 
</b>Consistent with this widely held international view, President Bush stated in Military Order 
No. 1 of November 13, 2001 that &quot;international terrorists, including members of Al Qaida, 
have carried out attacks on the United States diplomatic and military personnel and facilities 
abroad and on citizens and property within the United States on a scale that has created a state 
of armed conflict that requires the use of the United States Armed Forces.&quot; 
<b> 
</b>The United States believes that it is in a continuing state of international armed conflict with 
A1 Qaida. Members of A1 Qaida have attacked our embassies, our military vessels and 
military bases, our capital city, and our financial center. They have trained, equipped, and 
supported armed forces and have planned and executed attacks around the world against the 
United States on a scale that has required a military response. A1 Qaida attacks have 
deliberately targeted civilians and protected sites and objects. For example, the A1 Qaida 
network headed by Abu Musad al-Zargawi helped establish a poison and explosive training 
center camp located in northeastern Iraq, in cooperation with the radical organization Ansar al-
Islam. Other attacks attributed to Al Qaida and Al Qaida-linked groups include the attempted </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

bombing on December 22, 2001, of a commercial transatlantic flight from Paris to Miami by 
convicted shoe bomber Richard Reid; on January 23, 2002, the kidnapping of U.S. reporter 
Daniel Pearl from Karachi, Pakistan, who was later killed; on March 17, 2002, a grenade attack 
on a Protestant church in Islamabad killing five people, including two U.S. citizens; on June 
14, 2002, a car bomb attack on the U.S. Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan, killing 12 Pakistanis 
and damaging the consulate; on October 2, 2002, a bomb explosion in the Philippines, 
resulting in the death of a U.S. serviceman; on October 12, 2002, a car bomb outside a 
nightclub in Bali, Indonesia, killing nearly 200 international tourists, including seven U.S. 
citizens, and injuring about 300; on October 28, 2002, the fatal shooting of a USAID employee 
in Amman, Jordan; on February 28, 2003, attacks by a gunman on police posts outside the U.S. 
consulate in Karachi, killing four local police; on May 12, 2003, suicide bombings in Saudi 
Arabia attacking three residential compounds of foreign workers killing 34, including 10 U.S. 
citizens, and injuring 139 others; in 2004, at least 11 attacks, killing more than 60 people, 
including 6 U.S. citizens, and wounding more than 225; and on July 7, 2005, the coordinated 
suicide bombings of London's public transportation system, killing over 50 and injuring about 
700, including U.S. citizens. Moreover, no one needs reminding of the attacks on United States 
persons and property prior to 9/11 linked to Al Qaida, including the embassy 
 
Despite coalition successes in Afghanistan and around the world, the conflict is far from over. 
The Al Qaida network today is a multinational enterprise with operations in numerous 
countries. Some captured A1 Qaida operatives have escaped from detention to plan and to 
mount further terrorist attacks against the United States and coalition partners. The continuing 
military operations undertaken against the United States and its nationals by the Al Qaida 
organization both before and after September 11 necessitate a military response by the armed 
forces of the United States. To conclude otherwise is to permit an armed group to wage war 
unlawfully against a sovereign state while precluding that state from defending itself. 
 
The law of armed conflict (also known as international humanitarian law) is the applicable law 
in armed conflict and governs the use of force against legitimate military targets. Accordingly, 
the law to be applied in the context of an armed conflict to determine whether an individual 
was arbitrarily deprived of his or her life is the law and customs of war. Under that body of 
law, enemy combatants may be attacked unless they have surrendered or are otherwise 
rendered hors de combat. Al Qaida terrorists who continue to plot attacks against the United 
States may be lawful subjects of armed attack in appropriate circumstances. 
<b> 
</b>In addition, the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary 
executions does not include the competence to review alleged violations of the law of armed 
conflict. See Commission on Human Rights resolution 1982/29. The United States disagrees 
with the assertion contained in the Special Rapporteur's August 26, 2005 communication and 
report to the 61st Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2005/7) that issues arising under the 
law of armed conflict are within the Special Rapporteur's mandate. This assertion by the 
Special Rapporteur rests on a series of inapplicable farts, the first of which is that &quot;All major 
relevant resolutions in recent years have referred explicitly to that body of law&quot; 
(E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 45). While recent Commission on Human Rights and UN General 
Assembly resolutions have made mention of international humanitarian law in the context of 
suggestions or admonitions to governments, this does net somehow impart upon the Special 
Rapporteur a mandate to consider issues arising under the law of armed conflict. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 346 
 
<b> 
</b>As support for his assertion, the Special Rapporteur also notes, &quot;Most recently, the General 
Assembly, in resolution 59/197 of 20 December 2004, dealing with the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur, urged Governments 'to take all necessary and possible measures, in conformity 
with international human rights law and international humanitarian law, to prevent loss of 
life...during...armed conflicts.` (E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 45; emphasis added). The emphasis here 
is relevant because the General Assembly was urging Governments to take action, not 
modifying or extending the Special Rapporteur's mandate. This resolution did not, in fact, deal 
with the mandate of the Special Rapporteur other Special Rapporteur to operate within his 
mandate. For example, operative paragraph 13 of the Resolution &quot;[u]rges the Special 
Rapporteur to continue, within his mandate, to bring to the attention of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights ... situations of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions that are of particularly serious concern or in which early action might prevent 
further deterioration.&quot; (59/197; emphasis added.) The Special Rapporteur's final support for his 
assertion that lie has a mandate to consider issues arising under international humanitarian law 
is that &quot;every single annual report of the Special Rapporteur since at least 1992 has dealt with 
violations of the right to life in the context of international and non-international armed 
conflicts&quot; (E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 45). The United States notes that while the Special 
Rapporteur may have reported on cases outside of his mandate, this does not give the Special 
Rapporteur the competence to address such issues. 
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Commission and Special Rapporteur lack competence to address 
issues of this nature arising under the law of armed conflict. The United States remains fully 
committed to the work of the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, and Arbitrary 
Executions. 
<b> 
Allegation letter dated 30 November 2006 
</b> 
This communication is in response to your correspondence of 4 May 2006, which replied to my 
earlier communication of 26 August 2005 requesting information regarding the alleged killing of 
Haitham al-Yemeni on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on or around 10 May 2005 by a missile 
fired by an unmanned aerial drone operated by the US Central Intelligence Agency.  Your 4 May 
2006 correspondence took the position that your government is in a continuing state of 
international armed conflict with Al Qaida, stated that &#8220;Al Qaeda terrorists who continue to plot 
attacks against the United States may be lawful subjects of armed attacks in appropriate 
circumstances&#8221;, and implied that Haitham al-Yemeni was targeted on that basis.  While I greatly 
appreciate your Government&#8217;s willingness to engage in a dialogue on this issue, I regret that your 
correspondence of 4 May 2006 provides a partial response to only the first of the four questions 
posed in my communication, namely, that you consider international humanitarian law 
applicable to the incident in question. 
 
Your letter also stated that the communication concerning Haitham al-Yemeni exceeded my 
mandate as Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions because: (1) 
international humanitarian law is applicable to that armed conflict and operates to the exclusion 
of human rights law; (2) issues governed by international humanitarian law do not fall within the 
terms of reference of the Commission on Human Rights (&#8220;Commission&#8221;), and thus by extension,

to alleged violations of international humanitarian law is not included in the mandate of the 
Special Rapporteur for extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions; and (4) States may 
determine for themselves whether an individual incident is covered by the mandate of the 
Special Rapporteur. 
 
If these positions were to be accepted, they would present a significant challenge not only to the 
work of this mandate but, more importantly, to a significant amount of the activities undertaken 
by the Human Rights Council.  In brief, one of the consequences would be to disable the Council 
in relation to a large number of situations involving armed conflicts in which it has been actively 
involved over the past decade and more.  In view of the potentially dramatic implications of the 
position put forward by your Excellency&#8217;s Government it is essential that they be subject to very 
careful scrutiny.  That is the purpose of the present communication. 
 
International human rights law and international humanitarian law are complementary, not 
mutually exclusive 
 
Your position is that, as a general matter, international humanitarian law operates to the 
exclusion of international human rights law in times of armed conflict.  I respectfully submit that 
the relationship between the two bodies of law in times of armed conflict is significantly more 
complex than this characterization would suggest.  In its <i>Nuclear Weapons </i>Advisory Opinion, 
the International Court of Justice concluded that the test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life 
in the context of hostilities &#8220;falls to be determined by the applicable <i>lex specialis</i>, namely, the 
law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities&#8221;,<b>10</b> a 
position your Government had advocated in its written pleadings to the Court.<b>11</b>  Thus, even 
under the <i>lex specialis </i>principle, and even if my mandate were specifically limited to human 
rights law (which, as I will explain below, it is not), I would be not only permitted but required 
to examine international humanitarian law as a necessary prerequisite to interpreting human 
rights law.

<b>10</b> <i>Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, I.C.J. Reports 1996,</i> p. 240, 
para. 25.  
<b>11</b> The US Government&#8217;s written submission to the International Court of Justice in the <i>Nuclear Weapons </i>Advisory 
Opinion was premised on the <i>lex specialis </i>principle, arguing that a full examination of the principle of &#8216;arbitrary 
deprivation of life&#8217; under human rights law must include examination of international humanitarian law during 
armed conflict..  <i>Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons</i>, Written Statement of the Government of the 
United States of America (June 20, 1995) online at http://www.icj-
cij.org/icjwww/icases/iunan/iunan_ipleadings/iunan_ipleadings_199506_WriStats_18_USA.pdf.  For this reason, 
your Government argued that  <i>Id. </i>at p. 44-45 (&#8220;Rather than attempt to identify all the possible circumstances under 
which the taking of life might be justified, the drafters [of the ICCPR] agreed to a simple prohibition on the 
&#8216;arbitrary&#8217; deprivation of life.  In any event, we know of no significant opposition to the proposition that the 
deprivation of life as a &#8216;lawful act of war&#8217; would not be violative of the protected right to life.  The European 
Convention, which also guarantees the right to life, specifically recognizes the right of States to deprive persons of 
their lives through lawful acts of war&#8221;). </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

The Court has since consistently added another important layer to this analysis, as exemplified in 
its most recent case (<i>Congo </i>v. <i>Uganda</i>): 
 
</p>
<p>[T]he protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed 
conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in 
Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As regards the 
relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus 
three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international 
humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may 
be matters of both these branches of international law.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p> 
The Court stated this principle of complementarity and the <i>lex specialis </i>principle in the same 
paragraph, with the clear implication that the complementarity principle continues to operate 
alongside the <i>lex specialis </i>principle.<b>13</b>  In <i>Congo v. Uganda</i> it reiterated the complementarity 
principle and then found separate violations of international humanitarian law and human rights 
law, thus demonstrating conclusively that international humanitarian law does not wholly replace 
human rights law during an armed conflict.<b>14</b>  This is consistent with the conclusion of the 
Human Rights Committee that &#8220;[w]hile, in respect of certain Covenant rights, more specific rules 
of international humanitarian law may be specially relevant for the purposes of the interpretation 
of Covenant rights, both spheres of law are complementary, not mutually exclusive.&#8221;<b>15</b>  Thus, 
under current international law, human rights law is applied alongside international humanitarian 
law during armed conflict, and the interpretation of human rights law requires examination of 
international humanitarian law.  In contrast, it is noteworthy that in support of its assertion of the 
exclusivity of international humanitarian law the United States&#8217; Government offers no authority 
to support its position.  It also clearly and directly contradicts earlier positions taken by the 
United States. 
 
The Commission on Human Rights, the body specifically charged with oversight of my mandate 
(until its replacement by the Human Rights Council earlier this year),<b>16</b> has also clearly endorsed 
the complementarity of human rights law and international humanitarian law.  In Resolution 
2005/34 on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions, the Commission explicitly 
&#8220;[a]cknowledg[ed]&#8230; that international human rights law and international humanitarian law are

complementary and not mutually exclusive&#8221;.<b>17</b>   Similarly, in Resolution 2002/36, the 
Commission &#8220;[e]xpresse[d] grave concern over the continued occurrence of violations of the 
right to life highlighted in the report of the Special Rapporteur as deserving special attention 
[including] violations of the right to life during armed conflict&#8221;.<b>18</b>  It would be inexplicable for 
the Commission to explicitly endorse this aspect of the report if it considered human rights law 
inapplicable during armed conflict or believed such violations were beyond the mandate. 
 
Finally, the International Law Commission has recently addressed the applicability of human 
rights law during armed conflict in its work on the effect of armed conflict on treaties.  In that 
context, the applicability of human rights law in armed conflict was separately endorsed by 
governments,<b>19</b> the Special Rapporteur on the topic,<b>20</b> and the Legal Office of the United Nations 
Secretariat.<b>21</b>  It should be noted in particular that the applicability of human rights law during 
armed conflict received the direct support and approval of the US Government.<b>22</b>   
 
The Commission on Human Rights could and did consider international humanitarian law within 
its terms of reference 
 
Your assertion that the Commission on Human Rights lacked the competence to address issues 
arising under the law of armed conflict is deeply concerning, both because of a complete lack of 
support for the proposition and because of the radical consequences that would flow from 
removing many of the worst situations in the world today from the purview of the Council.  In 
the decades since the Commission was established as a subsidiary body of the Economic and 
Social Council (&#8220;ECOSOC&#8221;), the Commission has consistently included international 
humanitarian law within its terms of reference, and this approach has been endorsed by 
ECOSOC.  The resolutions discussed below provide illustrative examples:

As these examples make clear, during the life of the Commission, ECOSOC clearly and

in no way undertook to narrow its competence.<b>35</b> 
 
The mandate of the Special Rapporteur for extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions 
includes examination of alleged violations of international humanitarian law 
<b> 
</b>With regard to your position that the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for extrajudicial, 
summary, or arbitrary executions does not include the competence to review alleged violations 
of international humanitarian law, I would note that the mandate as stated in the resolutions 
creating the post of Special Rapporteur for extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions is &#8220;to 
examine &#8230; questions related to summary or arbitrary executions,&#8221; without reference to the 
specific legal framework within which that mandate is to be implemented.<b>36</b>  The mandate thus 
has been defined in terms of a phenomenon &#8212; extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions &#8212; 
that was of concern to the Commission and now to the Council rather than by reference to a 
particular legal regime.  
 
Your correspondence stated that &#8220;while the Special Rapporteur may have reported on cases 
outside of his mandate, this does not give the Special Rapporteur the competence to address such 
issues.&#8221;  This position, however, does not accurately reflect the consultative process within

which the legal framework supporting the mandate has been developed.  While the Special 
Rapporteur alone cannot, and has not, determined the contours of the legal framework within 
which the mandate is to be implemented, neither may any single government do so.  This power 
is held by the Council and was previously held by the Commission, which reviewed and 
accepted the interpretations provided by successive mandate-holders.  The cases below provide 
illustrative examples: 
 
&#8226; In the very first report under the mandate in 1983, Mr. S. Amos Wako observed that 
</p>
<p>summary and arbitrary executions frequently occur during armed conflicts and that, 
therefore, international humanitarian law formed an important element of the mandate&#8217;s legal 
framework.  With that in mind, he included a substantive section on &#8220;Killings in war, armed 
conflict, and states of emergency&#8221; under the heading &#8220;International legal standards&#8221;.<b>37</b>  In 
that section, after discussing application of human rights law in accordance with the relevant 
derogation rules, he notes that &#8220;[t]he Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 are also 
relevant.  &#8230;. Each of the Geneva Conventions clearly prohibits murder and other acts of 
violence against protected persons.  They explicitly provide that &#8216;wilful killings&#8217; are to be 
considered &#8216;grave breaches&#8217; of the Geneva Conventions, that is, war crimes subject to 
universality of jurisdiction.&#8221;<b>38</b>  The report was accepted in its entirety by the Commission.<b>39</b> 
</p>
<p> 
&#8226; In January 1992 the Special Rapporteur, Mr. S. Amos Wako, published a special annex to his 
</p>
<p>annual report entitled <i>List of Instruments and other Standards which Constitute the Legal 
Framework of the Mandate of the Special Rapporteur</i>.<b>40</b>  The Geneva Conventions appear as 
item three of that fourteen point list.  This report was accepted in its entirety by the 
Commission.<b>41</b>  Moreover, the Commission explicitly &#8220;welcome[d] his recommendations 
with a view to eliminating extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions&#8221;.<b>42</b>  These 
recommendations contained recommendations on extrajudicial executions during armed 
conflict.<b>43</b>  If the Commission did not accept that international humanitarian law formed part 
of the legal framework within which the mandate is to be implemented, it is difficult to 
understand why the Commission would explicitly endorse recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur as to extrajudicial executions in armed conflict.

&#8226; In December 1992, Mr. Bacre Waly Ndiaye in his first report as Special Rapporteur included

section stated that &#8220;[t]he Special Rapporteur receives many allegations concerning 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions during armed conflicts.  In considering and 
acting on such cases, the Special Rapporteur takes into account the Geneva Conventions of 
12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977.  Of particular relevance are 
common article 3 of the 1949 Conventions, which protects the right to life of members of the 
civilian population as well as combatants who are injured or have laid down their arms, and

<p>humanitarian law within the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate. The fact is that it falls squarely 
within the mandate.&#8221;<b>49</b>  The Commission accepted this report in its Resolution 2005/34 on 
extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions.<b>50</b>  That resolution also explicitly 
&#8220;[a]cknowledg[ed]&#8230; that international human rights law and international humanitarian law 
are complementary and not mutually exclusive&#8221;.<b>51</b>  This endorsement of the complementarity 
of human rights and international humanitarian law by the Commission &#8211; the body that 
determined my mandate &#8211; is unequivocal.   
</p>
<p> 
I note with respect that the United States did not object to Mr. Wako&#8217;s characterization of the 
legal framework when first published, nor did the United States ever object to the inclusion of 
international humanitarian law instruments in the legal framework supporting the mandate until 
2003, two decades after international humanitarian law was first applied under the mandate.<b>52</b>  
Even my comments in the 2005 report, which were in direct response to the United States&#8217; 
position on this question, received no objection from your Government.  If your Government 
wished to take issue with my position on the mandate which I elaborated in the report, then as a 
member of the Commission your Government could have called for a rewording of this 
resolution so as to challenge my conclusions.  Instead, the United States made a number of 
substantive interventions in the debate on the resolution, but none concerning this language.<b>53</b>  In 
the vote on the resolution, your Government chose to abstain.<b>54</b>   
 
It is abundantly clear that the United States did not, in fact, persuade the Commission to modify 
its long-standing interpretation of the mandate.  It can also be added that, under the principle of 
good faith in international law, a State should not benefit from its own inconsistency.<b>55</b>  After

twenty-three years of silence on the topic while an unbroken line of Special Rapporteurs 
submitted legal frameworks including international humanitarian law to the Commission for 
public debate, it would be difficult to accept that your Government could now avoid responding 
to an individual communication simply by objecting that international humanitarian law falls 
outside the mandate. 
<b> 
</b>States may not unilaterally determine that a specific incident complied with international law and 
is therefore not covered by the mandate 
<b> 
</b>Under the reinterpretation of the mandate suggested by your Government, States are given the 
power unilaterally &#8211; without any external scrutiny &#8211; to determine whether a specific incident is 
covered by the mandate of the Special Rapporteur.  
 
The response your letter gives regarding the killing of Haitham al-Yemeni provides a clear 
example of why this reinterpretation of the mandate would have unacceptable implications: 
 
</p>
<p>The United States respectfully submits that inquiries related to allegations stemming from 
military operations conducted during the course of an armed conflict with Al Qaida do 
not fall within the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. . . . [E]nemy combatants may be 
attacked unless they have surrendered or are otherwise rendered hors de combat.  Al 
Qaida terrorists who continue to ploy attacks against the United States may be lawful 
subjects of armed attack in appropriate circumstances. 
</p>
<p> 
This response suggests that the Special Rapporteur should automatically accept a State&#8217;s 
unsubstantiated assertion that a particular individual was an &#8220;enemy combatant&#8221; attacked in 
&#8220;appropriate circumstances&#8221;.  According to this understanding, a Government may target and kill 
any individual without any detailed explanation to the international community simply by stating 
that he was an enemy combatant. 
 
In essence, your Government&#8217;s position has the effect of placing all actions taken in the &#8220;global 
war on terror&#8221; in a public accountability void, in which no public and transparent international 
monitoring body would exercise oversight.<b>56</b>  It is in the interest of all parties that no such void

Permanent Court of International Justice held that where two States were bound by the same treaty obligations, State 
A could not complain of an act by State B of which it itself had set an example in the past.  <i>Diversion of Water from 
the Meuse (Netherlands v. Belgium), 1937 P.C.I.J. (ser. A/B) No. 70 </i>at p. 4, 25.  Finally, in the <i>North Atlantic Coast

exists in international law.  For this reason, the Special Rapporteur, in his capacity as an 
independent expert, would need to receive a full account of all incidents pertaining to his 
mandate, so that he may conduct an independent analysis of whether each incident falls within 
the scope of that mandate.  That assessment cannot be left in the hands of each individual State.  
As I explained in my 2006 report: 
 
</p>
<p>[T]he Special Rapporteur cannot determine whether a particular incident falls within his 
mandate without first examining its facts. When he receives information alleging a 
violation, he will often need to be informed by the State concerned of the evidentiary 
basis for its determination regarding any status or activity that may have justified the use 
of lethal force.  Conclusory determinations that the deceased was a combatant or was 
taking part in hostilities when killed do not enable the Special Rapporteur to respond 
effectively to information and swiftly pursue the elimination of extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions.<b>57</b> 
</p>
<p> 
A State which receives a communication from the Special Rapporteur requesting information 
may, of course, express its opinion as to whether the given situation falls within the mandate, but 
it also has a duty to provide the requested information so that the Special Rapporteur can himself 
make this determination and communicate it to the Council.  Any failure to do so is directly 
contrary to the repeated requests by the Commission to States to &#8220;cooperate with and assist the 
Special Rapporteur so that her or his mandate may be carried out effectively&#8221;.<b>58</b> 
<b> 
</b>The reinterpretation of the mandate your Government is advocating would be detrimental to the 
effective protection of individuals 
 
The reinterpretation of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions which your Government advocates would drastically limit the effectiveness 
of that mandate in protecting individuals.  As has been noted, throughout the mandate&#8217;s history, 
&#8220;a very high proportion of summary or arbitrary executions occur in situations of armed 
conflict.&#8221;<b>59</b>  These include, to name but a few cases:

The position of your Government appears to be that the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions was abusing his or her mandate in addressing each of these 
situations.  Furthermore, the position of your Government appears to be that the Special 
Rapporteur should cease forthwith to consider any allegations of violations received from 
victims of the conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan, of the conflict in Sri Lanka, and of a great 
many other vitally important situations.  I sincerely hope that I have misinterpreted the position 
adopted in the correspondence of your Government.  If that is not the case I would nevertheless 
hope or that your Government might be prepared to reconsider its position in light of the 
compelling evidence offered above. 
 
Conclusion and Request for Further Information 
 
In light of these considerations, I respectfully request a reply to the four questions posed in my 
correspondence of 26 August 2005 with respect to the alleged killing of Haitham al-Yemeni on 
the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on or around 10 May 2005 by a missile fired by an un-manned 
aerial drone operated by the US Central Intelligence Agency.  To reiterate, these questions are: 
</p><p> 
1. What rules of international law does your Excellency&#8217;s Government consider to govern this 
</p>
<p>incident?  If your Excellency&#8217;s Government considers the incident to have been governed by 
humanitarian law, please clarify which treaty instruments or customary norms are considered 
to apply. 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2. What procedural safeguards, if any, were employed to ensure that this killing complied with 
</p>
<p>international law? 
 
3. On what basis was it decided to kill, rather than capture, Haitham al-Yemeni? 
 
4. Did the government of Pakistan consent to the killing of Haitham al-Yemeni? 
 
I make these observations and requests for information in the hope that they will prove helpful to 
your Government and other governments in ensuring compliance with international law 
prohibiting extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions, and I look forward to further 
constructive dialogue with your Government on this issue in the future.

The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United States of America has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on 
Human Rights. 
<b> 
Letter of allegation dated 7 March 2006</b> sent with Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism<b> 
</b> 
We would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s attention information we have received regarding 
three incidents of air strikes by United States unmanned aircraft against targets in Pakistan, each 
of them resulting in the death of several civilians. We have written to the Government of 
Pakistan in this matter as well. 
 
On 5 November 2005, an unmanned aircraft operated by the US Central Intelligence Agency 
(CIA) fired a missile at a house in North Waziristan, Pakistan (no further details of the location 
reported). The CIA had received information that al-Qaeda operative <b>Hamza Rabia</b>, a citizen of 
Egypt alleged to have been involved in an attempt on the life of President Pervez Musharraf in 
December 2003, was staying there with his wife and children. While an overall <b>eight persons, 
including his wife and children</b>, were reportedly killed in the attack, Hamza Rabia managed to 
escape with an injured leg. 
 
On 1 December 2005, an unmanned drone operated by the CIA fired a missile at a house in the 
village Haisori, near the town of Mir Ali, North Waziristan, about 30 kms from the Afghani 
border, killing five persons. It would appear that the dead are <b>Hamza Rabia</b>, <b>two other foreign 
men, and the 17-year-old son and an eight-year-old nephew of the owner of the house</b>. 
While Pakistani authorities stated that the blast that resulted in the deaths was caused by 
explosives handled or stored in the house, reports indicate that residents of the area saw an 
unmanned aircraft fire a missile at the house and recovered fragments of the missile. 
 
In the early morning hours of 13 January 2006 a remote-piloted Predator aircraft of the United 
States security services launched a strike with &#8220;Hellfire&#8221; missiles on the village of Damadola in 
the Bajaur Agency, North Western Pakistan, close to the border with Afghanistan. Reports 
indicate that US Predator drones were circling the area of Damadola village during the three days 
preceding the missile strike. The attack is reported to have killed 18 persons, including women 
and children. The target of the strike reportedly was <b>Ayman al-Zawahri</b>, who is commonly 
referred to as the &#8220;number two&#8221; of al-Qaeda. He was reportedly expected at a dinner in 
Damadola on the evening of 12 January 2006. However, he appears not to have been in the 
village at the time of the attack. The Pakistani Federal authorities are reported to have stated that 
5 senior al-Qaeda figures were among those killed, including a chemical and explosives expert, 
<b>Midhat Mursi al-Sayed alias Abu Abu Khabab, Abu Obaidah al-Misri</b>, allegedly al-Qaeda 
chief of operations for Afghanistan&#8217;s eastern Kunar province, and Ayman al-Zawahiri&#8217;s son-in-
law<b> Abdur Rehman al-Maghribi</b>. However, the reports we have received indicate that the 
bodies of the five &#8220;Arab fighters&#8221; killed in the strike were pulled out of the rubble and taken 
away from the scene soon after the strike, so that only the bodies of 13 Pakistani victims could 
be identified.  
 
It is our understanding that the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is authorized to operate 
such Predator operations under presidential authority signed after the September 11, 2001 </p>

terrorist attacks. The Government of Pakistan is reported to have lodged a diplomatic protest 
over the incident on 14 January 2006. Pakistan&#8217;s Prime Minister, Mr. Shaukat Aziz, reportedly 
stated publicly that such attacks are not acceptable to Pakistan. 
 
In drawing the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to this information and seeking 
clarification thereof, we are fully aware of the stance taken by your Government in 
correspondence with the predecessor to the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions with respect to the mandate&#8217;s competence regarding killings that are said to 
have occurred within the context of an armed conflict (we refer to your Government&#8217;s letters 
dated 22 April 2003 and 8 April 2004). As explained in the Report of the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to the 61st Commission on Human Rights, as well 
as in a letter to your Excellency&#8217;s Government of 26 August 2005, however, both the practice of 
the General Assembly and of the independent experts successively holding the mandate since its 
creation in 1982 make it clear that questions of humanitarian law fall squarely within the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate (See E/CN.4/2005/7, at par. 45). As to the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while 
countering terrorism, it should be pointed out that reference to &#8220;fundamental freedoms&#8221; in the 
title of the mandate established by paragraph 14 of Commission on Human Rights resolution 
2005/80 is to be understood in the light of operative paragraph 1 of the same resolution which 
explicitly refers to, inter alia, international humanitarian law.  
 
In the light of these considerations, we would express the concern (stated by the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions in his Report to the 61st 
Commission on Human Rights and in his letter of 26 August 2005 concerning the killing of 
Haitham al-Yemeni, which unfortunately has remained without a reply from your Government), 
that empowering Governments to identify and kill &#8220;known terrorists&#8221; places no verifiable 
obligation upon them to demonstrate in any way that those against whom lethal force is used are 
indeed terrorists, or to demonstrate that every other alternative has been exhausted. (See 
E/CN.4/2005/7, at par. 41). Moreover, as these incidents dramatically illustrate, such &#8220;targeted 
killings&#8221; may (and all too often do) result in the death of numerous bystanders, while missing the 
target. 
 
We would also recall that the Human Rights Committee has held that a State party can be held 
responsible for violations of rights under the Covenant where the violations are perpetrated by 
authorized agents of the State on foreign territory, &#8220;whether with the acquiescence of the 
Government of [the foreign State] or in opposition to it&#8221;. (See Lopez v. Uruguay, communication 
No.52/1979, CCPR/C/OP/1 at 88 (1984), paras. 12.1-12.3.) 
 
Finally, we wish to remind you that UN GA Resolution 59/191 of 10 March 2005, in its 
paragraph 1, stresses that &#8220;States must ensure that any measure to combat terrorism complies 
with their obligation under international law, in particular international human right, refugee and 
humanitarian law&#8221;, the latter to the extent it is indeed applicable. 
</p>
<p> 
Without in any way wishing to pre-judge the accuracy of the information received, we would be 
grateful for a reply to the following questions. (These questions repeat the unanswered questions 
in letter of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions of 26 
August 2005):   </p>

1.  Are the reports according to which the target of the missile strike against Damadola was 
Ayman al-Zawahri accurate? On what basis was it decided to kill, rather than capture, Ayman al-
Zawahri (considering also the reported presence of US military aircraft in the area during the 
three days preceding the attack)? On what basis was it decided to kill, rather than capture, 
Hamza Rabia? 
 
2.  Did the Government of Pakistan agree to the killing of Ayman al-Zawahri? Did the 
Government of Pakistan agree to the killing of Hamza Rabia?

I have received various reports indicating that at least 10 persons, namely Mr. <b>Faiz Hratt 
Khalaf</b>, (aged 28), his wife <b>Sumay&#8217;ya Abdul Razzaq Khuther</b> (aged 24), their three children 
<b>Hawra&#8217;a</b> (aged 5) <b>Aisha</b> ( aged 3) and <b>Husam</b> (5 months old),  Faiz&#8217;s mother Ms. <b>Turkiya 
Majeed Ali</b> (aged 74), <b>Faiz&#8217;s sister</b> (name unknown),  Faiz&#8217;s nieces <b>Asma&#8217;a Yousif Ma&#8217;arouf</b> </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

(aged 5 years old), and <b>Usama Yousif Ma&#8217;arouf</b> (aged 3 years), and a visiting relative Ms. 
<b>Iqtisad Hameed Mehdi</b> (aged 23) were killed during the raid. 
 
According to the information received, American troops approached Mr. Faiz&#8217;s home in the early 
hours of 15 March 2006. It would appear that when the MNF approached the house, shots were 
fired from it and a confrontation ensued for some 25 minutes. The MNF troops entered the 
house, handcuffed all residents and executed all of them. After the initial MNF intervention, a 
US air raid ensued that destroyed the house. 
 
Iraqi TV stations broadcast from the scene and showed bodies of the victims (i.e. five children 
and four women) in the morgue of Tikrit. Autopsies carries out at the Tikrit Hospital&#8217;s morgue 
revealed that all corpses were shot in the head and handcuffed.  
 
I am aware that the MNF confirmed that an air raid took place that day in Balad and that it 
caused an unconfirmed number of casualties. The US military attacked the house to capture 
members of Mr. Faiz Harrat Al-Majma&#8217;ee&#8217;s family on the basis that they were allegedly involved 
in the killing of two MNF soldiers who were killed between 6 to 11 March 2006 in the Al 
Haweeja area. The US military was further reported in the media as stating that MNF troops 
attacked the house in question to capture &#8220;a foreign fighter facilitator for the Al Qaeda in Iraq 
network&#8221;. Other reports indicate that over the past five months, there have been a significant 
number of lethal incidents in which the MNF is alleged to have used excessive force to respond 
to perceived threats either at checkpoints or by using air bombing in civilian areas.  
 
In drawing the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to this information and seeking 
clarification thereof, I am fully aware of the stance taken by your Government in correspondence 
with me regarding the mandate&#8217;s competence regarding killings that are said to have occurred 
within the context of an armed conflict (I refer to your Government&#8217;s letters dated 22 April 2003 
and 8 April 2004). As explained in my report to the 61st Commission on Human Rights, as well 
as in letters to your Excellency&#8217;s Government of 26 August 2005 and 7 March 2006, however, 
not only the relevant formulation of the mandate but also the General Assembly in its resolutions 
and the now longstanding practice of the independent experts successively holding the mandate 
since its creation in 1982 make it clear that questions of humanitarian law fall squarely within 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate (See E/CN.4/2005/7, at par. 45).  
 
I would also recall that the Human Rights Committee has held that a State party can be held 
responsible for violations of rights under the Covenant where the violations are perpetrated by 
authorized agents of the State on foreign territory, &#8220;whether with the acquiescence of the 
Government of [the foreign State] or in opposition to it&#8221;. (See Lopez v. Uruguay, communication 
No.52/1979, CCPR/C/OP/1 at 88 (1984), paras. 12.1-12.3.) 
 
Finally, I wish to remind you that UN GA Resolution 59/191 of 10 March 2005, in its paragraph 
1, stresses that &#8220;States must ensure that any measure to combat terrorism complies with their 
obligation under international law, in particular international human right, refugee and 
humanitarian law&#8221;. 
 
Without in any way wishing to pre-judge the accuracy of the information received, I would be 
grateful for a reply to the following questions: </p>

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United States of America has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on 
Human Rights. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation dated 22 August 2006 
</b> 
I am writing about the case of Chief Warrant Officer Lewis E. Welshofer Jr., who, according to 
the information I have received, was found guilty of negligent homicide and negligent 
dereliction of duty by a jury of six-officers on 21 January 2006 in Colorado. The jury acquitted 
Chief Welshofer of murder and assault charges. On 24 January 2006, it imposed a sentence that 
comprised a fine of US$6,000, confinement to his base and place of worship for two months, and 
a letter of reprimand. 
 
The charges against Chief Welshofer related to the death of Major General Abed Hamed 
Mowhoush, an Iraqi general who had turned himself in to military authorities. During an 
interrogation on 23 November 2003 in Qaim, Iraq, Officer Welshofer forced Maj. Gen. 
Mowhoush head first into a sleeping bag and sat on his chest. The general, who was fifty-seven 
years old and weighed two hundred and fifty pounds, died shortly thereafter. 
 
I bring the case to your attention for two reasons. First, I am deeply concerned that the sentence 
imposed on Chief Welshofer may not be proportionate to the gravity of the offence. Chief 
Welshofer has clearly been prosecuted and convicted. Nonetheless, I am concerned that his </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 364 
 
sentence permits United States military personnel to operate with the expectation of a fair degree 
of impunity when employing life-threatening interrogation techniques. The maximum sentence 
that Chief Welshofer faced for the offence of negligent homicide was three years imprisonment. 
The sentence handed down falls so short of the maximum that it would appear to send the 
message that Chief Welshofer&#8217;s crime was not a serious one. 
 
The second issue of concern to me is the military&#8217;s apparent failure to comprehensively 
investigate either (i) systemic breakdowns that may have contributed to Maj. Gen. Mowhoush&#8217;s 
death or (ii) the possibility that Officer Welshofer&#8217;s superior officers may have implicitly or 
expressly sanctioned the interrogation techniques that ultimately proved fatal. 
 
According to the information received, at his trial, Chief Welshofer reportedly testified that he 
was not adequately trained to conduct interrogations in Iraq prior to his deployment and that he 
received little guidance about how to conduct interrogations once there. He testified that months 
before Maj. Gen. Mowhoush&#8217;s death he had received a memorandum from a senior officer, 
which said that senior personnel &#8220;wanted the gloves to come off&#8221; in interrogations and sought 
&#8220;an interrogation techniques wish list&#8221; from interrogators. Chief Welshofer also testified that he 
had received prior approval from Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez before escalating the interrogation 
methods used with Maj. Gen. Mowhoush. The interrogation of this prisoner seems to have been 
considered of great importance because of his high-ranking position under the previous regime 
and also because he was thought to be a central figure in the Iraqi insurgency. In the face of this 
evidence, the failure to investigate the possible responsibility of higher-ranking officials in the 
death of Maj. Gen. Mowhoush may send an additional message of impunity. 
 
As you are aware, human rights law requires States to effectively investigate, prosecute, and 
punish individuals responsible for arbitrary deprivations of life (see the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, Arts. 2 and 6(1)).  Inasmuch as the right to life is non-derogable, 
these obligations do not cease to apply during armed conflict (see ICCPR, Art. 4). The 
requirements of the Geneva Conventions are also relevant, because Maj. Gen. Mowhoush was 
either a prisoner of war or a person detained on suspicion of activities hostile to the security of 
an occupying power. Under the Geneva Conventions, States must &#8220;take measures necessary for 
the suppression of all acts contrary to [their] provisions&#8221; (see Geneva III, Art. 129; Geneva IV, 
Art. 146).  Among other measures, this obligation entails the imposition of &#8220;effective penal 
sanctions&#8221; for grave breaches, including &#8220;willful killing&#8221;, &#8220;torture or inhuman treatment&#8221;, and 
&#8220;willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health&#8221; (see Geneva III, Arts. 129, 
130; Geneva IV, Arts. 146, 147).  As discussed above, there is reason to doubt that the penal 
sanctions imposed on Chief Welshofer will be effective in preventing future violations of these 
international obligations. 
</p>
<p> 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly to seek to clarify all such 
cases brought to my attention.  Since I am expected to report on these cases to the Commission, I 
would be grateful for your cooperation and observations on the following matters:

<b>Uzbekistan: Death Sentence of Ismatillo Abasov 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Non-respect of international standards relating to the imposition of capital 
punishment 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> 1 male 
<b> 
Character of reply:</b> No response 
<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Uzbekistan has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human 
Rights. 
<b> 
Urgent appeal dated 23 January 2006 
</b>  
We would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government the situation of Mr. 
<b>Ismatillo Abasov</b>, who appears to be at risk of imminent execution.  
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, Mr. Ismatillo Abasov was sentenced to death by the 
Tashkent City court on 31 January 2005 for &quot;premeditated, aggravated murder&quot;. Mr. Abasov has 
exhausted all judicial remedies. Reportedly, his conviction and sentence are based on 
confessions extorted under torture or other forms of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p> 
Mr. Abasov has submitted a communication to the Human Rights Committee under the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights (ICCPR). The Committee has 
requested your Excellency&#8217;s Government not to execute Mr. Abasov while his case is under 
consideration by the Committee.  
</p>
<p> 
While we are fully aware of the serious nature of the crime Mr. Abasov has been found guilty of, 
we respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s that &#8220;in capital punishment cases, the obligation of 
States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights admits no exception admits&#8221; (Little v. 
Jamaica, communication no. 283/1988, Views of the Human Rights Committee of 19 November 
1991, para. 10). Relevant to the cases at issue, these guarantees include the right not to be 
compelled to confess guilt.  
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 366 
 
We also recall that Commission on Human rights resolution 2005/39 urges States to ensure that 
any statement, which is established to have been made as a result of torture, shall not be invoked 
in any proceedings. This principle is an essential aspect of the right to physical and mental 
integrity set forth, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from 
Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  
</p>
<p> 
We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the 
rights under international law of Mr. Abasov are respected. Considering the irremediable nature 
of capital punishment, this can only mean suspension of the death sentence against Mr. Abasov 
until the allegation of torture have been thoroughly investigated and all doubts in this respect 
dispelled. Finally, international law requires that the accountability of any person guilty of 
subjecting Mr. Abasov to torture is ensured. 
</p>
<p> 
It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all 
cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the Commission, 
we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 
1. Are the facts alleged in the above summaries of this case accurate? 
 
2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
examinations and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the allegations that Ismatillo 
Abasov was subjected to torture while in pre-trial detention. If no inquiries have taken place or if 
they have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
 
3. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken with 
regard to the alleged torture of Ismatillo Abasov. Have penal, disciplinary or administrative 
sanctions been imposed on the perpetrators?

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

We would first like to assure you that we are conscious of the fact that States&#8217; obligation to 
protect and promote human rights requires them to take effective measures to combat terrorism. 
Further, we would like to underline that States must ensure that any measure taken to combat 
terrorism complies with their obligations under international law, in particular international 
human rights, refugee and humanitarian law. We view our mandates as Special Rapporteurs as a 
device to support and advise States in protecting and promoting human rights and fundamental 
freedoms while countering terrorism.  
</p>
<p> 
We would like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention to the case of Mr.<b> 
Mohammadrafiq Kamoluddin, </b>imam of a mosque in the city of Kara-Suu, Mr. <b>Ayubkhodja 
Shahobidinov</b> and Mr. <b>Fathullo Rahimov</b>. According to the allegations we have received:   
</p>
<p> 
On 6 August 2006, the above-mentioned individuals were killed in the city of Osh, 
Kyrgyzstan as the result of an alleged counter terrorism operation, led by the National 
Security Service of Kyrgyzstan, in cooperation with the security forces of Uzbekistan. It 
has been reported that these individuals were suspected members of the Islamic 
Movement of Uzbekistan and were planning to carry out a terrorist attack on the territory 
of the State of Uzbekistan. Other reports highlight that it was not alleged that Mr. 
Mohammadrafiq Kamoluddin was a member of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan or 
that he was involved in the commission of terrorist acts. 
</p>
<p> 
Without in any way implying any conclusion as to the facts of the case, we should like to appeal 
to your Excellency to seek clarification of these facts and circumstances. We wish to remind you 
that while Governments have a responsibility to protect their own citizens and those of other 
States against the excesses of non-State actors or other entities General Assembly resolution 
59/191, in its paragraph 1, stresses that: &#8220;States must ensure that any measure taken to combat 
terrorism complies with their obligations under international law, in particular international 
human rights, refugee and humanitarian law&#8221;, as does Security Council resolution 1456 (2003) in 
its paragraph 6. In this respect, I wish to stress my concern that empowering Governments to 
identify and kill &#8220;known terrorists&#8221; places no verifiable obligation upon them to demonstrate in 
any way that those against whom lethal force is used are indeed terrorists, or to demonstrate that 
every other alternative has been exhausted. (See the Report of the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to the 61st Commission on Human Rights, 
E/CN.4/2005/7, at par. 41). 
 
We would also like to appeal to your Excellency's Government to ensure the right to freedom of 
religion or belief in accordance with the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief and article 18 of 
the Universal Declaration on Human Rights as well as of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. 
 
Since we are expected to report to the Human Rights Council on all cases brought to our 
attention, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following 
matters: 
</p>
<p>    
</p><p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? In particular, does your 
</p>
<p>Government acknowledge that these killings were the result of a counter-terrorism </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2. On what basis was it decided to kill, rather than capture, these three individuals? What 
</p>
<p>rules of international law does your Excellency&#8217;s Government consider to govern these 
incidents?  
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>3. Does your Excellency&#8217;s Government intend to provide compensation to the families of 
</p>
<p>the three individuals killed in this operation? If so, what steps have been taken in this 
direction? 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>4. Please indicate what the legal basis for qualifying an individual or an entity as &#8220;terrorist&#8221; 
</p>
<p>under the law of Uzbekistan is. Please also indicate what the consequences are of such 
qualification. In this specific instance, what evidence did your Excellency&#8217;s government 
have at its disposal to determine that these individuals were in fact alleged terrorists? 
Were these individuals aware that this determination had been made?  
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>5. Lastly, please indicate what evidence your Excellency&#8217;s government had at its disposal to 
</p>

crimes these were.  
 
</p>
<p>We remain at your disposal with regard to any questions or requests for any assessment that your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government would wish to seek, in the form of written comments, hearings before 
parliamentary or other bodies or through a Special Rapporteur&#8217;s country visit.

Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 17 de julio de 2006, <b>Edison Steveen G&#225;mez Cabrera</b> se 
encontraba en frente del negocio y residencia de la Sra. Egl&#233; D&#237;az, ubicado en el barrio La Cruz, 
cuando un funcionario de la Polic&#237;a de Circulaci&#243;n de Miranda, que vest&#237;a de civil y se 
desplazaba en una moto de placa N&#186; 4-18, lo habr&#237;a amenazado con arrestarlo por haber 
presuntamente robado unos zapatos y una pelota que se encontraban en su casa. <b>Jos&#233; Manuel 
Silva D&#237;az</b>, hijo de la Sra. Egl&#233; D&#237;az, se  habr&#237;a acercado al escuchar las amenazas. En ese 
momento, el funcionario de la polic&#237;a se habr&#237;a dirigido a Jos&#233; Manuel y a <b>Eduardo Antonio 
Moro,</b> otro joven que se encontraba all&#237;, dici&#233;ndoles que a ellos tambi&#233;n los iba a desaparecer y a 
ajusticiar. 
 
Desde entonces, este funcionario de la Polic&#237;a de Circulaci&#243;n de Miranda, que reside tambi&#233;n en 
el barrio La Cruz, habr&#237;a continuado amenazando de muerte a estos j&#243;venes, as&#237; como 
preguntado a los vecinos sobre los lugares que los j&#243;venes frecuentan y lo horarios en los que 
suelen salir. Seg&#250;n nuestras fuentes, este funcionario tambi&#233;n pasar&#237;a frente al negocio y 
residencia de Sra. Egl&#233; D&#237;az, junto a otro funcionario uniformado de la polic&#237;a Metropolitana, y 
se&#241;alar&#237;a la casa con gestos amenazantes. 
 
De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 27 de julio del 2004, la Sra. Egl&#233; D&#237;az denunci&#243; este 
hecho ante la oficina de Atenci&#243;n a la V&#237;ctima del Ministerio P&#250;blico, pero el funcionario 
p&#250;blico a cargo habr&#237;a manifestado que el Ministerio P&#250;blico no ten&#237;a competencia para recibir 
denuncias sobre amenazas a la seguridad personal. Igualmente, se  habr&#237;an realizado denuncias 
ante la divisi&#243;n de asuntos internos de la Polic&#237;a de Circulaci&#243;n de Miranda y de la Polic&#237;a 
Metropolitana, no obstante ninguna investigaci&#243;n habr&#237;a sido iniciada. 
 
Frente a estas alegaciones, expreso mi temor por la seguridad de las personas anteriormente 
mencionadas, e insto al Gobierno de su Excelencia a tomar de inmediato las medidas necesarias 
para garantizar la seguridad e integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de Jos&#233; Manuel Silva D&#237;az, Steeven 
G&#243;mez Cabrera y Eduardo Antonio Moro. A este respecto, llamo la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno 
sobre las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de Derechos Humanos y 
en el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos. Los art&#237;culos 3 y 6 de estos

<b>Viet Nam: Death Sentence of Nguyen Thi Quynh Van 
</b> 
<b>Violation alleged:</b> Non-respect of international standards relating to the imposition of capital 
punishment 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> 1 female 
<b>

<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of Viet Nam 
and welcomes the information that Nguyen Thi Quynh Van will not face the death penalty. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal dated 30 October 2006 
</b> 
I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received regarding 
Ms. <b>Nguyen Thi Quynh Van</b>, who reportedly could face the death penalty if she is found guilty 
of &#8220;losing state resources through economic mismanagement&#8221;, a crime which I understand 
carries the death penalty in Vietnam. 
</p>
<p> 
According to the information received, Ms. Nguyen Thi Quynh Van is a former deputy head of 
trade finance at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of Vietnam, known as Incombank. 
Authorities maintain that she lost US$5.4 million in speculative currency trades made with three 
foreign banks that do business in Vietnam. The State and Incombank also claim that Ms. Van 
was not authorized to undertake foreign-exchange transactions and that her conduct represents 
mismanagement of funds. The Police reportedly charged her with &quot;losing state resources through 
economic mismanagement&quot;, a crime that carries the death penalty in Vietnam. 
</p>
<p> 
I understand that 11 high-ranking officials and business people were sentenced to death for 
economic crimes by Vietnamese courts in the last three years. The last known execution was 
reportedly carried out in March 2006 on Mr. Phung Long That, head of the Customs 
Department's anti-smuggling office, who was found guilty of accepting bribes and smuggling. 
</p>
<p> 
If the information I have received is accurate, there would be grounds for serious concern and 
compelling grounds to challenge Ms Nguyen Thi Quynh Van&#8217;s death sentence as being 
incompatible with the international obligations of Vietnam. In this connection, I would like to 
bring your Excellency&#8217;s attention to article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights that states that &quot;in countries which have not abolished the death penalty, sentence of death 
may be imposed only for the most serious of crimes (&#8230;)&quot;. In this regard the UN Human Rights 
Commission has repeatedly stated that economic crimes do not fall within the &quot;most serious 
crimes&quot;. In its resolution 2005/59 on the question of the death penalty adopted on 20 April 2005 
at its 61st session, the Commission called on states &quot;To ensure that the notion of &#8220;most serious 
crimes&#8221; (&#8230;) is not imposed for non-violent acts such as financial crimes&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 
I have been informed that in February 2006 the Ministry of Public Security proposed a reduction 
in the number of offences punishable by the death penalty. The proposal, which has been </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 373 
 
submitted to the central judicial reform commission for consideration, reportedly recommends 
that economic crimes such as fraud and embezzlement, smuggling, counterfeiting and bribery 
should no longer be capital offences. I would like to express my very strong support for this 
initiative and remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that all efforts to fight against economic 
crimes should be undertaken within the framework of recognized international human rights 
standards.   
</p>
<p> 
In view of the urgency of the matter, I would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of Ms. Nguyen Thi Quynh Van, in 
accordance with its obligations under international law. 
</p>
<p> 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all 
cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on these cases to the Human Rights 
Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following 
matters: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1.  Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2.  Please provide a detailed description of the crimes with which Ms.  Nguyen Thi Quynh Van 
has been charged. 
</p>
<p> 
3.  Please provide a description of the process that will be followed in the trial of Ms. Nguyen 
Thi Quynh Van, so as to enable me to assess whether the proceedings comply with international 
standards relating the imposition of capital punishment. 
<b> 
Response of the Government of Viet Nam dated 8 January 2007 
 
</b>Ms. Nguyen Thi Quynh Van is a former Deputy Head of Trade Finance of the Hai Phong 
Industrial and Commercial Bank (Incombank). Ms. Van was born on 23/03/1970 in Ha Tay 
Province. Her permanent residence is in Nghia Tan Commune, Cau Giay District, Hanoi Capital. 
Her current r&#233;sidence is in An Bien Commune, Le Chan District, Hai Phong City. 
 
On 03/03/2006, the Police Agency for Investigation made an introduction of. instance against a 
criminal case occurred at the Hai Phong Incombank, and also made at the same time an 
introduction of instance against the arrestee, Ms. Nguyen Thi Quynh Van on charge of 
&quot;intentionally breaching State Regulations on economic management, causing serious 
consequences&quot; (Article 165 of the 1999 Penal Code). Later, on 20/4/2006, the Police Agency for 
Investigation .issued another d&#233;cision supplementing the previous one, adding one more crime: 
&quot;making corrupt use of. position and power while executing public services&#8221; (Article 281 of the 
1999 Penal code), and at the same, this additional crime was also charged against Ms. Nguyen 
Thi Quynh Van. 
 
Currently, this case is under investigation process, and Ms. Nguyen Thi Quynh Van is 
provisionally detained in line with provisions of the 1999 Penal Code. The investigation, 
provisional detention are strictly carried out in accordance with rules of procedures stipulated by 
laws. In accordance with the provisions of the 1999 Penal Code of the Socialist Republic of Viet </p>

Yemen: Death Sentences of Ismail Lutef Huraish and Ali Mussara&#8217;a Muhammad Huraish 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Non-respect of international standards relating to the imposition of capital 
punishment 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> 2 males 
<b> 
Character of reply: </b>UN translation awaited for response of the Government of Yemen dated 12 
June 2006 
<b> 
Urgent appeal dated 8 December 2005 
</b> 
I would like to draw the attention of Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to information I have 
received concerning the situation of Mr. <b>Ismail Lutef Huraish</b>, a 47-year-old deaf man and his 
cousin Mr. <b>Ali Mussara&#8217;a Muhammad Huraish</b>, aged 37, who are reportedly at risk of 
imminent execution. They were sentenced to death in 2000 for a murder committed in 1998. The 
Supreme Court of Yemen upheld their death sentences in January 2004. I understand that 
President &#180;Ali &#180;Abdullah Saleh, who has the power to grant them clemency, is currently 
considering their sentences. Concerns have been expressed that the two men were sentenced to 
death following trials that may have fallen short of international fair trial standards.  
 
According to the information I have received, at no time during the judicial process did the 
authorities provide access to sign-language interpretation for Ismail Lutef Huraish, preventing 
him from giving his own account of his alleged involvement in the murder. It appears that he 
was convicted solely on the basis of statements made by Ali Mussara&#8217;a Muhammad Huraish 
during police interrogation and during their trial, which allegedly implicated both men in the 
murder. Detailed information about the circumstances in which Ali Mussara&#8217;a Muhammad 
Huraish&#8217;s confessions were obtained has not been made available to me.  
 
I would like to remind Your Excellency that the death penalty must be regarded as an extreme 
exception to the fundamental right to life and must as such be interpreted in the most restrictive 
manner. Accordingly, it is crucial that all restrictions and fair trial standards pertaining to capital 
punishment contained in international human rights law are fully respected in proceedings 
relating to capital offences.  
</p>
<p> 
The Commission on Human Rights has consistently requested me and my predecessors as 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to monitor the 
implementation of all standards relating to the imposition of capital punishment. 
</p>
<p> 
The alleged failure of the authorities to provide the means for Ismail Lutef Huraish to 
communicate is in violation of norms applicable at both domestic and international level. Indeed </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 375 
 
it violates Article 337 of the Yemeni penal code, which states that deaf defendants must have 
access to sign-language interpretation, and Article 14 (3) of the <i>ICCPR</i>, which states that 
defendants have the right to be informed of the charges against them and to have proceedings 
conducted in a language which they understand. This would appear to include finding the 
appropriate language or method to inform people with a hearing or speech disability of the 
charges and proceedings against them. 
</p>
<p> 
While I am fully aware of the serious nature of the crime these two men have been found guilty 
of, I would respectfully remind Your Excellency that &#8220;in capital punishment cases, the 
obligations of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in 
Article 14 of the <i>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</i> admits of no exception&#8221;. 
(<i>Little v. Jamaica</i>, communication no. 283/1988, Views of Human rights Committee of 19 
November 1991, para. 10). Relevant to the cases at issue, these guarantees include the right to be 
informed promptly and in detail in a language which the accused individual understands of the 
nature and cause of the charge against him, the right not to be compelled to confess guilt and the 
right to adequate time and facilities for the preparation of one&#8217;s defence. 
</p>
<p>   
Without in any way pre-judging the accuracy of the information I have received, I would 
respectfully request Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to provide me with: 
</p>
<p> 
a) the details of the trial proceedings of Ismail Lutef Huraish and Ali Mussara&#8217;a Muhammad<b> 
</b>Huraish, including the specific charges against them, with a view to establishing whether the 
proceedings complied with international standards relating to the imposition of capital 
punishment;  
</p>
<p> 
b) information as to whether they were given the right to formal representation by a lawyer and 
whether Ismail Lutef Huraish was given access to sign-language interpretation; 
</p>
<p> 
c) details of the circumstances in which Ali Mussara&#8217;a Muhammad Huraish&#8217;s confessions were 
obtained. 
</p>
<p> 
In view of the urgency of the matter, I would appreciate a response on these matters before any 
irreversible steps are taken in relation to the fate of Ismail Lutef Huraish and Ali Mussara&#8217;a 
Muhammad<b> </b>Huraish.

&#8220;The reply formulated by the Ministry of Justice indicates that the proceddings taken against the

Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates the response provided by the Government of Yemen.  However, 
the SR regrets that this response does not include any information regarding the review of the trial 
conducted by the Office of the Attorney General and in no way clarifies whether the trial 
proceedings fully complied with international standards relating to the imposition of capital 
punishment. 
<b> 
Urgent appeal sent on 10 October 2005</b>, reproduced from E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.1, pp 306-307 
<b> 
</b>Urgent appeal sent concerning Fuad&#8217; Ali Mohsen al-Shahari, aged about 45, who appeared to be 
at risk of imminent execution if his death sentence, which had already been upheld by the 
Supreme Court in March 2004, was ratified by the President. 
 
Your Excellency will recall that the principal purpose of the above correspondence was to raise 
concerns in view of information received that Fuad&#8217; Ali Mohsen al- Shahari&#8217;s trial failed to meet 
international fair trials standards. As mentioned in the letter, he was for instance allegedly 
convicted on bases of a confession which was said to have been extracted under torture while he 
was held incommunicado for one month. Four versions of his confessions were reportedly 
included in the charge sheets and forensic evidence was contradictory. It was further reported 
that he had not been represented by lawyers throughout the legal proceedings against him, that 
defense witnesses were not allowed to testify and that certain pieces of evidence had been 
disregarded. It was also alleged that a personal dispute between himself and the Prosecutor could 
have compromised the Prosecutor's impartiality. Finally, it was reported that the death sentence 
against him had been confirmed by the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court instead of the 
Criminal Division. 
 
I have recently been informed that, on 6 September 2005, the President has ratified Fuad&#8217; Ali 
Mohsen al-Shahari&#8217;s death sentence, which means that he could be executed at any time. It is 
reported that, in August 2004, the President had actually ordered the Office of the Attorney 
General to review his case. While the details of this review are not known, it is my understanding 
that, afterwards, the Head of the Supreme Court advised the Office of the Attorney General that 
there had been no procedural flaws during Fuad al-Shahari&#8217;s trial.

Although capital punishment is not prohibited under international law, it must be regarded as an 
extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be interpreted in the most 
restrictive manner. Therefore, it is crucial that all restrictions and fair trial standards pertaining to 
capital punishment contained in international human rights law are fully respected in 
proceedings relating to capital offences. 
 
Since I have received no response to my previous communication concerning this situation, I 
would respectfully request the Government of your Excellency to provide me with the details of 
the above-mentioned review of the case of Fuad&#8217; Ali Mohsen al-Shahari&#8217; by the Office of the 
Attorney General with a view to determine if the trial proceedings fully complied with 
international standards relating to the imposition of capital punishment. 
 
In view of the urgency of the matter, I would appreciate a response on these matters before any 
irreversible steps are taken in relation to the fate of Fuad&#8217; Ali Mohsen al- Shahari&#8217;.

Response of the Government of Yemen dated 6 February 2006</b> to an urgent appeal dated 10 
October 2005 (see E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.1, p. 306)<b> 
</b> 
The Government of Yemen responded to an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on 10 
October 2005 regarding the case of Fuad Ali Mohesen al-Shahari. According to the Government, he 
was executed on 29 November 2005 for killing Mohamed Mohamed al-Amiri. According to the 
Government, in 1996, Mr. Al-Shahari was convicted by the Court of First Instance of the 
governorate of Ta&#8217;izz of the revenge killing of Mohamed Mohamed Ahmead al-Amiri. The Ta&#8217;izz 
Appeal Court confirmed the sentence in 1997. The Supreme Court sent the case back to the Appeal 
Court in 2000. The Criminal Divison of the Ta&#8217;izz Appeal Court handed down a death sentence 
against Mr. Al-Shahari in 2002. He appealed the sentence and the case file (No.246) was sent to the 
Supreme Court on 14 december 2002. The Supreme Court upheld the death sentences delivered by 
the Ta&#8217;izz Court of First instance and Appeal Court. The sentence was ratified by the Higher Judicial 
Council and was carried out on 29 November 2005. It is important to note that, in accordance with 
the principles of justice, Yemeni law regards the judiciary as an independent authority, in the 
proceedings and decisions of which there can be no interference.

<b>Urgent appeal dated 20 December 2005 sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture</b> 
 
We would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s attention the situation of Ms. <b>Fatima Hussein al-
Badi </b>who could face imminent execution if the President of Yemen rejects a final appeal asking 
for her death sentence to be commuted on the basis that her trial was unfair.  
 
According to the information received, Fatima Hussein al-Badi and her brother Abdullah 
Hussein al-Badi were arrested on 13 July 2000 for the murder of her husband, Hamoud Ali al-
Jalal. They were sentenced to death on 17 February 2001 following a trial that may have fallen 
short of international fair trial standards. Fatima Hussein al-Badi's has maintained her innocence 
in the murder of her husband since her arrest: she was reportedly tortured by police in detention, 
but refused to &quot;confess&quot;. We have further been informed that her brother denied that he and his 
sister were involved in the murder, but later &quot;confessed&quot; to police after he was assured that his 
&quot;confession&quot; would lead to Fatima's release. During the trial, they reportedly had no legal 
representation, and were forced to be quiet whenever they tried to speak in court. Both Fatima 
and her brother took their case to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the sentence against them 
on 12 August 2002. They then appealed to the Supreme Court, which upheld the decision.  
 
President 'Ali 'Abdullah Saleh then ratified the two death sentences. On 2 May 2005, Abdullah 
Hussein al-Badi was executed for his alleged role in the murder. In October, Fatima Hussein al-
Badi lodged a special personal appeal with the President, asking him to commute her sentence on 
the basis that her trial was unfair. The President is believed to be considering the appeal. If he 
rejects it, Fatima Hussein al-Badi could be executed within a few weeks 
 
Although the death penalty is not prohibited under international law, we would like to remind 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government that &#8220;in capital punishment cases, the obligations of States parties 
to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the (ICCPR) admits 
no exception&#8221; (Little v. Jamaica, communication no. 283/1998, Views of the Human Rights 
Committee of 19 November 1991, para.10). Relevant to the cases at issue, these guarantees 
include the right not to be compelled to confess guilt and the right to prepare one&#8217;s defence. 
 
We also recall that Commission on Human rights resolution 2005/39 urges States to ensure that 
any statement, which is established to have been made as a result of torture, shall not be invoked 
in any proceedings. This principle is an essential aspect of the right to physical and mental 
integrity set forth, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from 
being subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment.   
 
In view of the urgency of the matter, we urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to suspend the 
capital punishment against Fatima Hussein al-Badi until the allegations of torture have been 
thoroughly investigated and all doubts in this respect dispelled. Besides, I also remind your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government that international law requires that the accountability of any person 
guilty of subjecting Fatima Hussein al-Badi to torture is ensured.

Response of the Government of Yemen dated 1 June 2006 
 
</b>The Ministry of Human Rights responded to a communication sent by the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions about Yemeni national Fatima Hussein al-Badi, on 20 December 2005. According to 
the Government, 
 
The above-mentioned woman and her brother Abdullah Hussein al-Badi murdered her innocent 
husband, Hamud Ali Jalal.  Evidence of guilt was provided at trial and by the defendant herself, 
who confessed to the murder.   
 
The trial was conducted in accordance with the law, as explained hereunder. 
 
The initial verdict was delivered on 17 December 2001 and the defendant lodged an appeal.  
After reviewing the procedures followed by the court of first instance and finding nothing amiss, 
the appeal court issued a ruling, on 12 August 2002, upholding the initial verdict. The case was 
referred to the Supreme Court, which in turn approved the appeal court ruling sentencing this 
woman to death.  The Supreme Court ruling was issued on 5 August 2004.  This information is 
contained in the reply from the Prosecutor-General. 
 
The Government should also like to draw attention to the following: 
 
This woman was not subjected to any form of mental or physical torture.  A lawyer was 
appointed to present her defence from the very first stage of proceedings until the Supreme Court 
delivered its ruling.

<b>Yemen: Death Sentence of Adil Muhammad Saif al-Ma&#8217;amari 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Non-respect of international standards relating to the imposition of the death 
penalty 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> 1 male (juvenile offender) 
<b> 
Character of reply: </b>No response 
<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Yemen has failed to cooperate with the 
mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal dated 8 March 2006</b> sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture<b> 
</b> 
We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received 
regarding <b>Adil Muhammad Saif al-Ma'amari</b> who has reportedly been sentenced to death for a 
murder committed when he was 16 years old. According to the information we have received, 
Adil Saif al-Ma'amari was arrested on 27 July 2001. He was tortured at a police station and 
confessed to the murder of his relative during an argument. During his trial at a lower Court in 
the city of al Rwana, the defendant immediately protested that he was under 18. On the orders of 
a judge he was examined by a doctor, who confirmed that he had not yet passed his 17th 
birthday. Nevertheless, the court decided to sentence him to death on 19 October 2002. The 
sentence has reportedly been upheld by the Taiz Court of Appeal on 23 May 2005 and the 
Supreme Court on 27 February 2006. 
</p>
<p> 
Mr. Adil Saif al-Ma'amari&#8217;s sentence is with President Ali &#180;Abdullah Saleh who has the power to 
ratify or commute the death penalty; the young man is said to be at imminent risk of execution.  
</p>
<p> 
In view of the urgency of the matter and the irreversibility of the punishment, we respectfully 
request your Excellency&#8217;s Government to suspend the execution of Mr. Adil Saif al-Ma'amari as 
it would be incompatible with the international obligations of Yemen under various instruments 
which we have been mandated to bring to the attention of Governments. The right to life of 
persons below eighteen years of age and the obligation of States to guarantee the enjoyment of 
this right to the maximum extent possible are both specifically expressed in article 6 of the 
Convention of the Rights of the Child. More explicitly, article 37 (a) provides that capital 
punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age. 
In addition, article 6 (5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that 
the death penalty shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of 
age. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1

We also respectfully remind your Excellency that &#8220;in capital punishment cases, the obligation of 
States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 (of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) admits of no exception (Little v. Jamaica, 
communication no. 283/1988, Views of the Human Rights Committee of 19 November 1991, 
para. 10). Relevant to the cases at issue, these guarantees include the right not to be compelled to 
confess guilt and the right to adequate time and facilities for the preparation of one&#8217;s defence. 
</p>
<p> 
We also recall that Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/39 urges States to ensure that 
any statement, which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked 
in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made. This principle is an essential aspect of the right to physical and mental integrity set forth, 
inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from being Subjected to 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p> 
We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the 
allegations of torture have been thoroughly investigated and all doubts in this respect dispelled. 
Moreover, international law requires that the accountability of any person guilty of subjecting 
Mr. Adil Saif al-Ma'amari to torture is ensured.  
</p>
<p> 
It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on Human Rights 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify all 
cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the Commission, 
we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
 
2. Please provide the details and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the allegations that Adil 
Saif al-Ma'amari was subjected to torture while in pre-trial detention. If no inquiries have taken 
place or if they have been inconclusive please explain why. 
 
3. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken with 
regard to the above mentioned alleged torture. Have penal, disciplinary or administrative 
sanctions been imposed on the perpetrators?

The Special Rapporteur welcomed the commitment conveyed by the Government of Yemen in 
earlier communication to reconsider the death sentence of Amina Ali Abdulatif, but he regrets 
that he has not been informed of the outcome of that reconsideration. 
<b> 
Follow-up letter dated 17 October 2006</b> (to an urgent appeal sent on 29 April 2005)<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 
I would like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s attention to our correspondence, (reflected in my report 
to the Commission on Human Rights E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.1 p. 303-305), relating to the death 
sentence of juvenile offender <b>Amina Ali Abdulatif</b>.  
</p>
<p> 
As indicated in my report, I welcome the decision of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
reconsider the case of Amina Ali Abdulatif in light of Yemen&#8217;s treaty commitments not to 
execute persons for crimes committed when under the age of 18.  As further indicated in my 
observations, I would be grateful if your Government could provide me with information on the 
outcome of your Government&#8217;s reconsideration.  
 
<b>Palestinian Authority: Killing of Civilians in the Gaza Strip and Israel 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Impunity; Deaths due to attacks or killings by paramilitary groups or private 
forces 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> General 
<b> 
Character of reply:</b> No response (recent communication) 
<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
 
</b>The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving a response concerning these allegations. 
<b> 
Urgent appeal sent on 30 November 2006 
</b> 
I am writing to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to express my concern about recent incidents of 
killing of civilians in the Gaza strip and neighboring Israel. I am also writing to the Government 
of Israel and a copy of that letter is enclosed herewith. 
 
According to reports received, following the killing of 18 civilians in Beit Hanoun on 8 
November 2006, several senior representatives of the Hamas party, the party leading the 
government and with a majority in the legislature, made statements which have been widely 
interpreted as advocating the resumption of suicide attacks against the civilian population of 
Israel. 
 
On 23 November 2006, near the town of Beit Lahiya in the Gaza Strip, Ms. Fatima Omar 
Mahmud al-Najar, a woman aged around 60 years, reportedly detonated an explosive belt she 
was wearing when Israeli soldiers who had become suspicious about her conduct threw a stun 
grenade at her. Reports indicate that this attack was claimed by Hamas and that she was 
subsequently shown on television in a so-called martyr&#8217;s video, wearing a bright green Hamas 
bandanna. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 383 
 
 
According to further reports, on 15 November 2006, a 57-year old woman was killed and another 
man injured in Sderot after they were hit by shrapnel from a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip, 
which is at a ten kilometer distance from the town. Since Israeli settlers and troops withdrew 
from Gaza in September 2005, at least 1,100 rockets have reportedly been fired from Gaza, 
killing four Israeli civilians.  
 
In connection with these statements and incidents, I would like to recall that international 
humanitarian law requires parties to an armed conflict to distinguish at all times between 
combatants and civilians, and to direct attacks only against combatants (Rules 1 and 7 of the 
Customary Rules of International Humanitarian Law identified by the International Committee 
of the Red Cross). Also launching an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of 
civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which 
would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is 
prohibited (Rule 14). Moreover, acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to 
spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited (Rule 2).  
 
In the light of these reports, I would like to learn the official position of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government with regard to both the firing of rockets at Israeli civilian settlements and with 
regard to bomb attacks against Israeli targets, both military and civilian, carried out by persons 
who do not identify themselves as combatants.   
 
It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human Rights 
and extended by the Human Rights Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. 
Since I am expected to report on this matter to the Council, I would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
 
</p>
<p>(i) Are the facts alleged above accurate?  
 
</p>
<p>(ii) Does your Excellency&#8217;s Government consider that it is obliged under international law to 
seek to prevent the firing of rockets at Israeli civilian settlements and explosive attacks 
against Israeli targets carried out by persons who do not identify themselves as 
combatants?  
</p>
<p> 
(iii) If not so, I would be grateful for an explanation as to the grounds on which your 
</p>
<p>Government does not consider that international law, including the above provisions, 
places such an obligation on it. 
</p>
<p> 
(iv) If your Excellency&#8217;s Government does consider that it is under an obligation to prevent 
</p>
<p>such attacks, please explain the steps taken to comply with this obligation. 
 
I undertake to ensure that your Government&#8217;s response to each of these questions is accurately 
reflected in the report I will submit to the Human Rights Council for its consideration. Please 
note that in order to include your Government&#8217;s response in my next report to the Human Rights 
Council, I would need to receive it before 15 January 2007.

<b>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE): Death Threats against Ratnajeevan Hoole 
 
Violation alleged:</b> Death threats and fear of imminent extrajudicial execution 
<b> 
Subject(s) of appeal:</b> 1 male 
<b> 
Character of reply:</b> No response 
<b> 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b> 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Commission 
on Human Rights. 
 
<b>Urgent Appeal sent on 13 April 2006 
</b> 
We have the honour to address you in our capacities as Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions and Special Representative of the  
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders pursuant to Commission on Human 
Rights resolutions 2004/37 and 2003/64.  
</p>
<p> 
In this connection, we would like to draw your attention to information we have received 
regarding death threats against the Vice Chancellor of Jaffna University, Prof. <b>Ratnajeevan 
Hoole</b>, and his family. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> 
At the beginning of March 2006 Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole, who is a Christian, was 
appointed Vice Chancellor of Jaffna University. Soon thereafter, posters appeared on the 
university campus, alleging that he was anti-Hindu, implying that he is also anti-Tamil.  
 
On 11 March 2006, shortly after his appointment as Vice Chancellor of Jaffna University, 
Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole received several telephone calls from persons claiming to 
represent a group called the People's Uprising Force (Makkal Eluchip Padai). The callers 
warned Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole that if he stepped onto the campus of Jaffna University 
he would return home &#8220;headless in a box&#8221;. On 12 March 2006, the leader of the Jaffna 
University Students&#8217; Union (Yaal Palkalaikalaha Maanavar Ondriyam) threatened to 
assault him if he steps onto the campus. 
 
On the same day, 12 March 2006, the website &#8220;nitharsanam.com&#8221;, which is reported to be 
operated by the LTTE, posted a photo of Prof. Hoole captioned &#8220;Who is this fool&#8221; 
together with an article entitled &#8220;Army Spy Appointed VC [Vice Chancellor]&#8221;. The 
article referred to Professor Hoole&#8217;s alleged involvement in the 1990 publication of a 
book called The Broken Palmyra criticizing the LTTE's suppression of alternative voices 
within the Tamil community. On 18 March 2006, &#8220;nitharsanam.com&#8221; published a second 
article entitled &#8220;Who is this fool Part 2&quot;, which among other things accused Professor 
Hoole of being connected to the University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna) (UTHR-
J), a civil society group documenting abuses by the LTTE. 
 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
 Page 385 
 
</p>
<p>On 22 March 2006, Prof. Hoole&#8217;s daughter Anbini received an anonymous call with a 
threat to &#8220;kill her younger brother and chop him into pieces&#8221; if their father were to take 
up the Vice Chancellor post at the university. The family received further threatening 
calls from the People&#8217;s Uprising Force. 
 
In a letter dated 21 March 2006 Prof. Hoole raised his concerns about threats against him 
and his family with the Norwegian Embassy in Colombo and the Sri Lanka Monitoring 
Mission (SLMM). Since then he has received messages through members of parliament 
of the Tamil National Alliance, and others claiming to be from the LTTE, that he must 
resign from the post of Vice Chancellor. 
 
</p>
<p>Without prejudging the accuracy of the reports received, we urge the LTTE to publicly condemn 
the death threats and other intimidation against Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole. We further urge the 
LTTE to ensure that Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole and his family are not harmed. While we are not 
privy to detailed knowledge of the exact nature of the relationship between the LTTE and the so-
called &#8220;People's Uprising Force&#8221;, the publishers of the website nitharsanam.com, or the 
leadership of the Jaffna University Students&#8217; Union, we have no doubts that the LTTE exercises 
sufficient influence over them to make them desist from carrying out their threats and from 
further intimidation.  
</p>
<p> 
We would also like to recall that the LTTE has formally committed itself to international human 
rights standards, which prominently include the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of one&#8217;s life 
and the right to freedom of opinion and expression. The Charter of the North East Secretariat on 
Human Rights states (Article 1) that &#8220;[all] persons deserve to be treated with &#8230; respect for their 
humanity&#8221; and reiterates that &#8220;[all] persons have the right to life&#8221; (Article 5.1). It also enshrines 
the &#8220;right to be free from incitement of discrimination, hatred or violence&#8221; (Article 1.5) and 
protects the &#8220;right to express &#8230; opinions and beliefs freely&#8221;. In this connection, we would also 
like to refer the LTTE to the fundamental principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and 
Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally 
Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which 
state that everyone has the right individually or in association with others, to promote and to 
strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels.  
</p>
<p> 
We would further like to recall that in Article 2.1 of the Ceasefire Agreement, the LTTE 
committed to &#8220;abstain from hostile acts against the civilian population&#8221; in accordance with 
international law.  
</p>
<p> 
We are gravely concerned that the alleged threats against Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole and his family 
are aimed at preventing him from carrying out his work, which includes promoting the human 
right to freedom of opinion and expression within the Tamil community. 
</p>
<p> 
In the conclusions to the report on his visit to Sri Lanka (para. 84), the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions stated that &#8220;[t]he LTTE should unequivocally 
denounce and condemn any killing attributed to it for which it denies responsibility.  Mere 
denials are neither adequate nor convincing.&#8221; Similarly, the systematic creation of an atmosphere 
conducive to the killing of Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole and his family by forces close to the LTTE, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.1 
Page 386 
 
calls for unequivocal denouncement and condemnation by the LTTE if it does not wish to be 
held responsible in the event that Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole or his family were to be harmed.
