<p>At the 55th meeting, held on 26 March 2015, the President of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council made the following statement: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Human Rights Council: 
</p>
<p>1. Recalls that 2015 marks the seventieth anniversary of the end of the 
</p>
<p>Second World War, a war that brought untold sorrow to humankind, particularly in 
</p>
<p>Europe, Asia, Africa, the Pacific and other parts of the world; 
</p>
<p>2. Pays tribute to all victims of the Second World War, including the 
</p>
<p>victims of the Holocaust, of war crimes and crimes against humanity; 
</p>
<p>3. Stresses that this historic event established the conditions for the 
</p>
<p>creation of the United Nations, designed to save succeeding generations from the 
</p>
<p>scourge of war and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and dignity and the 
</p>
<p>worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations 
</p>
<p>large and small; 
</p>
<p>4. Calls upon the States Members of the United Nations to unite their 
</p>
<p>efforts in dealing with the challenges and threats to international peace and security, 
</p>
<p>with the United Nations playing a central role, and to refrain in their international 
</p>
<p>relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political 
</p>
<p>independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations, and to settle all disputes by peaceful means in conformity with 
</p>
<p>the Charter of the United Nations; 
</p>
<p>5. Underlines the progress made since the end of the Second World War 
</p>
<p>in overcoming its legacy and in promoting reconciliation, international and regional 
</p>
<p>cooperation and democratic values, human rights and fundamental freedoms, in 
</p>
<p>particular through the United Nations, and the establishment of regional and 
</p>
<p>subregional and other appropriate frameworks.&#8221;
