Cautionary statements

This presentation has been prepared by Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited (“Rio Tinto”). By accessing/attending  this presentation you acknowledge that you have read and understood the following 
statement.
Forward-looking  statements
This document contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of the Rio Tinto Group. These statements are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The words “intend”, “aim”, “project”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, 
“believes”, “expects”, “may”,  “should”, “will”, “target”, “set to” or similar expressions, commonly identify such forward-looking statements.
Examples of forward-looking statements include those regarding estimated ore reserves, anticipated production or construction dates, costs, outputs and productive lives of assets or similar factors. Forward-
looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors set forth in this presentation.
For example, future ore reserves will be based in part on market prices that may vary significantly from current levels. These may materially affect the timing and feasibility of particular developments. Other 
factors include the ability to produce and transport products profitably,  demand for our products, changes to the assumptions regarding the recoverable value of our tangible and intangible assets, the effect 
of foreign currency  exchange rates on market prices and operating costs, and activities by governmental authorities, such as changes in taxation or regulation, and political uncertainty.
In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, actual results could be materially different from projected future results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements which speak only as to 
the date of this presentation. Except as required by applicable regulations or by law, the Rio Tinto Group does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, 
whether as a result of new information or future events. The Group cannot guarantee that its forward-looking statements will not differ materially from actual results. In this presentation all figures are US 
dollars unless stated otherwise.
Disclaimer
Neither this presentation,  nor the question and answer session, nor any part thereof, may be recorded, transcribed, distributed, published or reproduced in any form, except as permitted by Rio Tinto.  By 
accessing/ attending this presentation, you agree with the foregoing and, upon request, you will promptly return any records or transcripts at the presentation without retaining any copies.
This presentation contains a number of non-IFRS financial measures. Rio Tinto management considers these to be key financial performance indicators of the business and they are defined and/or 
reconciled in Rio Tinto’s annual results press release and/or Annual report.
Reference to consensus figures are not based on Rio Tinto’s own opinions, estimates or forecasts and are compiled and published without comment from, or endorsement or verification by, Rio Tinto. The 
consensus figures do not necessarily reflect guidance provided from time to time by Rio Tinto where given in relation to equivalent metrics, which to the extent available can be found on the Rio Tinto website.
By referencing consensus figures, Rio Tinto does not imply that it endorses, confirms or expresses a view on the consensus figures. The consensus figures are provided for informational purposes only and 
are not intended to, nor do they, constitute investment advice or any solicitation to buy, hold or sell securities or other financial instruments. No warranty or representation, either express or implied, is made 
by Rio Tinto or its affiliates, or their respective directors, officers and employees, in relation to the accuracy,  completeness or achievability of the consensus figures and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, 
no responsibility or liability is accepted by any of those persons in respect of those matters. Rio Tinto assumes no obligation to update, revise or supplement the consensus figures to reflect circumstances 
existing after the date hereof.
Production Targets 
The bauxite production target which appears on slide 23 was disclosed in a media release dated 27 November 2015 (“Rio Tinto approves US$1.9 billion Amrun (South of Embley) bauxite project”).  All the 
material assumptions underpinning that production target continue to apply and have not materially changed since the date of that release.
The Oyu Tolgoi production target which appears on slide 23 was disclosed in a release to the market on 6 May 2016. All material assumptions underpinning that target continue to apply and have not 
materially changed.
The Silvergrass production target which appears on slide 23 was disclosed in a presentation dated 10 May  2016 and released to the market on 10 May 2016. All material assumptions underpinning that target 
continue to apply and have not materially changed.

• Average LME prices decreased 13% year-on-year. Value-added product premia continued to be robust, averaging $226 per
tonne in H1 2016 (H1 2015: $259). The average realised price per tonne averaged $1,805 in H1 2016 (H1 2015: $2,292).
• H1 2016 cost savings were $223 million pre-tax, taking total pre-tax Aluminium cost savings since 2012 to $1,355 million.
• Integrated operations EBITDA margins decreased to 25% in H1 2016, compared to 35% in H1 2015. This performance and
reduced working capital delivered strong operating cash flows of $993 million and $660 million of free cash flow.
• The modernised and expanded Kitimat smelter delivered it’s first full quarter at nameplate capacity in the second quarter of 2016.
• Since its approval in November 2015, the Amrun Project is advancing in both engineering and construction. Site establishment is 
progressing to plan with the initial stage of the construction accommodation village complete. Construction of the river terminals is 
well advanced and clearing for the 40 kilometre access road has been completed.

• The Copper & Diamond group’s underlying earnings were heavily impacted by lower prices, volumes and non-cash asset write-
downs at Rio Tinto Kennecott following the conclusion of the asset portfolio review. Despite the challenging market, the group 
remained free cash flow neutral during the half.
• Net cash generated from operating activities was $447 million in H1 2016 (H1 2015: $867 million), and there was $370 million
investment in development capital and exploration and evaluation spend during the period.
• The over $140 million in cost savings achieved at Rio Tinto managed operations during the half were offset by lower volumes at
Escondida and a decision to process lower grade stockpiles to release working capital, impacting unit costs. Total pre-tax cost 
savings delivered by Copper & Diamonds since 2012 are $999 million.
• To optimise smelter utilisation, Rio Tinto Kennecott tolled 199 thousand tonnes of third party concentrate in H1 2016.
• At 30 June 2016, the Group had an estimated 189 million pounds of copper sales that were provisionally priced at 214 cents per
pound. The final price of these sales will be determined during the second half of 2016. This compares with 252 million pounds of 
open shipments at 31 December 2015, provisionally priced at 217 cents per pound.

• Underlying earnings of $82 million were 11% higher than H1 2015, with further cash cost savings and favourable exchange rates
partly offsetting lower prices.
• Pre-tax cash cost improvements in the Energy & Minerals group were $152 million in H1 2016, with total savings delivered since
2012 now at $1,215 million.
• Net cash generated from operating activities of $469 million was 31% lower than H1 2015 due to lower prices, higher tax 
payments and the expensing of Simandou study costs which was partially offset by cash cost improvements and further 
reductions in working capital.
• On 27 January 2016, Rio Tinto announced that it had reached a binding agreement for sale of its Mount Pleasant thermal coal 
assets to MACH Energy Australia Pty Ltd for $224 million plus royalties. The sale is expected to complete in the third quarter.
• Revenues included $137 million of freight in H1 2016 (H1 2015: $172 million).

Note: The sensitivities give the estimated effect on underlying earnings assuming that each individual price or exchange rate moved in isolation. The relationship between 
currencies and commodity prices is a complex one and movements in exchange rates can affect movements in commodity prices and vice versa. The exchange rate 
sensitivities include the effect on operating costs but exclude the effect of revaluation of foreign currency working capital.
