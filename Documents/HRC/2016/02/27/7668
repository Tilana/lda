<p><i>Summary 
</i>Since May 2010, the Government of Greece has been implementing an economic 
</p>
<p>adjustment programme as a condition for securing a total financing package of &#8364;240 billion 
from the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central 
Bank. The programme consists of stringent policy measures that entail deep public 
spending cuts, public sector job cuts, tax increases, the privatization of public enterprises 
and structural reforms (including labour market reforms), which are ostensibly aimed at 
reducing the country&#8217;s fiscal deficit and debt to a &#8220;sustainable&#8221; level. Nevertheless, the 
measures have pushed the economy into recession and generally undermined the enjoyment 
of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, in Greece. Significantly, 
the public spending cuts and labour market reforms have resulted in increased 
unemployment (in particular among young people), homelessness, poverty and social 
exclusion (with approximately 11 per cent of the population living in extreme poverty), and 
severely reduced access to public services, such as health care and education. The impact

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. From 22 to 27 April 2013, the Independent Expert conducted an official visit to 
Greece. The key purpose of his visit was to assess the impact of the economic adjustment 
programme adopted by the Government of Greece as a condition for financial assistance 
from the troika&#8217; comprising the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to address the country&#8217;s fiscal deficit and debt, on the 
realization of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>2. The Independent Expert met with senior officials from the Ministries of Foreign 
Affairs, Labour and Social Welfare, Finance, Education, Health, Development, Justice, and 
Public Order and Citizens&#8217; Protection, as well as the Hellenic Coast Guard. He also had 
meetings with members of Parliament (including those from the main opposition party, 
Syriza) and representatives of the Bank of Greece, the National Commission for Human 
Rights, the National Ombudsman, IMF, the European Commission and the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Greece, academics and civil 
society organizations. He also visited two volunteer community clinics in Perama and 
Helleniko (Attica), which provide free health care to the needy. 
</p><p>3. The Independent Expert is grateful to the Government for its invitation and 
cooperation during his mission. He also expresses his gratitude to UNHCR for its support, 
as well as to all those who met with him.  
</p>
<p>4. Nevertheless, he regrets the lack of support by Greece and other European Union 
countries for the mandate in the Human Rights Council, despite the fact that several 
European Union countries (including Greece) face obvious challenges in the progressive 
realization of economic, social and cultural rights due to the sovereign debt crisis affecting 
them and in the context of economic adjustment programmes adopted to address the crisis. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Framework for analysis: human rights in the context of 
economic adjustment  
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>5. Austerity and other economic adjustment policies raise important concerns regarding 
the protection of economic, social and cultural rights, because they are often incompatible 
with the obligation of States to take steps for their progressive realization and to avoid 
deliberate retrogressive measures, in particular those that are incompatible with the core 
obligations of each right and the duty of States to use all available resources in an effort to 
satisfy, as a matter of priority, these minimum obligations.1 <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Greece&#8217;s human rights obligations  
</b></p>
<p>6. The Constitution of Greece sets out a number of human rights obligations of the 
State. Article 2(1) underscores that &#8220;respect and protection of the value of the human being 
constitute the primary obligation of the State&#8221;. Part Two of the Constitution explicitly sets 
out a number of other obligations of the State, including the protection of property (art. 17); 
family, motherhood and childhood (art. 21.1); the special care for health (art. 21(2) and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>

</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>(3)); the advancement of conditions of employment (art. 22(1)); and social security (art. 
22(5)). Various rights correspond to these obligations, including the rights to equality of all 
Greeks (art. 4), social, economic and political participation (art. 5), information (art. 5A), 
petition (art. 10), peaceful assembly (art. 11), free public education (art. 16(2)), property 
(art. 17(2)), health care (art. 21(3)), work (art. 22(1)), social security (art. 22(5)) and 
freedom to unionize (art. 23). Article 21.4 specifies that &#8220;the acquisition of a home by the 
homeless or those inadequately sheltered shall constitute an object of special State care&#8221;. 
Article 25, paragraph 1 explicitly refers to the principle of the welfare State and 
underscores that all public institutions are obliged to ensure the effective implementation of 
these rights.  
</p>
<p>7. These provisions are complemented by standards set out in several core international 
and regional human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights and the European Social Charter, to which Greece is a party.2  
</p>
<p>8. Under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Greece 
is obliged to realize the rights enshrined therein progressively, using its maximum available 
resources. This requires it to adopt and implement laws and policies that aim to achieve 
incremental improvements in universal access to basic goods and services, such as health 
care, education, housing, social security and cultural life. While it does enjoy a &#8220;margin of 
appreciation within which to set (its) national, economic, social and cultural policies&#8221;, 
including during austerity, it has the duty to &#8220;avoid at all times taking decisions which 
might lead to the denial or infringement of economic, social and cultural rights&#8221;.3  
</p>
<p>9. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has emphasized that 
austerity and other adjustment policies adopted by States in times of economic crisis must 
comply with obligations derived from the Covenant. In particular, any measure that could 
impede the progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights must (a) be 
temporary and restricted to the period of crisis; (b) strictly necessary and proportionate; (c) 
not be discriminatory and take into account all possible alternatives, including fiscal 
measures, to ensure the necessary measures to mitigate inequalities that may arise in times 
of crisis; and (d) identify the minimum core content of the rights enshrined in the Covenant, 
or a social protection floor, as developed by the International Labour Organization (ILO),4 
and ensure the protection of this core content at all times.5  
</p>
<p>10. In addition, States bear the burden of establishing that austerity measures have been 
introduced only after the most careful consideration of all other less restrictive alternatives.6 
States cannot therefore justify austerity measures simply by referring to the need to achieve 
fiscal discipline and savings; they need to show why the austerity measures were necessary 
for the protection of the totality of the rights provided for in the Covenant.7

 Greece is not a party to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant

from Enforced Disappearance, the Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications 
procedure.

<p>11. It is notable that the Guiding Principles on foreign debt and human rights also 
underscore that States should ensure that their rights and obligations arising from external 
debt agreements or arrangements do not hinder the progressive realization of economic, 
social and cultural rights.8 
</p>
<p><b> B. The obligations of Greece&#8217;s international lenders 
</b></p>
<p>12. It is increasingly accepted that non-State actors, including international financial 
institutions, have obligations to ensure that their policies and activities respect international 
human rights standards.9 This obligation implies a duty to refrain from formulating, 
adopting, funding, promoting or implementing policies and programmes that directly or 
indirectly impede the enjoyment of human rights.10  
</p><p>13. It is also well established that States must adhere to their international law 
obligations when they act through international organizations.11 Moreover, an important 
element of the duty of international cooperation as reflected in the Charter of the United 
Nations and binding international human rights treaties is that States parties, individually or 
through membership of international institutions, should not adopt or promote policies or 
engage in practices that imperil the enjoyment of human rights. 
14. In circumstances where countries are constrained to implement adjustment 
programmes involving austerity, it should be ensured that efforts to protect the most basic 
economic, social and cultural rights are, to the maximum extent possible, factored into such 
programmes and policies.12 
</p>
<p>15. In tacit recognition of their role in relation to adjustment programmes, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has urged international financial

<p>institutions to pay enhanced attention in their activities to respect for economic, social and 
cultural rights, including through the explicit recognition of these rights, assisting in the 
identification of country-specific benchmarks to facilitate their promotion, and facilitating 
the development of appropriate remedies for responding to violations, and to use social 
safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable in the context of adjustment programmes.13  
</p><p>16. In Greece, the European Union, the European Central Bank and IMF play an 
important role in the design and monitoring of the measures under the country&#8217;s adjustment 
programme (see paragraphs 24 and 25 below). It may therefore be contended that these 
institutions have a duty to respect the human rights of that country&#8217;s population by ensuring 
that the programme does not undermine the capacity of the Government to establish and 
maintain the conditions for the realization of human rights, including by assuring equitable 
access to basic public services.14  
</p>
<p><b> III. The eeconomic adjustment programme  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background</b>15<b>  
</b></p>
<p>17. In the mid-1990s, the economy of Greece started to boom as the Government 
borrowed large amounts from European banks to finance its imports, including military 
equipment,16 from countries such as Germany. This process intensified with the adoption of 
the euro in 2001. The Government also borrowed extensively to fund the 2004 Olympics 
Games.17 
</p>
<p>18. The Government used its enhanced access to cheap credit (as a member State of the 
European Monetary Union, or euro zone) to fund public spending and offset the country&#8217;s 
low tax revenues.18 It also borrowed to pay for imports that were not offset by tariffs or 
exports. As a result, and despite annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 
4.5 per cent in the period from 2000 to 2007, revenue declined substantially while the 
budget and trade deficits increased. 
</p>
<p>19. Widespread corruption, weak tax administration and tax evasion also put a strain on 
public finances.19

 It should be noted the European Union and the European Central Bank are bound by the Charter of

<p>Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which enshrines economic and social, as well as civil 
and political, rights.

<p>20. To keep within the euro zone guidelines, previous Governments had, for many years 
and with the help of foreign banks, also misreported the national economic statistics, as did 
a number of other European Governments. In early 2010, it emerged that, with the help of 
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and other banks, specific derivatives were developed so 
that the actual level of debt and deficits could be hidden and Greece could gain entry into 
the euro zone.20  
</p>
<p>21. The global financial crisis of 2008 had a profound impact on tourism and shipping, 
two of the country&#8217;s largest industries; in 2009, revenues sank by 15 per cent.21 In this 
context, lending to the country increased to help cope it with the impact of lower tax 
revenues and the need for higher government spending.22  
</p>
<p>22. In October 2009, the newly elected Government of George Papandreou revealed that 
that previous Governments had been underreporting the budget deficit. The new 
Government revised the overall fiscal deficit for 2009 from 5 per cent to 13.5 per cent of 
GDP (and subsequently to 15.6 per cent). The figure for Government debt at the end of 
2009 was also revised from &#8364;269.3 billion (113 per cent of GDP) to &#8364;299.7 billion (130 per 
cent).23  
</p><p>23. From November 2009, Greece suffered several speculative waves, raising the 
interest rate on sovereign debt to prohibitively high levels. The deteriorating fiscal results 
led to downgrades of Government bonds by credit rating agencies in late April 2010. In 
effect, this curtailed the State&#8217;s access to the international financial markets. To avoid 
defaulting on its debt, Greece turned to the European Union and IMF for financial 
assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The bailout programme  
</b></p>
<p>24. In May 2010, Greece agreed a &#8364;110 billion loan at market-based interest rates with 
the European Commission, the European Central Bank and IMF.24 The loan was 
conditional on Greece implementing an economic adjustment programme entailing &#8364;30 
billion of fiscal cuts over the period 2010-2014. The programme, which had the two broad 
objectives of making fiscal policy and the fiscal and debt situation sustainable, and 
improving competitiveness,25 consisted of three main components: the implementation of 
austerity measures to restore the fiscal balance; the privatization of State assets worth &#8364;50

<p>billion by the end of 2015, to keep the debt sustainable; and implementation of structural 
reforms to improve competitiveness of the economy and growth prospects.26  
</p>
<p>25. The loan was to be disbursed in several instalments from May 2010 until June 2013. 
Owing to the worsening recession, however, in October 2011, the State&#8217;s European partners 
agreed to provide it with a second bailout loan of &#8364;130 billion. This was conditional not 
only on the implementation of another austerity package (together with the privatization 
and structural reforms outlined in the initial programme), but also a restructuring of all 
Greek public debt held by private creditors (approximately 58 per cent of total public debt) 
so as to reduce the overall public debt burden by about &#8364;110 billion. Under this debt 
restructuring (known as &#8220;Private Sector Initiative&#8221;, or PSI+) creditors were asked to accept 
lower interest rates and a 53.5 per cent face value loss. 
</p>
<p>26. According to information available to the Independent Expert, approximately 15,000 
Greek families holding Government bonds were included in the Private Sector Initiative 
without their consent.27 At current market prices, their bonds have less than 30 per cent of 
their nominal value. 
</p>
<p>27. The Independent Expert is concerned at allegations that, when purchasing their 
bonds, some Greek investors were misled by bank personnel who failed to adhere to the 
Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID Directive 2004/39/EC). He also 
received information that other bondholders relied on representations contained in official 
European Union and European Central Bank documentation as, well as statements made by 
public institutions, namely the Bank of Greece and the Public Debt Management Agency, 
on the State&#8217;s economic health.  
</p>
<p>28. The Independent Expert is also concerned that the new maturity period for the bonds 
(30 years) may be too long for some older individual bondholders, who do not expect to 
live long enough to enjoy the return on their investment. Furthermore, some of the 
bondholders who invested a substantial amount of savings in bonds that they understood to 
be relatively safe investments for their retirement, or had planned to fund their own health-
care needs or care of disabled family members from these savings, are experiencing serious 
financial hardship, particularly against the backdrop of severe cuts to pensions and other 
social benefits. He therefore urges the Government to address urgently the plight of these 
investors, particularly the elderly, to investigate fully the claims that public employees 
misled bondholders, and to take appropriate action against those found to have done so.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Austerity measures 
</b></p>
<p>29.  Under the adjustment programme, the Government committed to implement 
rigorous austerity measures to bring the deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP by 2014. In 
addition to increases in value-added-tax rates, the measures included reducing public sector 
jobs by 150,000 through 2015, a recruitment freeze in the public sector, reduction of public 
sector wages, raising the retirement age, cuts in social benefits amounting to 1.5 per cent of 
GDP (elimination of pension bonuses, a nominal pension freeze and the introduction of 
means testing for unemployment benefits), eliminating bonuses and allowances, and cutting 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>26
 These measures were outlined in a memorandum of understanding that has been updated several 
</p>
<p>times. See European Commission, &#8220;The Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece &#8211; 
Third Review, July 2013&#8221; (available from 
http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2013/pdf/ocp159_en.pdf), pp. 
99-222. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>27
 This was possible because Law 4050/2012 required that a majority of bondholders convene and that a 
</p>
<p>&#8220;super majority&#8221; agree to tender their bonds for exchange and accept amendments to their terms.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>investment spending. The Government has committed to further spending cuts over the 
fiscal period 2013/14.28 
</p>
<p><b> D. Privatization 
</b></p>
<p>30. A key component of the adjustment programme is the sale of State-owned 
enterprises and assets in order to contribute to the reduction of the public debt.29 It was 
initially assumed that &#8364;50 billion would be generated through the privatization process by 
the end of 2015. The privatization programme has not, however, been as successful as 
anticipated; for example, revenues generated by the end of 2012 amounted to only &#8364;1.6 
billion, and proceeds in 2013 were &#8220;below expectations&#8221;. The target has therefore been 
reduced to &#8364;24.2 billion by 2020.  
</p>
<p>31. The Independent Expert is concerned that several of the enterprises targeted for 
privatization provide essential public services, such as water and sanitation, transportation 
and energy, and that there is a likelihood of a significant increase in user fees for the 
services offered by these entities after privatization, with a potential negative impact on the 
enjoyment of basic rights. Consequently, he considers that privatization should be 
undertaken cautiously and with sensitivity to the rights of the population. 
</p>
<p>32. Furthermore, if the intention is to raise funds to pay down the debt, the decision to 
privatize the Greek national lottery, one of the most profitable in the world, may be called 
into question.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Structural reforms  
</b></p>
<p>33. The adjustment programme includes several &#8220;structural reforms&#8221; aimed at boosting 
competitiveness and enabling Greece to emerge from the crisis quickly. These include 
modernizing public administration by reorganizing recruitment procedures; liberalizing 
trade; opening up regulated professions; ensuring greater labour market &#8220;flexibility&#8221; to 
reduce labour entry and exit costs; strengthening the anti-corruption framework; and 
improving the business environment through by addressing inefficiencies in the judicial 
system. 
</p>
<p>34. Since 2010, a series of labour market reforms (laws 4019/2011, 3996/2011, 
3986/2011, 4024/2011 and 4052/2012) have been implemented with the professed aim of 
increasing the competitiveness of the economy and boosting growth prospects. Specific 
measures include labour cost reduction and encouraging employment through the repeal of 
allowances and benefits; reduction of the time of notification of dismissals (Law 
3863/2010); making collective bargaining &#8220;more flexible&#8221;, including by waiving the so-
called &#8220;principle of favourability&#8221; in collective bargaining, and firm-level agreements 
taking precedence over any other favourable collective (sectoral or professional) agreement 
(Law 3899/2010); introducing flexible forms of employment by extending the maximum 
duration of successive fixed-term contracts from two to three years (Law 3986/2011); and 
reduction of the monthly minimum wage in the private sector by 22 per cent for workers 
over 25 years and by 32 per cent for those under 25 (Law 4046/2012).

 The programme is overseen by the Hellenic Asset Development Fund, which includes representatives 
</p>
<p>of the European Union and IMF. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/50/Add.1

<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>35. The above-mentioned measures may well violate the standards set out in the treaties 
to which Greece is a party; for example, the European Committee of Social Rights of the 
Council of Europe has held that the reduced minimum wage for employee under 25 years 
violates the right to a fair remuneration in article 4 (1) of the European Social Charter, as it 
provides a minimum wage below the poverty level.30  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Debt sustainability 
</b></p>
<p>36. According to IMF, Greece&#8217;s public debt was expected to peak at around 176 per cent 
of GDP in 201331 before declining to 124 per cent in 2020 and &#8220;substantially below 110 per 
cent of GDP in 2022&#8221;.32 In June 2013, gross external debt was estimated at 233 per cent of 
GDP but was expected to peak at around 240 per cent of GDP during the same year, then 
decline to around 145 per cent in 2020.33 Net external debt was projected to fall from 
approximately 130 per cent of GDP in 2012 to around 75 per cent in 2020.34  
</p>
<p>37. These projections are based on the assumption that the Government will be able to 
maintain a primary surplus of 4 per cent in the long run, generate about &#8364;22 billion from 
privatization through 2020, and continue to rely on official loans at relatively low interest 
rates.35 It is also based on the assumption that the economy will start to grow from 2014 and 
that Greece will secure additional contingent debt relief of about 4 per cent of GDP from its 
European partners, to be determined in 2014/15. These projections appear, however, to be 
overly optimistic. Indeed, it is evident that IMF has consistently underestimated the loss of 
GDP for Greece, lowering its projections by 6.9 per cent since its first review of the stand-
by arrangement in September 2010. In June 2013, IMF admitted that it had underestimated 
the impact of austerity measures on the country&#8217;s economy and debt sustainability.36 
Furthermore, failures with the privatization programme &#8211; the trend to date &#8211; would also 
raise the debt-to-GDP ratio.37 
</p>
<p>38. Significantly, Greece&#8217;s debt, as IMF has acknowledged, is likely to remain high 
&#8220;well into the next decade&#8221;.38 It is also notable that its external debt burden, particularly on

growth was insufficient to support a decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio during that period.

 Although the adjustment programme assumed large revenues from privatization (about 15 per cent of 
</p>
<p>GDP between 2010-2011 and 22 per cent of GDP by 2017), there has been little forthcoming from 
privatization since 2010.

<p>short-term maturities, is significant. Government annual external debt payments are 
estimated at &#8364;23 billion (29 per cent of revenue and 42 per cent of exports).39 
</p><p>39. From a human rights viewpoint, the IMF debt sustainability assessment has 
limitations. It is too narrowly focused on debt repayment capacity. As the Independent 
Expert has stressed on previous occasions, debt sustainability analyses should include an 
evaluation of the level of debt that a country can carry without undermining its capacity to 
fulfil its human rights obligations.40 
</p>
<p><b> V. Impact of the adjustment programme on human rights 
</b></p>
<p>40. The economic and social costs of the adjustment programme have been substantial.41 
The economy remains in recession while output has fallen by nearly 25 per cent since 
2007.42  
</p>
<p>41. The measures implemented as part of adjustment, in particular the job cuts, and cuts 
to wages and pensions, have had the overall effect of compromising the living standards of 
the population and the enjoyment of human rights. According to the National Ombudsman, 
&#8220;the drastic adjustments imposed on the Greek economy and society as a whole have had 
dramatic consequences on citizens, while vulnerable groups increase and multiply&#8221;.43 In a 
similar vein, the National Human Rights Commission observed a &#8220;rapid deterioration in 
living standards coupled with the dismantling of the welfare State and the adoption of 
measures incompatible with social justice, which are undermining social cohesion and 
democracy&#8221;.44  
</p>
<p>42. The burden of adjustment does not appear to be shared fairly,45 and the impact has 
been particularly severe for the most vulnerable sectors of the population: the poor, older 
persons, pensioners, women, children, people with disabilities and immigrants. 
</p>
<p>43. Owing to space limitations, the Independent Expert will only highlight the impact of 
the adjustment programme on the rights to work, social security, health, education and 
adequate housing, as well as its contribution to poverty and social exclusion.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Work 
</b></p>
<p>44. One of the most profound consequences of the adjustment programme has been the 
exponential rise in unemployment. Under the programme, the Government committed to 
cut 150,000 public sector jobs (about 22 per cent of public employment) by 2015. Some

December 2013, not because of the adjustment programme. Most of the financing will come from

<p>80,000 to 120,000 public sector workers had already lost their jobs at the time of the 
Independent Expert&#8217;s visit. As a result, unemployment grew from 7.3 per cent in June 2008 
to 27.9 per cent in June 2013,46 the highest in the European Union (see figure below). There 
are around 1.4 million unemployed people in Greece; about 778,000 persons lost their jobs 
during the period 2010-2013 alone. Further lay-offs in the public sector are planned. Youth 
unemployment reached an unprecedented rate of 64.9 per cent in May 2013 (compared with 
an average of 24.4 in the euro zone).47 Thus, the prospects of a significant part of the 
population to access the job market and for securing an adequate standard of living have 
been compromised. 
</p>
<p>45. In addition, the labour market reforms under the adjustment programme have 
undermined the realization of the right to work. Together with successive wage cuts and tax 
hikes, the reforms have failed to achieve the stated goal of promoting secure growth and 
employment. Conversely, they have resulted in massive lay-offs, a deterioration in labour 
standards, increased job insecurity and widespread precariousness, with over-flexible low-
paid jobs, where women and young people are predominant. The minimum wage has been 
pushed below poverty thresholds and has, to a large extent, lost its function as a tool for 
poverty alleviation.48 In addition, more than 120,000 professionals &#8211; including doctors, 
engineers and scientists &#8211; have emigrated since 2010.49 
</p>
<p>46. It may be contended that this situation is at odds with the obligation of the State 
under article 22(1) of the Constitution to protect the right to work and to create conditions 
of employment for all citizens.

</p>
<p>47. As the figure above shows, the crisis has had a disproportionate impact on women. 
The rate of unemployment among women, currently estimated at 31.9 per cent, is 7 
percentage points higher than that for men.50 In addition, there has been a strong increase in 
involuntary part-time work since 2008, in particular among women. Some 61 per cent of all 
part-timers did not choose this status, an increase of 16 per cent.51  
</p>
<p>48. According to the Ombudsman, there have been an increasing number of complaints 
relating to unfair dismissal due to pregnancy, indicating increased pressures on women to 
turn to unpaid work or the informal economy, thereby compounding inequalities.52 
</p>
<p>49. The economic crisis has also contributed to rising tensions in the informal sector, 
where a significant number of the estimated 470,000 irregular migrants are employed.53 
These individuals face the risk of exposure to exploitative labour conditions. They also lack 
protection, as they have little access to legal redress mechanisms owing to fear of being 
detected by the authorities, detained and ultimately deported. The shooting of 33 migrant 
workers at a strawberry farm in Manolada in April 2013 following a labour dispute 
underscores the gravity of the problem.

<p>50. The Independent Expert commends the Government for the measures it has taken to 
expand employment and training programmes. These include the youth internship and 
employment voucher programme, which supports six-month vocational training and 
internships for 45,000 beneficiaries.54 He considers it unlikely, however, that these 
measures can, against the backdrop of the deep reforms to the labour market, provide a 
sustainable solution to the country&#8217;s profound youth unemployment problem or provide 
opportunities for decent work in line with international standards.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Social security 
</b></p>
<p>51. Significant spending cuts under the adjustment programme have affected a range of 
benefits, including unemployment benefits, pensions and family benefits.55 To compound 
the problem, there are significant delays in issuing pension decisions, paying pensions and 
benefits and interpretative problems in the implementation of new pension legislation.56  
</p>
<p>52. Owing to the rise in long-term unemployment, only a fraction of all registered 
unemployed persons receive benefits (27 per cent as at February 2013). Moreover, 
unemployment benefits expire after 12 months, resulting in the loss of public health 
insurance cover. Many young people are not eligible for support because they have never 
had a job and have not paid the required national insurance contributions. 
</p><p>53. The Independent Expert notes that a modified assistance scheme to be introduced as 
of 1 January 2014 will expand unemployment support to all long-term unemployed persons 
below retirement age. Those with a family income below &#8364;10,000 will be entitled to 
monthly assistance of &#8364;200 per month. Nevertheless, he is of the view that this may be 
insufficient to protect the individuals concerned and their dependants from falling into 
poverty. It should be noted that the number of people living in jobless households increased 
from around 600,000 in 2009 to about 1.48 million during the first quarter of 2013, while 
the number of children living in such households grew even faster from 93,375 in 2009 to 
277,149 in the first quarter of 2013.57  
</p>
<p>54. Consecutive cuts have reduced pensions by up to 60 per cent (for higher pensions) 
and between 25 and 30 per cent for lower ones. The total monthly pension income in excess 
of &#8364;1,000 has been reduced by 5 to 15 per cent, while Christmas, Easter and summer 
bonuses for pensioners have been abolished. These wholesale pension cuts have pushed a 
large proportion of the population into poverty.  
</p>
<p>55. The Independent Expert shares the view of the European Committee of Social 
Rights that the &#8220;cumulative effect&#8221; of the various laws introduced as &#8220;austerity measures&#8221; 
in Greece since May 2010, restricting and reducing both public and private pension 
benefits, constituted a violation of the right to social security enshrined in article 12(3) of

likely to occasion &#8220;a significant degradation of the standard of living and the living 
conditions of many of the pensioners concerned&#8221;.59 It is therefore critical that the 
Government make efforts to ensure a sufficient level of protection for the most vulnerable 
sectors of the population.  
</p>
<p>56. In 2011 and 2012, several family benefits were abolished and replaced by a single 
means-tested family benefit provided according to family income.60 The new benefit 
amounts to &#8364;40 per month per child (with slightly higher benefits per child for families with 
three or more children). However, only families with an annual income under &#8364;18,000 are 
eligible.  
</p>
<p>57. While the changes to the family benefit system ensure that support is provided in a 
more targeted fashion to those in need, the Independent Expert is concerned that eligibility 
criteria are very strict and require (since February 2011) 10 years of permanent and 
continuous residence in Greece. This has the effect of excluding large numbers of 
immigrants, and needs to be addressed.  
</p>
<p>58. It is notable that, to date, Greece is the only euro zone member State without a 
comprehensive social assistance scheme serving as a social safety net of last resort. The 
Independent Expert is concerned that, rather than maintain or expand social security 
spending to mitigate the negative social impact of the adjustment programme, the initial 
mid-term fiscal strategy envisioned that social programmes (excluding pensions and health) 
would contribute 1.5 per cent of GDP to fiscal consolidation.  
</p>
<p>59. The Independent Expert welcomes the steps taken by the Government to enhance 
social protection, including, inter alia, a health voucher programme, which will provide 
100,000 long-term uninsured citizens with access to primary health-care services, and a 
review of the effectiveness of its income support programmes.61 Nonetheless, he urges the 
Government to extend coverage to all, including immigrants, in accordance with the human 
rights obligation of non-discrimination. He also urges the Government to ensure 
participation of affected individuals and communities, as well as civil society organizations, 
in the review, design and implementation of any proposed social protection measures.

<p>and health-care facilities, the reduction in the number of hospital beds and an increasing 
number of people losing public health insurance (mainly due to long-term unemployment)63 
has undermined the availability of and access to quality health care, particularly for the 
poorest. 
</p>
<p>61. Since 2010, Greece has reduced health-care spending significantly, to levels below 
the average in the European Union.64 Public health expenditure fell from 7.1 per cent of 
GDP in 2010 to 5.8 per cent in 2012, and was projected to drop to 5.3 per cent in 2013, well 
below the 6.3 per cent average for European Union member States. Overall, the health 
budget has been cut by about 40 per cent. 
</p>
<p>62. The austerity policies are also creating ancillary problems with serious health 
implications; for example, cuts to public health spending have meant that diseases thought 
to have long been eradicated in the country, such as malaria, have resurfaced owing to the 
discontinuation of anti-mosquito spraying programmes.65  
</p>
<p>63. A 52 per cent increase in HIV infections was reported from 2010 to 2011.66 Reports 
indicate that, although initially blamed on sex workers and irregular migrants, the outbreak 
was mainly due to unsafe injecting practices among drug addicts, especially desperate 
young Greeks facing unemployment who had turned to drugs.67  
</p>
<p>64. The Independent Expert is concerned that, in response to the above situation, the 
authorities issued a directive (Health Regulation No. GY/39A) in April 2012, which 
allowed the Health Department to forcibly test anyone for certain infectious diseases, 
including influenza, tuberculosis, polio, hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases, 
including HIV. The Independent Expert is also concerned that Regulation No. GY/39A was 
reinstated on 26 June 2013 only a few months after it was repealed.68 
</p>
<p>65. It should be noted that the detention of persons for the purposes of forcibly testing 
them for HIV violates the right to security of the person (International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, art. 9), as well as the International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and 
Human Rights.69 Furthermore, the publication of sensitive personal and medical data, such 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>introduced for all persons insured with EOPYY, in tandem with a 25 per cent co-payment for a range 
of prosthetic devices, orthopaedic materials and respiratory devices. Law 4093/2012 introduced a &#8364;25 
patient admission fee at public hospitals and a fee of &#8364;1 for each prescription issued by the national 
health-care system as of 1 January 2014. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>63
  At the beginning of the crisis, it was estimated that 85 per cent of the population had public health 
</p>
<p>insurance. An increasing number of people have, however, lost insurance cover owing to long-term 
unemployment.

 Within the first two years of austerity, the total expenditure of the Ministry of Health fell by &#8364;1.8

<p>as the HIV status of persons, by the Hellenic Police and local media violates the rights to 
privacy (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 17) and the 
confidentiality of personal health information (International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, art. 12).  
</p><p>66. There has also been a rise in mental health problems. Suicides have risen by 37 per 
cent since the onset of the debt crisis (from 677 in 2009 to 927 in 2011).70 According to 
some studies, the rise in suicides and suicide attempts can, to a large extent, be attributed to 
the financial and social strain imposed on individuals by the economic crisis.71  
</p>
<p>67. In the context of severely reduced access to the public health-care system, there has 
been an increase in the number of community clinics serving a population unable to afford 
health insurance, nor pay for treatment and medicines. More and more Greek citizens are 
turning to these clinics, which were initially established to help immigrant communities, are 
staffed by volunteer doctors and nurses and provide free services and medicines (which are 
donated). 
</p><p>68. Access to medicines has also become a problem. In February 2013, more than 200 
medical products were in short supply at hospitals and pharmacies, including drugs for 
arthritis, hepatitis C and hypertension, cholesterol-lowering agents, antipsychotics and 
antibiotics.72 The introduction of co-payments has compounded the problem, since many 
patients cannot afford, in the context of severe austerity, to pay for their medication.  
</p>
<p>69. In June 2013, the National Organization for Health-care Provision (EOPYY) started 
to hand out free medicines to about 50,000 unemployed and uninsured persons through a 
network of &#8220;social&#8221; pharmacies located in Attica.73 The Independent Expert welcomes this 
initiative, but is of the view that the programme needs to be significantly expanded in 
volume and geographical scope so as to ensure affordable access to medicines by all that 
need them. 
</p>
<p>70. The reforms have also restricted access to health care for undocumented migrants. 
Although in theory they have access to free health-care services in cases of emergency or if 
there is a risk to their life, in practice such access cannot be assured since it is at the 
discretion of medical personnel. Moreover, an official directive issued on 2 May 2012 
(amending the Law 3386/2005, &#167;84) states clearly that public services, public corporate 
bodies, local authorities and social security institutions do not have to provide services to 
undocumented third-country nationals, except in an emergency.74

<p>71. The Independent Expert acknowledges the need for reform of the Greek health-care 
system. Nevertheless, he considers that the massive cuts to public funding to the health 
sector and the introduction of user fees, which have resulted in a large section of the 
population being unable to enjoy the minimum essential levels of the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health, as enshrined in article 12 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, constitute retrogressive measures. He underscores 
that health is an important condition for the individual&#8217;s well-being and dignity.75 Greece 
therefore has an obligation to establish conditions under which the health of all individuals 
can be protected and promoted. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Education 
</b></p>
<p>72. Annual public spending on education was cut from &#8364;7.23 billion in 2009 to &#8364;5.84 
billion in 2013, a reduction of 30 per cent. The education budget has been reduced by 
cutting government spending on human resources, as well through drastic cuts in daily 
operational and maintenance costs for schools and costs for purchasing educational 
material. These expenditures were reduced by 24 per cent in 2011 and by a further 19 per 
cent in 2012.76 
</p>
<p>73. As part of austerity, between school years 2009-2010 and 2013-2014, approximately 
(14.5 per cent of all school units of primary education (including pre-primary schools) and 
4 per cent of school units in secondary education have been merged. The closure of schools 
has in certain instances significantly increased the distance for children to reach school, and 
limited access and increased school drop-out rates, especially among Roma children, 
remain a concern.77 
</p>
<p>74. In addition, the number of secondary school teachers has been reduced, , mainly 
through retirement and restrictions placed on new recruitments from mid-2010, in particular 
for the school year 2012-13 by about 11 per cent. It is planned that 2,500 more teachers will 
be placed in the mobility scheme and may eventually be retrenched. The salaries of teachers 
in public schools have also been cut.  
</p>
<p>75. According to the Ministry of Education, however, these funding cuts have not 
resulted in a deterioration of the right to education as many teachers will been reassigned 
according to need. Nonetheless, the Independent Expert considers that these cuts in a very 
short time cannot realistically be absorbed without any negative impact on the quality of 
public education.78  
</p>
<p><b> E. Adequate housing  
</b></p>
<p>76. As a result of the recession and the adjustment programme, there has been an 
increase in homelessness since 2009, estimated at 25 per cent. Non-governmental 
organizations estimate that at least 20,000 people are now homeless. Many of the &#8220;neo-

</p>
<p>homeless&#8221; are relatively well-educated who have found themselves in this situation owing 
to the financial difficulties occasioned by loss of employment and benefits.  
</p>
<p>77. As part of the fiscal consolidation, the Workers&#8217; Housing Organization, the only 
major institution providing housing benefits, was abolished in February 2012 and its 
competences transferred to the Manpower Employment Organization. The Workers&#8217; 
Housing Organization had provided, inter alia, a rental subsidy to nearly 120,000 
households and housing benefits for non-insured elderly persons.79  
</p>
<p>78. At the same time, reductions in social service budgets have severely affected the 
ability of support services to provide assistance to the homeless at a time when they were 
already struggling to meet the increasing demand. For example, in November 2010, 61 of 
the 85 staff members at the City of Athens Homeless Foundation were laid off, greatly 
reducing the services that could be provided.80 
</p>
<p>79. In 2009, the Government took measures to protect low- and middle-income 
homeowners unable to service their mortgages from bank foreclosures. To this end, the 
Government imposed a ban on banks from repossessing primary residences worth up to 
&#8364;200,000. The Independent Expert understands, however, that the State&#8217;s international 
lenders have pressed the Government to end the ban. He calls upon these lenders to avoid 
prescribing policy actions that may undermine Greece&#8217;s international human rights 
obligations, including the right to adequate housing.  
</p>
<p>80. The Independent Expert shares the concern expressed by the Special Rapporteur on 
the right to adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, 
and on the right to non-discrimination in this context that the phasing out of housing 
subsidies, changes to the legal protection against evictions and the emergency property tax 
have had a detrimental impact on the realization of the right to adequate housing for the 
poorest and most marginalized segments of society.81 He calls upon the Greek authorities to 
introduce a comprehensive means-tested housing benefit targeted at the poor and their 
families, to close the social protection gap in the area of housing exacerbated by the 
dissolution of the Workers&#8217; Housing Organization. It should be noted that housing, like 
employment, is an important guarantor of human dignity. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Poverty and social exclusion 
</b></p>
<p>81. Although Greece already had the highest poverty rate in the euro zone prior to 2009, 
the austerity measures, particularly job redundancies and cuts to wages and benefits, have 
pushed even more people into poverty. Approximately 11 per cent of the population is 
living in extreme poverty.82 These poverty levels have contributed to increasing inequality 
and social exclusion.  
</p>
<p>82. According to a study by the Athens University of Economics and Business and 
University of Essex, the relative poverty rate (namely, the percentage of persons having less 
than 60 per cent of the median income at their disposal) increased from 20 per cent in 2009

<p>to 21.29 per cent in 2012.83 In particular, the unemployed (relative poverty rate of 41.08 per 
cent) and many children (26.75 per cent) have dropped under the relative poverty threshold. 
Data from the Hellenic Statistics Authority for 2011 indicating that 44 per cent of all 
unemployed have fallen under the poverty threshold confirm this trend. It should be noted 
that single parent households with children face a similar risk of poverty (rate of 43.2 per 
cent).84  
</p><p>83. Income inequality has also increased. Overall, the Gini index, taking values from 0 
(total equality) to 1 (total inequality), moved from 0.3449 in 2009 to 0.3678 in 2012.85 
Although the austerity measures included elements requiring a greater contribution to the 
fiscal savings by the more affluent, the adjustment has nevertheless further reduced the 
income of population groups that were already at the bottom of income distribution in 2009, 
thus exacerbating their poverty. People in the lowest income decile lost 24.2 per cent of 
their pre-crisis income between 2009 and 2012. If income deciles are adjusted on the basis 
of the 2012 income distribution, the income loss of the poorest 10 per cent of the population 
rises to an alarming 56.5 per cent.86  
</p>
<p>84. It is difficult to isolate the distributive effects of the austerity policies from the wider 
recession, as both are closely connected. Experts nevertheless conclude that the 63.3 per 
cent of the population that found itself below the fixed poverty line in 2010 and 2011 did so 
as a consequence of austerity policies alone &#8211; meaning they can be directly attributed to 
changes imposed by taxation, and wage and social benefit cuts. They also note that the 
sharp rise in poverty and inequality was mostly due to the large drop in the income share of 
the poorest 10 per cent of the population.87 
</p>
<p><b> G. Other rights 
</b></p>
<p>85. The negative impact of the adjustment programme extends to civil and political 
rights; for example, the widespread public protests held against the harsh austerity measures 
were reportedly dealt with in a heavy-handed manner by the authorities.88 In May 2013, the 
Government invoked national emergency legislation allowing it to compel public sector 
employees to work to ban a planned strike by the National Union for High School Teachers 
against austerity measures during university entrance examinations. The Government 
argued that the measure was necessary to prevent a severe disturbance to the social and 
financial life of the country and to safeguard public order, as well as the health of 
prospective university students.  
</p>
<p>86. The Independent Expert considers, however, that such responses are 
disproportionate and may violate the freedoms of assembly and association, which are also 
guaranteed in the Constitution.

<p>87. There has also been a rise in hate crimes and xenophobia against the country&#8217;s 
immigrant community, largely targeted in an attempt to find  a scapegoat for the crisis.89 In 
April 2013, UNHCR, the National Commission for Human Rights and a coalition of 30 
non-governmental organizations documented 154 incidents of racist violence in 2012 alone, 
of which 151 committed against refugees and migrants and three against European citizens. 
It is believed that most attacks were committed by members of extremist groups, and that 
only a fraction of all cases are actually documented.90

<p>88. The Independent Expert is concerned at reports of the failure of the police to protect 
victims or to respond to such attacks and to investigate them diligently.91 He welcomes the 
establishment of 70 anti-racist police units throughout the country and the appointment of a 
special prosecutor responsible for the coordination and proper investigation of racist crimes 
by the prosecuting authorities as an important step to combat such incidents. He also 
welcomes the submission to the Hellenic Parliament on 20 November 2013 of a new law 
aimed at combatting racism and xenophobia (Amendment of law 927/1979). 
</p><p>89. Lastly, the enjoyment of human rights has been further undermined by the limited 
ability of public accountability bodies, such as the Greek Ombudsman and the National 
Commission for Human Rights, to respond adequately to human rights issues in the context 
of the economic crisis owing to insufficient funding for operations. Other barriers to access 
to justice include lengthy proceedings before civil and administrative courts, higher fees for 
initiating legal proceedings and inadequate funding for legal aid.92 The Independent Expert 
urges the Government of Greece to address these challenges as a matter of urgency and 
notes in this context that, on 12 February 2014, the Hellenic Parliament adopted a new law 
(4239/2014) aimed at providing fair satisfaction for exceeding the reasonable duration of 
proceedings in civil and criminal courts and in the Court of Audit.

<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> The adjustment programme and, in particular, the excessively rigid austerity 
measures implemented since May 2010 have exacted substantial economic and social 
costs for the Greek population. The programme has pushed the economy into 
recession, compromised the standard of living of the majority of the population and 
generally undermined the enjoyment of human rights in Greece. A large proportion of 
bailout loans has been used to pay off the banks that lent money recklessly to Greece, 
while increasing the country&#8217;s debt. Regrettably, the role of the State as provider of 
accessible public services has been subordinated to the increasingly elusive goal of 
restoring a sustainable public budget.

<p><b>  </b>91.<b> On the basis of the findings set out in this report, the Independent Expert 
makes the recommendations below.   
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Government of Greece 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b>  The Independent Expert recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Implement its international financial obligations, including those under 
the adjustment programme, without resorting to further public spending cuts and 
other austerity measures that may undermine the realization of economic, social and 
cultural rights in the country; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure that it preserves sufficient resources to enable it utilize its 
&#8220;maximum available resources&#8221; for the realization of all human rights and, in 
particular, to ensure the enjoyment of the minimum essential levels of economic and 
social rights in line with its international obligations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Conduct an independent, transparent and participatory audit of its debt 
in order to determine its origins and to identify and to hold to account those found 
responsible for the debt;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Conduct human rights impact assessments to identify the potential 
negative impact of the adjustment programme and the necessary policies to address it; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e)  Intensify its efforts to combat tax avoidance and evasion and, in 
particular, to improve collection of outstanding tax debts;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Urgently devote sufficient resources to close gaps in the social protection 
system; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Consider expanding existing programmes aimed at addressing 
unemployment, particular among youth, through training and proactive labour 
policies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h)  Increase the minimum wage (after taxes) as soon as possible to levels 
above the poverty threshold;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Consider expanding the means-tested guaranteed minimum income

welfare safety net, in accordance with ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 
2012 (No. 202);  
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Urgently repeal or adjust any austerity measures that have had a 
regressive impact on income distribution; 
</b></p>

and address the drop-out of persons from medical insurance owing to long-term 
unemployment or other reasons;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Repeal as a matter of urgency Health Regulation No. GY/39A;  
(m) Reconsider the reform measures that have had a negative impact on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to education, particularly for members of vulnerable groups;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(n)</b> <b>Enhance support for homeless persons and increase efforts to prevent 
further homelessness; consider establishing a housing benefit for low-income 
households to fill the gap caused by the closure of the Workers&#8217; Housing 
Organization, and continue protection of low-income homeowners and their families </b></p>

for Human Rights to curb the increase in racist attacks and xenophobic violence; and 
continue to take decisive measures to combat violent extremism in accordance with 
international human rights law;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (p) Consider ratifying core international human rights treaties to which the 
State is not yet a party, in particular, the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</b>. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. International lenders  
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> The Independent Expert calls upon the country&#8217;s international lenders: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To avoid providing financial assistance with intrusive and onerous policy 
conditions that may undermine the country&#8217;s growth prospects and the realization of 
all human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b)  To support the undertaking by the Government of Greece to conduct an 
independent, transparent and participatory audit of the State&#8217;s public debt;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c)  To consider a further reduction of the public debt of Greece, including a 
write-down of Greek bonds held by the European Central Bank, to allow the country 
to reduce its debt to a more sustainable level as defined in the present report; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d)  To include the reduction of unemployment and poverty as measurable 
targets in the ongoing adjustment programme, and to monitor progress regularly;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) To ensure transparency in their dealings with the Government of Greece 
in a manner that fully respects the rights of the people of Greece, including the right 
to public participation;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) With particular reference to IMF, to ensure that debt sustainability 
assessments take into consideration the other demands on the Government&#8217;s available 
resources, particularly those required for social investment and establishment of the 
conditions for the full realization of all human rights, particularly economic, social 
and cultural rights;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g)  To consider preparing a new adjustment programme for Greece with 
better conditions that will allow it to address its deficit and debt problems without 
undermining the enjoyment of human rights.
