<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its sixth session from 30 
November to 11 December 2009. The review of the Democratic Republic of the Congo was 
held at the 7th meeting, on 3 December 2009. The delegation of the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo was headed by H.E. Mr. Upio Kakura Wapol, Minister of Human Rights. At 
its 11th meeting, held on 7 December 2009, the Working Group adopted the present report 
on the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the Democratic Republic of the Congo: 
Gabon, Japan and Slovenia. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of the Democratic Republic of the Congo: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/COD/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/COD/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/COD/3).  
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, Belgium; Canada, the Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Hungary; Latvia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands was transmitted to the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo through the troika. These questions are available on the Extranet of the UPR 
Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Congolese delegation introduced the national report, which was the product of 
broad consultations, notably with civil society, and replied to the questions put in advance 
by States. The delegation said that the Democratic Republic of the Congo had ratified 
numerous instruments for the protection of civil and political, economic, social and cultural 
rights, and was determined to implement them. Its efforts were being held back, however, 
by the recurring armed conflicts raging mainly in the east of the country, with the 
involvement of several external actors. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation noted that, in many cases, documents on the human rights situation 
tended to give an incomplete rendering of some of the facts and omitted &#8212; often 
deliberately &#8212; to report the noteworthy efforts made by the Government to improve the 
promotion and protection of rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p>7. According to the delegation, the framework for the protection and extension of 
human rights currently comprised the 18 February 2006 Constitution, which gave 
constitutional status to the majority of rights and made them fundamental values (notably 
the right to life and the prohibition of torture); various international and regional 
instruments, duly ratified; and the body of legislation, which included in particular a 
number of laws recently promulgated by the President on sexual violence, the status of </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-10154 
</p>
<p>opposition parties, the protection of children and the rights of persons living with or 
affected by HIV/AIDS, and the High Council of the Judiciary. 
</p>
<p>8. As to the establishment of effective structures for the protection of human rights, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo had honoured its undertaking, made at the end of the 
tenth ordinary session of the Human Rights Council, by establishing on 12 August 2009 the 
&#8220;Entit&#233; de Liaison des Droits de l&#8217;Homme&#8221; (Human Rights Liaison Unit), a mechanism 
comprising various stakeholders whose task was to study the underlying causes of human 
rights violations and propose appropriate solutions. Human rights consultative bodies were 
also planned at the provincial level. In addition, the bill on the creation of a national human 
rights commission in accordance with the Paris Principles was before Parliament. The 
Government was making efforts to ensure that the necessary resources were allocated to 
those mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>9. The Democratic Republic of the Congo had created a national agency to combat 
violence against women and girls, which was being made operational. Synergies at the 
provincial level were also very active in efforts to combat impunity for sexual violence. 
According to the delegation, there were no reliable global statistics on sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation said that the shortcomings in support for the victims of sexual 
violence were due in part to the fact that some victims did not report incidents and also to 
the scarcity of available resources. The two laws on sexual violence enacted in 2006 were 
already being applied, and several convictions had been handed down by both civil and 
military courts. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation welcomed the creation of the National Fund for the Advancement of 
Women and the Protection of Children in October 2009, the first State fund specifically for 
women and children since independence. 
</p>
<p>12. As to the use of child soldiers and violence against children, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo had a national policy to combat the recruitment of child soldiers, 
spearheaded by the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme 
implementation unit, and was committed to making those responsible for child recruitment, 
the sale of children, trafficking in children and any other form of exploitation of children 
answer for their actions in court. Various activities were being organized to help such 
children reintegrate. 
</p>
<p>13. The delegation said that combating impunity was a priority and was characterized by 
a zero tolerance policy. Disciplinary and criminal sanctions were imposed at various levels. 
The Democratic Republic of the Congo confirmed its firm intention to continue cooperating 
with the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>14. With regard to the establishment of a transitional justice system for crimes 
committed between 1993 and 2003, the Democratic Republic of the Congo stated that it 
intended to make use of the outcome of the mapping exercise conducted by the United 
Nations. 
</p>
<p>15. With regard to human rights violations committed by the Armed Forces of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC), internal verification mechanisms within 
FARDC facilitated the identification of officers who violated human rights, and the 
imposition of disciplinary or judicial penalties. 
</p><p>16. As to the fight against corruption, the delegation said that penalties were imposed on 
all who were found guilty. In addition, the High Council of the Judiciary monitored judges&#8217; 
ethical standards and could propose dismissal for those who failed to comply. 
</p>
<p>17. According to the delegation, human rights defenders were expected to work within 
the legal and regulatory framework that governed the life of the country and the </p>


<p>GE.10-10154 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Government had expressed its willingness to work towards implementation of a special 
framework for the protection of human rights defenders setting forth rights and obligations 
in accordance with the 1998 Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. Journalists and 
human rights defenders whose rights had been violated were urged to take judicial action. 
There was a regular framework for consultation and dialogue between the Government and 
civil society. 
</p>
<p>18. As to the abolition of the death penalty, the delegation stated that under the 
Constitution the death penalty had been abolished. A bill amending the Criminal Code to 
explicitly repeal the death penalty was before the National Assembly. No death sentence 
had been carried out for over seven years. 
</p>
<p>19. With regard to the reform of the army and the police, draft legislation had been 
debated in plenary and was being aligned in committee. 
</p>
<p>20. The reform of the Criminal Code was under way, as was the prison system reform. 
Provincial governments had been delegated responsibility for managing the situation in 
prisons. With assistance from its partners, the Government had begun building new prisons 
and setting up prison farms. 
</p>
<p>21. Access to persons subject to administrative detention measures, under judicial 
supervision, did not present any problem when procedures were followed. The difficulties 
met would be discussed in the &#8220;Entit&#233; de Liaison des Droits de l&#8217;Homme&#8221; at the national 
and provincial levels. 
</p>
<p>22. According to the delegation, press freedom was guaranteed in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo and was administered in accordance with the law. As to the isolated 
(not systematic) cases of murders of journalists, which the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo condemned, it was up to the judicial system, which was independent, to do its work 
properly. 
</p>
<p>23. With regard to the improvement of economic and social rights, the delegation 
emphasized that employment, housing, health, education, and water and electricity were the 
priorities that formed the focus of the Government&#8217;s action under its &#8220;five priorities&#8221; drive 
and the growth and poverty-reduction strategy.  
</p>
<p>24. The Democratic Republic of the Congo urged the international community to 
support its efforts to reach completion point in the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) 
initiative, which would enable it to cancel its debt in mid-2010 and thus better promote 
human rights.  
</p>
<p>25. With regard to rational management of natural resources, the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo was making efforts to regulate the sector through a policy of transparency and 
was renegotiating mining contracts with due regard for the mining code and regulations. A 
similar process was under way with the conversion of titles to forest land in consultation 
with the indigenous and local populations. 
</p>
<p>26. The Democratic Republic of the Congo was now formally cooperating with seven 
special procedures and was open to any other special rapporteurs who so requested, as with 
the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, who had recently 
visited the country, and the independent expert on the effects of economic reform policies 
and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights, who was to be invited during 
</p><p>2010. 
</p>
<p>27. The delegation urged the international community to continue its assistance to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo for the full restoration of peace in the country, to 
mobilize more resources and to integrate human rights concerns in all cooperation 
initiatives. </p>
