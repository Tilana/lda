EAGLE SECOND QUARTER REPORT 2016
Eagle Energy Inc.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (unaudited)
For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015  
 
(in Canadian dollars)
1.
Reporting Entity / Structure of Eagle Energy Inc.
On January 27, 2016, Eagle Energy Trust (the “Trust”) closed the plan of arrangement (the “Arrangement”) involving 
the acquisition by way of share exchange, of Maple Leaf Royalties Corp. (“Maple Leaf”) and conversion of the Trust 
into a corporate structure.  The resulting public entity, named Eagle Energy Inc. (“Eagle”), is listed on the Toronto 
Stock Exchange with its common shares trading under the symbol “EGL”.  Pursuant to the Arrangement, the Trust’s 
units  were  exchanged  indirectly  for  Eagle  common  shares  on  a  one-for-one  basis,  which  resulted  in  34,863,364 
common shares of Eagle being issued.  In addition, Eagle acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares 
of Maple Leaf on the basis of 0.0947 of a common share of Eagle being issued for each outstanding common share 
of  Maple  Leaf,  which  resulted  in  7,141,815  common  shares  of  Eagle  being  issued.    Refer  to  note  6  “Business 
Combination”.    After  the  Arrangement,  former  unitholders  of  the  Trust  held  approximately  82%  of  the  42,451,623 
outstanding common  shares of  Eagle.    Concurrently,  with the  approval of  the  Arrangement,  the  unitholders  of  the 
Trust and the shareholders of Maple Leaf approved the adoption by Eagle of a new long-term equity compensation 
incentive plan for Eagle’s directors, officers, employees and consultants.  Refer to note 8 “Share-based Payments”.  
Holders of options to purchase Trust units had their option agreements adjusted to entitle them to purchase shares of 
Eagle on identical terms and conditions.  All outstanding options to purchase shares of Maple Leaf were terminated.
Throughout these notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements, Eagle and its subsidiaries are 
referred to collectively as the “Company” or “Eagle” for purposes of convenience.
Liquidity
Refer to note 15 “Debt”.  At June 30, 2016, the Company had a $64.4 million working capital deficit, which excludes 
the $2.3 million risk management asset and the $2.3 million risk management liability, but includes the $66.9 million 
drawn on its $CA 70 million credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of Canadian banks.  The 
amount drawn on the Credit Agreement is included in current liabilities because the May 27, 2017 maturity date of the 
Credit Agreement falls within 12 months of the June 30, 2016 balance sheet date.  This Credit Agreement maturity 
date represents the date (the “commitment termination date”) through which the syndicate of Canadian bank lenders 
are obligated under the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement to make advances to Eagle up to the 
authorized borrowing base amount in effect from time to time.  The Credit Agreement continues to be subject to semi-
annual (November and May) redeterminations of the borrowing base by the lenders.  In the event that, prior to May 
27, 2017:  (i) Eagle and its syndicate of Canadian bank lenders have not amended the Credit Agreement to reflect a 
later  maturity  date,  or;  (ii)  Eagle  does  not  repay  amounts  outstanding  under  the  existing  Credit  Agreement  by 
refinancing with a new credit agreement (which may or may not include some of the existing syndicate of Canadian 
bank lenders), the Credit Agreement instructs that Eagle shall repay all outstanding principal and accrued interest 
amounts  on  May  27,  2017.   Since  Eagle currently  estimates  the  present  value  of its  proved  developed  producing 
reserves  (the reserves category  primarily  used  by  lenders when  determining  borrowing base  levels)  discounted at 
10% and using mid-July 2016 forward pricing assumptions to be in excess of its current $CA 70 million authorized 
borrowing base by approximately 50%, Eagle anticipates that it is likely that either a refinancing or an amendment to 
extend the maturity date will occur prior to May 27, 2017.  However, there is no assurance that such refinancing will 
be  successful.    Eagle  actively  manages  its  liquidity  through  cash,  debt  and  equity  management  strategies.    Such 
strategies  include  continuously  monitoring  forecast  and  actual  cash  flows  from  operating,  financing  and  investing 
activities, available credit under existing banking arrangements and opportunities to refinance existing first-lien debt, 
issue subordinated debt or issue additional common shares.  Cash flow forecasts show sufficient cash flows from 
operating  activities  to  fund  operations  and  service  the  amounts  currently  drawn,  or  expected  to  be  drawn,  on  the 
Credit  Agreement.    In  addition,  Eagle  has  concluded,  through  discussions  with  various  lenders,  it  is  likely  that  a 
refinancing  could  occur  prior  to  the  May  27,  2017  maturity  date  of  the  Credit  Agreement  since  Eagle’s  current 
estimate of the present value of its proved developed producing reserves (the reserves category primarily used by 
lenders  when  determining  borrowing  base  levels)  discounted  at  10%  and  using  mid-July  2016  forward  pricing 
assumptions exceeds Eagle’s $CA 70 million borrowing base by approximately 50%.
The next semi-annual borrowing base redetermination is scheduled to be finalized no later than November 30, 2016 
and will be conducted based on the lenders’ price forecasts then in effect.  Current and forward crude oil prices have
5
EAGLE SECOND QUARTER REPORT 2016
recovered from their lows in early February 2016 (which also corresponded to the time when lenders perform year 
end borrowing base reviews) and Eagle anticipates that a rebound in oil price levels will be incorporated into lenders’ 
borrowing base redeterminations affording Eagle increased liquidity and flexibility.
Eagle  intends  to  pay  dividends  to  shareholders  from  a  portion  of  its  available  cash  and  use  the  remainder  of  its 
available cash to reinvest to fund growth through acquisitions and capital expenditures.  Cash flow is provided from 
properties owned directly by Eagle and indirectly by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eagle Hydrocarbons Inc.  On May 
31, 2016, a new covenant was added to Eagle’s Credit Agreement that restricts Eagle from paying dividends in an 
amount that exceeds $0.005 (half a cent) per share per month, beginning with the dividend declared in July 2016 
(which is payable in August 2016) and ending with any dividend that may be declared in June 2017 (which would be 
payable  in  July  2017).    In  addition,  the  Credit  Agreement  contains  a  covenant  that  restricts  Eagle  from  paying 
dividends  to  its  shareholders  if  any  default,  event  of  default  or  borrowing  base  deficiency  has  occurred  and  is 
continuing or would result from such dividend, or if the cash dividend payments made for the trailing four quarters 
exceeds the Available Distributable Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement).  At June 30, 2016, there were 
no  covenant  violations  under  or  in  connection  with  the  Credit  Agreement.    In  addition,  it  is  likely  that  either  a 
refinancing or an amendment to extend the maturity date will occur prior to the May 27, 2017 maturity date of the 
Credit Agreement.  There can be no assurance, however, that such refinancing or extension will be successful, and 
dividends would be curtailed in those circumstances.
The address of Eagle is: Suite 2710, 500-4th Avenue SW, Calgary, AB T2P 2V6.
2.1.  Basis of Preparation
The foreign exchange rate at June 30, 2016 was $US 1.00 equal to $CA 1.29 (December 31, 2015 - $US 1.00 equal 
to $CA 1.38), and the average foreign exchange rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $US 1.00 equal to 
$CA 1.1.33 (for the six months ended June 30, 2015 - $US 1.00 equal to $CA 1.24).
Basis of Accounting
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue in accordance with a resolution of 
the Board of Directors made on August 4, 2016.
These  condensed  consolidated  interim  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International 
Financial  Reporting  Standards  (“IFRS”)  as  issued  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“IASB”) 
applicable to the preparation of interim financial statements, including IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting and have 
been prepared following the same accounting policies as the annual audited IFRS consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended December 31, 2015, except for income tax expense for an interim period (which is based on an 
estimated average annual effective income tax rate) and accounting policies adopted as a result of the conversion of 
the  Trust  into  a  corporate  structure  (refer  to  note  2.2  “Changes  in  Accounting  Policy  and  Disclosures”).    The 
condensed  consolidated  interim  financial  statements  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  annual  audited 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, which have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as issued by the IASB.  When reading prior financial statements, references to “unit” or “units” should now 
be read to refer to “share” or “shares” as a result of the conversion of the Trust into a corporate structure on January 
27, 2016.
2.2.  Changes in Accounting Policy and Disclosures
Other than the accounting policies below, which have been adopted as a result of the conversion of the Trust into a 
corporate structure, the accounting policies followed in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are 
consistent with those of the previous financial year.
Share-based Compensation
The Company’s share-based compensation program consists of:  (i) a new long-term equity compensation incentive 
plan which was implemented following the closing of the Arrangement; (ii) a share option plan which was previously 
in  place  (and  has  been  adjusted  to  entitle  holders  of  options  to  purchase  shares  of  Eagle  on  identical  terms  and 
conditions);  and,  (iii)  restricted  unit  rights  agreements  which  were  previously  in  place  (and  have  been  adjusted  to 
entitle holders to identical rights, terms and conditions).
(i)  New long-term equity compensation incentive plan:  Under this equity-settled plan, the Company has issued time-
based restricted share units (“RSUs”) and performance-based performance share units (“PSUs”) to directors officers 
and  employees  of  the  Company.    The  PSUs  have  been  granted  with  a  performance  multiplier.    This  multiplier, 
ranging from zero to two, will be applied at vesting and is dependent on the performance of the Company relative to
6
EAGLE SECOND QUARTER REPORT 2016
pre-defined corporate performance measures for a particular period at the Board of Director’s discretion.  The RSUs 
and PSUs are accounted for using the fair-value method.  With respect to the RSUs, the fair value of the RSUs is 
estimated at the date of grant using the trading price of the underlying shares of Eagle on the relevant valuation date.  
With respect to the PSUs, since the performance conditions attached to the PSUs are not specifically measurable, 
the PSUs that have been issued are not considered granted in accordance with the definition of grant in IFRS 2.  As a 
result, the fair value of the PSUs are determined at each reporting period and at the date of settlement based on 
either the closing trading price for the shares of Eagle on the TSX multiplied by an estimated payout multiplier for the 
number  of  PSUs  expected  to  vest  (in  the  case  of  valuation  at  each  reporting  period,  and  with  the  Black-Scholes 
option pricing model yielding a similar fair value) or based on the actual Fair Market Value (defined as the volume 
weighted  average  trading  price  for  the  shares  of  Eagle  on  the  TSX  for  the  five  days  on  which  the  shares  traded 
preceding the date of reference) and actual payout multiplier applied to the number of PSUs vested.  As a result of 
revaluing  the  PSUs  each  reporting  period,  fluctuations  in  compensation  expense  may  occur  due  to  the  re-
measurement of the value of the shares as well as changes in estimating the outcome of the performance conditions 
(i.e. the performance multiplier).  The fair value thus established is recognized as compensation expense on a graded 
basis over the settlement period of the RSUs or PSUs with an equivalent increase to contributed surplus.  A forfeiture 
rate  is  estimated  on  the  grant  date  and  is  subsequently  adjusted  to  reflect  the  actual  number  of  RSUs  or  PSUs 
settled.  All RSUs and PSUs are equity settled.
(ii)  Share option plan that was previously in place:  Under this plan, formerly referred to as a unit option plan, the 
Trust, as the predecessor reporting issuer to Eagle, had issued options to directors, officers and employees of the 
Company.    These  options  are  accounted  for  using  the  fair-value method  which  estimates  the  value of  the  options 
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  A forfeiture rate is estimated on the valuation.  Consistent with their 
treatment  prior  to the conversion  of  the  Trust  into  a corporate  structure,  they  are  treated  similar  to  a cash  settled 
stock-based compensation arrangement, with the associated liability being fair-valued at the end of each reporting 
period and the corresponding change to fair value being recognized in the income statement.  Effective June 9, 2016, 
all  holders  of  options  outstanding  under  this  plan  agreed  to  a  voluntary  cancellation  of  options  and  the  plan  was 
terminated.
(iii)  Existing restricted unit rights agreements:  Under these cash settled agreements, the Trust had issued restricted 
unit rights (“RURs”) to directors, officers and employees of the Company.  The RURs are accounted for using the fair-
value  method  which  estimates  their  value  using  the  Black-Scholes  model.    The  RURs  are  a  cash  settled 
compensation arrangement and, consistent with their treatment prior to the conversion of the Trust into a corporate 
structure, the associated liability is fair-valued at the end of each reporting period and the corresponding change to 
fair  value  is  recognized  in  the  income  statement.    When  a  cash  payment  is  made,  the  liability  is  reduced  with  a 
resulting  reduction  in  cash  provided  by  operating  activities.    The  Company  does  not  intend  to issue  further  RURs 
under this plan.
Taxation
Prior to the Arrangement (refer to note 1 “Reporting Entity / Structure of Eagle Energy Inc.”), business was conducted 
through a trust structure with the Trust having indirect Canadian and U.S. subsidiaries.  The Trust was considered a 
SIFT Trust as described in the annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 
2015.  Pursuant to the Arrangement, Eagle converted into a corporate structure with all Canadian oil and gas assets 
held in Eagle.  Eagle will be taxed in the same manner as other Canadian oil and gas corporations, including being 
subject to Canadian federal income tax to the extent that taxable income cannot be reduced by claiming permitted 
deductions  (such  as  wages  and  other  employment  expenses,  interest  payments,  various  Canadian  resource 
expenditures and certain capital expenditures).
Also  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement,  Eagle  Hydrocarbons  Inc.,  the  U.S.  operating  subsidiary,  became  an  indirect 
subsidiary of Eagle.  There is no change to the taxation of the U.S. indirect subsidiary from how it was described in 
the annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year December 31, 2015.
As a corporate structure, payments, if any, made by Eagle to shareholders will be in the form of dividends instead of 
distributions to unitholders of a trust.
Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations
Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements clarify that the acquirer of an interest in a joint operation in which the 
activity constitutes a business is required to apply all of the principles of business combinations accounting in IFRS 3 
Business Combinations in the event of an increase or decrease in ownership share in an existing joint operation or an 
investment in a new joint operation.

EAGLE SECOND QUARTER REPORT 2016
Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
Amendments  have  been  issued  to  address  an  inconsistency  between  the  requirements  in  IFRS  10  Consolidated 
Financial Statements and those in International Accounting Standard (IAS) 28 Investments in Associates and Joint 
Ventures  regarding  the  sale or  contribution  of assets  between  an  investor  and  its  associate  or  joint  venture.    The 
amendment clarified that a full gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves a business.  A partial gain or 
loss is recognized when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business.
Disclosure Initiative
Amendments have been issued to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to clarify existing requirements related 
to materiality, order of notes, subtotals, accounting policies and disaggregation which have not had a material impact 
on the Company's disclosure.
Accounting Pronouncements not yet Adopted
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In  May  2014,  the  IASB  issued  IFRS  15  Revenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers.    It  replaces  existing  revenue 
recognition  guidance  and  provides  a  single,  principles-based  five-step  model  to  be  applied  to  all  contracts  with 
customers.  Retrospective application of this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 
2018, with earlier application permitted.  The Company is assessing the impact of this standard.
Financial Instruments:  Recognition and Measurement
In July 2014, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued as a complete standard, including the requirements previously 
issued  related  to  classification  and  measurement  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities,  and  additional  amendments  to 
introduce  a  new  expected  loss  impairment  model  for  financial  assets  including  credit  losses.    Retrospective 
application  of  this  standard  with  certain  exemptions  is  effective  for  fiscal  years  beginning  on  or  about  January  1, 
2018, with earlier application permitted.  The Company is assessing the impact of this standard.
Leases
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases which replaces the existing leasing standard (IAS 17 Leases) and 
requires the recognition of most leases on the balance sheet.  IFRS 16 effectively removes the classification of leases 
as either finance or operating leases and treats all leases as finance leases for lessees with exemptions for short-
term leases where the term is twelve months or less and for leases of low value items.  The accounting treatment for 
lessors remains the same, which provides the choice of classifying a lease as either a finance or operating lease.  
IFRS 16 is effective January 1, 2019, with earlier application permitted.  The adoption of this standard could impact 
the  Company  as  it  enters  into  leases  which  would  currently  be  classified  as  operating  leases.    The  Company  is 
assessing the impact of this standard.
3.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments
Other than the critical accounting estimates and judgments below, which have been removed or adopted as a result 
of the conversion of the Trust into a corporate structure, the critical accounting estimates and judgments followed in 
these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are consistent with those of the previous financial year.  
Further information about Eagle’s critical accounting estimates and judgments can be found in the notes to Eagle’s 
annual audited consolidated financial statements and MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Classification of Trust Units as Equity
This no longer applies after January 27, 2016.
Share- Based Compensation
The  amount  of  compensation  expense  accrued  for  share-based  compensation  arrangements  is  subject  to 
Management’s  best  estimate.    For  both  the  RSUs  and  PSUs,  (refer  to  note  8  “Share-based  Payments”),  there  is 
uncertainty  as  to  what  the  share  price  will  be  when  the  RSUs  and  PSUs  are  ultimately  settled.    Since  the 
performance conditions attached to the PSUs are not specifically measureable, the PSUs that have been issued are 
not considered granted in accordance with the definition of grant in IFRS 2.  As a result, the fair value of the PSUs 
are  determined  at  each  reporting  period  based  on  the  closing  trading  price  for  the  shares  of  Eagle  on  the  TSX
8
EAGLE SECOND QUARTER REPORT 2016
multiplied by an estimated payout multiplier for the number of units expected to vest.  As a result of revaluing the 
PSUs  each  reporting  period,  fluctuations  in  compensation  expense  may  occur  due  to  the  re-measurement  of  the 
value of the shares as well as changes in estimating the outcome of the performance conditions (i.e. the performance 
multiplier).  The fair value is based on several assumptions and therefore is subject to measurement uncertainty.
4.
Financial Risk Management and Financial Instruments
Eagle’s  activities  expose  it  to  a  variety  of  financial  risks  that  arise  as  a  result  of  its  exploration,  development, 
production and financing activities such as:
•
•
liquidity risk;
credit risk; and
•  market risk.
For a discussion of liquidity risk, refer to note 1 “Reporting Entity / Structure of Eagle Energy Inc.” within the section 
titled “Liquidity”. This note presents information about changes in Eagle’s exposure to credit and market risk since the 
year ended December 31, 2015.

The  net  fair  value  of  Eagle’s  unrealized  risk  management  positions  at  June  30,  2016,  is  a  liability  of  $2.0  million 
(December  31,  2015  -  $9.2  million  asset).    The  carrying  value  of  Eagle’s  risk  management  position  has  been 
calculated  using  both  quoted  prices  in  active  markets  and  observable  market-corroborated  data  consistent  with  a 
Level 2 valuation.
The fair values of cash, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and dividends payable approximate 
their carrying amount due to the short-term maturity of those instruments.
Debt is a financial liability with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.  After initial 
measurement, these assets are measured at amortized cost at the settlement date using the effective interest rate 
method.  The carrying value of Eagle’s debt is equal to the fair value and the determination of the fair value of the 
debt is consistent with a Level 2 valuation.

Business Combination
Pursuant to the Arrangement (refer to note 1 “Reporting Entity / Structure of Eagle Energy Inc.”), Eagle acquired all of 
the issued and outstanding common shares of Maple Leaf on the basis of 0.0947 of a common share of Eagle being 
issued  for  each  outstanding  common  share  of  Maple  Leaf,  which  resulted  in  7,141,815  common  shares  of  Eagle 
being issued.  Based on the January 27, 2016 closing price of $0.73 per share, the total value of the common shares 
issued to acquire Maple Leaf was $5,214,000.  At the time of closing, Maple Leaf had no debt and no working capital 
deficiency.  In addition, Eagle issued 446,444 common shares (valued at $325,904 based on the January 27, 2016 
closing price of $0.73 per share) to terminate the Maple Leaf management agreement. This amount was recorded in 
administrative expenses.
From  the  period  January  27,  2016  through  to  June  30,  2016,  the  Maple  Leaf  assets  acquired  have  contributed 
revenues  of  $1.1  million  and  operating  income  of  $0.9  million.    Had  the  acquisition  closed  on  January  1,  2016, 
estimated  contributed  revenues  would  have  been  $1.2  million  and  estimated  contributed  operating  income  would 
have been $1.0 million to June 30, 2016.

The Company implemented a new long-term equity compensation incentive plan (the “2016 Equity Incentive Plan”) 
following  the  closing  of  the  Arrangement.    Under  the  2016  Equity  Incentive  Plan,  RSUs  and  PSUs  have  been 
awarded.  In addition, following the closing of the Arrangement, a share option plan that was previously in place (the 
“2010 Option Plan”) was adjusted to entitle holders of options to purchase shares of Eagle on identical terms and 
conditions.  Lastly, cash-settled RUR agreements which were previously in place were adjusted to reference shares, 
but otherwise entitle holders to identical rights, terms and conditions.  Effective June 9, 2016, all holders of options 
outstanding under the 2010 Option Plan agreed to a voluntary cancellation of options and the 2010 Option Plan was 
terminated.
All  holders  of  cash  settled  Unit  Rights  (“URs”)  that  were  previously  granted  to  United  States-based  officers, 
employees and certain consultants of Eagle Hydrocarbons Inc. agreed to a voluntary cancellation of the URs effective 
February 23, 2016 and the UR Plan was terminated on March 31, 2016.

Following  the  Arrangement,  Eagle  implemented  a  new  equity  compensation  plan,  the  2016  Equity  Incentive  Plan, 
dated effective January 27, 2016.  It was approved by the shareholders at Eagle’s special shareholders’ meeting held 
on January 25, 2016.
The  aggregate number  of  shares  that may  be  reserved  for  granting awards  at any  time  under  (i)  the  2016  Equity 
Incentive  Plan,  and  (ii)  all  of  Eagle's  other  security-based  compensation  arrangements  involving  the  issuance  of 
shares from treasury, must not exceed 10% of the total issued and outstanding shares.
Awards in the form of RSUs, Options, Share Appreciation Rights and Deferred Share Units may be granted to the 
employees, officers, consultants and directors of Eagle and its affiliates (except that Deferred Share Units cannot be 
granted to consultants).  The Board may fix vesting criteria based on time and/or on performance criteria that relate to 
the performance of Eagle (in the latter case, those awards are referred to as PSUs).  PSUs have been granted with a 
performance multiplier.  This multiplier, ranging from zero to two, will be applied at vesting and is dependent on the 
performance of Eagle relative to pre-defined corporate performance measures set by the Board of Directors for the 
associated period.  Due to the PSU performance conditions not being specifically measureable, the PSUs that are 
issued are not considered granted in accordance with the definition of grant in IFRS 2.  RSUs and PSUs represent a 
right to receive, on the vesting date, one share or a payment of cash equal to the Fair Market Value of one share (or 
a combination thereof).  The Fair Market Value of the vested RSUs and PSUs will be determined as of the vesting 
date and will be settled in shares or cash (or a combination thereof) after deduction of any applicable withholding 
taxes.  "Fair Market Value" is determined using the volume weighted average trading price for the shares of Eagle on 
the TSX for the five days on which the shares traded preceding the date of reference.  Participants receive dividend-
equivalent rights on their RSUs and PSUs.  If an award can be settled in shares, the Board may elect to settle the 
award using either authorized and unissued shares or outstanding shares acquired on the open market through the 
16
EAGLE SECOND QUARTER REPORT 2016
facilities of an independent broker (or a combination thereof).  It is the intention of the Board to settle these awards 
with equity; thus these awards are treated as equity-settled awards.
As of June 30, 2016, there were 902,515 RSUs and 383,478 PSUs outstanding as described below.
Vesting is determined by the Board.  The RSUs and PSUs that have been granted will vest as follows:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
As to one-third of the total RSUs and one-third of the total PSUs granted on the date that is the sixth day 
that the shares traded on the TSX after the date that Eagle has publicly released its annual financial results 
for the year ended December 31, 2016;
As to one-third of the total RSUs and one-third of the total PSUs granted on the date that is the sixth day 
that the shares traded on the TSX after the date that Eagle has publicly released its annual financial results 
for the year ended December 31, 2017; and
As to the remaining one-third of the total RSUs and one-third of the total PSUs granted on the date that is 
the sixth day that the shares traded on the TSX after the date that Eagle has publicly released its annual 
financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018.
With respect to the RSUs, the fair value of the RSUs is determined at the date of grant and is the volume weighted 
average trading price for the shares of Eagle on the TSX for the five days that the shares traded preceding the grant 
date (with the Black-Scholes option pricing model yielding a similar fair value).  The resulting compensation expense 
is amortized over the three year vesting period (with the offsetting entry to contributed surplus) using graded vesting 
and an estimated forfeiture rate of 5%.  Upon settlement, amounts are transferred from contributed surplus to share 
capital.  The estimated weighted average fair value for RSUs at the measurement date (the grant date) is $0.63 per 
RSU granted for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
The following schedule shows the continuity of equity settled RSUs issued:

With respect to the PSUs, since the performance conditions attached to the PSUs are not specifically measureable, 
the PSUs that have been issued are not considered granted in accordance with the definition of grant in IFRS 2.  As a 
result, the fair value of the PSUs are determined at each reporting period and at the date of settlement based on 
either the closing trading price for the shares of Eagle on the TSX multipled by an estimated payout multiplier of one 
for the number of units expected to vest (in the case of valuation at each reporting period, and with the Black-Scholes 
option  pricing  model  yielding  a  similar  fair  value)  or  based  on  the  actual  Fair  Market  Value  and  actual  payout 
multiplier applied to the number of units vested.  As a result of revaluing the PSUs each reporting period, fluctuations 
in compensation expense may occur due to the re-measurement of the value of the shares as well as changes in 
estimating the outcome of the performance conditions (i.e. the performance multiplier).  The resulting compensation 
expense at each reporting period is amortized over the remaining portion of the three year vesting period (with the 
offsetting entry to contributed surplus) using graded vesting and an estimated forfeiture rate of 5%.  Upon settlement, 
amounts are  transferred  from  contributed surplus to share capital.   The  estimated  weighted  average  fair  value  for 
PSUs at the measurement date (June 30, 2016) is $0.71 per PSU granted for the six months ended June 30, 2016.

Pursuant to the Arrangement, the unit option plan of the Trust that was adopted in 2010 became a stock option plan 
of Eagle Energy Inc., with such amendments thereto as was necessary to reflect the status of Eagle Energy Inc. as 
an Alberta corporation.  In addition, each option previously granted under this plan was adjusted, without constituting 
a novation or disposition of such option, to provide that each such option entitled, without any further action on the 
part of an optionholder, the optionholder to purchase an equivalent number of shares in lieu of units.  Effective June 
9,  2016,  all  holders  of  options  outstanding  under  the  2010  Option  Plan agreed  to a  voluntary  cancellation  of  their 
options and the 2010 Option Plan was terminated.

The fair value of the options was estimated at nil at March 31, 2016 using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the 
same inputs as December 31, 2015 (other than using the March 31, 2016 closing share price).  Therefore, no further 
balance sheet entry was required during the second quarter of 2016 to reflect the voluntary cancellation.  The fair 
value of the options for the comparative periods of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015 was $0.07 and $0.66 per 
option, respectively.
Note 8(c)
Cash settled RURs
Following  the  Arrangement,  an  amendment  was  made  to  the  RURs  agreement  which  entitled  the  holders  of  the 
RURs to identical rights, terms and conditions, including entitling the holder to receive cash payments equal to the 
dividends payable on one share as well as capital appreciation of shares.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, $43,516  has been paid to the RUR holders (year ended December 31, 
2015 - $227,685, six months ended June 30, 2015 – $113,835).

The  June 30,  2016 fair  value  of  the  RURs  was  estimated using  the  Black-Scholes  valuation model and  using  the 
same inputs as December 31, 2015 (other than a 5-day volume weighted average share price assumption of $0.71 
per share as compared to $1.13 per share at December 31, 2015).  Based on these assumptions, the fair value at the 
June 30, 2016 balance sheet  was nil per RUR (December 31, 2015 - $0.01 per RUR,  June 30, 2015 - $0.19 per 
RUR).
Note 8(d)
UR Plan
In 2011, the Trust adopted a cash-settled unit rights incentive plan for the U.S.-based directors, officers, employees 
and  eligible  consultants  of  the  Trust’s  U.S.  operating  subsidiary.    Each  UR  entitled  the  holder  to  receive  cash 
payments  equal  to  the  distributions  paid  on  one  unit  as  well  as  capital  appreciation  (increases  in  the  fair  market 
value) of the units less a capital deficiency (decreases in the fair market value) of the units.  Distributions did not give 
rise to a payout amount as long as there was a capital deficiency.  The URs were terminated on February 23, 2016 
and the UR Plan was terminated on March 31, 2016.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016, $nil has been paid to 
the UR holders (year ended December 31, 2015 - $nil, six months ended June 30, 2015 - $nil).

At the end of each reporting period, the Company assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be 
impaired  or  require  a  reversal  of previously  recorded  impairments.   At June 30, 2016,  the  Company  assessed  it’s 
properties at a CGU level and determined that given the increase in oil price and the reduced net book value of the oil 
and gas properties, no impairment indicators were present and therefore an impairment test was not performed.
15.  Debt
Eagle  has  a  Credit  Agreement  with  a  syndicate  of  Canadian  bank  lenders  that  is  subject  to  semi-annual 
redeterminations of the borrowing base level.  It is used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, 
capital expenditures and future acquisitions.  Amounts drawn under the Credit Agreement are available in either U.S. 
or Canadian dollars and may be used for activities in either the U.S. or Canada.
At June 30, 2016, there were no covenant violations under or in connection with the Credit Agreement.
On May 31, 2016, Eagle finalized its semi-annual borrowing base redetermination which resulted in:  (i) amendments 
being made to its Credit Agreement; (ii) a borrowing base level being set at $CA 70 million and; (iii) a maturity date of 
May 27, 2017 remaining unchanged.  Security granted under the Credit Agreement remained unchanged and is by 
way of a first priority security interest on substantially all of the property and assets of Eagle Energy Inc. and Eagle 
Hydrocarbons Inc. (each a borrower under the Credit Agreement).  A summary of the significant amendments made 
to  the  Credit  Agreement  effective  May  31,  2016  is  set  forth  below  and  a  redacted  version  of  the  entire  Credit 
Agreement can be found under Eagle’s issuer profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
Prior to the May 31, 2016 redetermination, the most recent semi-annual borrowing base redetermination had closed 
October 7, 2015 and had resulted in a borrowing base level being set at $US 80 million.  In the period between these 
two  redeterminations,  sustained  weakness  in  global  commodity  prices  resulted  in  downward  pressure  on  the 
commodity price decks used by lenders when determining borrowing base levels.
The next semi-annual borrowing base redetermination is scheduled to be finalized no later than November 30, 2016 
and will be conducted based on the lenders’ price forecasts then in effect.  Current and forward crude oil prices have
22
EAGLE SECOND QUARTER REPORT 2016
recovered from their lows in early February 2016 (which also corresponded to the time when lenders perform year 
end borrowing base reviews) and Eagle anticipates that a rebound in oil price levels will be incorporated into lenders’ 
borrowing  base  redeterminations  affording  Eagle  increased  liquidity  and  flexibility.    In  the  event,  however,  that  a 
borrowing  base  redetermination  results  in  a  reduction  of  the  borrowing  base  below  the  aggregate  amounts 
outstanding  under  the  Credit  Agreement  (such  that  a  “borrowing  base  deficiency”  exists)  the  Credit  Agreement 
instructs that Eagle shall, after receipt of written notice from the lenders regarding such deficiency, take any of the 
following actions and notify the lenders of its election of the following actions within ten (10) days after receipt of the 
deficiency notice from the lenders:  (1) Repay the borrowing base deficiency within 10 days; (2) pledge additional 
acceptable collateral such that the borrowing base deficiency is cured within 30 days; (3) deliver an election in writing 
to the lender to agree to repay the borrowing base deficiency within (30) days.  A failure by Eagle to take such actions 
to remedy any borrowing base deficiency within the time periods specified above would constitute an event of default.
Summary of Significant Amendments to Covenants, Terms and Conditions of Credit Facility
Under  the  Credit  Agreement,  Eagle  is  required  to  satisfy  certain  customary  affirmative  and  negative  covenants, 
including  financial  covenants.    The  following  is  a  summary  of  the  significant  amendments  made  to  the  Credit 
Agreement’s covenants, terms and conditions effective May 31, 2016.
-

The borrowing base was amended to $CA 70 million (previously $US 80 million).  
The  covenant  that  restricts  Eagle  from  paying  dividends  to  its  shareholders  if  any  default,  event  of 
default or borrowing base deficiency has occurred and is continuing or would result from such dividend, 
or if the cash dividend payments made for the trailing four quarters exceeds the Available Distributable 
Cash Flow (as defined by the Credit Agreement, and which was $20.6 million at June 30, 2016) for the 
trailing four quarters, remained unchanged.  
A  new  covenant  was  added  that  restricts  Eagle  from  paying  dividends  in  an  amount  that  exceeds 
$0.005 (half a cent) per share per month, beginning with the dividend declared in July 2016 (which is 
payable in August 2016) and ending with any dividend that may be declared in June 2017 (which would 
be payable in July 2017).  
The covenant requiring Eagle to maintain, as at the end of each fiscal quarter, a maximum debt to four 
quarter trailing EBITDAX ratio of 3.00 to 1.00, was amended to proactively manage the effect that the 
precipitous drop in  oil  prices will  have  on  this trailing  covenant calculation.   Beginning with  the  fiscal 
quarter ending June 30, 2016, and for five quarters through to and including the fiscal quarter ending 
June  30,  2017,  the  maximum  ratios  are  amended  as  follows:    for  the  fiscal  quarter  ending  June  30, 
2016  -  4.00  to  1.00;  for  the  fiscal  quarter  ending  September  30,  2016  -  5.00  to  1.00;  for  each  fiscal 
quarter ending December 31, 2016 through to the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2017 – 6.00 to 1.00; 
and for each fiscal quarter ending after June 30, 2017, 3.00 to 1.00.  The definition of EBITDAX remains 
unchanged from that disclosed in Eagle’s 2015 annual financial statements. 
The covenant requiring Eagle to maintain, as at the end of each fiscal quarter, a minimum current ratio 
of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 remained unchanged. The current ratio excludes the current portion of the 
long term debt. 
The covenant requiring Eagle to maintain, as at the end of each fiscal quarter, a minimum four quarter 
trailing interest expense coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 was deleted. 
The maturity date of the Credit Agreement remained unchanged at May 27, 2017.  This date represents 
the date (the “commitment termination date”) through which the syndicate of Canadian bank lenders are 
obligated under the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement to make advances to Eagle 
up  to  the  authorized  borrowing  base  amount  in  effect  from  time  to  time.    The  Credit  Agreement 
continues to be subject to semi-annual (November and May) redeterminations of the borrowing base by 
the  lenders.   In the event  that,  prior  to  May  27,  2017:    (i) Eagle and  its  syndicate  of  Canadian  bank 
lenders have not amended the Credit Agreement to reflect a later maturity date, or; (ii) Eagle does not 
repay  amounts  outstanding  under  the  existing  Credit  Agreement  by  refinancing  with  a  new  credit 
agreement (which may or may not include some of the existing syndicate of Canadian bank lenders), 
the  Credit  Agreement  instructs  that  Eagle  shall  repay  all  outstanding  principal  and  accrued  interest 
amounts on May 27, 2017.  Since Eagle currently estimates the present value of its proved developed 
producing reserves (the reserves category primarily used by lenders when determining borrowing base 
levels) discounted at 10% and using mid-July 2016 forward pricing assumptions to be in excess of its 
current $CA 70 million borrowing base by approximately 50%, it is likely that either a refinancing or an 
amendment to extend the maturity date will occur prior to May 27, 2017.  However, there can be no 
assurance that such refinancing will be successful.

The decommissioning provision reflects the present value of internal estimates of future decommissioning costs of 
Eagle’s net ownership position in oil and gas wells and related facilities at the relevant balance sheet date determined 
using local pricing conditions and requirements.  The liability would be incurred over the life of the assets, with the 
majority after the year 2050.  The timing of payments related to the decommissioning provision is uncertain and is 
dependent on various items which are not always within Management’s control.
The  decommissioning  provision  was  estimated  using  existing  technology,  at  current  prices  (adjusted  for  a  2.0% 
annual  inflation  rate),  and  discounted  using  a  risk-free  discount  rate  at  June  30,  2016,  of  1.06%  for  the  Salt  Flat 
properties (December 31, 2015 – 1.39%), 1.72% for the Hardeman properties (December 31, 2015 – 2.15%)  1.72 % 
for the Dixonville properties (December 31, 2015 – 2.15%), 1.06% for the Twining properties (December 31, 2015 – 
1.39%) and 1.72% for the NW Alberta properties that were acquired January 27, 2016 pursuant to the Arrangement.

On January 27, 2016, as part of the Arrangement, Eagle issued 7.6 million shares valued at $0.73 per share for a 
total value of $5.5 million (see note 6 “Business Combination”).  Costs associated with issuing shares pursuant to the 
Arrangement were approximately $906,000.
From January 21, 2015 to January 20, 2016, Eagle had a normal course issuer bid (“NCIB”) in place.  Under the
