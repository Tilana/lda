<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its sixteenth session from 
22 April to 3 May 2013. The review of Cameroon was held at the 15th meeting on 1 May 
</p><p>2013. The delegation of Cameroon was headed by Pierre Moukoko Mbonjo, Minister of 
External Relations. At its 18th meeting held on 3 May 2013, the Working Group adopted 
the report on Cameroon. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Cameroon: Italy, Kazakhstan and Kenya. 
</p><p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Cameroon: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/16/CMR/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/16/CMR/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/16/CMR/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Mexico, 
Montenegro, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Cameroon through the troika. These questions are 
available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation explained that the national report, which had been drafted by an 
interministerial committee under the auspices of the Prime Minister, had been subjected to 
a series of reviews, beginning with all the ministerial departments involved in human rights, 
followed by civil society organizations and, lastly, at a joint Government/civil society 
workshop. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation emphasized that progress had been made in the field of human rights 
since February 2009, in terms of strengthening strategic orientations, improving the 
normative and institutional framework, and implementing practical measures. 
</p>
<p>7. At the strategic level, Cameroon had adopted the Growth and Employment Strategy 
Paper in 2010 and had also initiated the process of adoption of the National Action Plan for 
the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>8. With regard to the normative and institutional framework, the delegation noted that 
Cameroon had ratified eight international human rights and humanitarian law conventions. 
Two of the instruments had been the subject of recommendations accepted during the first </p>

 <p></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.13-15472 
</p>
<p>cycle of the Universal Periodic Review, in 2009,1 namely, the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. African regional instruments had also been ratified 
between 2009 and 2012. 
</p>
<p>9. As to the specific measures taken during the period under review, the delegation 
declared that key initiatives had been undertaken to improve the overall human rights 
situation. Access to high-quality, low-cost food remained a constant priority and steps had 
been taken to reduce the high cost of living and promote the quality of products intended 
for human consumption. 
</p>
<p>10. Concerning the right to work and access to employment, the delegation noted that, in 
February 2011, Cameroon had launched an extensive programme to recruit 25,000 young 
persons to the public service. It also emphasized that the country&#8217;s appeal to foreign 
investors and the implementation of major State projects offered good prospects for 
guaranteeing Cameroonians the right to work. 
</p>
<p>11. With regard to persons with disabilities, the delegation referred to the measures 
taken to promote their access to education, such as total or partial exemption from school 
and university fees. It also provided details of several achievements in guaranteeing the 
rights of persons living with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>12. With regard to the right to participate in the management of public affairs, the 
delegation noted that Elections Cameroon, a body established in 2009 to monitor the 
elections, had conducted its activities satisfactorily. Elections Cameroon had thus organized 
the country&#8217;s recent &#8212; and first &#8212; senatorial elections, held on 14 April 2013, and the 
presidential elections of October 2011. The delegation listed various measures that had 
facilitated successful elections, including the free establishment of national identity cards 
and the effective operation of all the regional and departmental branches of Elections 
Cameroon. The adoption of a single Electoral Code and the overhaul of the electoral rolls 
using biometric data strengthened the transparency of elections and confidence in the 
electoral process. 
</p>
<p>13. The delegation emphasized that most of the accepted recommendations had been 
implemented satisfactorily. 
</p>
<p>14. With regard to recommendations on women&#8217;s rights, the Government had intensified 
capacity-building actions for the prevention and management of gender-based violence, 
adopted the national strategy against such forms of violence and implemented a programme 
to combat various forms of violence against women. 
</p>
<p>15. The respect of freedom of expression had been manifested through, inter alia, better 
freedom of the press, the establishment of the National Communication Council and the 
organization of training for journalists on the respect of professional norms and ethics. It 
highlighted that the status of journalists or human right defenders was not tantamount to 
exemption from being prosecuted for common law crimes. 
</p>
<p>16. Regarding the relations related to education, the delegation mentioned, among 
others, the opening of eight universities, the teaching of national languages and cultures and 
the boosting of the teaching of human rights in schools. 
</p>
<p>17. Concerning the fight against corruption, the delegation stated that Cameroon had 
stepped up its efforts through, inter alia, the development of the National Strategy against 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 A/HRC/11/21, para. 76.  </p>

 <p></p>
<p>GE.13-15472 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Corruption and the creation of the Special Criminal Court and a Ministry in charge of 
Public Contracts. 
</p>
<p>18. In terms of public health, the delegation noted the decline of the HIV/AIDS 
prevalence, the stabilization of the budget of the Ministry of Health and significant decline 
in the mortality rate of children under 5 years. 
</p>
<p>19. With regard to the recommendation to strengthen the National Commission for 
Human Rights and Freedoms (NCHRF), the delegation said that its implementation had 
been translated concretely in the increase of its budget and its compliance with the 
principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
human rights (Paris Principles). 
</p><p>20. The delegation also underlined the country&#8217;s fruitful international cooperation in the 
area of human rights and its compliance with its obligation of submitting reports. 
</p>
<p>21. Furthermore, Cameroon received in 2011 and 2012 several regional and 
international mandate holders, such as the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders 
in Africa of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the United 
Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to food. In addition to the expected visit of the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, three other invitations had been sent to United Nations special procedures. 
</p>
<p>22. The delegation noted with satisfaction the protection of children&#8217;s rights and the 
carrying out of a national ongoing study on the identification of indigenous people. 
</p>
<p>23. However, the implementation of some recommendations still remained causes for 
concern for Cameroon. 
</p>
<p>24. In that regard, the delegation mentioned the compliance of places of detention with 
international standards. Even though some progress had been made, efforts still needed to 
be carried out to improve food for prisoners, enhance sanitation in prisons, build new 
prisons and modernize existing ones. The continuation of the implementation of the 
Programme for Improving the Conditions of Detention (PACDET) with the collaboration of 
the European Union was expected to overcome some of those challenges. 
</p>
<p>25. The delegation was also concerned at the adherence to international conventions and 
noted that of the seven international instruments whose ratification had been accepted, two 
had been actually ratified (the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT) and the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in 
armed conflict (OP-CRC-AC)). 
</p><p>26. Regarding decent housing facilities, the delegation stated that the 2010&#8211;2013 
programme for the building of 10,000 low-cost houses and the development of 50,000 
building plots was under way although it had met with some delays. 
</p>
<p>27. The unsatisfactory implementation of some recommendations was not the result of 
bad faith from the Government but was due to limited resources, time necessary for the 
changes of attitude from the population and administrative work-related issues. 
</p>
<p>28. The delegation listed various challenges that Cameroon had been facing such as the 
fight against impunity; problems linked to the capacity-building of State and civil society&#8217;s 
stakeholders; and education and awareness on human rights issues. Added to those 
challenges were the inadequate means for economic, social and cultural rights; the lack of a 
formal mechanism for monitoring and evaluating public policy and the lack of the 
collection and dissemination of statistics on human rights. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.13-15472 
</p>
<p>29. The delegation reiterated the commitment of Cameroon to continue implementing 
the recommendations accepted in 2009 and those to be agreed upon at the end of the 
present review. Cameroon would develop an action plan and a roadmap for the 
implementation of the recommendations and the consultation of governmental and civil 
society&#8217;s stakeholders and continue its cooperation with the subregional United Nations 
Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Central Africa. 
</p>
<p>30. Regarding the advance questions raised by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland and Slovenia on violence and discrimination against women, the 
delegation replied that the actual revision of the Penal Code would allow eventually 
repressing all forms of violence against women. Sexual assaults are the most common form 
of violence against women and perpetrators are systematically prosecuted and sentenced in 
most cases. The Government had developed a national strategy to fight against sexual 
violence around several axes such as prevention; legal and psychosocial counselling of 
victims; research; and the fight against specific violence. 
</p>
<p>31. With regard to female genital mutilation (FGM), the delegation noticed that the 
phenomenon was restricted to the far north, north and south-west parts of the country and to 
a few sites in Yaound&#233;. In total, it stated that 1.4 per cent of the population was mutilated in 
Cameroon. It listed several actions carried out to fight against FGM, such as microprojects 
to allow persons who practise FGM to develop income-generating activities and the 
organization of an annual campaign called &#8220;Zero tolerance to FGM&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>32. During the interactive dialogue, 82 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue can be found in chapter II of the present report.

</p>
<p>57. Replying to questions concerning homosexuality, the delegation of Cameroon noted 
that Cameroonian society did not yet accept homosexuality as normal behaviour and that 
attitudes would change over time. The delegation stressed that homosexuals were not 
persecuted and that the few incidents that had been brought to the attention of the 
international community had occurred in public places. The phenomenon, which was 
quantitatively negligible, should therefore be put into perspective. Furthermore, article 29 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provided that a State could limit a freedom 
for the purpose of &#8220;meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general 
welfare in a democratic society&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>58. Concerning the death penalty, the delegation noted that only one execution had been 
carried out since President Paul Biya had come to power. The law was the expression of the 
general will and the Government was required to take into account its electorate, regardless 
of its convictions. The death penalty was not applied de facto and it would eventually be 
abolished but it was important to take into account changes in society. 
</p>
<p>59. With regard to journalists and human rights defenders, the delegation said that 
Cameroon had some 60 radio stations and 20 television channels, which allowed free 
debate, and about a hundred private newspapers. It declared that no journalists were in 
prison because of their profession and that no journalism graduates experienced problems. 
The Government did not prosecute journalists &#8212; only individuals did so, for defamation or 
dissemination of false information &#8212; and references to the decriminalization of press 
offences concerned defamation rather than press offences. 
</p>
<p>60. The delegation also said that the Government did not tolerate threats against human 
rights defenders and that investigations were carried out in such cases. </p>

 <p></p>
<p>GE.13-15472 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>61. Regarding the right of association, the delegation noted that provisions were in place 
for all to express and organize freely. However, it should be emphasized that the 
Government prohibited demonstrations when there was information suggesting that 
violence might ensue, but that did not undermine the right of association. 
</p>
<p>62. Benin noted the Government&#8217;s commitment to tackle poverty through the adoption 
of the growth and employment strategy paper to ensure food security and jobs creation in 
rural areas. It encouraged Cameroon to pursue its efforts to ensure suitable housing for each 
citizen and eradicate FGM.

</p>
<p>66. Burkina Faso encouraged Cameroon to continue adopting measures to improve the 
administration of justice, to go on with the guarantee of care services, particularly regarding 
maternal and child health, adopting the five-year action plan against FGM, guarantee the 
rights of persons with disabilities and request support from the relevant United Nations 
agencies. 
</p>
<p>67. Burundi commended Cameroon for its National Commission for Human Rights and 
Freedoms and the programme to create jobs. It welcomed the ongoing training provided to 
police staff, gendarmerie, penitentiary administration, army and courts. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. Cambodia welcomed the ratification of OP-CAT and the OP-CRC-AC. It noted the 
creation of the National Plan of Action for Human Rights and the national plan of action to 
combat trafficking and sexual exploitation of children. Cambodia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. Canada recalled that, in 2009, it had recommended that Cameroon abolish the 
privative penalty for press offences and that Cameroon had accepted it. Canada requested 
what measures had been taken in this regard and when Cameroon was expected to abolish 
that penalty. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. Cape Verde highlighted the National Human Rights Education Programme, a 
platform including a programme of fight against violence towards women, creation of an 
interministerial committee of prevention and fight against trafficking in persons and a law 
on the protection of persons with disabilities. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71. Chad noted that Cameroon had strengthened its human rights framework by 
validating the National Plan of Action for Human Rights and elaborating the strategy 
document for growth and employment. It encouraged Cameroon to pursue its initiated 
efforts and asked for the support of partners to join Cameroon in the implementation of 
recommendations. 
</p>

Action for Human Rights and its combat to fight corruption. It commended the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to ensure food security and provide medical care and special benefits </p>

the ratification of the OP-CRC-AC and OP-CAT. 
</p>

expressed appreciation for steps taken in favour of children&#8217;s rights and education for all. It 
encouraged Cameroon to pursue its efforts to effectively implement the first cycle UPR

</p>
