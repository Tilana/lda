<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health considers 
occupational health as an integral component of the right to health. The report outlines 
international human rights and other instruments related to occupational health, and it 
addresses occupational health in the informal economy, focusing on the needs of vulnerable 
and marginalized groups. It also addresses the obligation of States to formulate, implement, 
monitor and evaluate occupational health laws and policies, as well as the requirement for 
the participation of workers at all stages of those activities. The discussion of State 
obligations is followed by the analysis of such occupational health issues as environmental 
and industrial hygiene; prevention and reduction of the working population&#8223;s exposure to 
harmful substances; challenges posed by emerging technologies; minimization of hazards 
in the workplace; and availability and accessibility of occupational health services. The 
Special Rapporteur then elaborates on the prospective and retrospective components of 
accountability, as well as remedies for violations related to occupational health. The 
Special Rapporteur concludes his report with a number of recommendations aimed at 
strengthening occupational health, as a component of the right to health.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report considers the right to occupational health as an integral 
component of the right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health (hereafter, the right to health). It discusses the obligation of States to 
formulate, implement, monitor and evaluate national occupational health laws and policies. 
In particular, it examines in detail the right of workers to participate in decision-making at 
all stages of these processes. It also explores a number of substantive issues through the 
lens of the right to health which extend beyond the mere absence of injuries in the 
workplace, and includes prevention of disease in the workplace, environmental and 
industrial hygiene, harmful substances affecting workers, emerging technologies, 
psychosocial hazards and occupational health services. Finally, it investigates methods of 
accountability and remedies required by the right to occupational health.  
</p>
<p>2. In order to achieve the full realization of the right to occupational health as a 
fundamental component of the right to health, a broad understanding of the relationship 
between work and health must be adopted. Accordingly, an examination of occupational 
health must include consideration of harmful exposures during work, specific varieties of 
working conditions, working environment, working relationships, and the social, 
environmental and political contexts in which work is situated. 
</p>
<p>3. Since the establishment of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the 
landscape of work and the relationships between workers and employers has changed 
dramatically as a result of, amongst other things, globalization and the growth of 
transnational corporations. These phenomena have had a significant impact on the 
occupational health of workers. At the same time, the contemporary understanding of work 
has been greatly enriched by the recognition and examination of the informal economy as a 
persistent and substantial portion of the modern, globalized economy, and the source of 
work for millions of individuals. This has been cause for the re-evaluation of traditional 
approaches to the promotion and protection of occupational health. 
</p>
<p>4. Globalization can be defined as the increasing global interconnectedness of 
economic, political, social and cultural affairs. Trade liberalization and the proliferation of 
free trade agreements are central to this increasing economic interconnectedness. The 
migration of production and distribution networks and facilities from the developed to the 
developing world has increased as transnational corporations domiciled in more developed 
States produce more goods in the developing world for sale in developed markets. This 
migration is driven by the availability of cheap labour and the prevalence of weak 
environmental and labour regulations in the developing world. In some instances, special 
economic zones have been established that weaken or preclude regulations intended to 
protect workers&#8223; rights, including those relating to occupational health, within a specified 
area in order to attract the production and distribution operations of transnational 
corporations. Free trade agreements have been used for similar purposes. As a result, a 
growing numbers of workers are employed in workplace environments lacking adequate 
protections for their occupational health. At the same time, workers in the developed world, 
particularly migrants and workers in emerging technologies, are exposed to workplace 
hazards that are inadequately regulated or outside the purview of existing occupational 
health regimes.  
</p>
<p>5. A right to health approach to occupational health is particularly critical in light of 
these developments. This approach requires States to intervene directly in order to fulfil the 
right to occupational health of workers in the formal and informal economy; facilitate the 
direct participation of workers in the formulation, implementation, monitoring and 
evaluation of occupational health laws and policies; to implement regulation towards the </p>


<p>detection, prevention and treatment of occupational disease and the control or prohibition of 
harmful substance in the work place; pay special attention to the situation of vulnerable and 
marginalized workers; and ensure adequate accountability mechanisms are in place and 
remedies are available to workers.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Conceptual framework 
</b></p>
<p>6. The right to occupational health is an integral component of the right to health. The 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights addresses occupational 
health in article 12.2(b) and (c) and establishes that States must take steps towards the full 
realization of the right to health, including the improvement of all aspects of industrial 
hygiene and the prevention, treatment and control of occupational and other diseases. 
General comment No. 14 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
interprets article 12.2(b) of the Covenant to include safe and hygienic working conditions, 
preventive measures in respect of occupational accidents and diseases and the 
minimization, so far as is reasonably practicable, of the causes of health hazards inherent in 
the working environment (para. 15). General comment No. 14 states that article 12.2(c) of 
the Covenant requires States to make available relevant technologies, using and improving 
epidemiological surveillance and data collection on a disaggregated basis (para. 16).   
</p>
<p>7. A number of international human rights instruments address the right to 
occupational health in a variety of contexts. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
provides for the right of everyone to &#8220;just and favourable conditions of work&#8221; (art. 23).1 
The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
establishes women&#8223;s &#8220;right to protection of health and to safety in working conditions, 
including the safeguarding of the function of reproduction&#8221; (art. 11.1(f)) and requires States 
to &#8220;provide special protection to women during pregnancy in types of work proved to be 
harmful to them&#8221; (art. 11.2 (d)). The International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families obliges States to &#8220;take 
measures not less favourable than those applied to nationals to ensure that working and 
living conditions of migrant workers and members of their families in a regular situation 
are in keeping with the standards of fitness, safety, health and principles of human dignity&#8221; 
(art. 70). 
</p>
<p>8. The ILO recognizes both the right to a safe and healthy working environment and 
the protection of the worker against sickness, disease and injury arising out of his 
employment to be fundamental human rights.2 The ILO defines its Decent Work agenda to 
require safe and healthy work that does not expose workers to health hazards.3 The ILO has 
adopted numerous instruments ratified by varying numbers of member States that directly 
address occupational health. These include the Convention on Occupational Safety and 
Health, the Occupational Health Services Convention, the Working Environment (Air 
Pollution, Noise and Vibration) Convention, as well as the Protection of Workers&#8223; Health 
Recommendations. The ILO defines &#8220;health&#8221; broadly in the context of work to indicate not 
merely the absence of disease or infirmity but also the physical and mental elements

<p>affecting health, which are directly related to safety and hygiene at work.4 &#8220;Industrial 
hygiene&#8221; (or occupational hygiene) encompasses all efforts to protect workers&#8223; health 
through control of the work environment, including the recognition and evaluation of those 
factors that may cause illness, lack of well-being or discomfort among workers or the 
community.5 
</p>
<p>9. Under the right to health, everyone is entitled to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of health conducive to living a life in dignity. The ILO Decent Work 
agenda establishes the primary goal of the ILO to promote opportunities for women and 
men to obtain decent and productive work, in conditions of freedom, equity, security and 
human dignity.6 The joint ILO-WHO social protection floor approach, a strategic objective 
of the Decent Work agenda, is committed to promoting human dignity and increasing the 
productive capacity of vulnerable groups.7 The ILO Convention No. 155 on occupational 
safety and health states that it applies to &#8220;all branches of economic activity&#8221; (art. 1) in 
which workers are employed, including the informal economy8 where workers may be 
particularly vulnerable, as discussed below. General comment No. 14 also places special 
emphasis on States&#8223; responsibilities vis-&#224;-vis vulnerable and marginalized groups, including 
in the core obligations to formulate and implement a national health policy and to ensure 
access to health facilities, goods and services on a non-discriminatory basis (para. 43(f)). 
The right to occupational health, as an integral component of the right to health, thus 
includes the promotion of the dignity of workers, realized in part through safe and healthy 
working conditions, with a particular focus on vulnerable and marginalized groups. 
</p>
<p><b> A. The informal economy 
</b></p>
<p>10. The informal economy can be defined as a diversified set of economic activities, 
enterprises and workers that are not regulated or protected by the State. As defined by the 
ILO, the informal sector consists of &#8220;private unincorporated enterprises&#8221; which are not 
registered under specific forms of national legislation.9 Informal employment, however, is 
broader in scope and consists of all employment in the informal sector, plus those workers 
employed informally within the formal sector.10 The informal economy includes both the 
black economy, which seeks to avoid taxation and regulation, and the criminal economy, 
which deals in illegal goods and services. However, the black and criminal economies 
account for only a small share of the informal workforce. Most informal enterprises and 
workers deal in legal goods and services, and operate in a semi-legal, but not deliberately 
illegal manner.  
</p>
<p>11. The informal economy stands in contrast to the formal economy in a number of 
critical ways, the most important being the relative absence of State regulation. The lack of

<p>regulation results in numerous insecurities and vulnerabilities for informal workers, such as 
the lack of collective bargaining and anti-discrimination protections. Further, informal 
workers are also often subjected to volatile, insecure work schedules and long hours. Many 
informal workers are involved in piece work, which encourages unsafe work habits and 
shifts the burden of responsibility to protect occupational health from employers to 
workers. Although there are some very high earners within the informal economy (such as 
self-employed professionals), the vast majority of informal workers come from 
marginalized backgrounds and work without adequate training, technology and health 
precautions for a small, insecure wage. Although not all persons involved in the informal 
economy are poor, and not all of the working poor are informal workers, there is a 
substantial overlap between poverty and the informal economy. 
</p>
<p>12. The informal economy constitutes more than 50 per cent of the economy in many 
developing countries.11 When the agricultural sector is included in assessments, in some 
countries the informal economy approaches between 80 to 90 per cent of the total 
economy.12 However, the existence of the informal economy is certainly not limited to the 
developing world; the informal economy also makes up a sizeable portion of developed 
economies.13 Studies suggest that the informal economy may be a fall-back or buffer during 
times of economic downturn, when the informal economy often grows.14 In light of the 
magnitude of the recent global financial crisis and subsequent recession, it is likely that the 
informal sector has grown substantially. As the informal economy has grown, so have its 
related occupational health concerns. Considering the size and nature of the informal 
economy, it is impossible for States to fully realize the right to health without addressing 
concerns related to occupational health in the informal economy.  
</p>
<p>13. Informal employment consists of both self-employment in informal enterprises and 
wage employment in informal jobs. Self-employment in informal enterprises consists of 
self-employed persons in small unregistered or unincorporated enterprises, including 
employers (who hire others), own-account operators (who do not hire others), unpaid 
contributing family workers and members of unregistered co-operatives. Wage employment 
in informal jobs consists of wage workers who lack social protection through their work 
and who are employed by formal or informal firms (and their contractors), by households, 
or by no fixed employer, including non-standard employees of informal enterprises, non-
standard employees of formal enterprises, casual or day labourers, and industrial 
outworkers (also called homeworkers).15  
</p>
<p>14. Many in the formal workforce find themselves in a situation similar to those in the 
informal workforce. There is a growing trend toward contractualization and informalization 
of formal work, a process by which workers become their own employers and thereby may 
lose occupational health protections otherwise afforded to them as employees. At the same 
time, many developed economies are systematically moving away from standard work16&#8211;
full-time, year-round, permanent wage employment with a single employer with adequate 
statutory benefits and entitlements &#8211;,17 leading to an increase in part-time, casual,

<p>temporary, self-employed or contingent workers. While such workers are not technically 
part of the informal economy because their work and workplaces are likely to be still 
regulated, they may face difficulties similar to those faced by informal workers. For 
example, in many developed economies, employers are not required to provide health 
benefits to part-time and temporary employees. Both contractualization and the trend 
towards replacing standard work with atypical work often represent attempts by employers 
to evade their responsibility under existing occupational health regimes. 
</p>
<p>15. The right to health requires States to pay special attention to the needs of vulnerable 
and marginalized groups. Most workers in the informal economy face significant social and 
economic difficulties. These include lack of legal protection, lack of access to formal 
financial services, lack of social protection or social health insurance afforded to formal 
sector employees, exposure to harsh law enforcement, lack of job security, discrimination 
and others. Moreover, many workers in the informal economy often face increased risk of 
occupational disease and injury as compared to formal workers. In some cases when 
informal workers are injured, they are not granted compensation for their injuries.18 As a 
result, informal workers are amongst the least secure and most vulnerable of all workers, 
and thus require special attention under the right to occupational health. 
</p>
<p>16. Though there are regional variations, women are more likely than men to work 
within the informal economy than in the formal economy.19 And, like the formal economy, 
the informal economy is highly segmented in terms of gender. Approximately two-thirds of 
all female workers in the developing world work in the informal economy (not including 
agriculture). Moreover, women earn less than men, and are in lower paid and less skilled 
jobs.20 
</p>
<p>17. More research about the informal economy and informal workforce is needed at the 
local and national levels. The lack of disaggregated data, in particular, prevents States from 
understanding the demographic landscape of the informal economy and the particular 
vulnerabilities faced by informal workers. States must systematically engage informal 
workers in order to effectively conduct human rights and health impact assessments and 
risk surveillance, with a view to identifying and controlling known risks, as well as 
epidemiological and disease surveillance to detect and manage disease and prevent long 
term risks. 
</p>
<p>18. Informal work and workplaces do not fall under the purview of existing national 
occupational health laws therefore the employer-employee relationship in the informal 
economy goes unregulated. States have an obligation to fulfil workers&#8223; right to health 
through direct occupational health interventions in the informal economy. In some 
instances, this may require formalization through the introduction or extension of 
occupational health regulations into the informal economy. The ILO and other 
organizations have attempted to address the occupational health vulnerability of informal 
workers by implementing programmes in coordination with national governments aimed at 
reaching informal workers. These include the integration of occupational health services 
into primary health-care services;21 participatory health and safety training programmes for

<p>informal street vendors initiated by local governments22 and various efforts to extend social 
health insurance coverage in the informal sector.23 A number of interventions tailored to the 
needs of specific industries have also been implemented.24 
</p>
<p>19. There are additional means by which States can address the right to health in the 
informal sector. These include social health insurance schemes tailored to address the 
sector-specific health risks faced by workers throughout the informal economy; 
occupational health service provision at work sites; and primary health care interventions 
designed to educate and train workers about occupational health. The obligation to fully 
realize the right to occupational health for workers in the informal economy falls directly 
on States. In some instances, this may require formalization through the introduction or 
extension of occupational health regulations in the informal economy. Where this is not 
possible or feasible, States should then take all necessary steps (short of those that would 
eliminate these jobs) to mitigate harm stemming from such employment. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Obligation to formulate, implement, monitor and evaluate effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>laws and policies towards realizing the right to occupational health  
</b></p>
<p>20. The obligation to fulfil the right to health requires States to formulate and implement 
a national health policy towards realizing the right to health. General comment No. 14 of 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights explains that it is a core obligation 
to formulate, implement and periodically review a coherent national policy to minimize the 
risk of occupational accidents and diseases, as well as to provide a coherent national policy 
on occupational safety and health services (para. 36). ILO conventions on occupational 
safety and health and on occupational health services call on States to do the same. General 
comment No. 14 states that a national policy on occupational health, amongst other things, 
should include the identification, determination, authorization and control of dangerous 
materials, equipment, substances, agents and work processes; the provision of health 
information to workers and the provision, if needed, of adequate protective clothing and 
equipment; and the enforcement of laws and regulations through adequate inspection (para. 
36, ftn. 25).  
</p>
<p><b>  Participation  
</b></p>
<p>21. The right to health requires the participation of those affected in all decision-making 
processes affecting their health during the formulation, implementation, monitoring and 
evaluation of all health laws and policies. This means that workers must participate in the 
formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of laws and policies affecting their 
occupational health. While established trade unions must also participate fully in this 
process, in some instances, they may not adequately represent the interests of some

<p>communities of affected workers. Moreover, workers in the informal economy are seldom 
organized, and may not be recognized by employers or by the State when they are. Thus the 
right to health requires the direct participation of informal workers, which may be achieved 
through the recognition and promotion of member-based organizations. 
</p>
<p>22. Participation is essential to ensuring that health laws and policies affecting workers&#8223; 
occupational health are effective, responsive and sustainable. Workers&#8223; participation in the 
right to health process prevents top-down formulation of occupational health laws and 
policies, while ensuring regulation and health interventions do not become removed from 
the people that they are meant to serve. Participation empowers workers by ensuring that 
their views and experiential knowledge play integral roles in shaping laws and policies that 
impact their occupational health. This provides law and policymakers insight into the social 
context of occupational diseases, including the nature of employer-employee power 
relations and knowledge of specific risk factors and environmental hazards. Such 
knowledge is crucial to formulating laws and policies that effectively address workers&#8223; day-
to-day concerns, as well as to monitoring and evaluating the implementation of such laws 
and policies. 
</p>
<p>23. Participation under the right to occupational health establishes direct State 
obligations vis-&#224;-vis workers, as the State has the ultimate obligation to ensure realization 
of the right to health. States thus have a positive obligation to facilitate the active and 
informed participation of workers&#8223; in the formulation of State laws and policies impacting 
</p>
<p>their occupational health. This includes ensuring that workers participate in defining 
research priorities that inform policy formulation. It also includes an obligation to raise 
workers&#8223; awareness of occupational hazards, the manner in which workplace environments 
</p>
<p>produce poor health outcomes and the prevalence of work-related diseases and contributing 
psychosocial factors. Local law- and policymakers and health authorities may be best 
placed to ensure the meaningful participation of workers, particularly those in the informal 
economy. Raising the awareness of workers requires that they have access to relevant and 
accurate information relating to their occupational health.  
</p>
<p>24. The right to access information is central to the right to health and an essential 
component of active and informed participation. It includes the right to access health-
related education and information and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas 
concerning health issues. States also have a positive obligation in this respect to provide 
workers with health and rights-related information and to ensure that third parties, including 
private employers, do not limit access to such information. The ILO also requires States to 
ensure that national health laws and policies provide workers with comprehensive 
information, education and training related to occupational health. The right to occupational 
health thus requires that employers make available and accessible information concerning 
all health and safety risks, including those related to production inputs and equipment, 
machinery and chemicals used in the work place. States must further ensure that workers&#8223; 
right to access information affecting their occupational health supersedes employers&#8223; rights 
to protect commercial information under commercial confidentiality, trade secret and other 
related laws. 
</p>
<p>25. The right of workers to access information pertaining to their occupational health 
must be realized at each stage in the development of occupational health laws and policies. 
Notably, States must make relevant and accurate information available to workers at the 
very outset of the policy formulation process and during the reformulation of existing laws 
and policies so they may identify and prioritize areas of concern related to their 
occupational health before policy agendas are set. States must also ensure workers have a 
sufficient understanding of all relevant information. This includes technical information 
pertaining to harmful substances, dangerous equipment and machinery, and all relevant 
laws and regulations. In addition, workers must also be apprised of all health risks in the </p>


<p>workplace in a clear, comprehensible manner so they may themselves determine whether to 
engage in dangerous or unsafe work.  
</p>
<p>26. States must also not interfere, through its laws and policies or the acts of its officials, 
with communication and interactions amongst workers and between workers and the civil 
society regarding occupational health concerns. States must further facilitate the 
transmission of information pertaining to occupational health from affected workers 
directly to State officials. This may take the form of a complaint mechanism or a forum in 
which affected workers engage directly with relevant State officials or bodies in order to 
address violations of the right to occupational health. In some cases, these communications 
are barred by non-disclosure laws and mandatory contractual provisions between workers 
and their employers. States should ensure whistle-blower provisions or similar protections 
that supersede contractual obligations are in place to allow workers to disclose information 
regarding their occupational health publicly and directly to the State without fear of 
reprisal. 
</p>
<p>27. States must also guarantee that the process of law and policy formulation is fair and 
transparent and inclusive of all affected workers.25 Fair participation requires States to 
facilitate a law and policy formulation process in which workers&#8223; views and experiential 
knowledge are given equal consideration along with that of employers and government 
officials. For example, workers or their representatives must be included on policymaking 
bodies, and mechanisms must be available by which workers can provide direct and 
immediate input into the law- and policymaking processes. Transparency requires that 
information about all aspects of the process of law and policy formulation be made 
available and accessible to workers and their representatives. It further requires that the 
rationale and basis for all decisions made by the State at each stage in the process be made 
available and accessible to workers. State decisions affecting workers&#8223; occupational health 
must not be made behind closed doors.   
</p>
<p>28. For example, processes surrounding the negotiation of free trade agreements have 
lacked transparency and have not involved the participation of affected communities. As 
discussed earlier, the proliferation of free trade agreements is an element of globalization, 
which directly impacts the occupational health of workers. The right to occupational health 
requires States to incorporate workers&#8223; views and experiential knowledge into processes 
surrounding the negotiations of free trade agreements. Additionally, transparency requires 
States to make publicly available and accessible all draft agreements, negotiation proposals, 
minutes from negotiation meetings, and all other relevant information.  
</p>
<p>29. Participation of workers in the formulation and implementation of occupational 
health laws and policies is particularly critical for the informal workforce. The need for the 
active and informed participation of informal workers in the formulation and 
implementation of occupational health laws and policies is particularly acute given the 
traditional State neglect of this sector.  
</p>
<p><b>  Monitoring and evaluation  
</b></p>
<p>30. Under the right to health, States have a dual obligation to monitor and evaluate 
occupational health. As a prerequisite to the obligation to formulate and implement a 
national occupational health policy, States must conduct disease and epidemiological 
surveillance, including the collection of disaggregated data, in order to understand workers&#8223; 
health risks in all sectors, as well as human rights, health impact assessments and risk 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Kingdom, University of Essex, Human Rights Centre, 2008), p. 22. </p>


<p>surveillance, in order to assess the impact of occupational health laws and policies prior to 
implementation. Additionally, States are required to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness 
of their national occupational health policies as part of their core obligation to periodically 
review these policies. This requirement includes the obligation to regularly inspect 
worksites and production facilities in order to assess employer compliance with 
occupational health laws and policies. Periodic review is necessary in order to ensure the 
continual refinement of occupational health laws and policies to account for evolving health 
risks and new technologies. In both instances, monitoring and evaluation must be informed 
by international standards, including those developed by WHO and ILO. 
</p>
<p>31. The right to health requires robust participation of workers: in defining research 
priorities; in collecting epidemiological data prior to law and policy formulation; and in 
monitoring and evaluating occupational health laws and policies. In all instances, the State 
must ensure that the processes of monitoring and evaluation are not captured by private 
interests. For example, in many cases employers fund epidemiological research and exert 
undue influence on the findings.26 The State must not allow these studies to impact policy 
formulation. 
</p>
<p>32. Public health professionals have traditionally taken an approach to epidemiological 
research that focuses on the population as an object to be studied, thereby failing to 
recognize and utilize the population&#8223;s experiential knowledge. In contrast, more recent 
approaches utilize participatory research methods that broaden the epidemiological 
investigation from the individual to the population level and emphasize the role of the 
socio-political context in which disease occurs. For example, community-based 
participatory research conducts &#8222;research with, rather than on communities, affirms the 
value of communities&#8223; experiential knowledge and stresses a collaborative process&#8223;.27 
</p>
<p>33. Community-based participatory research is a joint-learning process in which 
researchers and community members contribute equally. It empowers community members 
through building local capacity, promotes their dignity by increasing the control they exert 
over their lives, and achieves a balance between research and community-level action. The 
approach employs a variety tools in the formulation and implementation of health laws and 
policies and systematizes workers&#8223; collective experiences concerning occupational health 
risks and outcomes as a means of identifying and controlling risks in the work 
environment.28 
</p>
<p>34. Right to health indicators and benchmarks must play an integral role in the periodic 
review of occupational health laws and policies in order to monitor and evaluate these laws 
and policies. There are three categories of human rights indicators: structural, process and 
outcome indicators.29 Structural indicators are used to determine whether key structures or 
mechanisms necessary for the realization of the right to health are in place. Process 
indicators measure discrete aspects of State policies and interventions toward realizing the 
right to health; whereas outcome indicators measure the impact of such interventions on the 
health of populations. Benchmarks are the national targets with respect to each indicator.

<p>They create a standard against which States can be held accountable, and allow for 
monitoring progress over time. 
</p>
<p>35. The right to occupational health indicators and benchmarks must be developed with 
the participation of workers and trade unions, including those in the informal economy. 
Monitoring of occupational health laws and policies on the basis of these mechanisms must 
be done transparently and in partnership with workers and the civil society, and all 
information resulting from this process must be made publicly available and accessible. 
Moreover, States must ensure that workers are intimately familiar with the right to health 
indicators and benchmarks so they can participate in the monitoring and evaluation of 
occupational health laws and policies on the basis of these mechanisms. Workers are best 
positioned to determine whether laws and policies affecting their occupational health are 
meeting the right to health benchmarks, and they have the greatest stake in ensuring that 
these laws and policies comply with the right to health. Ensuring that workers are familiar 
with the right to health indicators and benchmarks will additionally facilitate prospective 
State accountability by allowing workers to ascertain whether their right to occupational 
health is being realized.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Substantive occupational health issues and the right to 
occupational health 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Hazards 
</b></p>
<p>36. The right to health requires States to take steps to prevent, treat and control diseases 
related to work. Despite the well-established connection between work and disease,30 the 
nexus between factors in the work environment and workers&#8223; health outcomes is not always 
clear or easily defined. This is particularly the case with regard to diseases caused by 
multiple factors. The complex relationship between work and disease is recognized in the 
ILO classification of diseases related to work as &#8220;occupational diseases,&#8221; which have a 
specific link to a causal agent within the work environment; &#8220;work-related diseases,&#8221; which 
have multiple causal factors, one of which may include a factor in the work environment; 
and &#8220;diseases affecting working populations,&#8221; which lack a causal relationship with work 
but may be aggravated by factors in the work environment.31 
</p>
<p>37. For example, in extractive industries, exposure to dust, fumes and particulates places 
workers at increased risk of being affected by a number of diseases, including occupational 
diseases, such as coal miner&#8223;s pneumoconiosis; work-related disease, such as chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease; and diseases affecting working populations, such as 
asthma.32 The right to health requires States to prevent, control and treat these diseases. 
Primary prevention is considered the most effective means of reducing the burden of 
disease, and as such prevention of disease should be the principal aim of States.33 States are 
required to ensure adequate research and monitoring of the relationship between work

<p>conditions and health; dissemination of information to educate workers about work and 
health; and improvement of occupational and environmental conditions within the 
workplace, including the prevention and reduction of hazards in the workplace. 
</p>
<p>38. The right to a healthy workplace environment is an integral component of the right 
to health. It requires States to improve all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene, 
including housing, sanitation, nutrition and access to safe water. For example, there are 
significant concerns regarding environmental and industrial hygiene in agricultural work. 
These concerns are exacerbated by fact that many agricultural workers, particularly migrant 
workers who are involved in agricultural work in large numbers, are socially and 
economically disadvantaged and often lack adequate resources to protect their own health. 
The improvement of environmental and industrial hygiene is therefore critical to achieving 
the full realization of the right to occupational health, especially for agricultural workers. In 
many instances, the work environment is indistinguishable from the home environment. As 
a result, many agricultural workers reside in crowded and substandard accommodation with 
poor sanitation and inadequate access to safe and potable water.34 Many of them are also 
exposed to environmental hazards such as pesticides or other pollutants because of the 
proximity or overlap of their homes to their worksites.35 These conditions significantly 
contribute to the increased rates of infectious diseases seen amongst these workers.36 The 
right to health requires that States give particular attention to the needs of vulnerable and 
marginalized groups in the formulation and implementation of occupational health laws and 
policies. This includes an obligation to monitor and evaluate occupational health risks and 
diseases affecting vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p>39. International migrant workers are especially vulnerable for two reasons: they may be 
undocumented and thus open to exploitation by employers; or they may be documented, but 
lack protection under the law equal to that of nationals. This situation is exacerbated by 
structural and institutional racism, as well as social, cultural and linguistic barriers that 
prevent migrant workers from knowing, demanding and enforcing the limited legal rights 
that they possess.  
</p>
<p>40. The right to health also requires States to address the prevention and reduction of the 
population&#8223;s exposure to harmful substances, such as pesticides, and to assess their health 
impacts on workers. This is particularly important with respect to migrant workers because 
they may have limited access to health facilities, goods and services, and may lack access to 
the justice system. Where there is a real and confirmed hazard, the obligation to protect the 
right to occupational health requires States to prohibit production, sale and use of these 
substances. Where there is a reasonable potential for risk, States have a duty to take 
appropriate measures to reduce or prevent exposure, taking into consideration both the 
likelihood that harm will result and the extent of that harm. This includes requiring that 
pesticide labels are printed in all relevant languages, and agricultural workers are provided 
with adequate training and information regarding the use of pesticides.

<p>41. Exposure to pesticides has been linked to various acute and chronic toxic illnesses, 
including a number of cancers.37 Despite this, in many countries the law does not require 
pesticide use labels to be printed in languages understood by migrant workers in the 
jurisdiction.38 As a result, migrant agricultural workers suffer from high rates of toxic 
chemical injuries and skin disorders compared to other workers.39 Moreover, there are 
strong indications that efforts to regulate the distribution, application and disposure of such 
pesticides have been ineffective in reducing exposure.40 Such regulations are deficient in 
scope and under-enforced in both the developed and the developing world. 
</p>
<p>42. Emerging technologies pose a unique challenge to the prevention and reduction of 
exposure to harmful substances. The rapid development of new substances and market 
pressures have meant that extensive testing and study of these materials for long-term 
effects is often impractical. As a result, workers may be exposed to as yet undetected health 
risks.41 Emerging risks in the nano-technology field have received much needed attention in 
light of studies suggesting that exposure to nano-particles may have toxic and carcinogenic 
effects on lung tissue.42 In accordance with the precautionary principle, States must restrict 
the use of such technologies in the workplace until their health effects have been accurately 
assessed and communicated to workers. 
</p>
<p>43. The right to occupational health additionally requires States to work towards the 
minimization of hazards in the workplace. This recognizes that some hazards may be 
inherent to the occupation or workplace environment. For example, work in the textile and 
apparel industry is often laborious and of a highly repetitive nature, predisposing workers to 
musculoskeletal disorders, particularly repetitive strain injuries.43 Similarly, agricultural 
workers are exposed to harsh natural conditions and have heavy physical workloads, which 
may lead to thermal stress and musculoskeletal disorders.44 States must take steps to 
minimize, as far as reasonably practical, the resulting harm. Where hazards exist they 
should be identified and workers should be made aware of the risks of exposure. Workers 
should be empowered to determine when hazards pose a risk to their health that they deem

<p>unacceptable. In these circumstances, the right to health requires that workers, at all times, 
retain the right to refuse dangerous or unsafe work without fear of losing their job.  
</p>
<p>44. The duty of States to minimize hazards in the workplace includes both physical and 
psychosocial hazards. There is a growing body of evidence linking psychosocial hazards, 
such as stress and work overload, with psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression 
and burnout,45 and physical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal 
disorders, gastro-intestinal disorders and impaired immune competence.46 Ongoing reports 
linking high rates of attempted and completed suicide amongst workers in the technology 
industry with requirements to work extremely long hours are of particular concern. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Services 
</b></p>
<p>45. The right to health further requires that occupational health services are available, 
accessible, acceptable and of good quality. These services must be tailored to the needs of 
workers. For example, services must be made available at easily accessible locations and 
during hours that accommodate workers schedules; they must include the rehabilitation of 
affected individuals back into the workplace; health workers must be aware of the specific 
health risks faced by workers, and they must be trained to detect, prevent and treat 
occupational diseases. The ILO Occupational Health Services Convention No. 161 also 
states that occupational health services are essential to maintaining a safe and healthy 
working environment in order to facilitate optimal physical and mental health, and to 
adapting work to the capabilities of workers in the light of their health.  
</p>
<p>46. The obligation to ensure access to occupational health services may be met through 
the direct provision of services by the State or through social health insurance that covers 
all workers against occupational diseases and injuries. In most cases, social health 
insurance must be provided by the employer. Where this not possible, States must provide 
direct coverage or subsidize the purchase of private insurance based upon the economic 
needs of each worker. In all cases, insurance benefits must include preventative, promotive 
and curative health services, and must be tailored to address the specific occupational 
health risks faced by workers in their respective work sectors.    
</p>
<p><b> C. Gender 
</b></p>
<p>47. With respect to all of the above, it is critical that a gendered perspective be adopted 
in the formulation and implementation of occupational health laws and policies. A gender-
based approach recognizes that biological and socio-cultural factors play a significant role 
in influencing the health of men and women. The disaggregation of health and socio-
economic data according to sex is essential in the monitoring and evaluation of all 
occupational health laws and policies.  
</p>
<p>48. In many respects, women are particularly vulnerable to negative health impacts 
resulting from conditions of work. The majority of women who work are employed in the 
informal sector, particularly in the lowest paid, lowest skilled jobs, where they are more

<p>likely to be exposed to hazardous working conditions.47 Women are on average paid less 
than men for the same work,48 and are more likely to experience violence and harassment in 
the workplace.49 Further, many occupational exposures are hazardous to reproductive 
organs, having serious implications for the sexual and reproductive health of female 
workers.50 For example, women of childbearing age, as well as pregnant women working in 
agriculture, are exposed to highly hazardous pesticides that risk not only their health but 
also the health of their children.51 Children born with congenital disorders due to in utero 
exposure to toxic chemicals endure disabilities for life.52 These problems are compounded 
by the fact that work-related diseases affecting women are often underdiagnosed and 
undercompensated as compared to men.53 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Obligation to enforce laws and policies towards realizing the 
right to occupational health  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Accountability  
</b></p>
<p>49. Accountability is a central feature of the right to health. It requires States to 
demonstrate and justify the manner in which it is meeting its obligations under the right to 
health, and to provide adequate remedies to redress any failures to meet these obligations. 
Accountability is critical to achieving full realization of the right to health; as indicated by 
the previous Special Rapporteur, &#8222;without accountability, human rights can become no 
</p>
<p>more than window dressing&#8223;.54 The role of the State in ensuring accountability under the 
right to occupational health for workers in the informal economy is particularly critical, as 
these workers do not have access to accountability mechanisms under existing occupational 
health regimes. 
</p>
<p>50. Accountability may have both prospective and retrospective components. 
Prospective accountability means that at all times the State must be able to demonstrate and 
justify how it is discharging its obligations. States are accountable to explain to all affected 
parties what steps they are taking to achieve the full realization of the right to health, and

<p>why these steps are being taken. For example, in the mining industry, this means that a 
worker concerned about exposure to asbestos should have access to information detailing 
the steps that the State has taken to prevent or reduce exposure to this harmful substance. In 
order to assess whether these steps are effective, and therefore whether States are meeting 
their obligations under the right to occupational health, the results of the monitoring of 
exposure levels and the incidence of asbestos-related diseases must be available and 
accessible. In this manner, prospective accountability is closely linked to monitoring and 
evaluation, both of which are critically necessary to determine whether the actions of States 
are consistent with its obligations under the right to health. 
</p>
<p>51. Retrospective accountability focuses on appropriately addressing prior violations of 
the right to health. Violations of the right to health must be addressed through effective 
judicial or other appropriate remedies. In order to achieve this, effective remedies must be 
available, and effective accountability mechanisms must be in place to identify both the 
right to health violation and the appropriate remedy to redress that violation. A number of 
accountability mechanisms may function at the national level, including judicial, quasi-
judicial, administrative, political, and social mechanisms. General comment No. 14 
explicitly endorses the use of judicial mechanisms to address violations of the right to 
health, and promotes the use of quasi-judicial bodies and social mechanisms of 
accountability (para. 59) These include national ombudsmen, human rights commissions, 
consumer forums and patient&#8223;s rights associations.   
</p>
<p>52. Judicial accountability is one of the most critical and secure methods to achieving 
the full realization of the right to occupational health. Judicial review of violations of the 
right to health grants courts the power to subject State laws, policies, decisions and 
omissions affecting workers&#8223; occupational health to rights-based review. This also grants 
the judiciary the power to determine the normative content and scope of the right to health 
and promotes a national occupational health policy that is open, accountable, 
comprehensive, coherent and cooperative.55 Judicial accountability may therefore provide 
aggrieved workers with appropriate and adequate remedies and promote recognition of the 
right to occupational health by subjecting State laws and policies to judicial review.  
</p>
<p>53. Other accountability mechanisms may be used to ensure States meet their 
obligations under the right to occupational health. Quasi-judicial bodies, such as 
occupational health and safety commissions, may receive complaints about unsafe or 
unhealthy workplaces, investigate occupational health and safety in various work sectors, 
and conduct reviews of employer compliance with occupational health and safety 
standards. Commissions may also have the ability to hold hearings and make binding 
decisions imposing various sanctions. Social bodies such as workers&#8223; rights associations 
may similarly promote accountability through social mobilization and utilization of the 
media to pressure States to uphold their obligations under the right to health. 
</p>
<p>54. Administrative mechanisms, such as human rights impact assessments, may be used 
to facilitate prospective accountability.56 Human rights impact assessments require 
policymakers to examine the human rights effects of proposed laws, policies or 
programmes prior to finalization in order to ensure that they are compliant with human 
</p>
<p>  
 55 For example, article 21 of the Indian Constitution judicially interprets the right to life to include the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;protection of the health and strength of the worker,&#8221; and the Supreme Court of India has recognized 
workers&#8223; right to health and medical care [as] a fundamental right. In another judgment, the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Court of India ordered the &#8222;Government to ensure safety measures were implemented in factories in 
response to the deaths of workers due to occupational exposure to dust. 
</p>
<p> 56 Helen Potts, <i>Participation and the right to the highest attainable standard of health </i>(Essex, United 
Kingdom, University of Essex, Human Rights Centre, 2008), p. 20. </p>


<p>rights. Such assessments prioritize concerns of the most vulnerable groups and ensure they 
are included in the law- and policymaking process. In the context of occupational health, 
this requires States to work together with workers to ensure occupational health laws and 
policies comply with the right to health prior to implementation.  
</p>
<p>55. For example, free trade agreements often remove or weaken occupational health and 
safety regulations in order to facilitate trade and foreign direct investment. The right to 
health, however, requires that States prioritize occupational health protections over trade-
related concerns. Therefore, in order to facilitate prospective accountability and ensure that 
free trade agreements do not violate the right to occupational health, States must conduct 
human rights impacts assessments prior to signing any free trade agreement. 
</p>
<p>56. Transnational corporations have an obligation to respect their workers&#8223; right to 
occupational health, and States have a dual obligation in this respect. States in which 
transnational corporations are domiciled have the responsibility of holding these 
corporations accountable for violations of the right to occupational health occurring in 
foreign jurisdictions when the foreign States are unable or unwilling to do so. This includes 
violations committed by their foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures, partnerships with foreign 
companies or supply-chain relationships that may have distinct legal personality but 
nonetheless operate under the control of the parent corporation. This could be achieved 
through a variety of mechanisms, including administrative sanctions via the occupational 
health and safety regulatory body in the base country or the application of law with 
extraterritorial reach. States in which transnational corporations operate must hold these 
corporations directly accountable under relevant occupational health laws. Transnational 
corporations must not escape accountability due to their political and financial influence; 
claims that they do not fall within the host country&#8223;s legal jurisdiction; or assertions that 
they are not accountable for the actions of their foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures, 
partnerships with foreign companies or supply-chain relationships. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Remedies 
</b></p>
<p>57. The right to health entitles all victims of violations to adequate remedies. States 
must ensure workers are afforded access to adequate reparation, including restitution, 
compensation, satisfaction or guarantees of non-repetition, and that statutes of limitations 
do not interfere with access to remedies. Restitution requires that States restore the situation 
that existed prior to the violation. For example, if a statute regulating the use of hazardous 
materials in the workplace is repealed, resulting in workers falling ill, a remedy of 
restitution would require States to reinstate the law or draft a new law to address the 
lacunae. Monetary compensation should cover the cost of medical care, including 
rehabilitation, and any lost income arising from inability to work due to injury. Satisfaction 
includes a formal commitment by States, such as legislation or an executive order, to fulfil 
its obligation to realize the right to health of an individual or a specific population.  
</p>
<p>58. The obligation to provide adequate remedies requires that workers must have access 
to courts and other adjudicatory bodies where they may obtain financial compensation and 
other remedies for violations of their right to occupational health. If a worker&#8223;s right to 
occupational health is violated and the State has failed to put in place effective mechanisms 
to ensure that the employer provides the worker with an adequate remedy, the State has a 
direct obligation to remedy the violation. This responsibility accrues from the obligation to 
protect workers from violations of their right to health by third parties. Further, failure of 
the State to protect workers&#8223; right to occupational health in this circumstance may require 
an additional remedy of satisfaction and/or guarantee of non-repetition. 
</p>
<p>59. States have a direct obligation to provide workers in the informal economy with 
remedies for violations of their right to occupational health. Violations of the right to health </p>


<p>subject to direct State remediation include the failure of the State to implement components 
of the right to occupational health and claims arising from prior State commitments to 
implement the right. For example, if States fail to implement components of the right to 
occupational health, such as the inclusion of informal workers in the national occupational 
health policy, an appropriate remedy would be to reformulate the policy to address the 
occupational health of informal workers. Alternatively, if States have established a national 
social health insurance scheme covering workers in the informal economy, informal 
workers must have a private right of action to ensure that they are covered and that they 
receive appropriate benefits under the scheme. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The right to occupational health is an integral part of the right to health.  It 
complements existing occupational health approaches by addressing their deficits and 
</b></p>
<p><b>responding to the new challenges posed by globalization. The Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that States take the following steps in order to realize the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>occupational health: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Extend existing occupational health laws and policies to cover the 
</b></p>
<p><b>informal workforce, and establish innovative laws and policies to support direct 
</b></p>
<p><b>occupational health interventions in the informal economy, with special attention paid 
</b></p>
<p><b>to its gendered aspects. This should include: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Social health insurance programmes that cover all informal workers, 
</b></p>
<p><b>which, to the greatest extent possible, must be tailored to address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific occupational health risks faced by informal workers in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>respective sectors; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Occupational health services that are provided where informal workers 
</b></p>
<p><b>work;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Primary healthcare interventions that are designed to educate and train 
</b></p>
<p><b>informal workers about occupational health.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure that in cases where work is contractualized or informalized that 
</b></p>
<p><b>workers do not lose protections under existing occupational health laws and policies. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure mechanisms are in place to facilitate the active and informed 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation of workers, particularly informal workers, in the formulation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of occupational health laws and policies in a fair and transparent 
</b></p>
<p><b>process. These should include: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Direct and ongoing participation of existing worker</b>s&#8217; groups, including 
</p>
<p><b>trade unions and informal worker organizations, in law- and 
</b></p>
<p><b>policymaking bodies at all levels of  government; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Mechanisms by which workers may voice concerns and complaints 
</b></p>
<p><b>regarding the content of occupational health laws and policies directly to 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant parties; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Mechanisms by which workers may communicate occupational health 
</b></p>
<p><b>risks to the State and to other workers without risk of termination or 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecution; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Laws and policies that prioritize workers&#8217; right to information <b>affecting 
</b></p>
<p><b>thei</b>r occupational health over employers&#8217; rights to protect <b>commercial </b></p>


<p><b>information under commercial confidentiality, trade secret and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>related laws;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Whistle-blower protection for workers who disclose information 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerning their occupational health publicly or directly to the State. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure mechanisms are in place to monitor and evaluate occupational 
</b></p>
<p><b>health prior to the formulation and implementation of occupational health laws and 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies. These should include: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Disease and epidemiological surveillance, including the collection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>disaggregated data; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Human rights and health impact assessments and risk surveillance;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Development, with the direct participation of workers, of the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>health indicators and benchmarks, against which occupational health 
</b></p>
<p><b>laws and policies must be measured.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensure mechanisms are in place to monitor and evaluate occupational 
</b></p>
<p><b>health after the implementation of occupational health laws and policies. These should 
</b></p>
<p><b>include: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Development, with the direct participation of workers, of the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>health indicators and benchmarks, against which occupational health 
</b></p>
<p><b>laws and policies must be measured.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Utilize participatory research methods, such as community-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>participatory research, in order to monitor and evaluate occupational health both 
</b></p>
<p><b>prior to formulation and after the implementation of occupational health laws and 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Prevent, control and treat occupational diseases, with special attention to 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerable groups. In order to do so, States must ensure that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The relationship between the work environment and health is monitored 
</b></p>
<p><b>through State-led inspections of worksites and production facilities;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Information is disseminated in order to educate workers about work 
</b></p>
<p><b>and occupational health in a manner that can be easily understood by 
</b></p>
<p><b>workers;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Exposure to harmful substances in the workplace and home 
</b></p>
<p><b>environments that overlap with the workplace is restricted or 
</b></p>
<p><b>prohibited, including agricultural pesticides; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Occupational health services are available at easily accessible locations 
</b></p>
<p><b>and during hours that accommodate workers schedules, and include 
</b></p>
<p><b>rehabilitation of affected individuals back into the workplace; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Health workers are aware of the specific health risks faced by workers 
</b></p>
<p><b>and are trained to detect, prevent and treat occupational diseases. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Restrict the use of technologies in the workplace until their health effects 
</b></p>
<p><b>have been accurately assessed and communicated to workers, in accordance with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>precautionary principle. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Implement social health insurance for workers not covered by their 
</b></p>
<p><b>employers, which provides direct coverage or subsidizes the purchase of private 
</b></p>
<p><b>insurance. Insurance coverage should: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Include preventative, promotive and curative health services; </b></p>


<p>&#8226; <b>Be tailored to address the specific occupational health risks faced by 
</b></p>
<p><b>workers in their respective work sectors. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Ensure that prospective and retrospective accountability mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>are available and accessible to workers.  These should include:  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Social audits;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Consumer forums and patient&#8217;s rights associa<b>tions;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>National human rights ombudsmen;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Human rights and health impact assessments;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Human rights commissions;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Judicial review. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Incorporate the right to occupational health protections into all free 
</b></p>
<p><b>trade agreements and prioritize the occupational health of workers over trade 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerns. As a part of this process all free trade agreements should undergo a human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights impact assessment prior to conclusion of the agreement. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Establish legal and political mechanisms through which transnational 
</b></p>
<p><b>corporations are held accountable for violations of the right to occupational health, 
</b></p>
<p><b>either in the country where the corporation is domiciled or the host country.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) Ensure that all remedies are available and accessible to workers, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including restitution, compensation, satisfaction or guarantees of non-repetition, and
