<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 66/143 on 
the inadmissibility of certain practices that contribute to fuelling contemporary forms of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in which the Assembly 
requested the Special Rapporteur to prepare for submission to the Human Rights Council at 
its twentieth session a report on the implementation of that resolution.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur notes that a report including contributions received from 
States and other stakeholders on the implementation of General Assembly resolution 
66/143 will be submitted to the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, in accordance with 
paragraph 24 of said resolution. 
</p>
<p>3. In chapter II of the present report the Special Rapporteur addresses the human rights 
and democratic challenges posed by extremist political parties, movements and groups in 
the context of the current economic crisis. He examines the use of the Internet and social 
media by extremist political parties, movements and groups in chapter III and considers the 
adverse effects of such phenomena on youth in chapter IV. In chapter V, the Special 
Rapporteur raises the need for preventive measures to address extremism in sport, while 
chapter V contains his conclusions and recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Addressing the human rights and democratic challenges 
posed by extremist political parties, movements and groups 
in the context of the current economic crisis 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Democratic challenges posed by extremist political parties, movements 
</b></p>
<p><b>and groups in the context of the current economic crisis  
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the current economic and financial crisis 
and its consequences on poverty and unemployment may have further contributed to the 
rise of extremist political parties, movements and groups, and exacerbated identity-related 
issues. Indeed, societies have become more and more diverse in terms of cultural and ethnic 
origin and religious affiliation, and in some instances, such diversity has led to identity-
related tensions that have been exploited in the context of the current economic crisis by 
some extremist political parties to incite discrimination and hatred against specific groups. 
In some countries, it has been reported that the financial aspects of the crisis have rekindled 
old negative stereotypes and racial prejudices against members of minorities such as the 
Roma. Furthermore, in some regions, fear and discontent occasioned by social and 
economic problems such as pauperisation, unemployment and budget cuts in social benefits 
have manifested themselves in votes in favour of extremist political parties, including those 
with racist and xenophobic programmes. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that in some 
instances this has led to the electoral success of such political parties, which are, for the 
first time, gaining seats in national parliaments. For instance, it was reported that this year, 
far-right political parties, which did not previously enjoy representation in national 
parliaments, have managed to obtain seats in the context of austerity policies and measures 
implemented in response to the economic crisis at the national level. In other countries, 
extremist political parties have become the third political party, with an increased number 
of seats in national parliaments, which gives them more influence in the political arena and 
the national legislature. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that in this context vulnerable 
groups have been particularly targeted and stigmatized. Indeed, reports received indicate 
that the tendency of political leaders to promote their platforms in ethnic terms, while </p>


<p>stigmatizing other peoples and blaming them for any problems experienced, appears to 
have grown. In this connection, it appears that extremist political parties have effectively 
placed the burden of the negative consequences of the crisis on minorities, foreigners, 
migrants, including irregular migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. These groups have 
been labelled as a threat to the standard of living of the general population and blamed for 
being responsible for the rise in unemployment and the State debt. Reports received 
indicate that Muslim populations have also been particularly singled out and stigmatized, 
especially during electoral campaigns carried out this year in some countries, including at 
the presidential level. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that some traditional political parties have also 
engaged in the rhetoric of extremist political parties and have scapegoated vulnerable 
groups, instead of using rational and objective arguments to counter the rather simplistic 
solutions often put forward by extremist political parties to solve the political, societal and 
economic problems resulting from the crisis. The previous mandate holder had already 
pointed out the sometimes equivocal position taken by mainstream political parties towards 
extremist political parties, including through coalitions formed with such parties and the 
fuelling of populist ideas during electoral campaigns (A/HRC/15/45; A/HRC/18/44). In 
order not to lose part of their electorate, some traditional political parties and leaders 
continue to favour nationalistic rhetoric that is sometimes openly racist and xenophobic. 
For instance, it was reported that some mainstream political parties, like extremist political 
parties, have repeatedly, based their electoral campaigns on the rhetoric of national identity, 
threats posed by foreigners and migrants, including irregular migrants, to the economy, 
employment, security and national identity. The problem is that the spiral of scapegoating 
creates a climate in which such rhetoric may increasingly be seen as the norm. Indeed, it 
was reported that traditional political parties and politicians, including high-level political 
leaders, do not always condemn such discourse and rhetoric. Yet the absence of 
condemnation may send a wrong signal that the ideas promoted by extremist political 
parties are acceptable, despite the fact that they represent a danger to democracy and the 
cohesion of societies. The Special Rapporteur calls on traditional political parties and 
leaders to take a strong public stance against extremist political parties and politicians who 
propagate racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. He also urges 
all politicians and political parties to break out of the spiral of intolerant, racist and 
xenophobic discourse that seeks primarily to blame, and above all serves to inflame 
tensions rather than build mutual understanding and respect. Furthermore, the Special 
Rapporteur emphasizes that it is equally important that such a stance be taken by traditional 
political parties against expressions of intolerance, racism and xenophobia when these 
expressions come from their own ranks.  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Persistence of racial violence against vulnerable groups  
</b></p>
<p>6. As stated above, in this period of economic crisis, non-citizens, members of 
minorities, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers are still the main scapegoats of extremist 
political parties with a xenophobic and racist agenda, which blame them for the social 
problems of the population and sometimes incite racial discrimination and violence against 
them. Indeed, an increase in incidents involving racist violence perpetrated by extremist 
movements and groups, including neo-Nazis, skinheads, and other right-wing movements 
were reported in some countries. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about 
reported cases of violence and harassment perpetrated by neo-Nazis and skinheads against </p>


<p>individuals of African descent.1 He is also concerned by information indicating that Roma 
continue to be at a high risk of racist and xenophobic violence by individuals or groups 
closely linked to extremist political parties, movements and groups. For instance it was 
reported that groups of neo-Nazi armed with knives and metal sticks attacked Roma 
settlements where Roma children, women and older people lived. Furthermore, according 
to information received, threatening fascist ideology messages and swastikas are frequently 
tagged on Roma&#8217;s houses or near Roma settlements.2 Of particular concern are also reports 
indicating that in some countries, Muslims and Jews have been targeted by individuals or 
groups linked to extremist political parties, movements or groups. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned, inter alia, about reports of physical attacks against Muslims and 
Jews, perpetrated by individuals belonging to extreme right-wing movements; paintings of 
Swastikas on monuments dedicated to the victims of the Holocaust3 and anti-Semitic acts 
committed by neo-Nazi groups registered as legal entities under different names.4 
</p>
<p>7. Xenophobia against foreigners, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers is a 
predictable trend in many parts of the world when the economic situation deteriorates, and 
this should be carefully addressed by all actors. Indeed, according to information received, 
extremist groups and movements inciting racial hatred and violence against migrants 
continue to operate in a number of countries. It was reported for instance, that several 
marches against irregular migrants were organized by individuals belonging to far-right 
groups, followed by violent attacks against migrants.5 Foreigners, including foreign 
students, have also been targeted. In this regard, it was reported that raids have been 
organized by far-right groups on dormitories where a number of foreign students were 
living. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that in some instances, activities by individuals 
linked to extremist groups or movements, including for instance the distribution of leaflets 
and posters propagating hatred against migrants have contributed to increased hostility 
against foreigners and migrants among the local population.6 In addition, it was reported 
that in some countries, anti-immigrant border vigilante groups have attacked, harassed and 
sometimes killed individuals they perceived to be irregular migrants. In this connection, the 
Special Rapporteur warns States about the adoption and implementation of policy and 
legislative measures targeting migrants &#8211; especially irregular migrants &#8211; that may contribute 
to exacerbating xenophobic violence and hostility against them. He calls on States to ensure 
that those responsible are prosecuted and sanctioned.  
</p>
<p>8. While minorities, migrants, foreigners, asylum seekers and refugees continue to be 
the main victims of racist and xenophobic violence by individuals linked to extremist 
political parties, movements or groups, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that such 
individuals also target persons on the basis of their sexual orientation. In this regard, he is 
deeply concerned about information received recently regarding the death of a young gay 
man of 24 years old, following a brutal attack by individuals linked to a neo-Nazi group, 
who beat him unconscious and cut swastikas on his chest and arms with a broken bottle.

<p>The Special Rapporteur draws the attention of States and relevant actors to prejudice and 
behaviour that tends to stigmatize and place individuals into a single category. Like his 
predecessor, he recalls that the identity of each individual is made up of a multitude of 
components, including gender, age, nationality, profession, sexual orientation, political 
opinion, religious affiliation and social origin (A/HRC/14/43, para. 13). He calls for further 
tolerance, mutual understanding and respect for all, without prejudice, stereotyping or 
discrimination of any kind. In this regard, it is essential that appropriate measures be taken 
by States to address the multiple and often interlinked forms of discrimination faced by 
individuals on the basis of their race, colour, descent, national or ethnic origin and sexual 
orientation.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur shares the view of the High Commissioner that States 
should investigate promptly all reported killings and other serious incidents of violence 
perpetrated against individuals because of their actual or perceived sexual orientation or 
gender identity, whether carried out in public or in private by State or non-State actors 
(A/HRC/19/41, para. 84 (a)), including extremist movements and groups, and to hold the 
perpetrators accountable. Indeed, reports received indicate that racist, xenophobic and 
intolerant acts perpetrated by persons belonging or linked to extremist political parties, 
movements and groups are not always prosecuted or adequately sanctioned. In this regard, 
the Special Rapporteur received information about a case regarding the murder of nine 
migrants by a neo-Nazi group during a 13-year crime spree, which the authorities allegedly 
failed to adequately investigate. Cases of law enforcement agents, including the police, 
refusing to record and investigate acts of racial violence perpetrated by individuals linked to 
extremist movements, groups or political parties were also often reported. Yet without 
investigation and prosecution, the rights of the victims to justice, including access to 
effective remedies and reparation, remain hampered. Some reports further indicate that in 
some instances, police officers did not intervene to stop harassment, verbal abuse and 
violent attacks targeting, in particular, members of minorities, including Roma. Similarly, 
the Special Rapporteur notes with concern that racist crimes committed by individuals 
linked to extremist groups are sometimes sanctioned by light sentences. As an illustration, 
he highlights the case reported about a neo-Nazi supporter who was sentenced to 400 hours 
of community labour for having gravely attacked a Roma.7  
</p>
<p>10. While the Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation measures taken to end the 
recruitment of police officers from extreme right-wing groups, and specific training 
provided by civil society actors to law enforcement agents on recognizing and dealing with 
hate crimes as well as threats posed by extremist movements and groups, he urges States to 
duly prosecute and sanction those responsible for racist and xenophobic violence, while 
taking into account the rights and interests of the victims. He also urges States to ensure 
that mandatory training on human rights, including on how to address racially motivated 
crimes committed by individuals linked to extremist political parties, movements and 
groups, are provided to law enforcement agents, including the police. Furthermore, the lack 
of data remains an important obstacle to effectively addressing racist, xenophobic and 
intolerant crimes by individuals closely linked to extremist political parties, movements and 
groups. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur reiterates, as his predecessor, the importance 
of collecting accurate data on racist and xenophobic crimes. He further encourages States 
and civil society actors to establish systems for recording, reporting and monitoring racist 
incidents and to encourage the victims of racist acts to report them.

<p><b> III. Challenging the use of the Internet and social media by 
extremist political parties, movements and groups  
</b></p>
<p>11. In his report (A/HRC/18/44), the previous mandate holder expressed concern about 
the increased use of the Internet by individuals and groups of individuals closely linked to 
extremist movements to disseminate racist ideas and propagate racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. Reports received recently confirm that 
extremist political parties, movements and groups are still actively present on the Internet, 
including through material published on their website or in the web pages of sympathizing 
organizations that promote and incite racial discrimination and violence, and that their use 
of the Internet remain of particular concern.8 Furthermore the Internet not only remains an 
important channel for extremist movements and groups to spread hate speech and incite 
racial violence and abuse against specific groups of individuals, but it has also been used as 
a means to expand their networks of individuals, movements and groups worldwide. In this 
regard, some reports indicate that exchanges between right-wing extremists through social 
networking sites and YouTube are more and more ubiquitous. It was also reported that the 
Internet is used by a number of extremist movements and groups, especially far right-wing 
movements, as the perfect recruitment platform for potential new members, as it enables 
easy invitations to various events and meet-ups without distance constraints. The Special 
Rapporteur also received information about overtly anti-Semitic statements in ultra-
nationalist or far right-wing publications posted on the Internet that are reportedly often 
made with impunity.9 Cases of persons being attacked following the publication of their 
personal details in a list of anti-fascist activists on a neo-Nazi website were also reported.10  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur is alarmed by the use of the Internet and social media by 
extremist groups and individuals to disseminate racist ideas and propagate racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. However, he reiterates that the Internet 
and social media can also be a useful tool for preventing the spread of racist ideologies by 
extremist political parties, groups and movements. In this connection, he welcomes 
information received about projects set up at the national level by civil society groups with 
the support of public authorities, including the creation of a social network-based platform 
targeting young people and aiming specifically at countering right-wing extremism and 
fostering a democratic culture. Reports received indicate that young people of all social 
backgrounds are interested in politics, although there is still a lack of sufficient knowledge 
of the challenges posed by extremist political parties, movements and groups. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur urges States to sensitize children and youth, including 
through human rights classes, about the challenges that such parties, groups, and 
movements pose to democracy, especially with regard to the principle of non-
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>13. Like his predecessor, the Special Rapporteur encourages States to use the 
opportunities provided by new technologies, including the Internet, to counter the 
dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred. He warns States about any 
attempt to unduly limit the right to freedom of expression when adopting measures to 
counter extremist political parties, movements and groups. In this regard, he calls on States

<p>to fully respect their obligations under articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and reiterates, like his predecessor, that determining which acts or 
expressions may meet the thresholds determined in articles 19 to 20 of the Covenant and 
article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination is ultimately a decision that is best made by an independent and impartial 
court or tribunal in accordance with international standards, after a thorough assessment of 
the individual circumstances of each case (A/HRC/18/44, para. 30).  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Preventing the adverse effects of extremist political parties, 
movements and groups on youth  
</b></p>
<p>14. It is a major concern that youth are particularly vulnerable to extremist political 
parties, movements and groups, including neo-Nazis, skinhead groups and similar extremist 
ideological movements. A similar issue was already raised by the Committee on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination which expressed its concern at the rise 
in xenophobic and right-wing tendencies among youth and at the reported growth in 
outreach activities by extremist organizations using electronic social networks to expand 
their propaganda specifically among youth.11 In this regard, repeated attacks against 
foreigners and members of minorities by young extremists were reported, including a 
specific case regarding the attack on foreign students by a group of high school students, 
who reportedly had an initiation video of a far-right activist group on their mobiles.12 
According to information received in some countries, violent racist attacks are often 
committed by groups of skinhead youth who are not necessarily members of structured 
right-wing organizations or formally registered groups, but rather belong to a skinhead 
subculture. In this regard, it was reported that such attacks are frequently severe, resulting 
in serious wounding by beating, knifing or shooting.13 Furthermore, extremist movements 
and groups, including neo-Nazis, reportedly often use fashion to get their ideologies 
accepted, including through stores selling fashion brands popular among neo-Nazis that 
attract young people. It was reported that such shops serve for networking and have also 
become meeting points for local neo-Nazi groups, where &#8220;cool&#8221; brands give their young 
customers a sense of belonging. According to information received in some countries, 
music concerts have been used by extreme right wing and neo-Nazi groups as a space to 
spread their ideology,14 attract young people and recruit new members, including 
unemployed youth. 
</p>
<p>15. Specific awareness-raising campaigns aimed at preventing and dissuading youth 
from joining extremist political parties, movements and groups, including neo-Nazi and 
skinhead groups and similar extremist ideological movements, should be carried out. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes information provided about campaigns launched 
in schools by civil society organizations to raise awareness about neo-Nazi ideology. He 
emphasizes that human rights education is a key tool in countering the rise of extremist 
political parties, movements and groups among the young generation, and building a 
society based on pluralism, tolerance, respect for cultural diversity, multiculturalism and 
non-discrimination. Furthermore, while it is important to educate and sensitize youth about

<p>human rights and the principle of non-discrimination, it is equally essential to sensitize 
parents and teachers. Indeed, reports received indicate that youth are also influenced by 
extremist ideas based on racial superiority and hatred at homes.  
</p>
<p><b> V. The need for preventive measures to address extremism in 
sport  
</b></p>
<p>16. The presence of extremist groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups in the 
field of sport, in particular football, is also an important concern that arises from 
information received by the Special Rapporteur. In this regard, he is concerned about 
reported cases of Nazi symbols and banners deployed during football matches, as well as 
the shouting and show of Nazi slogans and gestures on those occasions, often directed at 
players or supporters of African origin.15 The Special Rapporteur calls on States and all 
relevant actors, including football federations, to deal with the presence of extremist 
groups, including neo-Nazi and skinhead groups, as well as hooligans at sports events, 
including football matches. Indeed, in light of upcoming sports events, including the Union 
of European Football Associations (UEFA) Euro 2012 championship and the Olympics, it 
is crucial that preventive measures be taken to avoid acts of racial violence, abuse and 
incitement to racial hatred by extremist individuals or groups. In this regard, initiatives, 
such as a handbook to assist law enforcement officials in identifying racist symbols used by 
supporters and fans, including neo-Nazi and skinhead members, as well as preventive 
measures aimed at fostering tolerance and respect are encouraged by the Special 
Rapporteur. He also encourages national and international sports organizations and 
federations to develop and implement codes of conduct that would address the issue of 
extremist ideologies and behaviours among supporters. In addition, such events could be 
used as an opportunity for host States to further promote human rights, democracy and the 
rule of law, and to address human rights and democratic challenges posed by extremist 
political parties, movements and groups. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>17. <b>The rise in extremist political parties, movements and groups, including neo-
Nazi and skinhead groups and similar extremist ideological movements, continue to 
</b></p>
<p><b>pose major human rights and democratic challenges. The Special Rapporteur notes 
</b></p>
<p><b>with concern that the economic crisis in different parts of the world may have further 
</b></p>
<p><b>aggravated this trend. He acknowledges that a number of efforts have been taken by 
</b></p>
<p><b>States and civil society actors to address the problem, but he is of the view that more 
</b></p>
<p><b>needs to be done in order to effectively counter such phenomenon which threaten 
</b></p>
<p><b>democracy, affect vulnerable groups and have spread its roots among the young 
</b></p>
<p><b>generation. Greater efforts and increased vigilance from States and all relevant actors 
</b></p>
<p><b>are therefore required. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur shares the view that a 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive approach based on a solid legal framework that also includes key 
</b></p>
<p><b>complementary measures should be developed and implemented. The Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur emphasizes that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>outcome document of the Durban Review Conference and the International 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination constitute a 
</b></p>
<p><b>major comprehensive framework to be implemented in this respect. 
</b></p>
<p>  
 15 Ibid. </p>


<p>18. <b>As long as extremist political parties, movements and groups continue to exist, 
they will remain a major challenge to democracy. In this regard, States should always 
</b></p>
<p><b>bear in mind that preserving and consolidating democracy is essential to effectively 
</b></p>
<p><b>preventing and combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</b></p>
<p><b>intolerance. Therefore the Special Rapporteur recommends, as did the previous 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandate holder, that respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law be the 
</b></p>
<p><b>cornerstone of any programme or activity developed by political parties. He further 
</b></p>
<p><b>urges political leaders and political parties to refrain from disseminating discourses 
</b></p>
<p><b>that scapegoat vulnerable groups. On the contrary, political leaders and political 
</b></p>
<p><b>parties have an important responsibility to explicitly and strongly condemn all 
</b></p>
<p><b>political messages that disseminate ideas based on racial superiority or hatred and 
</b></p>
<p><b>that incite racial discrimination or xenophobia. Political leaders and political parties 
</b></p>
<p><b>are therefore urged to promote multiculturalism within their societies, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>tolerance and mutual understanding and respect.  
</b></p>
<p>19. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that appropriate legislation conforming 
to international human rights standards be adopted by States to prevent and address 
</b></p>
<p><b>such phenomenon. In this regard, he recalls that according to article 4 of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>States parties shall:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a)  Declare as an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based 
</b></p>
<p><b>on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts 
</b></p>
<p><b>of violence, or incitement to such acts, against any race or group of persons of another 
</b></p>
<p><b>colour or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to conduct racist 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities, including the financing thereof; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b)  Declare illegal and prohibit organizations and all organized and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>propaganda activities which promote and incite racial discrimination, and recognize 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation in such organizations or activities as an offence punishable by law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c)  Not permit public authorities or public institutions, national or local, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>promote or incite racial discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p><b>In this connection, it is crucial to introduce into domestic criminal law a provision to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the effect that the commission of an offence with racist or xenophobic motivation or 
</b></p>
<p><b>aim constitutes an aggravating circumstance attracting heavier sanctions. 
</b></p>
<p>20. <b>Any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes 
weakens the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such 
</b></p>
<p><b>acts. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that States ensure that those responsible for 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes with racist or xenophobic motivation are prosecuted and adequately 
</b></p>
<p><b>sanctioned. In this connection, prompt, thorough and impartial investigations are 
</b></p>
<p><b>crucial as a first step towards ensuring justice for the victims and fighting impunity. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Victims should be provided with effective access to legal remedies, including the right 
</b></p>
<p><b>to seek just and adequate reparation for any damage suffered as a result of a racist or 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobic crime. 
</b></p>
<p>21. <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that States collect data on racist 
and xenophobic crimes in order to identify the types of offences committed, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>characteristics of the victims and of the perpetrators, including whether they are 
</b></p>
<p><b>affiliated with an extremist political party, movement or group. Such data would 
</b></p>
<p><b>further enable a better assessment of the effectiveness of measures taken to address 
</b></p>
<p><b>racist crimes. The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the necessary financial, 
</b></p>
<p><b>human and technical resources be provided to improve the quality of data-collection 
</b></p>
<p><b>systems where they already exist, while ensuring that civil society is involved in this 
</b></p>
<p><b>process.  </b></p>


<p>22. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the capacity of law enforcement 
agents and members of the judiciary to address crimes motivated by racist or 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobic attitudes be strengthened through adequate and mandatory human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>training, including training with specific focus on racist and xenophobic crimes 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrated by individuals linked to extremist political parties, groups and 
</b></p>
<p><b>movements. Law enforcement agents should also be provided with the necessary 
</b></p>
<p><b>instructions, procedures and resources to identify, investigate and register such 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes. Like his predecessor, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that States should 
</b></p>
<p><b>also ensure that law enforcement agents further engage with vulnerable groups who 
</b></p>
<p><b>are at particular risk of racist or xenophobic crimes, in order to reduce their fear, 
</b></p>
<p><b>restore confidence in law enforcement officers and allow for better reporting of racist 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes.  
</b></p>
<p>23. <b>A significant challenge posed by extremist political parties, movements and 
groups is the need to ensure full respect for human rights and democratic principles, 
</b></p>
<p><b>while adopting measures to counter the rise of such phenomenon. In this context, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>positive role that freedom of expression can play in promoting democracy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>combating racist and xenophobic ideologies based on racial superiority should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>stressed. Indeed, States should take all opportunities, including those provided by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Internet, to counter the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred 
</b></p>
<p><b>and promote the values of equality, non-discrimination, diversity and democracy. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Therefore the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that States respect their 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations under articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Political Rights which guarantee the rights to freedom of expression and determine 
</b></p>
<p><b>the limitations thereto.  
</b></p>
<p>24. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that concrete steps be taken to raise 
awareness among youth about the adverse effects of the ideologies and activities of 
</b></p>
<p><b>extremist political parties, movements and groups, including neo-Nazi and skinhead 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups and similar extremist ideological movements. He recalls that education 
</b></p>
<p><b>remains one of the most effective means of countering the negative influence that 
</b></p>
<p><b>extremist political parties, movements and groups may have on youth. Reiterating the 
</b></p>
<p><b>call in the Durban Programme of Action (para. 136),  he urges States to ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>education and training, especially teacher training, promote respect for human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</b></p>
<p><b>intolerance, and that educational institutions implement policies and programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b>agreed by the relevant authorities on equal opportunities, anti-racism, gender equality 
</b></p>
<p><b>and cultural, religious and other diversity, with the participation of teachers, parents 
</b></p>
<p><b>and students, and follow up on their implementation.  
</b></p>
<p>25. <b>In the light of the upcoming sports events in 2012, including the UEFA Euro 
2012 championship and the Olympics, the Special Rapporteur calls on States to 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen measures to prevent racist and xenophobic incidents on these occasions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including by individuals or groups of individuals linked to extremist movements and 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups. He reiterates the key role of sport in promoting cultural diversity, tolerance 
</b></p>
<p><b>and harmony and recommends that States take advantage of such events to promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>racial harmony. The Special Rapporteur further recalls the Durban Programme of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Action (para. 218) which urges States, in cooperation with intergovernmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations, the International Olympic Committee and international and regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>sports federations, to intensify the fight against racism in sport by, among other 
</b></p>
<p><b>things, educating the youth of the world through sport practised without 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires human 
</b></p>
<p><b>understanding, tolerance, fair play and solidarity. </b></p>


<p>26. <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that States closely cooperate 
with all the relevant actors, including civil society and national human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions, in order to effectively prevent and address the challenges posed by 
</b></p>
<p><b>extremist political parties, movements and groups, including neo-Nazi and skinhead 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups and similar extremist ideological movements.
