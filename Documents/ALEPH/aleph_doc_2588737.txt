GLOSSARY OF TERMS
 
Bbl.  One stock tank barrel or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume.
 
Bcf.  Billion cubic feet.
 
Boe.  One barrel of oil equivalent, determined using a ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of
crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids.
 
Boe/d.  Barrels of oil equivalent per day.
 
Btu.  British thermal unit, which is the heat required to raise the temperature of a one-pound mass of
water from 58.5 to 59.5 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
Developed acreage.  The number of acres that are allocated or assignable to productive wells or
wells capable of production.
 
Development project.  A drilling or other project which may target proven reserves, but which
generally has a lower risk than that associated with exploration projects.
Development well.  A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or natural gas reservoir to the
depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
 
Dry hole or well.  A well found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities
such that proceeds from the sale of such production would exceed production expenses and taxes.
 
Field.  An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the
same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition.
 
Gross acres or gross wells.  The total acres or wells, as the case may be, in which a working interest
is owned.
Hydrocarbons.  Oil, NGL and natural gas are all collectively considered hydrocarbons.
 
Liquids.  Oil and NGLs.
MBbls.  One thousand barrels of crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons.
 
MBoe.  One thousand barrels of crude oil equivalent, using a ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one
Bbl of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids.
Mcf.  One thousand cubic feet.
MGal.  One thousand gallons of natural gas liquids or other liquid hydrocarbons.
 
MMBbls.  One million barrels of crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons.
 
MMBoe.  One million barrels of crude oil equivalent, using a ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl
of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids.
 
MMBtu.  One million British thermal units.
 
MMcf.  One million cubic feet.
Net acres or net wells.  The sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres or gross
wells, as the case may be.
 
NGL or natural gas liquids.  The combination of ethane, propane, butane and natural gasolines that
when removed from natural gas become liquid under various levels of higher pressure and lower
temperature.
 
NYMEX.  New York Mercantile Exchange.
Page 3
Oil.  Crude oil and condensate.
 
Productive well.  A well that is found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient
quantities such that proceeds from the sale of such production exceed production expenses and
taxes.
 
Proved developed reserves.  Reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells
with existing equipment and operating methods. Additional oil and natural gas expected to be
obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for
supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery are included in “proved
developed reserves” only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program
has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved.
 
Proved developed non-producing reserves or PDNPs.  Proved oil and natural gas reserves that are
developed behind pipe, shut-in or that can be recovered through improved recovery only after the
necessary equipment has been installed, or when the costs to do so are relatively minor. Shut-in
reserves are expected to be recovered from (1) completion intervals which are open at the time of
the estimate but which have not started producing, (2) wells that were shut-in for market conditions
or pipeline connections, or (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons. Behind-pipe
reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells that will require additional
completion work or future recompletion prior to the start of production.
 
Proved reserves.  Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which by analysis
of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically
producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic
conditions, operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts
providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain,
regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
 
Proved undeveloped drilling location.  A site on which a development well can be drilled consistent
with spacing rules for purposes of recovering proved undeveloped reserves.
 
Proved undeveloped reserves or PUDs.  Proved oil and natural gas reserves that are expected to
be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major
expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those drilling
units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled. Proved
reserves for other undrilled units are claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that
there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation. Estimates for proved
undeveloped reserves are not attributed to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or
other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proven
effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir.
 
Recompletion.  The completion for production of an existing wellbore in another formation from that
which the well has been previously completed.
 
Reserve acquisition cost.  The total consideration paid for an oil and natural gas property or set of
properties, which includes the cash purchase price and any value ascribed to units issued to a
seller adjusted for any post-closing items.
 
R/P ratio (reserve life).  The reserves as of the end of a period divided by the production volumes for
the same period.
 
Reserve replacement.  The replacement of oil and natural gas produced with reserve additions from
acquisitions, reserve additions and reserve revisions.
 
Reserve replacement cost.  An amount per Boe equal to the sum of costs incurred relating to oil and
natural gas property acquisition, exploitation, development and exploration activities (as reflected in
our year-end financial statements for the relevant year) divided by the sum of all additions and
revisions to estimated proved reserves, including reserve purchases. The calculation of reserve
additions for each year is based upon the reserve report of our independent engineers.
Management uses reserve replacement cost to compare our company to others in terms of our
historical ability to increase our reserve base in an economic manner. However, past performance
does not necessarily reflect future reserve replacement cost performance. For example, increases in
oil and natural gas prices in recent years have increased the economic life of reserves, adding
additional reserves with no required capital expenditures. On the other hand, increases in oil and
natural gas prices have increased the cost of reserve purchases and reserves added through
development projects. The reserve replacement cost may not be indicative of the economic value
added of the reserves due to differing lease operating expenses per barrel and differing timing of
production.
Reservoir.  A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of
producible oil and/or natural gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is
individual and separate from other reserves.
Page 4
Standardized measure.  The present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from
the production of proved reserves, determined in accordance with assumptions required by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission (using the
average annual prices based on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month
price for each month) without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as general and
administrative expenses, debt service and future income tax expenses or to depreciation, depletion
and amortization and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. Because we are a limited
partnership that allocates our taxable income to our unitholders, no provisions for federal or state
income taxes have been provided for in the calculation of standardized measure. Standardized
measure does not give effect to derivative transactions.
 
Undeveloped acreage.  Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point
that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of
whether such acreage contains proved reserves.
 
Working interest.  The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct
operating activities on the property and a share of production.
 
Workover.  Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
(1)Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a)Organization, Basis of Presentation and Description of Business
Legacy Reserves LP ("LRLP," "Legacy" or the "Partnership") and, unless the context indicates
otherwise, its affiliated entities, are referred to as Legacy in these financial statements.
 
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the
accrual basis of accounting whereby revenues are recognized when earned, and expenses are
recognized when incurred. These condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2016
and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited. In the opinion of
management, such financial statements include the adjustments and accruals, all of which are of a
normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim
periods. These interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) have
been condensed or omitted in this Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These condensed consolidated financial statements should be
read in connection with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the
Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
LRLP, a Delaware limited partnership, was formed by its general partner, Legacy Reserves GP,
LLC (“LRGPLLC”), on October 26, 2005 to own and operate oil and natural gas properties.
LRGPLLC is a Delaware limited liability company formed on October 26, 2005, and owns an
approximate 0.03% general partner interest in LRLP.
Significant information regarding rights of unitholders includes the following:
•Right to receive, within 45 days after the end of each quarter, distributions of available cash, if
distributions are declared.
•No limited partner shall have any management power over LRLP’s business and affairs; the
general partner shall conduct, direct and manage LRLP’s activities.
•The general partner may be removed if such removal is approved by the unitholders holding at
least 66 2/3 percent of the outstanding units, including units held by LRGPLLC and its affiliates,
provided that a unit majority has elected a successor general partner.
•Right to receive information reasonably required for tax reporting purposes within 90 days after the
close of the calendar year.
 
In the event of liquidation, after making required payments to Legacy's preferred unitholders, all
property and cash in excess of that required to discharge all liabilities will be distributed to the
unitholders and LRGPLLC in proportion to their capital account balances, as adjusted to reflect any
gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of Legacy’s assets in liquidation.
 
Legacy owns and operates oil and natural gas producing properties located primarily in the Permian
Basin (West Texas and Southeast New Mexico), East Texas, Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent
regions of the United States.

"Prepaid expenses and other current assets" line. The restricted cash amounts represent various
deposits to secure the performance of contracts, surety bonds and other obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business. There was no restricted cash recorded at December 31, 2015.
(d) Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-02, "Leases" ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use
(ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet
for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or
operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for
lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the
earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients
available. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our
consolidated financial statements.
In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, "Disclosure of
Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern" (“ASU 2014-15”). ASU
2014-15 requires management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to
provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The standard is effective for annual
periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of
ASU 2014-15 and do not anticipate any impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("ASU
2014-09"), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are
transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be
entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core
principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue
recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. In August 2015, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("ASU 2015-14"), which approved a
one-year delay of the standard's effective date. In accordance with ASU 2015-14, the standard is
now effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein,
using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the
application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical
expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-
09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). We are
currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated
financial statements and do not anticipate the standard will have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.
(e)Prior Year Financial Statement Presentation
Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation of
balances as stated in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Please read Note 2—Long-Term Debt for
further discussion regarding this reclassification.

In order to comply with Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, unamortized debt issuance
costs are now recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt. As such, debt
issuance costs have been reclassified from other assets to long-term debt on a retrospective
basis. This reclassification had no impact on historical income from continuing operations or
retained earnings.
Credit Facility
On April 1, 2014, Legacy entered into a five-year $1.5 billion secured revolving credit facility with
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, Compass Bank, as syndication
agent, UBS Securities LLC and U.S. Bank National Association, as co-documentation agents and
the lenders party thereto (the “Current Credit Agreement”). Borrowings under the Current Credit
Agreement mature on April 1, 2019. Legacy's obligations under the Current Credit Agreement are
secured by mortgages on over 90% of the total value of its oil and natural gas properties as well as
a pledge of all of its ownership interests in its operating subsidiaries. The amount available for
borrowing at any one time is limited to the borrowing base and contains a $2 million sub-limit for
letters of credit. The borrowing base is currently set at $630 million. The borrowing base is subject
to semi-annual redeterminations on or about April 1 and October 1 of each year with the next
redetermination scheduled for October 2016. Additionally, either Legacy or the lenders may, once
during each calendar year, elect to redetermine the borrowing base between scheduled
redeterminations. Legacy also has the right, once during each calendar year, to request the
redetermination of the borrowing base upon the proposed acquisition of certain oil and natural gas
properties where the purchase price is greater than 10% of the borrowing base then in effect. Any
increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of all the lenders and any decrease in or
maintenance of the borrowing base must be approved by the lenders holding at least 66-2/3% of the
outstanding aggregate principal amounts of the loans or participation interests in letters of credit
issued under the Current Credit Agreement. If the requisite lenders do not agree on an increase or
decrease, then the borrowing base will be the highest borrowing base acceptable to the lenders
holding 66-2/3% of the outstanding aggregate principal amounts of the loans or participation
interests in letters of credit issued under the Current Credit Agreement so long as it does not
increase the borrowing base then in effect.
Page 13
Our Current Credit Agreement also contains covenants that, among other things, require us to
maintain specified ratios or conditions as follows:
first lien debt to EBITDA for the four fiscal quarters ending on last day of the fiscal quarter
immediately preceding the date of determination for which financial statements are available to be
•
•
•less than: (i) 3.50 to 1.00, at any time during the period from and including February 19, 2016
through December 31, 2016, (ii) 3.25 to 1.00, at any time during the fiscal quarter ending March 31,
2017, (iii) 3.00 to 1.00, at any time during the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2017 and (iv) 2.50 to
1.00, at any time on or after July 1, 2017;
as of the last day of the most recent quarter, total EBITDA over the last four quarters to total Interest
Expense over the last four quarters to be greater than (i) 2.50 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending
December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, (ii) 2.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending June 30,
2016, September 30, 2016, December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017 and (iii) 2.50
to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter ending on or after September 30, 2017; and
consolidated current assets, as of the last day of the most recent quarter and including the unused
amount of the total commitments, to consolidated current liabilities as of the last day of the most
recent quarter of not less than 1.0 to 1.0, excluding non-cash assets and liabilities under ASC 815,
which includes the current portion of oil, natural gas and interest rate derivatives.
As of June 30, 2016, Legacy was in compliance with all financial and other covenants of the Current
Credit Agreement. Depending on oil and natural gas prices in 2016, Legacy could breach certain
financial covenants under its revolving credit facility, which would constitute a default under its
revolving credit facility. Such default, if not remedied, would require a waiver from Legacy's lenders
in order for it to avoid an event of default and subsequent acceleration of all amounts outstanding
under its revolving credit facility and potential foreclosure on its oil and natural gas properties. If the
lenders under Legacy's revolving credit facility were to accelerate the indebtedness under its
revolving credit facility as a result of a default, such acceleration could cause a cross-default of all of
its other outstanding indebtedness, including its 8% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Senior
Notes") and its 6.625% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Senior Notes" and, together with the
2020 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”), and permit the holders of such indebtedness to accelerate
the maturities of such indebtedness. While no assurances can be made that, in the event of a
covenant breach, such a waiver will be granted, Legacy believes the long-term global outlook for
commodity prices and its efforts to date, which include the suspension of distributions to its
unitholders and holders of both its 8% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable
Perpetual Preferred Units (the "Series A Preferred Units") and its 8.00% Series B Fixed-to-Floating
Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (the "Series B Preferred Units" and,
together with the Series A Preferred Units, the “Preferred Units”), as well as asset sales completed
as of the date of this filing, will be viewed positively by its lenders.
As of June 30, 2016, Legacy had approximately $533.0 million drawn under the Current Credit
Agreement at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.22%, leaving approximately $95.6 million of
availability under the Current Credit Agreement. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2016,
Legacy paid in cash $9.3 million of interest expense on the Current Credit Agreement.
8% Senior Notes Due 2020
On December 4, 2012, Legacy and its 100% owned subsidiary Legacy Reserves Finance
Corporation completed a private placement offering to eligible purchasers of an aggregate principal
amount of $300 million of its 2020 Senior Notes, which were subsequently registered through a
public exchange offer that closed on January 8, 2014. The 2020 Senior Notes were issued at
97.848% of par.
Legacy will have the option to redeem the 2020 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or
after December 1, 2016, at the specified redemption prices set forth below together with any
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption if redeemed during the twelve-month
period beginning on December 1 of the years indicated below.

Prior to December 1, 2016, Legacy may redeem all or any part of the 2020 Senior Notes at the
“make-whole” redemption price as defined in the indenture. Legacy may be required to offer to
repurchase the 2020 Senior Notes at a purchase price of 101%
Page 14
of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, in the event
of a change of control as defined by the indenture. Legacy's and Legacy Reserves Finance
Corporation's obligations under the 2020 Senior Notes are guaranteed by its 100% owned
subsidiaries Legacy Reserves Operating GP LLC, Legacy Reserves Operating LP and Legacy
Reserves Services, Inc., Legacy Reserves Energy Services LLC, Dew Gathering LLC and Pinnacle
Gas Treating LLC, which constitute all of Legacy's wholly-owned subsidiaries other than Legacy
Reserves Finance Corporation. In the future, the guarantees may be released or terminated under
the following circumstances: (i) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially
all of the properties of the guarantor; (ii) in connection with any sale or other disposition of sufficient
capital stock of the guarantor so that it no longer qualifies as our Restricted Subsidiary (as defined
in the indenture); (iii) if designated to be an unrestricted subsidiary; (iv) upon legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture; (v) upon the liquidation or
dissolution of the guarantor provided no default or event of default has occurred or is occurring; (vi)
at such time the guarantor does not have outstanding guarantees of its, or any other guarantor's,
other, debt; or (vii) upon merging into, or transferring all of its properties to Legacy or another
guarantor and ceasing to exist. Refer to Note 11 - Subsidiary Guarantors for further details on
Legacy's guarantors.
The indenture governing the 2020 Senior Notes limits Legacy's ability and the ability of certain of its
subsidiaries to (i) sell assets; (ii) pay distributions on, repurchase or redeem equity interests or
purchase or redeem Legacy's subordinated debt, provided that such subsidiaries may pay
dividends to the holders of their equity interests (including Legacy) and Legacy may pay
distributions to the holders of its equity interests subject to the absence of certain defaults, the
satisfaction of a fixed charge coverage ratio test and so long as the amount of such distributions
does not exceed the sum of available cash (as defined in the partnership agreement) at Legacy, net
proceeds from the sales of certain securities and return of or reductions to capital from restricted
investments; (iii) make certain investments; (iv) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue
preferred units; (v) create or incur certain liens; (vi) enter into agreements that restrict distributions or
other payments from certain of its subsidiaries to Legacy; (vii) consolidate, merge or transfer all or
substantially all of Legacy's assets; (viii) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (ix) create
unrestricted subsidiaries; and (x) engage in certain business activities. These covenants are subject
to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. If at any time when the 2020 Senior Notes
are rated investment grade by each of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's
Ratings Services and no Default (as defined in the indenture) has occurred and is continuing, many
of such covenants will terminate and Legacy and its subsidiaries will cease to be subject to such
covenants. The indenture also includes customary events of default. The Partnership is in
compliance with all financial and other covenants of the 2020 Senior Notes. However, if the lenders
under Legacy's Current Credit Agreement were to accelerate the indebtedness under Legacy's
Current Credit Agreement as a result of a default, such acceleration could cause a cross-default of
all of the 2020 Senior Notes and permit the holders of such notes to accelerate the maturities of
such indebtedness.
Interest is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, Legacy repurchased a face amount of $52.0 million of
its 2020 Senior Notes on the open market. Legacy treated these repurchases as an extinguishment
of debt. Accordingly, Legacy recognized a gain for the difference between (1) the face amount of the
2020 Senior Notes repurchased net of the unamortized portion of both the original issuer's discount
and issuance costs and (2) the repurchase price.
On June 1, 2016, Legacy exchanged 2,719,124 units representing limited partner interests in the
Partnership for $15.0 million of face amount of its outstanding 2020 Senior Notes. Legacy treated
this exchange as an extinguishment of debt. Accordingly, Legacy recognized a gain for the
difference between (1) the face amount of the 2020 Senior Notes repurchased net of the
unamortized portion of both the original issuer's discount and issuance costs and (2) the fair value of
the units issued in the exchange based on the closing price on June 1, 2016.
6.625% Senior Notes Due 2021
On May 28, 2013, Legacy and its 100% owned subsidiary Legacy Reserves Finance Corporation
completed a private placement offering to eligible purchasers of an aggregate principal amount of
$250 million of its 2021 Senior Notes, which were subsequently registered through a public
exchange offer that closed on March 18, 2014. The 2021 Senior Notes were issued at 98.405% of
par.
On May 13, 2014, Legacy and its 100% owned subsidiary Legacy Reserves Finance Corporation
completed a private placement offering to eligible purchasers of an aggregate principal amount of
an additional $300 million of the 6.625% 2021 Senior Notes, which were subsequently registered
through a public exchange offer that closed on February 10, 2015. These 2021 Senior Notes were
issued at 99.0% of par.
Page 15
The terms of the 2021 Senior Notes, including details related to our guarantors, are substantially
identical to the terms of the 2020 Senior Notes with the exception of the interest rate and redemption
provisions noted below. Legacy will have the option to redeem the 2021 Senior Notes, in whole or
in part, at any time on or after June 1, 2017, at the specified redemption prices set forth below
together with any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption if redeemed during
the twelve-month period beginning on June 1 of the years indicated below.

at its option, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes at the
redemption price of 106.625% with the net proceeds of a public or private equity offering. Legacy
may be required to offer to repurchase the 2021 Senior Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, in the event of a
change of control as defined by the indenture. The Partnership is in compliance with all financial
and other covenants of the 2021 Senior Notes. However, if the lenders under Legacy's Current
Credit Agreement were to accelerate the indebtedness under Legacy's Current Credit Agreement as
a result of a default, such acceleration could cause a cross-default of all of the 2021 Senior Notes
and permit the holders of such notes to accelerate the maturities of such indebtedness.
Interest is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, Legacy repurchased a face amount of $117.3 million of
its 2021 Senior Notes on the open market. Legacy treated these repurchases as an extinguishment
of debt. Accordingly, Legacy recognized a gain for the difference between (1) the face amount of the
2021 Senior Notes repurchased net of the unamortized portion of both the original issuer's discount
and issuance costs and (2) the repurchase price.
(3)Acquisitions
On July 31, 2015, Legacy purchased (1) 100% of the issued and outstanding limited liability
company membership interests in Dew Gathering LLC, which owns directly and indirectly natural
gas gathering and processing assets in Anderson, Freestone, Houston, Leon, Limestone and
Robertson Counties, Texas (the "WGR Acquisition") from WGR Operating LP ("WGR") for a net
purchase price of $96.7 million, and (2) various oil and natural gas properties and associated
exploration and production assets (the "Anadarko E&P Acquisition," together with the WGR
Acquisition, the "Anadarko Acquisitions") from Anadarko E&P Onshore LLC ("Anadarko") for a net
purchase price of $337.2 million. The Anadarko Acquisitions were accounted for as a business
combination.

(4)Related Party Transactions
 
Blue Quail Energy Services, LLC (“Blue Quail”), a company specializing in water transfer services,
is an affiliate of Moriah Energy Services LLC, an entity which Cary D. Brown and Dale A. Brown,
both directors of Legacy, are principals.  Legacy has contracted with Blue Quail to provide water
transfer services and paid $82,587 and $93,193 in the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and
June 30, 2015, respectively, to Blue Quail for such services. Blue Quail charged Legacy prices
consistent with that of other vendors for services rendered.
(5)Commitments and Contingencies
 
From time to time Legacy is a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business. While the outcome of lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty, Legacy is not currently a
party to any proceeding that it believes could have a potential material adverse effect on its financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Legacy is party to a contractual agreement, extending through 2022, to purchase CO2 volumes from
a third party. The contract requires Legacy to purchase minimum annual volumes, the pricing of
which is calculated as a percentage of NYMEX-WTI oil prices, with a floor of $57.14. Based upon
the minimum required volumes and the NYMEX-WTI strip prices as of June 30, 2016, we estimate
the value of our total future obligation through the term of the agreement to be approximately $50.5
million.
Legacy is subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the
environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. To the extent laws are enacted or
other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes environmental protection
requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and natural gas industry in general, the
business and prospects of Legacy could be adversely affected.
Legacy has employment agreements with its officers that specify that if the officer is terminated by
Legacy for other than cause or following a change in control, the officer shall receive severance pay
ranging from 24 to 36 months salary plus bonus and COBRA benefits, respectively.
Page 17
(6)Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value
measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
Level
1:
Level
2:
Level
3:
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for
identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. Legacy considers active markets as those in which
transactions for the assets or liabilities occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide
pricing information on an ongoing basis.
 
Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or
indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. This category includes those
derivative instruments that Legacy values using observable market data. Substantially all of
these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the term of the derivative
instrument, can be derived from observable data, or are supported by observable levels at
which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category include non-
exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter commodity price swaps and collars and
interest rate swaps as well as long-term incentive plan liabilities calculated using the Black-
Scholes model to estimate the fair value as of the measurement date.
 
Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to
the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e. supported by little
or no market activity). Legacy’s valuation models are primarily industry standard models that
consider various inputs including: (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) time value,
and (c) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other
relevant economic measures. Level 3 instruments currently are limited to Midland-Cushing
crude oil differential swaps. Although Legacy utilizes third party broker quotes to assess the
reasonableness of its prices and valuation techniques, Legacy does not have sufficient
corroborating evidence to support classifying these assets and liabilities as Level 2.
Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to
the fair value measurement. Legacy’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair
value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and
liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.
Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The following table sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy Legacy’s financial assets and
liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016:

Legacy estimates the fair values of the swaps based on published forward commodity price curves
for the underlying commodities as of the date of the estimate for those commodities for which
published forward pricing is readily available. For those commodity derivatives for which forward
commodity price curves are not readily available, Legacy estimates, with the assistance of third-
party pricing experts, the forward curves as of the date of the estimate. Legacy validates the data
provided by third parties by understanding the pricing models used, obtaining market values from
other pricing sources, analyzing pricing data in certain situations and confirming, where applicable,
that those securities trade in active markets. Legacy estimates the option
Page 18
value of puts and calls combined into hedges, including three-way collars and enhanced swaps,
using an option pricing model which takes into account market volatility, market prices, contract
parameters and discount rates based on published London interbank offered rates ("LIBOR") and
interest rate swaps. Due to the lack of an active market for periods beyond one-month from the
balance sheet date for its oil price differential swaps, Legacy has reviewed historical differential
prices and known economic influences to estimate a reasonable forward curve of future pricing
scenarios based upon these factors. In order to estimate the fair value of our interest rate swaps,
Legacy uses a yield curve based on money market rates and interest rate swaps, extrapolates a
forecast of future interest rates, estimates each future cash flow, derives discount factors to value the
fixed and floating rate cash flows of each swap, and then discounts to present value all known
(fixed) and forecasted (floating) swap cash flows. Curve building and discounting techniques used
to establish the theoretical market value of interest bearing securities are based on readily available
money market rates and interest swap market data. The determination of the fair values above
incorporates various factors including the impact of our non-performance risk and the credit standing
of the counterparties involved in the Partnership’s derivative contracts. The risk of nonperformance
by the Partnership’s counterparties is mitigated by the fact that most of our current counterparties (or
their affiliates) are also current or former bank lenders under the Partnership’s revolving credit
facility. In addition, Legacy routinely monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties. As the
factors described above are based on significant assumptions made by management, these
assumptions are the most sensitive to change.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of financial assets and
liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy:

During periods of market disruption, including periods of volatile oil and natural gas prices, rapid
credit contraction or
illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of the Partnership's derivative instruments if trading
becomes less frequent and/or
market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were previously in
active markets with observable data that become illiquid due to changes in the financial
environment. In such cases, more derivative instruments may fall to Level 3 and thus require more
subjectivity and management judgment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions
that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods which are more
sophisticated or require greater estimation thereby resulting in valuations with less certainty.
Further, rapidly changing commodity and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could
materially impact the valuation of derivative instruments as reported within Legacy's consolidated
financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases
in value may have a material adverse effect on Legacy's results of operations or financial condition
Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
Nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include certain
nonfinancial assets and liabilities as may be acquired in a business combination and thereby
measured at fair value; measurements of oil and natural gas property impairments; and the initial
recognition of asset retirement obligations ("ARO") for which fair value is used. These ARO
estimates are derived from historical costs as well as management’s expectation of future cost
environments. As there is no corroborating market activity to support the assumptions used, Legacy
has designated these liabilities as Level 3. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of
Legacy’s asset retirement obligation is presented in Note 8.

(a)
Legacy periodically reviews oil and natural gas properties for impairment when facts and
circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. During the six-month
period ended June 30, 2016, Legacy incurred impairment charges of $15.4 million as oil and
natural gas properties with a net cost basis of $35.2 million were written down to their fair value of
$19.8 million. In order to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is recoverable, Legacy
compares net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties to estimated
undiscounted future net cash flows using management’s expectations of future oil and natural
gas prices. These future price scenarios reflect Legacy’s estimation of future price volatility. If the
net capitalized cost exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows, Legacy writes the net cost
basis down to the discounted future net cash flows, which is management's estimate of fair value.
Significant inputs used to determine the fair value include estimates of: (i) reserves; (ii) future
operating and development costs; (iii) future commodity prices; and (iv) a market-based weighted
average cost of capital rate. The underlying commodity prices embedded in the Company's
estimated cash flows are the product of a process that begins with NYMEX forward curve pricing,
adjusted for estimated location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that Legacy's
management believes will impact realizable prices. The inputs used by management for the fair
value measurements utilized in this review include significant unobservable inputs, and
therefore, the fair value measurements employed are classified as Level 3 for these types of
assets.
The carrying amount of the revolving long-term debt of $533 million as of June 30, 2016
approximates fair value because Legacy's current borrowing rate does not materially differ from
market rates for similar bank borrowings. Legacy has classified the revolving long-term debt as a
Level 2 item within the fair value hierarchy. As of June 30, 2016, the fair values of the 2020 Senior
Notes and the 2021 Senior Notes were $111.6 million and $182.8 million, respectively. As these
valuations are based on unadjusted quoted prices in an active market, the fair values are classified
as Level 1 items within the fair value hierarchy.

(7)Derivative Financial Instruments
Commodity derivative transactions
Due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, Legacy periodically enters into price-risk
management transactions (e.g., swaps, enhanced swaps or collars) for a portion of its oil and
natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow, as well as to reduce exposure from
price fluctuations. While the use of these arrangements limits Legacy’s ability to benefit from
increases in the prices of oil and natural gas, it also reduces Legacy’s potential exposure to adverse
price movements. Legacy’s arrangements, to the extent it enters into any, apply to only a portion of
its production, provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices and
limit Legacy’s potential gains from future increases in prices. None of these instruments are used for
trading or speculative purposes and required no upfront or deferred cash premium paid or payable
to our counterparty.
 
All of these price risk management transactions are considered derivative instruments. These
derivative instruments are intended to reduce Legacy’s price risk and may be considered hedges for
economic purposes, but Legacy has chosen not to designate them as cash flow hedges for
accounting purposes. Therefore, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair
value with changes in fair value being recorded in current period earnings.
 
By using derivative instruments to mitigate exposures to changes in commodity prices, Legacy
exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform
under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the
counterparty owes Legacy, which creates credit risk. Legacy minimizes the credit or repayment risk
in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties, all of whom
are current or former members of Legacy's lending group.

Interest rate derivative transactions
Due to the volatility of interest rates, Legacy periodically enters into interest rate risk management
transactions in the form of interest rate swaps for a portion of its outstanding debt balance. These
transactions allow Legacy to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations. While the use of these
arrangements limits Legacy’s ability to benefit from decreases in interest rates, it also reduces
Legacy’s potential exposure to increases in interest rates. Legacy’s arrangements, to the extent it
enters into any, apply to only a portion of its outstanding debt balance, provide only partial
protection against interest rate increases and limit Legacy’s potential savings from future interest
rate declines. It is never management’s intention to hold or issue derivative instruments for
speculative trading purposes. Conditions sometimes arise where actual borrowings are less than
notional amounts hedged, which has, and could result in overhedged amounts.
Legacy accounts for these interest rate swaps at fair value and included in the consolidated balance
sheet as assets or liabilities.
Legacy does not designate these derivatives as cash flow hedges, even though they reduce its
exposure to changes in interest rates. Therefore, the mark-to-market of these instruments is
recorded in current earnings as a component of interest expense. The total impact on interest
expense from the mark-to-market and settlements was as follows:

(8)Asset Retirement Obligation
 
AROs associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset are recognized as a liability in
the period in which it is incurred and becomes determinable. Under this method, when liabilities for
dismantlement and abandonment costs, excluding salvage values, are initially recorded, the
carrying amount of the related oil and natural gas properties is increased. The fair value of the ARO
asset and liability is measured using expected future cash outflows discounted at Legacy’s credit-
adjusted risk-free interest rate. Accretion of the liability is recognized each period using the interest
method of allocation, and the capitalized cost is depleted over the useful life of the related asset.
 
The following table reflects the changes in the ARO during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and

Preferred Units
On April 17, 2014, Legacy issued 2,000,000 of its Series A Preferred Units in a public offering at a
price of $25.00 per unit. On May 12, 2014 Legacy issued an additional 300,000 Series A Preferred
Units pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional Series A Preferred Units.
On June 17, 2014, Legacy issued 7,000,000 of its Series B Preferred Units in a public offering at a
price of $25.00 per unit. On July 1, 2014, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option to
purchase an additional 200,000 Series B Preferred Units.
Distributions on the Preferred Units are cumulative from the date of original issue and will be
payable monthly in arrears on the 15th day of each month of each year, when, as and if declared by
the board of directors of the Partnership's general partner. Distributions on the Series A Preferred
Units will be payable from, and including, the date of the original issuance to, but not including April
15, 2024 at an initial rate of 8.00% per annum of the stated liquidation preference. Distributions on
the Series B Preferred Units will be payable from, and including, the date of the original issuance to,
but not including June 15, 2024 at an initial rate of 8.00% per annum of the stated liquidation
preference. Distributions accruing on and after April 15, 2024 for the Series A Preferred Units and
June 15, 2024 for the Series B Preferred Units will accrue at an annual rate equal to the sum of (a)
three-month LIBOR as calculated on each applicable date of determination and (b) 5.24% for Series
A and 5.26% for Series B, based on the $25.00 liquidation preference per preferred unit.
At any time on or after April 15, 2019 or June 15, 2019, Legacy may redeem the Series A Preferred
Units or Series B Preferred Units, respectively, in whole or in part at a redemption price of $25.00
per Preferred Unit plus an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon
through and including the date of redemption, whether or not declared. Legacy may also redeem the
Preferred Units in the event of a Change of Control.
The Series A Preferred Units and the Series B Preferred Units trade on NASDAQ under the
symbols "LGCYP" and "LGCYO,” respectively.
On January 21, 2016, Legacy announced that its general partner suspended monthly cash
distributions for both its Series A Preferred Units and its Series B Preferred Units. As of June 30,
2016, $0.92 of distributions per unit were in arrears, representing a total cumulative arrearage of
approximately $8.7 million.
Page 25
Incentive Distribution Units
On June 4, 2014, Legacy issued 300,000 Incentive Distribution Units representing limited partner
interests in the Partnership (the "Incentive Distribution Units") to WPX Energy Rocky Mountain, LLC
(“WPX”) as part of Legacy’s purchase of a non-operated interest in oil and natural gas properties
located in the Piceance Basin in Garfield County, Colorado from WPX on June 4, 2014 (the “WPX
Acquisition”). The Incentive Distribution Units issued to WPX include 100,000 Incentive Distribution
Units that immediately vested along with the ability to vest in up to an additional 200,000 Incentive
Distribution Units (the “Unvested IDUs”) in connection with any future asset sales or transactions
completed with Legacy. Incentive Distribution Units that are not issued to WPX or other parties will
remain in Legacy's treasury for the benefit of all limited partners until such time as Legacy may
make future issuances of Incentive Distribution Units. Effective January 1, 2016, WPX assigned its
vested and unvested IDUs to WPX Energy Holdings, LLC ("WPX Holdings"), a controlled affiliate of
WPX Energy, Inc.
The Incentive Distribution Units represent a right to incremental cash distributions from Legacy after
certain target levels of distributions are paid to unitholders, which targets are set above the current
levels of Legacy's distributions to unitholders. The Unvested IDUs do not participate in cash
distributions from Legacy until vested. The Unvested IDUs will automatically be forfeited on each of
the first two anniversaries of the closing date of the WPX Acquisition in an amount per forfeiture
equal to 66,666 Incentive Distribution Units and on the third anniversary of the closing date of the
WPX Acquisition in an amount equal to 66,668 Incentive Distribution Units. Unvested IDUs that
have not been forfeited will vest ratably at a rate of 10,000 Incentive Distribution Units per $35.5
million of additional cash consideration that is paid by Legacy to WPX or to a third party (along with
the fair market value of any non-cash consideration) in connection with the consummation of any
transaction by which Legacy acquires oil and natural gas properties (or rights therein or other assets
related thereto) from WPX or jointly with WPX. 66,666 Unvested IDUs were forfeited on each of
June 4, 2015 and June 4, 2016.
In addition, the vested and outstanding Incentive Distribution Units held by WPX Holdings may be
converted by Legacy, subject to applicable conversion factors, into units on a one-for-one basis at
any time when Legacy has made a distribution in respect of its units for each of the four full fiscal
quarters prior to the delivery of its conversion notice, and the amount of the distribution in respect of
the units for the full quarter immediately preceding delivery of its conversion notice was equal to at
least $0.90 per unit; and the amount of all distributions during each quarter within the four-quarter
period immediately preceding delivery of its conversion notice did not exceed the adjusted
operating surplus for such quarter. Further, WPX Holdings also has the ability to similarly convert
any of its vested Incentive Distribution Units beginning three years after June 4, 2014. WPX
Holdings may not transfer any of the Incentive Distribution Units it holds to any person that is not a
controlled affiliate of WPX Energy, Inc.

(10)Unit-Based Compensation
 
Long-Term Incentive Plan
 
On March 15, 2006, the LTIP for Legacy was implemented for its employees, consultants and
directors, its affiliates and its general partner. On June 12, 2015, the unitholders of Legacy approved
an amendment to the LTIP to provide for an increase in the number of units available for issuance
from 2,000,000 to 5,000,000. The awards under the LTIP may include unit grants, restricted units,
phantom units, unit options and unit appreciation rights ("UARs"). As of June 30, 2016, grants of
awards net of forfeitures and, in the case of phantom units, historical exercises covering 2,797,391
units had been made, comprised of 266,014 unit option awards, 885,001 restricted unit awards,
1,212,692 phantom unit awards and 433,684 unit awards. The UAR awards and certain phantom
unit awards granted under the LTIP may only be settled in cash, and therefore are not included in
the aggregate number of units granted under the LTIP. The LTIP is administered by the
compensation committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of the board of directors of LRGPLLC.
The cost of employee services in exchange for an award of equity instruments is measured based
on a grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions), and that cost must generally be
recognized over the vesting period of the award. However, if an entity that nominally has the choice
of settling awards by issuing stock predominately settles in cash, or if an entity usually settles in
cash whenever an employee asks for cash settlement, the entity is settling a substantive liability
rather than repurchasing an equity instrument. Because the UARs are settled in cash, Legacy
accounts for them by utilizing the liability method. The liability method requires companies to
measure the cost of the employee services in exchange for a cash award based on the fair value of
the underlying security at the end of each reporting period. Compensation cost is recognized based
on the change in the liability between periods.
 
Unit Appreciation Rights
A UAR is a notional unit that entitles the holder, upon vesting, to receive cash valued at the
difference between the closing price of units on the exercise date and the exercise price, as
determined on the date of grant. Because these awards are settled in cash, Legacy is accounting for
the UARs by utilizing the liability method.
During the year ended December 31, 2015, Legacy issued 204,500 UARs to employees which vest
ratably over a three-year period and 96,520 UARs to employees which vest at the end of a three-
year period. Legacy did not issue UARs to employees during the six-month period ended June 30,
2016. All UARs granted in 2015 expire seven years from the grant date and are exercisable when
they vest.
 
For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, Legacy recorded $112,100 and $16,359,
respectively, of compensation expense due to the change in liability from December 31, 2015 and
2014, respectively, based on its use of the Black-Scholes model to estimate the June 30, 2016 and
2015 fair value of these UARs (see Note 6). As of June 30, 2016, there was a total of approximately
$104,048 of unrecognized compensation costs related to the unexercised and non-vested portion of
these UARs. At June 30, 2016, this cost was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of approximately 2.07 years. Compensation expense is based upon the fair value as of
June 30, 2016 and is recognized as a percentage of the service period satisfied. Based on historical
data, Legacy has assumed a volatility factor of approximately 81% and employed the Black-Scholes
model to estimate the June 30, 2016 fair value to be realized as compensation cost based on the
percentage of service period satisfied. Based on historical data, Legacy has assumed an estimated
forfeiture rate of 5.3%. Legacy will adjust the estimated forfeiture rate based upon actual experience.
Legacy has assumed no annual distribution.

Phantom Units

Legacy has also issued phantom units under the LTIP to executive officers. A phantom unit is a
notional unit that entitles the holder, upon vesting, to receive either one Partnership unit for each
phantom unit or the cash equivalent of a Partnership unit, as stipulated by the form of the grant.
Legacy is accounting for the phantom units settled in Partnership units by utilizing the equity
method. Legacy is accounting for the phantom units settled in cash by utilizing the liability method.
On September 21, 2009, the board of directors of LRGPLLC, upon the recommendation of the
Compensation Committee, implemented an equity-based incentive compensation policy applicable
to the executive officers of Legacy. In addition to cash bonus awards, under the compensation plan,
the executives are eligible for both subjective and objective grants of phantom units. The subjective,
or service-based, grants may be awarded up to a maximum percentage of annual salary as
determined by the Compensation Committee. Once granted, these phantom units vest ratably over a
three-year period. The objective, or performance-based, grants may be awarded up to a maximum
percentage of annual salary as determined by the Compensation Committee. However, the amount
to vest each year for the three-year vesting period will be determined on each vesting date based on
a three-step process, with the first two steps each comprising 50% of the total vesting amount while
the third step is the sum of the first two steps. The first step in the process will be a function of Total
Unitholder Return (“TUR”) for the Partnership and the percentage rank of the Legacy TUR among a
peer group of upstream master limited partnerships, as determined by the Compensation Committee
at the beginning of each year. In the second step, the Legacy TUR will be compared to the TUR of a
group of master limited partnerships included in the Alerian MLP Index. The third step is the addition
of the above two steps to determine the total performance-based awards to vest. On March 7, 2013,
the board of directors of LRGPLLC, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee,
approved a revised compensation policy (the “Revised Policy”). This Revised Policy applies to
incentive awards granted after the fiscal year ended 2013. While the Revised Policy measures TUR
against both the peer group and Alerian MLP Index, the measurement periods were increased to a
three-year cumulative measurement period with a corresponding increase in vesting from a ratable
three-year vesting to three-year cliff vesting. Performance based phantom units subject to vesting
which do not vest in a given year will be forfeited. With respect to both the subjective and objective
units awarded under both compensation policies, distribution equivalent rights ("DERs") will
accumulate and accrue based on the total number of actual amounts vested and will be payable at
the date of vesting. However, due to the aforementioned revision for executive employees, accrued
DERs paid at the date of vesting will be treated as distributions in the period paid rather than being
recognized as compensation expense over the life of the award.
On February 24, 2015, the Compensation Committee approved the award of 341,251 subjective, or
service-based, phantom units and 259,998 objective, or performance based, phantom units to
Legacy’s executive officers.
Page 28
On June 22, 2016, the Compensation Committee approved with respect to Paul Horne, and the
board of directors of LRGPLLC approved the recommendation of the Compensation Committee with
respect to the other executive officers the award of a maximum of 391,674 subjective, or service-
based, phantom units that, upon vesting, settle in Partnership units, a maximum of 1,286,930
subjective phantom units that, upon vesting, settle in cash and a maximum of 2,238,138 objective,
or performance-based, phantom units that, upon vesting, settle in cash to our executive officers.
Compensation expense related to the phantom units was $1.8 million and $1.4 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Restricted Units
During the year ended December 31, 2015, Legacy issued an aggregate of 381,860 restricted units
to both non-executive employees and an executive employee. The restricted units awarded to non-
executive employees vest ratably over a three-year period beginning at the date of grant. The
restricted units granted to the executive employee vest ratably over a three-year period for a portion
of the restricted units, with the remainder vesting in full at the end of a five-year period. During the
six-month period ended June 30, 2016, Legacy did not issue restricted units to any employees.
Compensation expense related to restricted units was $1.6 million and $1.2 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, there was a total of $3.2
million of unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of these restricted
units. At June 30, 2016, this cost was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
2.0 years. Pursuant to the provisions of ASC 718, Legacy’s issued units, as reflected in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2016, do not include 431,691 units related to
unvested restricted unit awards.
Board Units
 
On June 15, 2015, Legacy granted and issued 11,025 units to each of its six non-employee
directors. The value of each unit was $9.13 at the time of issuance.
On May 10, 2016, Legacy granted and issued 39,526 units to each of its six non-employee directors.
The value of each unit was $2.59 at the time of issuance.
(11) Subsidiary Guarantors
On April 2, 2014, Legacy filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") to register the issuance and sale of, among other securities,
Legacy's debt securities, which may be co-issued by Legacy Reserves Finance Corporation. The
registration statement also registered guarantees of debt securities by Legacy Reserves Operating
GP LLC, Legacy Reserves Operating LP and Legacy Reserves Services, Inc. The Partnership's
2020 Senior Notes were issued in a private offering on December 4, 2012 and were subsequently
registered through a public exchange offer that closed on January 8, 2014. The Partnership's 2021
Senior Notes were issued in two separate private offerings on May 28, 2013 and May 8, 2014. $250
million aggregate principal amount of our 2021 Senior Notes were subsequently registered through
a public exchange offer that closed on March 18, 2014. The remaining $300 million of aggregate
principal amount of Legacy's 2021 Senior Notes were subsequently registered through a public
exchange offer that closed on February 10, 2015. The 2020 Senior Notes and the 2021 Senior
Notes are guaranteed by Legacy's 100% owned subsidiaries Legacy Reserves Operating GP LLC,
Legacy Reserves Operating LP, Legacy Reserves Services, Inc., Legacy Reserves Energy
Services LLC, Dew Gathering LLC and Pinnacle Gas Treating LLC, which constitute all of Legacy's
wholly-owned subsidiaries other than Legacy Reserves Finance Corporation, and certain other
future subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”, together with any future 100% owned subsidiaries that
guarantee the Partnership's 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes, the “Subsidiaries”). The
Subsidiaries are 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by the Partnership and the guarantees by the
Subsidiaries are full and unconditional, except for customary release provisions described in Note 2
- Long-Term Debt. The Partnership has no assets or operations independent of the Subsidiaries,
and there are no significant restrictions upon the ability of the Subsidiaries to distribute funds to the
Partnership. The guarantees constitute joint and several obligations of the Guarantors.

Overview
 
The recent supply and demand environment for crude oil and natural gas has resulted in a
prolonged period of low commodity prices. Based on the sustained level of commodity prices
through the second quarter of 2016, we are experiencing a challenging 2016. Crude oil prices
declined from an average of $92.91 per Bbl in 2014 to an average of $39.55 for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and natural gas prices declined from an average of $4.26 per Mcf in 2014 to
an average of $2.07 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. If commodity prices persist at current
levels, we will continue to experience an adverse effect on our operating income in future periods
resulting from decreased revenues and higher depletion rates when compared to prior time periods.
However, to illustrate the impact of recent commodity prices on our proved reserves, we
recalculated our proved reserves as of December 31, 2015, using the five-year average forward
price as of June 30, 2016 for both WTI oil and NYMEX natural gas held constant for the life of our
properties. While this 5-year NYMEX forward strip price is not necessarily indicative of our overall
outlook on future commodity prices, this commonly used methodology may help provide investors
with an understanding of the
Page 30
impact of the recent commodity price environment. Under such assumptions, we estimate our year-
end proved reserves increased by approximately 7.6% to 176.6 MMBoe from our previously
reported 164.2 MMBoe.
Sustained periods of low prices for oil or natural gas could materially and adversely affect our
financial position, our results of operations, the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can
economically produce, our access to capital and the amount of our cash distributions, as evidenced
by our suspension of cash distributions to our unitholders and holders of our 8% Series A Fixed-to-
Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (the "Series A Preferred Units")
and our 8.00% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units
(together with the Series A Preferred Units, the “Preferred Units”) announced in January 2016. We
continue to monitor the commodity markets and their impact on both our distributable cash flow and
financial covenants.
Depending on oil and natural gas prices in 2016 and given the recent difficulty we have had
entering into new commodity derivative positions with our bank group, we could breach certain
financial covenants under our revolving credit facility, which would constitute a default under our
revolving credit facility. Such default, if not remedied, would require a waiver from our lenders in
order for us to avoid an event of default and subsequent acceleration of all amounts outstanding
under our revolving credit facility and potential foreclosure on our oil and natural gas properties.
Certain payment defaults or acceleration under our revolving credit facility could cause a cross-
default or cross-acceleration of all of our indebtedness. In response to the current commodity price
environment, our focus for 2016 is to fund our operations and reduce leverage from both our
internally generated cash flow and additional select asset sales. Since December 31, 2015, we
have reduced our total leverage by $272.4 million by repurchasing $169.4 million of face amount of
our Senior Notes on the open market, exchanging $15.0 million of face amount of our 2020 Senior
Notes for units and repaying outstanding amounts under our revolver by $88.0 million.
Because of our growth through acquisitions and development of properties, historical results of
operations and period-to-period comparisons of these results and certain financial data may not be
meaningful or indicative of future results.
 
Acquisitions have been financed with a combination of proceeds from bank borrowings, issuance of
notes, issuances of units and preferred units and cash flow from operations. Post-acquisition
activities are focused on evaluating and developing the acquired properties and evaluating potential
add-on acquisitions. Our revenues, cash flow from operations and future growth depend
substantially on factors beyond our control, such as economic, political and regulatory
developments and competition from other sources of energy. Oil and natural gas prices historically
have been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future.
We face the challenge of natural production declines. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, oil
and natural gas production from a given well or formation decreases. We attempt to overcome this
natural decline by acquiring more reserves than we produce, drilling to find additional reserves,
utilizing multiple types of recovery techniques such as secondary (waterflood) and tertiary (CO2 and
nitrogen) recovery methods to re-pressure the reservoir and recover additional oil, recompleting or
adding pay in existing wellbores and improving artificial lift. Our future growth will depend on our
ability to continue to add reserves in excess of production. We will maintain our focus on adding
reserves through acquisitions and exploitation projects. Our ability to add reserves through
acquisitions and development projects is dependent upon many factors including our ability to raise
capital, competitively bid on acquisitions, obtain regulatory approvals and contract drilling rigs and
personnel.
 
Our revenues are highly sensitive to changes in oil and natural gas prices and to levels of
production. As set forth under “Investing Activities” below, we have entered into oil and natural gas
derivatives designed to mitigate the effects of price fluctuations covering a portion of our expected
production, which allows us to mitigate, but not eliminate, oil and natural gas price risk. We have
had recent difficulty entering into new commodity derivative positions with our bank group. We
continuously conduct financial sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of changes in pricing and
production. These analyses allow us to determine how changes in oil and natural gas prices will
affect our ability to execute our capital investment programs and to meet future financial obligations.
Further, the financial analyses allow us to monitor any impact such changes in oil and natural gas
prices may have on the value of our proved reserves and their impact on any redetermination to our
borrowing base under our revolving credit facility.
 
Legacy does not specifically designate derivative instruments as cash flow hedges; therefore, the
mark-to-market adjustment reflecting the change in fair value associated with these instruments is
recorded in current earnings.
Production and Operating Costs Reporting
We strive to increase our production levels to maximize our revenue and cash flow. Additionally, we
continuously monitor our operations to ensure that we are incurring operating costs at the optimal
level. Accordingly, we continuously monitor our production and operating costs per well to
determine if any wells or properties should be shut-in or recompleted.
Page 31
Such costs include, but are not limited to, the cost of electricity to lift produced fluids, chemicals to
treat wells, field personnel to monitor the wells, well repair expenses to restore production, well
workover expenses intended to increase production, and ad valorem taxes. We incur and
separately report severance taxes paid to the states in which our properties are located. These
taxes are reported as production taxes and are a percentage of oil and natural gas revenue. Ad
valorem taxes are a percentage of property valuation. While gathering and transportation costs are
generally borne by the purchasers of our oil and the price paid for our oil reflects these costs, much
of our natural gas production is subject to such costs before the transfer of ownership to the
purchaser, and we recognize these expenses as operating costs. We do not consider royalties paid
to mineral owners an expense as we deduct hydrocarbon volumes owned by mineral owners from
the reported hydrocarbon sales volumes.

Results of Operations
 
Three-Month Period Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three-Month Period Ended June 30, 2015
 
Our revenues from the sale of oil were $41.3 million and $59.1 million for the three-month periods
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our revenues from the sale of NGLs were $3.9 million
and $5.7 million for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our
revenues from the sale of natural gas were $28.2 million and $23.0 million for the three-month
periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $17.8 million decrease in oil revenues
reflects the decrease in average realized price of $10.76 per Bbl (21%) due to a decline in average
West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude oil prices of $12.39 per Bbl partially offset by an
improvement in realized regional differentials. The decrease in oil revenue is also due to natural
declines in oil production of 132 MBbls. The $1.8 million decrease in NGL sales reflects a decrease
in the realized NGL price of approximately $0.09 per Gal (18%) and a decrease in volumes of 1,903
MGals primarily due to plant downtime in our Mid-Con and Permian properties as well as reduced
realizations on our Piceance Basin properties. The $5.2 million increase in natural gas revenues
reflects an increase in our production volumes, partially offset by a decrease in realized natural gas
prices. Our natural gas production increased by approximately 7,094 MMcf (74%), primarily due to
our 2015 acquisitions, most notably the acquisitions of East Texas properties (7,642 MMcf), partially
offset by natural declines. Average realized natural gas prices decreased by $0.70 per Mcf (29%)
during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to
the decline in average NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas prices of $0.62 (22%) per Mcf.
For the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, we recorded $37.7 million of net losses on oil and
natural gas derivatives. Commodity derivative gains and losses represent the changes in fair value
of our commodity derivatives during the period and are based on oil and natural gas futures prices.
The net losses recognized during the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 are primarily due to
the increase in commodity prices during the second quarter. For the three-month period ended
June 30, 2015, we recorded $13.5 million of net losses on oil and natural gas derivatives.
Settlements of such contracts resulted in cash receipts of $22.1 million and $37.2 million during the
three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Our oil and natural gas production expenses, excluding ad valorem taxes, decreased to $41.5
million ($10.23 per Boe) for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 from $42.8 million ($14.02
per Boe) for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily attributable to
cost reduction efforts on historical properties partially offset by additional expenses associated with
the East Texas properties acquired in 2015 of $7.5 million. Additionally, production expenses per
Boe decreased for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three-month period
ended June 30, 2015 due to the inclusion of lower cost production in our East Texas properties
acquired in 2015 as well as a reduction in lifting costs in our historical properties. Our ad valorem
tax expense increased to $3.0 million ($0.75 per Boe) for the three-month period ended June 30,
2016 compared to $2.4 million ($0.78 per Boe) for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015. The
increase was attributable to additional taxes related to our acquisition of East Texas properties
partially offset by lower oil and natural gas commodity prices, resulting in lower reserve valuations,
upon which much of our ad valorem taxes are based, resulting in lower ad valorem tax expense on
a per Boe basis.
 
Our production and other taxes were $3.4 million and $4.0 million for the three-month periods ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Production and other taxes decreased due to the decline in
product prices.
 
Our general and administrative expenses were $11.0 million and $10.4 million for the three-month
periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. General and administrative expenses
increased $0.6 million primarily due to an increase in LTIP expense and salaries and benefits
expense commensurate with a larger asset base as a result of our acquisitions of East Texas
properties. This increase was partially offset by general cost reduction efforts.
We incurred depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, or DD&A, of $37.7 million
and $36.2 million for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. DD&A
increased $1.5 million due primarily to a larger depletable asset base following our acquisition of
East Texas properties.
We recorded gain on disposal of assets of $9.1 million and $0.9 million for the three-month periods
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The gain in 2016 primarily consisted of dispositions of
unproved leasehold acreage.
 
We recorded interest expense of $20.3 million and $17.8 million for the three-month periods ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense increased approximately $2.5 million
primarily due to losses on our interest rate derivatives and interest expense related to additional
borrowings on our revolving credit facility to fund the acquisitions of East Texas properties in 2015.
This increase was partially offset by decreased interest expense following our repurchase of a
portion of our Senior Notes, which resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $20.0 million.

Six-Month Period Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six-Month Period Ended June 30, 2015
 
Our revenues from the sale of oil were $71.6 million and $109.4 million for the six-month periods
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our revenues from the sale of NGLs were $6.4 million
and $9.9 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our
revenues from the sale of natural gas were $61.3 million and $50.0 million for the six-month periods
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $37.8 million decrease in oil revenues reflects the
decrease in average realized price of $12.18 per Bbl (26%) due to a decline in average WTI crude
oil prices of $13.70 per Bbl and a decline in production of 263 MBbls due to natural production
declines, partially offset by an improvement in realized regional differentials. The $3.5 million
decrease in NGL sales reflects a decrease in the realized NGL price of approximately $0.11 per Gal
(23%) due to lower commodity prices and a decrease in NGL production of 3,348 MGals (16%),
primarily due to ethane rejection in our Piceance Basin properties and plant downtime in our Mid-
Con and Permian properties. The $11.2 million increase in natural gas revenues reflects an
increase in our production volumes, partially offset by a decrease in realized natural gas prices. Our
natural gas production increased by approximately 14,702 MMcf (76%) primarily due to 15,544
MMcf of production from our acquired East Texas properties, partially offset by natural production
declines. Average realized natural gas prices decreased by $0.79 per Mcf (31%) during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to the decline in average
NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas prices of $0.75 per Mcf.
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, we recorded $20.6 million of net losses on oil and
natural gas derivatives. Commodity derivative gains and losses represent the changes in fair value
of our commodity derivatives during the period and are based on oil and natural gas futures prices.
The net losses recognized during the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 are primarily due to an
increase in commodity prices during 2016 partially offset by cash settlements received, as well as
the entrance into new derivative contracts. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, we
recorded $7.0 million of net gains on oil and natural gas derivatives. Settlements of such contracts
resulted in cash receipts of $44.9 million and $77.5 million during the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Our oil and natural gas production expenses, excluding ad valorem taxes, decreased to $88.2
million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 from $88.8 million for the six-month period
ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to cost reductions in our historical
properties partially offset by additional expenses related to our acquisition of East Texas properties.
These reduction efforts, as well as the large volume of natural gas production related to the
properties acquired in East Texas resulted in a decrease in the cost per Boe to $10.75 per Boe for
the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 from $14.56 per Boe for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2015. Our ad valorem tax expense increased to $6.4 million ($0.78 per Boe) for the six-
month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to $5.7 million ($0.93 per Boe) for the six-month
period ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to additional taxes related to our acquisition of East
Texas properties partially offset by lower oil and natural gas commodity prices, resulting in lower
reserve valuations, upon which much of our ad valorem taxes are based, resulting in a lower cost
per Boe.
 
Our production and other taxes were $6.0 million and $8.2 million for the six-month periods ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Production and other taxes decreased because of the
decline in product prices.
 
Our general and administrative expenses were $20.4 million and $19.3 million for the six-month
periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. General and administrative expenses
primarily increased due to overall general and administrative increases associated with a larger
asset base and a $0.9 million non-cash increase in LTIP expense.
We incurred depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, or DD&A, of $74.6 million
and $77.3 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. DD&A
decreased $2.6 million due primarily to lower depletion across much of our asset base due to the
reduced depletable basis resulting from the significant impairment realized in 2015 and 2016
partially offset by inclusion of properties acquired in East Texas.
 
Impairment expense was $15.4 million and $209.4 million for the six-month periods ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, we recognized $15.4
million of impairment expense on twelve separate producing fields primarily related to the further
decline in oil and natural gas futures prices during the period. Impairment expense for the period
ended June 30, 2015 was recognized on thirty-three separate producing fields primarily related to
the decline in natural gas prices. We recognized significant impairment expense in the fourth
quarter of 2014, and the continued decline in natural gas futures prices during the first quarter of
2015 resulted in additional write-downs.
We recorded (gain) loss on disposal of assets of $(40.8) million and $1.0 million for the six-month
periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The gain in 2016 primarily consisted of
dispositions of unproved leasehold acreage.
Page 35
We recorded interest expense of $45.5 million and $35.6 million for the six-month periods ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense increased approximately $9.9 million
primarily due to interest expense related to additional borrowings on our revolving credit facility to
fund the acquisition of East Texas properties and losses on our interest rate derivatives. This
increase was partially offset by decreased interest expense following our repurchase of a portion of
our Senior Notes, which resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $150.8 million.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a tool to provide additional information and metrics
relative to the performance of our business. Our management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is
useful to investors because this measure is used by many companies in the industry as a measure
of operating and financial performance and is commonly employed by financial analysts and others
to evaluate the operating and financial performance of the Partnership from period to period and to
compare it with the performance of other publicly traded partnerships within the industry. Adjusted
EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other publicly traded limited
partnerships or limited liability companies because all companies may not calculate Adjusted
EBITDA in the same manner.The following presents a reconciliation of “Adjusted EBITDA,” which is
a non-GAAP measure, to its nearest comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA should not be
considered as an alternative to GAAP measures, such as net income, operating income, cash flow
from operating activities, or any other GAAP measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is
defined as net income (loss) plus:
•Interest expense;
•(Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt
•
•Income tax expense (benefit);
•Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion;
•Impairment of long-lived assets;
•(Gain) loss on disposal of assets;
•Equity in (income) loss of equity method investees;
Unit-based compensation expense (benefit) related to LTIP unit awards accounted for under the
equity or liability methods;
•Minimum payments earned in excess of overriding royalty interest;
•Equity in EBITDA of equity method investee;
•Net (gains) losses on commodity derivatives;
•Net cash settlements received (paid) on commodity derivatives;
•Transaction related expenses.

A portion of minimum payments earned in excess of overriding royalties earned under a

EBITDA applicable to equity method investee is defined as the equity method investee's net
income plus interest expense and depreciation. We divested our interest in this investee in May

of 2015.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, Adjusted EBITDA decreased
43% to $39.7 million from $69.9 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 48% to $68.7 million from $131.9 million. These
decreases can be attributed to the significant declines in commodity prices and lower commodity
derivative settlements and were partially offset by production from our East Texas properties
acquired in 2015.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
 
Our primary sources of capital and liquidity have been cash flow from operations, sale of oil and
natural gas properties, the issuance of additional units and preferred units, the issuance of notes,
proceeds from bank borrowings or a combination thereof. To date, our primary use of capital has
been for acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties and the repayment of
indebtedness.
 
Based upon current oil and natural gas price expectations and our commodity derivatives positions,
we anticipate that our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity
under our revolving credit facility will provide us sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the
remainder of 2016 including our planned capital expenditures of $37 million. However, depending
on oil and natural gas prices in 2016, we could breach certain financial covenants under our
revolving credit facility, which would constitute a default under our revolving credit facility. Such a
default, if not remedied, would require a waiver from our lenders in order for us to avoid an event of
default and potential subsequent acceleration of all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit
facility and potential foreclosure on our oil and natural gas properties. Certain payment defaults or
acceleration under our revolving credit facility could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of
all of our other indebtedness. If an event of default occurs, or if other debt agreements cross-default,
and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other
debt outstanding, we will not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness. In
light of this, we elected to suspend distributions to unitholders and distributions to the holders of our
Preferred Units. Additionally, we have consummated certain credit-accretive asset sales comprised
primarily of non-producing acreage and have used the proceeds
Page 37
of such asset sales to reduce total leverage. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables,
including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices. We have recently had difficulty
entering into new commodity derivative positions with our bank group, which has restricted our
ability to mitigate commodity price risk. There can be no assurance that operations and other capital
resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to operate or to maintain planned levels of capital
expenditures. For further information about our revolving credit facility, please refer to Note 2—
Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
The amounts available for borrowing under our credit facility are subject to a borrowing base, which
is currently set at $630 million. As of August 3, 2016, we had $108.6 million available for borrowing
under our revolving credit facility. Based on their commodity price expectations, our lenders
redetermine the borrowing base semi-annually, with the next redetermination scheduled on or about
October 2016, subject to the parties' rights to have additional redeterminations between scheduled
redeterminations. Please see “—Cash Flow from Financing Activities—Credit Facility.”
Our commodity derivatives position, which we use to mitigate commodity price volatility and, if
positive, support our borrowing capacity, resulted in $132.9 million of cash receipts in the year
ended December 31, 2015. However, while a significant portion of our projected oil and natural gas
production is covered by derivative contracts, such contracts are at a price point that is significantly
lower than our historical contracts. As a point of reference, assuming NYMEX oil and natural gas
prices of $50.00 per Bbl and $2.50 per Mcf, respectively, for the remainder of 2016, we would
anticipate receiving total cash receipts of approximately $70.0 million for the calendar year 2016,
representing an approximately $62.9 million reduction from 2015.
For an example illustrating the potential effects of commodity prices on our estimates of proved
reserves, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition—Overview.”
As market conditions warrant, we may, subject to certain limitations and restrictions, repurchase,
exchange or otherwise pay down our outstanding debt, including our Senior Notes, in open market
transactions, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise which may impact the
trading liquidity of such securities. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in
the aggregate, may be material. Since December 31, 2015, we have repurchased approximately
$169.4 million of face amount of our Senior Notes on the open market and have exchanged
2,719,124 units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership for $15.0 million of face
amount of our 2020 Senior Notes. Our recently redetermined borrowing base of $630 million
currently prohibits additional Senior Notes repurchases given we no longer meet the required
minimum liquidity levels.
A significant portion of our horizontal operated development activity in the Permian Basin is pursued
through our development agreement (the "Development Agreement") with Jupiter JV LP ("Investor"),
an affiliate of TPG Special Situations Partners' investment funds. Pursuant to the Development
Agreement, Investor funds 95% of the costs to the parties' combined interests to develop the assets
and 80% of the costs to the parties' combined interests to develop or construct associated saltwater
disposal wells and other infrastructure assets. Investor received an undivided 87.5% of our working
interest in the assets, subject to reversions upon the occurrence of certain events. Legacy’s capital
resources and liquidity benefit from its interest in the development activity under the Development
Agreement.
Cash Flow from Operations
 
Our net cash provided by or (used in) operating activities was $(14.6) million and $0.2 million for the
six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 2016 period was impacted by
lower realized commodity prices.
 
Our cash flow from operations is subject to many variables, the most significant of which is the
volatility of oil, NGL and natural gas prices. Oil, NGL and natural gas prices are determined primarily
by prevailing market conditions, which are dependent on regional and worldwide economic activity,
weather and other factors beyond our control. Our future cash flow from operations will depend on
our ability to maintain and increase production through acquisitions and development projects, as
well as the prices of oil, NGL and natural gas.
Cash Flow from Investing Activities
We invested $14.1 million of capital for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, which consisted
of $11.7 million for development projects, $2.2 million for adjustments to prior period acquisitions
and $0.2 million for immaterial acquisitions. We received $87.5 million of proceeds related to the
divestiture of various oil and natural gas properties. Our cash capital expenditures were $23.7
million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015. The 2015 total includes $1.9 million for the
acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in individually immaterial acquisitions as well as $21.8
million for development projects.
Page 38
Our annual capital expenditure budget for 2016, which predominantly consists of drilling, CO2
injection, recompletion and well stimulation projects, was set at $37.0 million. During the six months
ended June 30, 2016 we have spent $11.7 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient
sources of working capital, including our cash flow from operations and available borrowing
capacity under our credit facility, to meet our cash obligations including our remaining planned
capital expenditures. Our remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility is $108.6
million as of August 3, 2016. The amount and timing of our capital expenditures is largely
discretionary and within our control, with the exception of certain projects managed by other
operators. We may defer a portion of our planned capital expenditures until later periods.
Accordingly, we routinely monitor and adjust our capital expenditures in response to changes in oil
and natural gas prices, drilling and acquisition costs, industry conditions, non-operated capital
requirements and internally generated cash flow. Future cash distributions will be at levels to be
determined based on cash available for distribution, any remaining borrowing capacity for cash
distributions under our credit facility, requirements to repay debt and any other factors the board of
directors of our general partner may consider. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of
variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices. There can be no
assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to
maintain planned levels of capital expenditures.
We enter into oil and natural gas derivative transactions to reduce the impact of oil and natural gas
price volatility on our operations. We use derivatives to offset price volatility of oil and natural gas
prices. For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we had favorable settlements of
$44.9 million and $77.5 million, respectively, related to our commodity derivatives.
 
By reducing the cash flow effects of price volatility from a portion of our oil and natural gas
production, we have mitigated, but not eliminated, the potential effects of changing prices on our
cash flow from operations for those periods. While mitigating negative effects of falling commodity
prices, these derivative contracts also limit the benefits we would receive from increases in
commodity prices. It is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are
major, creditworthy institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive market
makers. In addition, none of our current counterparties require us to post margin. However, we
cannot be assured that all of our counterparties will meet their obligations under our derivative
contracts. Due to this uncertainty, we routinely monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties.
The following tables summarize, for the periods indicated, our oil and natural gas derivatives
currently in place as of August 1, 2016, covering the period from July 1, 2016 through December 31,
2019. We use derivatives, including swaps, enhanced swaps and three-way collars, as our
mechanism for offsetting the cash flow effects of changes in commodity prices whereby we pay the
counterparty floating prices and receive fixed prices from the counterparty, which serves to reduce
the effects on cash flow of the floating prices we are paid by purchasers of our oil and natural gas.
These transactions are mostly settled based upon the monthly average closing price of the front-
month NYMEX WTI oil, the price on the last trading day of front-month NYMEX Henry Hub natural
gas and published West Texas Waha prices of natural gas.

We have entered into regional crude oil differential swap contracts in which we have swapped the
floating WTI-ARGUS (Midland) crude oil price for floating WTI-ARGUS (Cushing) crude oil price
less a fixed-price differential. As noted above, we receive a discount to the NYMEX WTI crude oil
price at the point of sale. Due to refinery downtime and limited takeaway capacity that has impacted
the Permian Basin, the difference between the WTI-ARGUS (Midland) price, which is the price we
receive on almost all of our Permian crude oil production, and the WTI-ARGUS (Cushing) price
reached historic highs in late 2012 and early 2013 and again in late 2014. We entered into these
differential swaps to negate a portion of this volatility. The following table summarizes the oil
differential contracts currently in place as of August 1, 2016, covering the period from July 1, 2016
through December 31, 2017:

We have also entered into multiple NYMEX WTI crude oil costless collar contracts. Each contract
combines a long put option or "floor" with a short call option or "ceiling." At an annual WTI market
price of $40.00, $50.00 and $60.00, the summary position below would result in a net price of
$45.00, $50.00 and $58.89, respectively.

We have also entered into multiple NYMEX WTI crude oil derivative three-way collar contracts.
Each contract combines a long put, a short put and a short call. The use of the short put allows us to
buy a put and sell a call at higher prices, thus establishing a higher ceiling and limiting our exposure
to future settlement payments while also restricting our downside risk. If the market price is below
the long put fixed price but above the short put fixed price, a three-way collar allows us to settle for
the long put fixed price. A three-way collar also allows us to settle for WTI market plus the spread
between the short put and the long put in a case where the market price has fallen below the short
put fixed price. For example, at an annual average WTI market price of $40.00, the summary
positions below would result in a net price of $65.00 for the remainder of 2016 and 2017. The
following table summarizes the three-way oil collar contracts currently in place as of August 1, 2016,

We have also entered into multiple NYMEX WTI crude oil derivative enhanced swap contracts. The
enhanced swap contract combines buying a lower-priced put, selling a higher-priced put, and using
the net proceeds from these positions to simultaneously obtain a swap at above market prices
(“enhanced swap price”). If the market price is at or above the higher-priced short put, this contract
allows us to settle at the enhanced swap price. If the market price is below the higher-priced short
put but above the lower-priced long put, this contract allows us to settle for the market price plus the
spread between the enhanced swap price and the higher-priced short put. If the market price is at or
below the lower-priced long put, this contract allows us to settle for the lower-priced long put plus
the spread between the enhanced swap price and the higher-priced short put. For example, at an
annual average WTI market price of $40.00, the summary positions below would result in a net price
of $66.70, $65.85 and $65.50 for the remainder of 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The following

Cash Flow from Financing Activities
Our net cash used in financing activities was $104.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to $51.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. During the six months ended
June 30, 2016, total net payments to our revolving credit facility were $75.0 million. We had cash
outflow during the six months ended June 30, 2016 in the amount of $21.5 million for repurchases of
our Senior Notes on the open market.
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, total net borrowings under our revolving credit facility
were $26.0 million. The proceeds from our net borrowings were used to finance our acquisition and
development activities as well as to fund a portion of our distributions to unitholders. We had cash
outflow during the six months ended June 30, 2015 of $66.6 million for distributions to record
holders of our units and $9.5 million for distributions to record holders of our Preferred Units, a
portion of which was funded from cash flow from operations with the remainder funded from
borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
Credit Facility
On April 1, 2014, we entered into a five-year $1.5 billion secured revolving credit facility with Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the “Current Credit Agreement”).
Borrowings under the Current Credit Agreement mature on April 1, 2019. Our obligations under the
Current Credit Agreement are secured by mortgages on over 90% of the total value of its oil and
natural gas properties as well as a pledge of all of its ownership interests in our operating
subsidiaries. The amount available for borrowing at any one time is limited to the borrowing base
and contains a $2 million sub-limit for letters of credit.
Page 41
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants of the Current Credit Agreement.
Depending on oil and natural gas prices in 2016, we could breach certain financial covenants under
our revolving credit facility, which would constitute a default under our revolving credit facility. Such
default, if not remedied, would require a waiver from our lenders in order for us to avoid an event of
default and subsequent acceleration of all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility
and potential foreclosure on our oil and natural gas properties. As previously noted, if the lenders
under our revolving credit facility were to accelerate the indebtedness under our revolving credit
facility as a result of a default, such acceleration could cause a cross-default of all of our other
outstanding indebtedness, including our Senior Notes, and permit the holders of such indebtedness
to accelerate the maturities of such indebtedness. While no assurances can be made that, in the
event of a covenant breach, such a waiver will be granted, we believe the long-term global outlook
for commodity prices and our efforts to date, which include the suspension of distributions to our
unitholders and Preferred Unitholders, as well as asset sales completed and anticipated as of the
date of this filing, will be viewed positively by our lenders. If an event of default would occur and
were continuing, we would be unable to make borrowings under the Current Credit Agreement, may
be unable to make distributions to our unitholders and our financial condition and liquidity would be
adversely affected. For further information related to our Current Credit Agreement, please refer to
Note 2–Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
As of June 30, 2016, Legacy had approximately $533 million drawn under the Current Credit
Agreement at a weighted average interest rate of 3.22%, leaving approximately $95.6 million of
availability under the Current Credit Agreement. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2016,
Legacy paid in cash $9.3 million of interest expense on the Current Credit Agreement.
We periodically enter into interest rate swap transactions to mitigate the volatility of interest rates. As
of June 30, 2016, we had interest rate swaps on notional amounts of $350 million with a weighted
average fixed rate of 1.20%. These swaps mature between September 2017 and September 2019.
8% Senior Notes Due 2020
On December 4, 2012, we, together with our 100% owned subsidiary Legacy Reserves Finance
Corporation, completed a private placement offering to eligible purchasers of an aggregate principal
amount of $300 million of our 2020 Senior Notes, which were subsequently registered through a
public exchange offer that closed on January 8, 2014. The 2020 Senior Notes were issued at
97.848% of par. We received approximately $286.7 million of net cash proceeds, after deducting the
discount to initial purchasers and offering expenses payable by us.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased a face amount of $52.0 million of our
2020 Senior Notes on the open market and exchanged 2,719,124 units representing limited partner
interests in the Partnership for $15.0 million of face amount of our 2020 Senior Notes.
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants of the 2020
Senior Notes. If an event of default would occur and were continuing, we would be unable to pay
distributions to our unitholders. As previously noted, if the lenders under our revolving credit facility
were to accelerate the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility as a result of a default, such
acceleration could cause a cross-default of all of our other outstanding indebtedness and permit the
holders of such indebtedness to accelerate the maturities of such indebtedness. For further
information related to our 2020 Senior Notes please refer to Note 2–Long-Term Debt in the Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
6.625% Senior Notes Due 2021
On May 28, 2013, we, together with our 100% owned subsidiary Legacy Reserves Finance
Corporation, completed a private placement offering to eligible purchasers of an aggregate principal
amount of $250 million of our 2021 Senior Notes, which were subsequently registered through a
public exchange offer that closed on March 18, 2014. This issuance of our 2021 Senior Notes was
at 98.405% of par. We received approximately $240.7 million of net cash proceeds, after deducting
the discount to initial purchasers and offering expenses payable by us.
On May 13, 2014, we, together with our 100% owned subsidiary Legacy Reserves Finance
Corporation, completed a private placement offering to eligible purchasers of an aggregate principal
amount of an additional $300.0 million of our 6.625% 2021 Senior Notes. This issuance of our 2021
Senior Notes was at 99.0% of par. We received approximately $291.8 million of net cash proceeds,
after deducting the discount to initial purchasers and offering expenses payable by us.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased a face amount of $117.4 million of our
2021 Senior Notes on the open market.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to select
and apply accounting policies that best provide the framework to report our results of operations and
financial position. The selection and application of those policies requires management to make
difficult subjective or complex judgments concerning reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements. As a result, there exists the likelihood that materially different amounts would
be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.
As of June 30, 2016, our critical accounting policies were consistent with those discussed in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates
pertain to proved oil and natural gas reserves, the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in
business combinations, valuation of derivatives, future cash flows from oil and natural gas
properties, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset retirement obligations and accrued
revenues. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
          
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use
(ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet
for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or
operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for
lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the
earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients
available. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our
consolidated financial statements.
In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, "Disclosure of
Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern" (“ASU 2014-15”). ASU
2014-15 requires management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to
provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The standard is effective for annual
periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of
ASU 2014-15 and do not anticipate any impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU
2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are
transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be
entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core
principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue
recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. In August 2015, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("ASU 2015-14"), which approved a
one-year delay of the standard's effective date. In accordance with ASU 2015-14, the standard is
now effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein,
using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the
application of the standard in each prior reporting period with
Page 43
the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative
effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes
additional footnote disclosures). We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of
ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and do not anticipate the standard will have
a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
 
The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and
qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to
the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices and interest rates. The
disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of
reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view
and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. All of our market risk sensitive instruments were
entered into for purposes other than speculative trading. These derivative instruments are discussed
in Item 1. Financial Statements – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 7 Derivative
Financial Instruments.
 
Commodity Price Risk
 
Our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production.
Realized pricing is primarily driven by the market prices applicable to our natural gas production
and the prevailing price for crude oil. Pricing for oil and natural gas has been volatile and
unpredictable for several years, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. The prices we
receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control, such as the strength of the
economy and the regional and international supply of oil and natural gas.
 
We periodically enter into and anticipate entering into derivative transactions with respect to a
portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through various transactions that offset
changes in the future prices received. These transactions may include swaps, enhanced swaps and
three-way collars. These derivative transactions are intended to support oil and natural gas prices at
targeted levels and to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price fluctuations. We have
recently had difficulty entering into new commodity derivative positions with our bank group, which
has restricted our ability to mitigate commodity price risk. We do not hold or issue derivative
instruments for speculative trading purposes.
As of June 30, 2016, the fair value of our commodity derivative positions was a net asset of $52.9
million based on NYMEX futures prices from July 2016 to December 2019 for both oil and natural
gas. As of December 31, 2015, the fair market value of our commodity derivative positions was a net
asset of $118.4 million based on NYMEX futures prices from January 2016 to December 2019 for
both oil and natural gas. While a significant portion of our projected oil and natural gas production is
covered by derivative contracts, such contracts are at a price point that is significantly lower than our
historical contracts. As a point of reference, assuming NYMEX oil and natural gas prices of $50.00
per Bbl and $2.50 per Mcf, respectively, for the remainder of 2016, we would anticipate receiving
total cash receipts of approximately $70.0 million for the calendar year 2016, representing an
approximately $62.9 million reduction from 2015. For more discussion about our derivative
transactions and to see a table listing the oil and natural gas derivatives from July 2016 through
December 2019, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations—Cash Flow from Investing Activities.”
Interest Rate Risks
 
At June 30, 2016, we had debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility of $533 million, which
incurred interest at floating rates in accordance with our revolving credit facility. The average annual
interest rate incurred by us under our revolving credit facility for the six-month period ended June 30,
2016 was 3.2%. A 1% increase in LIBOR on our outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility
as of June 30, 2016 would result in an estimated $1.83 million increase in annual interest expense
assuming our current interest rate hedges remain in place and do not expire. We have entered into
interest rate swaps with a weighted-average fixed rate of 1.20% to mitigate the volatility of interest
rates on notional amounts of $350 million of floating rate debt.
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.
 
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the “Exchange Act”) that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our general
partner’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
 
Our management, with the participation of our general partner’s chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016. Based upon
Page 45
that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our general partner’s chief executive officer and chief
financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish
their objectives.
 
Our general partner’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our
disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. The design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be
considered relative to their cost. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all of our control
issues and all instances of fraud, if any. The design of any system of controls also is based partly on
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions.
 
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our
fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Page 46
PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.  Legal Proceedings.
Although we may, from time to time, be involved in litigation and claims arising out of our operations
in the normal course of business, we are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. In
addition, we are not aware of any legal or governmental proceedings against us, or contemplated to
be brought against us, under the various environmental protection statutes to which we are subject.
Item 1A.  Risk Factors.
In addition to the information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors
discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.
The risks described in these reports are not the only risks we face.  Additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
Tax Risks to Unitholders and Preferred Unitholders
Our unitholders may be required to pay taxes on their share of our income even if they do not
receive any cash distributions from us.
Because our unitholders are treated as partners that are allocated a share of our taxable income
irrespective of the amount of cash, if any, distributed by us, unitholders will be required to pay
federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable
income, including our taxable income associated with cancellation of debt ("COD income") or a
disposition of property by us, even if they receive no cash distributions from us. As of January 21,
2016, we have suspended all cash distributions to unitholders and monthly cash distributions to
holders of our preferred units.
We may engage in transactions to de-lever the Partnership and manage our liquidity that may result
in the allocation of income and gain to our unitholders without a corresponding cash distribution. For
example, during the six month period ended June 30, 2016, we closed 18 divestitures generating
net proceeds of $87.5 million, and we may sell additional assets and use the proceeds to repay
existing debt or fund capital expenditure, in which case our unitholders may be allocated taxable
income and gain resulting from the sale, all or a portion of which may be subject to recapture rules
and taxed as ordinary income rather than capital gain, without receiving a cash distribution. Further,
we may pursue other opportunities to reduce our existing debt, such as debt exchanges, debt
repurchases, or modifications that would result in COD income being allocated to our unitholders as
ordinary taxable income. For example, in 2016 we have repurchased and exchanged approximately
$184.4 million of our existing debt at prices lower than face amount (see “Footnote 2—Long-Term
Debt”). These repurchases will, and similar transactions in the future may, result in COD income that
will be allocated to our unitholders as ordinary taxable income with no corresponding cash
distribution to pay the resulting tax liability. A unitholder who has held units for a long period of time
likely will have been allocated net tax losses, some of which may have been suspended. Such
losses should be available to offset any COD income, either in whole or in part. However, a
unitholder who has held units for only a short period of time will likely not have sufficient losses
allocated to them to offset any COD income.
The ultimate effect of any income allocations will depend on the unitholder's individual tax position,
including the availability of any current or suspended passive losses that may offset some portion of
the COD income allocable to a unitholder. Unitholders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors
with respect to the consequences of potential transactions that may result in income and gain to
unitholders.
Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our units could be more or less than expected because prior
distributions in excess of allocations of income will decrease our unitholders tax basis in their units.
If our unitholders sell any of their units, they will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference
between the amount realized and their tax basis in those units. Prior distributions to unitholders that
in the aggregate exceeded the cumulative net taxable income they were allocated for a unit,
decreased the tax basis in that unit, and will, in effect, become taxable income to our unitholders if
the unit is sold at a price greater than their tax basis in that unit, even if the price received is less
than original cost. A substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain,
may be ordinary income to our unitholders due to the potential recapture items, including
depreciation, depletion and intangible drilling cost recapture. In addition, because the amount
realized may include a unitholder’s share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if they sell their units, they
may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash they receive from the sale.
Page 47
Recently enacted legislation alters the procedures for assessing and collecting taxes due for
taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, in a manner that could substantially reduce cash
available for distribution to unitholders or for other uses.
Recently enacted legislation applicable to us for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017
alters the procedures for auditing large partnerships and also alters the procedures for assessing
and collecting taxes due (including applicable penalties and interest) as a result of an audit. Unless
we are eligible to (and choose to) elect to issue revised Schedules K-1 to our general partner and
unitholders with respect to an audited and adjusted return, the IRS may assess and collect taxes
(including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us in the year in which the audit is
completed under the new rules. If we are required to pay taxes, penalties and interest as the result
of audit adjustments, cash available for distribution to our unitholders or for other uses may be
substantially reduced. In addition, because payment would be due for the taxable year in which the
audit is completed, unitholders during that taxable year would bear the expense of the adjustment
even if they were not unitholders during the audited taxable year.
