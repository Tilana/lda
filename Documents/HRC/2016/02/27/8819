<p><b>  Mission to Kazakhstan</b>* ** 
</p>
<p>  (6 to 15 July 2009) 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 Kazakhstan has approximately 130 different ethnic groups, many of which have 
lived on the territory of Kazakhstan for generations. Initiatives taken by the Government in 
the field of minority issues have undoubtedly helped to ensure stability and respect for 
diversity and minority rights. These initiatives have included important policies to help 
preserve minority languages, establish and fund cultural associations for the preservation of 
ethnic cultures and traditions and the establishment of consultative bodies, the most 
prominent of which is the Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan.  
</p>
<p> The Assembly of the People, which plays a consultative or advisory role to the 
President, is a valuable national symbol of the recognition of minorities and the 
commitment of the State to the preservation of the cultural heritage of minorities. Nine 
seats in the lower house of Parliament are reserved for members chosen from the 
Assembly. However, the Assembly lacks the character of a legitimately representative 
body. Its membership is not constituted on a fully democratic basis and members are not, 
therefore, clearly accountable to their minority communities.

<p> Kazakhstan has not fully completed its transition to democratic institutions. 
Democratic structures, particularly at the local level, are critical for minorities to voice their 
concerns and issues and to achieve meaningful solutions. People belonging to minority 
communities expressed frustration at their lack of meaningful participation in political life 
and decision-making about issues that affect them. Some noted that even in localities where 
they make up a high proportion of the population, members of minorities are rarely 
appointed to fill senior positions of authority. If appointed, such minority representatives 
are confined in their actions to the conduct of a centralized policy from the capital.  
</p>
<p> According to the Constitution, Kazakh is the State language and Russian is used in 
State bodies on an equal footing. The Russian language is an important medium of 
communication for ethnic groups in Kazakhstan. The Government is moving forward with 
its policy to strengthen Kazakh as the State language. However, sensitivity must continue 
to be exercised to ensure that it does not have an undue impact on the rights and 
opportunities of those that might require additional assistance, time and resources to gain 
proficiency in the Kazakh language. In the period of transition towards the use of Kazakh 
as the primary language of administration, there should be no discrimination or undue 
restrictions, particularly with regard to recruitment and employment of civil servants and 
the rights of citizens to petition the Government or engage government services. 
</p>
<p> In the field of education, the Government has implemented positive measures to 
support minority schools and promote minority language education including through 
support to ethnocultural associations. Concerns were expressed however about: ensuring 
the highest standards of quality in minority and non-Russian language schools, including 
the Kazakh schools; guaranteeing adequate funding and resources, particularly to schools 
that teach in the languages of the smaller ethnic groups; ensuring sufficient provision of 
minority language textbooks; ensuring that all textbooks include appropriate consideration 
of the cultures, traditions and histories of minorities and their contributions to Kazakh 
society; and ensuring equality of access to university education for students from all 
groups. Most important is that all schools adequately prepare all groups for full inclusion in 
all aspects of Kazakh society. 
</p>
<p> Members of minority communities described an environment of relative equality 
and non-discrimination in private-sector employment, access to services and general 
societal interactions. Non-discrimination provisions exist in both the Constitution and 
individual pieces of legislation. However, Kazakhstan should adopt a specific, 
comprehensive law addressing racial discrimination to enhance enforcement of the rights of 
individuals from all communities to seek and receive remedies for acts of discrimination 
against them. 
</p>
<p> Kazakhstan has exhibited inter-faith harmony and religious freedom for those 
religions recognized as traditional or orthodox, however, people whose faiths are 
considered to be &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; (including Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, Baptists, evangelicals, 
Scientologists, non-recognized forms of Islam and others) feel that they have not been 
accorded the same freedoms. Rules for registration of certain religious groups, public 
statements and publications by the Government warning the population against certain 
religious faiths, confiscation of property, imposition of fines, arrests, deportations and other 
actions by police, national security agents and bureaucrats create a climate of repression for 
those religious groups. The independent expert urges that the rights and freedoms accorded 
to traditional religious groups must be extended to all religious groups and recommends a 
wide-ranging dialogue with &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; groups. 
</p>
<p> The Government and diverse people of Kazakhstan must be commended for the 
inter-ethnic tolerance that is generally evident in the society. Some incidents have occurred 
when ethnic tensions have flared into violent attacks on particular minority groups. In some 
cases deaths have resulted and community members have fled their homes. Although these </p>

</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>GE.10-10602 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>occurrences have been few and sporadic and do not signal a high risk of sustained inter-
ethnic violence, the ethnic dimensions of such incidents must not be ignored. There may be 
critical issues that must be addressed in an open and transparent manner in order to 
guarantee that inter-ethnic harmony is a reality.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The independent expert on minority issues conducted an official visit to Kazakhstan 
from 6 to 15 July 2009 at the invitation of the Government. She visited Astana and Almaty, 
and held consultations with senior Government representatives with responsibilities in the 
fields of minority rights, culture and language, anti-discrimination and equality. She held 
meetings with ethnic and cultural associations, non-governmental organizations, members 
of minority communities and journalists, and hosted a forum for minority women.  
</p><p>2. The independent expert thanks the Government for its cooperation throughout the 
preparation and conduct of her mission. She also thanks the United Nations Country Team 
for its cooperation and assistance and numerous non-governmental organizations, civil 
society groups and community representatives that met with her and provided valuable 
information. 
</p>
<p>3. Kazakh is the official language of Kazakhstan although Russian is used officially on 
a par with Kazakh in government institutions and is spoken by most citizens. Ethnic 
Kazakhs currently account for 58.6 per cent of the population, while ethnic Russians make 
up 26.1 per cent. Other ethnic groups account for 15.3 per cent of the population and 
include Ukrainians (2.9 per cent), Uzbeks (2.8 per cent), Uighurs, Tatars and Germans (1.5 
per cent each), and other groups 4.3 per cent. More than 100 other smaller ethnic groups 
live in Kazakhstan. The Government uses the term &#8220;nationalities&#8221; in preference to the term 
&#8220;minorities&#8221; to describe its ethnic groups, reflecting the relationship of many with a kin 
State or historical homeland.  
</p>
<p>4. The Constitution of Kazakhstan contains articles guaranteeing fundamental human 
rights in accordance with principles of international law and human rights treaties ratified 
by Kazakhstan. Article 4 (3) states that international treaties ratified by Kazakhstan shall 
have priority over its laws and be directly implemented except when the application of an 
international treaty requires the promulgation of a law. 
</p>
<p>5. Kazakhstan has ratified human rights treaties most relevant to minorities including 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Two 
domestic institutions oversee human rights issues: the Presidential Commission on Human 
Rights and the National Ombudsman.  
</p>
<p>6. Kazakhstan will take over the Chairmanship of the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2010. The Government has made pledges with regard to 
democratization and improving its human rights policies and practices to conform to OSCE 
standards.  
</p>
<p><b>  Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>7. The independent expert&#8217;s evaluation of minority issues in Kazakhstan is based on 
the 1992 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or 
Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities and other relevant international standards, from 
which she has identified four broad areas of concern relating to minorities globally: (a) the 
protection of a minority&#8217;s survival by combating violence against them and preventing 
genocide; (b) the protection and promotion of the cultural identity of minority groups and 
the right of national, ethnic, religious or linguistic groups to enjoy their collective identity 
and to reject forced assimilation; (c) the guarantee of the rights to non-discrimination and 
equality, including ending structural or systemic discrimination and the promotion of 
affirmative action when required; and (d) the guarantee of their right to effective </p>

</p>
<p>participation of members of minorities in public life, especially with regard to decisions 
that affect them. The independent expert applies a gender perspective in all areas of her 
work. 
</p>
<p>8. Each section below contains a summary of legislation, views expressed by senior 
governmental sources and the views of civil society actors, community members and 
others.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Historical context 
</b></p>
<p>9. A brief history of Kazakhstan and the forces that have shaped its demographic 
composition is vital to understanding the contemporary situation of minorities and 
legislation, policies and practice. The following is drawn from public historical and 
governmental sources.  
</p>
<p>10. For most of its history the territory of modern-day Kazakhstan was inhabited by 
nomadic tribes. The Kazakhs emerged as a distinct group in the sixteenth century, divided 
into three unions of tribes or clans claiming common ancestry and shared territory. Russia 
began advancing into the Kazakh steppe in the eighteenth century; by the mid-nineteenth 
century the territory was subsumed into the Russian Empire. The Kazakh Soviet Socialist 
Republic became part of the USSR in 1936.  
</p>
<p>11. Major demographic changes and the influx of a variety of different ethnic groups 
through both forced and voluntary migration marked the subsequent period. Under Soviet 
collectivization policies, intensive agricultural production entailed forced settlement of 
nomads and led to the death of most of their cattle &#8211; their only source of livelihood. 
Subsequent famine is estimated to have caused the deaths of 25 to 40 per cent of ethnic 
Kazakhs.  
</p>
<p>12. Between 1937 and 1949, Kazakhstan became the destination for huge deported 
populations whose loyalty to the Soviet Union was questioned. These included over 95,000 
ethnic Koreans, 444,000 Volga Germans and nearly 480,000 Chechens and Ingush, as well 
as smaller numbers of numerous other nationalities. The &#8220;Virgin Lands&#8221; campaign of 
1954&#8211;1956 opened up vast tracts of agricultural land and led to the further arrival of some 
640,000 settlers from Slavic and Baltic republics.1 
</p>
<p>13. By 1959, the census revealed that ethnic Kazakhs made up only 29 per cent of the 
population, while the Slavic and European nationalities represented nearly 60 per cent. The 
influx of Russian speakers, Russian culture and Soviet values, as well as of Stalin era 
purges of Kazakh intelligentsia, all served to turn Kazakhs into the most linguistically and 
culturally Russified of all Central Asian ethnic groups. Census statistics from 1989 revealed 
that 64 per cent of Kazakhs claimed fluency in Russian; in contrast, only 1 per cent of 
Russians and Slavs had proficiency in Kazakh. In urban Russophone settings, scholars 
described a dramatic loss of their native language among ethnic Kazakhs, with some 40 per 
cent unable to speak Kazakh.  
</p>
<p>14. Kazakhstan declared independence on 16 December 1991, the last Soviet republic to 
do so. It was the only newly independent State in which the titular ethnic group, the 
Kazakhs, did not constitute a majority. Independence brought radical demographic changes, 
including the mass emigration of Russians, Slavs and Germans. Overall, nearly 2 million 
Russian speakers left Kazakhstan in the decade to 2004. In addition, high birth rates among

<p>Working Group on Minorities at its ninth session. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>GE.10-10602 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Kazakhs and the return of large numbers of the Kazakh diaspora (<i>Oralmans</i>) contributed 
significantly to demographic changes. The 1999 census confirmed that Kazakhs constituted 
a majority with 53.4 per cent, whereas the Russian proportion had fallen from 37.4 to 29.9 
per cent. 2  
</p>
<p>15. A post independence policy of Kazakhization, including the promotion of Kazakh as 
the State language, some consider generated anxiety among minority ethnic Russians, 
Germans and Russian-speaking communities over their future prospects, and motivated 
mass emigration. The Government considers that emigration was a consequence of 
independence and relocation to historic kin-States, often assisted by those States, as well as 
economic considerations.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Political participation of minorities 
</b></p>
<p>16. Kazakhstan has a presidential form of government and a bicameral parliamentary 
system that consists of the Senate (Upper House) and the <i>Majilis</i> (Lower House). There are 
currently 10 officially recognized political parties. To register, a party must have at least 
40,000 members nationally and 600 members in each region. Political parties are prohibited 
from being based on racial, national, ethnic or religious affiliation. To obtain seats in the 
<i>Majilis</i>, parties must ordinarily poll at least 7 per cent of the vote. Only the party of 
President Nazarbayev, the <i>Nur Otan</i> (Bright Fatherland) party, reached this threshold in the 
2007 elections, however subsequent Constitutional amendments guarantee that at least two 
parties gain seats in the future. 
</p>
<p>17. In the 2007 elections, 98 of 107 seats in the <i>Majilis</i> were distributed on the basis of 
party lists to the political parties under the system of proportional representation. The <i>Nur 
Otan</i> party officially achieved 88.41 per cent of the vote in the elections, winning every seat 
in Parliament.3 Nine deputies of the <i>Majilis</i> are appointed from the Assembly of the People 
of Kazakhstan. The Senate is constituted on the basis of two members from each oblast, 
Astana and Almaty; 15 senators are directly appointed by the President. 
</p>
<p>18. The Assembly of the People (formerly &#8220;Peoples&#8221;) is a consultative body, established 
by the President in 1995 and charged with representing the communal interests of ethnic 
minorities. In its report for 2004 submitted to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, the Government explained that the Assembly&#8217;s objectives were twofold: to 
elaborate practical recommendations for consolidating society; and to assist the President in 
his activities as guarantor of respect for the rights and freedoms of the citizens of 
Kazakhstan, irrespective of their racial, ethnic or social origin, religion or beliefs.4 
</p>
<p>19. The Assembly has over 430 members, representing 40 of the largest ethnic groups, 
and has a Council of 56 members. The Government states that it performs a variety of 
cultural, inspirational, communicative and advisory functions. It revives and promotes 
ethnic cultures, languages and traditions; fosters national and ethnic patriotism; strengthens 
inter-ethnic unity and harmony through the monitoring of ethnic relations; and makes 
recommendations for State policy to develop friendly relations between the nationalities 
living in Kazakhstan.5 The Government notes that the Assembly ensures effective 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 Preliminary results of the 2009 census suggest that this trend continues, with ethnic Kazakhs 
</p>
<p>representing 67 per cent of the population and ethnic Russians 21 per cent.  
 
</p>
<p>3
 The All National Social Democratic Party officially achieved 4.54 per cent of the vote, while five 
</p>
<p>additional parties officially polled between 0.37 and 3.09 per cent.

<p>interaction between Government and civil society in the field of interethnic relations and 
assists Government in combating extremism. 
</p>
<p>20. In May 2007, Parliament amended the Constitution to give the Assembly 
constitutional status. It adopted the Law on the Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan in 
October 2008 which established that nine deputies in the <i>Majilis</i> would be appointed from 
the Assembly, in addition to the normally elected representatives.6 This system is intended 
to provide a more equitable ethnic distribution in Parliament and to empower ethnic 
minorities that may otherwise not have the ability to elect or nominate members of their 
ethnic group. Still, both houses remain predominantly Kazakh; only 10 of 47 senators are 
non-Kazakh, while only 24 of the 107 members of the <i>Majilis</i> are non-Kazakh.7 
21. The Government promotes the Assembly as a unique body with the authority to 
consider issues related to minorities. It is an umbrella structure that unites under its aegis 23 
national and more than 470 regional ethnic-cultural organizations from almost every region. 
The Assembly meets only once a year but has a permanent secretariat. Some civil society 
sources dispute the representative nature and scope of powers provided to the Assembly. 
The Government takes great pride in the Assembly of the People as a unique institution at 
the centre of Kazakhstan&#8217;s democracy, &#8220;with inter-ethnic consent remaining a pillar of 
democratic constitutionalism, rule of law, respect for human rights and freedom&#8221;.8  
</p>
<p>22. A State Commission on Democracy was established in 2006 to provide a forum for 
dialogue comprising representatives of Parliament, political parties, non-governmental 
organizations and the media. In 2007, it produced recommendations on enhancing the role 
of Parliament, political parties, civil society, local governance and media, and for fulfilling 
the potential of the Constitution. A working group made recommendations on amending the 
Constitution, resulting in reforms that include the reduction of future presidential terms 
from seven to five years as of 2012. President Nazarbayev, who has been in power since 
1989, however, is allowed to run for unlimited terms and to retain control of key 
institutions, effectively giving him lifetime powers and privileges. In response to 
international concerns, the Constitution was also amended to guarantee representation of at 
least two parties in Parliament. In the event that only one party passes the 7 per cent 
threshold, the party gaining the next largest percentage of votes will be given mandates in 
proportion to the votes received. The National Human Rights Action Plan recommends that 
the election law be further amended to lower the electoral threshold for seats in Parliament 
from 7 to 5 per cent of the vote.9 
</p>
<p>23. Kazakhstan continued its cooperation with the OSCE Office for Democratic 
Institutions and Human Rights regarding electoral reform, notably in the context of its 
chairmanship of OSCE in 2010. The undertakings made by the Government include 
reforming the law on elections and liberalizing the registration requirements for political 
parties. The &#8220;Road to Europe&#8221; programme is also highlighted as demonstrating its 
commitment to democratization and political modernization, to accelerate the transition to 
Western democratic standards and values.10

<p>24. Civil society actors raised concerns relating to minority political participation. Some 
political parties have complained that they are unable to meet the registration criteria to 
participate in elections. Widespread allegations of electoral fraud made by opposition 
parties and international monitors, such as the OSCE, have consistently charged that 
elections fall short of international standards.11 Despite Government claims of high voter 
turn-out at elections and freedom for political opposition, others strongly dispute those 
claims. The President appoints the chairman and two members of the Central Electoral 
Commission. 
</p>
<p>25. Some minority and civil society representatives expressed frustration regarding their 
prospects of achieving meaningful political participation and over Government claims of 
political reform. Serious democratic deficits reportedly persist in the country&#8217;s political 
environment and institutions. A highly centralized government structure is dominated by a 
single political party, and almost unlimited powers are vested in the President by 
Parliament.12 At the regional level, governors of the country&#8217;s 14 provinces (<i>oblasts</i>), 
mayors and deputy mayors are appointed by the President. In effect, he also appoints and 
may dismiss all judges,13 giving rise to allegations that the judicial system does not meet 
international standards of independence.  
</p>
<p>26. Critics claim that the membership of the Assembly of the People is largely 
appointed by the President and therefore that it lacks the character of a legitimately 
representative body based on an electoral process. The Government disputes this claim 
noting that the President approves candidates following a legitimate nomination and 
selection process taking into account the views of ethnic groups and ethnocultural 
associations. Concerns over presidential appointments extend to the appointment of nine 
Assembly members to seats in the Lower House. Critics portray the Assembly as a largely 
inactive, symbolic institution, not consisting of legitimate minority leaders and, as such, not 
an institution that provides for genuinely including minorities in representative 
Government. 
</p>
<p>27. The Assembly&#8217;s potential is equally hampered by restrictions on its activities to 
advising but not deciding on matters relating to the preservation of culture, traditions and 
the arts, celebrations and the functioning of ethnocultural associations. Some consider it 
&#8220;non-political&#8221; and actively discouraged from discussion of issues considered politically 
sensitive. Critics state that it is not empowered to consider, advise and provide 
recommendations on many substantive minority issues, including meaningful political 
participation of minorities and issues related to ethnic tensions, potential conflict or 
religious matters. 
</p>
<p>28. Members of smaller minority communities consider their opportunities for political 
participation to be extremely limited. Uighur community members noted that, even in 
regions in which they form the majority, they are rarely appointed to hold significant local 
government positions and are generally underrepresented in the public sector, especially in 
law enforcement bodies. It is commonly the case that ethnic Kazakhs and Russians fill 
senior posts. The Government asserts that discrimination on the grounds of national origin 
is banned under the Constitution (art. 14), and laws including the State Service Law. The

 All regular court judges are appointed by the President upon recommendation of the Higher Judicial

Senate. </p>

<p>Government notes that in the densely populated Uighur areas of Almaty region, Uighurs 
occupy numerous posts, including Governor and Deputy Governor. 
</p>
<p>29. Women are underrepresented in the Government of Kazakhstan in general. Minority 
women stressed that this is particularly the case for women from smaller ethnic groups. In 
2007, approximately 10 to 12 per cent of members of Parliament and 19 per cent of local 
governments and city councils were women according to a recent statement by a 
Government adviser.14 In Parliament, only 2 of the 47 senators are female, while 17 of the 
107 <i>Majilis</i> members are women. A presidential directive proposes to increase the number 
of women in executive level positions to 30 per cent by 2016.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Non-discrimination and equality 
</b></p>
<p>30. Article 14 of the Constitution of Kazakhstan includes a guarantee of equality and a 
ban on discrimination stating that (1) everyone shall be equal before the law and court; and 
(2) no one shall be subject to any discrimination for reasons of origin, social, property 
status, occupation, sex, race, nationality, language, attitude towards religion, convictions, 
place of residence or any other circumstances. The Criminal Procedures Code (art. 21), the 
Civil Procedures Code (art. 13), the Labour Code (arts. 4, 7, 22 and 145), the Law on 
Employment (art. 5), the Law on Migration (art. 3) and the State Service Act (art. 12, para. 
4) all refer to the prohibition of discrimination. There is no comprehensive anti-
discrimination legislation.  
</p>
<p>31. The Government considers that existing constitutional and legal provisions, and the 
status of international treaties to which it is a party, provide adequate legal protection 
against discrimination. 
</p>
<p>32. Two institutions in Government oversee human rights issues and have 
responsibilities in the area of discrimination: (a) the Presidential Commission on Human 
Rights;15 and (b) the Human Rights Ombudsman.16 The Commission, established as a 
consultative/advisory body attached to the office of the President currently has 22 members 
representing various elements of Kazakh society. The same presidential decree creating the 
Ombudsman also limits its powers; the Ombudsman is unable to review appeals and 
complaints relating to the actions and decisions of the President, Parliament and its 
members, the Constitutional Council, the Prosecutor General, the Central Electoral 
Commission and the Courts. The reports of these institutions include only brief reference to 
cases of discrimination and commonly find no proof.  
</p>
<p>33. Government representatives emphasized that no cases of discrimination on the 
grounds of ethnicity or nationality have ever come before the courts. There are no policies 
of affirmative action, such as employment quotas for minorities in the public sector. The 
Government notes that all are equal before the law and that such policies would constitute 
unfair bias or give unfair privileges to some. Disaggregated data along national or ethnic 
lines are collected in census surveys and by the statistics agency in various areas, including 
with regard to the number of different nationality groups employed in State service.  
</p>
<p>34. Non-governmental sources commented that the absence of court cases regarding 
racial discrimination reflects not an absence of discrimination, but rather an inadequate

<p>legislative framework, a lack of independent and effective mechanisms for individuals to 
make complaints and a lack of public confidence in the process. Courts are reluctant to 
classify or deal with violations as cases of discrimination. Mechanisms for ethnic minorities 
to submit complaints of discrimination are not widely used or understood by the public and 
are not considered politically independent. For these reasons they are ineffective at ensuring 
the rights of minorities. The Government asserts that the courts maintain high and 
improving standards and quality of justice and that confidence in the judicial system is high 
as indicated by social surveys in 2008. The Supreme Court has implemented measures for 
institutional strengthening and improving the functioning of the courts, including with 
regard to the quality and independence of judges.   
</p><p>35. Civil society groups call for an effective and independent human rights institution 
based upon strengthening the legal status, powers and functions of the Ombudsman and 
ensuring that it is an elected office. The Ombudsman should have the right to initiate 
administrative and criminal cases, recommend legislative amendments and address the 
Constitutional Council on human rights issues. Its independence should be legally 
protected.  
</p>
<p>36. There is a widely held perception of pro-Kazakh bias in Government and the actions 
of State officials, and that discrimination exists in favour of ethnic Kazakhs, particularly in 
government employment. This, minority sources argue, leaves ethnic minorities at a distinct 
disadvantage in many areas of public life. Underrepresentation of minorities in government 
posts is attributable, at least in part, to recent requirements that government workers speak 
Kazakh. This has reportedly created barriers to the employment, continuation of 
employment and promotion of non-Kazakh speakers. According to the Government, the 
State Service Act (art. 12, para. 4) bans any form of discrimination in relation to 
employment in public services.  
</p>
<p>37. Civil society groups consider the Law on Languages of 1997 to have set into motion 
policies which, while legitimately promoting the use of Kazakh, effectively discriminate 
against members of minorities and breach their minority rights with respect to language 
use. Russian, Uighur and other minorities are reportedly excluded from various economic, 
political, and employment opportunities owing to lack of proficiency in Kazakh. Members 
of the ethnic Russian minority historically occupied many government positions, a situation 
that has changed since independence. The mass emigration of Russians and other Russian-
speaking groups following independence is linked to pro-Kazakh policies and pessimism 
about their place in the country&#8217;s future.  
</p>
<p>38. Minority representatives whom the independent expert consulted stated that, in 
private sector employment and daily interactions, discrimination was not a major problem. 
However, according to a public poll taken in 2008, 23.7 per cent of self-reported minorities 
experienced ethnic prejudice and hostility; 14.4 per cent reported incidents of insults, 
humiliation, or other offences; and 11.8 per cent were discriminated against in employment 
or cases of dismissal.17 Members of ethnic minority communities allegedly remain reluctant 
to seek legal redress because they believe the system is biased. Some minority 
representatives expressed concern that the economic crisis and growing unemployment may 
have a greater impact on minorities in both public and private sectors.  
</p>
<p>39. Commentators described the growing prominence of ethnicity and nationality as 
important individual and group markers in society. The national project of &#8220;Kazakhization&#8221; 
has allegedly inspired growth in Kazakh nationalism. A rise in the use of nationalist slogans 
is reported, including &#8220;Kazakhstan for the Kazakhs&#8221;. Sentiments expressed in the media

<p>that minorities are &#8220;guests&#8221; who should be grateful for their place in Kazakh society were 
also reported. 
</p>
<p>40. Some groups are particularly vulnerable to discrimination and negative stereotyping. 
The Chechen community includes both citizens and a smaller group of war refugees who 
arrived in the past decade. Between 30,000 to 49,000 Chechens are thought to live in 
Kazakhstan, many illegally. Negative stereotyping, particularly during the Soviet era, of 
Chechens as &#8220;enemy people&#8221; or involved in criminal or terrorist activity has allegedly made 
it difficult for them to integrate according to some commentators. Chechens and Georgians 
are allegedly subject to non-formal immigration procedures and disproportionate scrutiny 
by police, who often practise racial profiling. The Government claims that all are treated 
equally under the law and immigration procedures. 
</p>
<p>41. The independent expert sought information about small minorities on the extreme 
margins of society. The Roma and <i>Luli</i> (or <i>Lyuli</i>) are generally described as nomadic and 
with livelihoods relying on informal trading, music, scavenging and begging. They may be 
de-facto stateless persons and are not represented in the Assembly of the People or other 
State institutions. Little information is available regarding their access to health care, 
education, housing and the effects of poverty. Members of these minorities often lack 
identification documents required to secure services; women and children may be 
particularly vulnerable. According to the Government, in January 2008, there were 5,153 
Roma in Kazakhstan, and measures were being introduced to prevent acts of discrimination 
against them, while no complaints or representations from the Roma had been recorded. 
Roma representatives registered the collective association <i>Tsygan</i> (gypsy), which works to 
promote the culture and traditions of Roma people.

<p><b> V. Identity, language, culture and religion 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Identity, language and culture 
</b></p>
<p>42. Article 7, paragraph 3, of the Constitution guarantees every person the right to speak 
and learn their language, declaring: &#8220;the State shall promote conditions for the study and 
development of the languages of the people of Kazakhstan&#8221;. Under Article 19, paragraph 2, 
everyone has the right to use their native language and culture and to choose freely their 
language of communication, education, instruction and creative activities. The Law on 
Language of 1997 replicates and reinforces these constitutional provisions. In its report 
submitted to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination,13 the Government 
points out that the State programme on the use and development of languages for the period 
2001&#8211;2010, confirmed by Presidential Decree No. 550 of 7 February 2001, was designed to 
secure not only the revival and extension of the use of the Kazakh language but also the 
preservation of the general culture and use of the Russian language and the development of 
the languages of ethnic groups. 
</p>
<p>43. Article 9, paragraph 3, of the Law on Education also establishes the right to 
education in one&#8217;s native language. The Government highlights general secondary 
education in pupils&#8217; native languages or teaching native languages as subjects; however, it 
also acknowledges difficulties in the organization of multicultural education arising from 
the complicated mosaic of ethnic cultures. A total of 65 schools have Uzbek as the 
language of instruction and 75 schools have mixed languages of instruction allowing 
79,426 to be enrolled in Uzbek-language education. There are 14 Uighur and 50 mixed 
language schools in the Almaty region, enabling 14,955 students to be enrolled in Uighur-
language education. Two Tajik schools and 10 mixed language schools teach 3,503 
students in Tajik in the South Kazakhstan region. Fifteen native languages are studied as </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/23/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>GE.10-10602 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>separate subjects in 126 general education schools; 76 general education schools provide 
optional language subjects or &#8220;study circles&#8221; in languages including German, Korean, 
Tartar, Polish and Ukrainian.13 
</p>
<p>44. The Government points out that the right to study native languages is realized by 
involving cultural associations in the implementation of the State&#8217;s language policy. A total 
of 79 Sunday schools established by national and cultural unions for children and adults 
receive support from the Ministry of Education and regional budgets for the teaching of 
native languages, including German, Korean, Hebrew, Tartar and Polish. Three &#8220;national 
revival&#8221; schools have also been established. There are plans for Sunday schools to provide 
courses in Kazakh. Members of over 80 nationalities are enrolled in institutes of higher 
education. At the Abaya National Teacher Training University, courses are taught in 
Uighur, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Korean, Chinese and German. 
</p><p>45. Every ethnic group residing in Kazakhstan has a right to establish national and 
cultural centres to promote the development of their language, culture and traditions. 
Cultural centres, supported by the Government, have been established in all regions to 
promote the ethnic identity of different nationalities. Members of the Assembly of the 
People are commonly chosen on the basis of their participation in ethnic cultural centres. In 
addition, there are Uighur, German and Korean theatres, the only examples in the former 
Soviet States. The independent expert visited Cossack, Russian, Ukrainian and Uighur 
cultural centres. Members demonstrated their activities, including in the preservation of 
music, culture and arts, and expressed their satisfaction with Government support. 
</p>
<p>46. Issues relating to language emerged as a considerable priority for minorities in their 
consultations with the independent expert. They stated that the number of minority 
language schools and schools with a mixed minority and Kazakh or Russian language 
education is reportedly decreasing as the number of Kazakh schools increases. They 
suggest a worrying negative trend away from the provision of education in minority 
languages that is concurrent with amendments to national legislation and a policy to 
promote the learning of Kazakh, Russian and English. 
</p>
<p>47. Civil society representatives note that previous legislation on education enacted in 
1999, such as the Law on Education, article 5, paragraph 3, included an explicit 
requirement that the State shall create conditions for national groups to learn their native 
language and may set up institutions or departments in the places inhabited by significant 
minority groups to meet their education needs. However, provisions in the new Law on 
Education (art. 9, para. 3) adopted in July 2007 are weaker, requiring only that the right to 
education in one&#8217;s native language is provided by setting up, if circumstances permit, the 
corresponding educational institutions. 
</p>
<p>48. Spokespersons of minority communities expressed concern that greater attention and 
resources should be given to developing and maintaining the system of minority schools. A 
decline in teaching standards, even with respect to the teaching of Kazakh and Russian 
languages in minority schools, and a shortage of adequately qualified teaching staff are 
increasingly problematic. Parents often regard minority schools as inferior educational 
alternatives that impede their children&#8217;s competitiveness for university entrance and 
employment. This has resulted in a marked decline in students attending minority schools. 
</p>
<p>49. School teaching materials in mainstream and minority language schools do not 
adequately reflect the history, cultures and contributions of minorities or the multi-ethnic 
nature of Kazakh society. According to one commentator, &#8220;We have brought up a whole 
generation since independence who know nothing about minorities, just about Kazakhs and 
Russians.&#8221; There is frustration that the State has not produced a new generation of 
textbooks to address this issue. The supply of textbooks is also a pressing concern, owing to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/23/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.10-10602 
</p>
<p>a serious shortfall for some minority schools. A lack of resources, corruption and printing 
presses that do not profit from small print runs for minority schools were blamed. 
</p>
<p>50. A meeting for minority women revealed their desire for equality of access to 
education and education outcomes to be improved for girls from minority communities. 
They noted that, especially in traditional rural communities, greater priority was given to 
the education of boys. Traditional gender roles were more likely to be preserved, thus 
restricting the opportunities for girls to pursue education. The Government notes that in 
December 2009 the Law on Equal Rights and Equal Opportunities for Women and Men 
was adopted with the aim of preventing discrimination on the grounds of sex. 
</p>
<p>51. Inequality of access to university for minority students was a common concern. 
University education is provided in Kazakh and Russian only,18 and the national testing 
system for high school students &#8212; the university entrance examination &#8212; is not available 
in minority languages. Consequently, minority students must first pass a graduation exam 
and then sit additional university entrance exams in Russian or Kazakh, which some 
struggle to pass owing to their poor language proficiency. Although an alternative 
&#8220;dissertation channel&#8221; exists for university entrance, minority representatives stated their 
desire for a long-term solution that ensures that language issues and difficulties faced by 
minority students are more thoroughly taken into account in the mainstream testing process. 
</p>
<p>52. The renaming of place or street names in the Kazakh language has reportedly 
become a politically charged issue causing growing resentment among minorities, including 
Uighurs and ethnic Russians. Some media have reportedly called for the renaming of the 
Uighur district of Almaty region following violent incidents between Kazakhs and Uighurs 
in late 2006. Uighur schools in this region have reportedly already had Uighur language 
signs and information reflecting Uighur history and commemorating Uighur public figures 
removed. Even in areas in which Uighurs make up a high proportion of the total population, 
restrictions exist on the use of Uighur as a means of official and administrative 
communication. 
</p>
<p>53. According to the Government, more than 80 per cent of the media is privately 
owned and it supports 19 regional national newspapers and numerous radio and television 
programmes in minority languages. The Russian minority has the greatest presence in the 
media, and Russian-language newspapers are common. Korean, Uighur, Ukrainian, 
Kurdish and German newspapers are also published. The Government states that there are 
324 ethnic language media outlets and that it provides financial support for newspapers, 
magazines, television and radio programmes in ethnic languages. Since 2002, all television 
and radio outlets, including minority media, are required to broadcast at least 50 per cent of 
their programming in Kazakh. Reports suggest that broadcasting in minority languages has 
significantly declined. In 1998, Kazakh State television reportedly broadcast Uighur-
language programmes for three hours a week; today this time has been reduced to 15 
minutes. 
</p>
<p>54. Civil society representatives claimed that a significantly higher proportion of the 
media was under de facto Government control and that the media operates in a climate of 
suspicion, Government monitoring and sensitivity over certain issues, including coverage 
of ethnic or religious strife, which limit the right to freedom of expression. Liberal use of 
criminal libel charges, fines, threats and harassment are reportedly common, leading to self-
censorship over such issues as ethnic relations. A law on Internet regulation, adopted by 
Parliament on 24 June 2009, classifies websites, blogs and chat rooms as media outlets and 
reportedly subjects them to strict regulation regarding reporting of elections, rallies, strikes

 The Government notes that 68 percent of the students in Kazakhstan&#8217;s higher education institutions 
</p>
<p>are taught in Russian. </p>

<p>and inter-ethnic relations. The Government asserts that in accordance with the Constitution 
(art. 20) freedom of speech is guaranteed and censorship is prohibited. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Religious freedoms 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Government Committee on Religious Affairs reported that, in 2008, there were 
representatives of over 40 religious confessions organized into 4,001 religious associations 
and groups. The Government highlights a considerable increase in the number of places of 
worship since independence.13 The majority of the population are of Sunni Muslim and 
Russian Christian Orthodox religions. The Government makes a conceptual distinction 
between &#8220;traditional&#8221; faiths and others that have emerged since independence, which it 
refers to as &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; faiths. It recognizes 50 organizations representing &#8220;non-
traditional&#8221; religions. Government representatives noted a high degree of religious 
tolerance, dialogue and strong inter-faith relations in a secular Kazakh State. Kazakhstan 
hosted the third Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions in Astana in July 
</p><p>2009. 
</p>
<p>56. Article 22 of the Constitution states that everyone has the right to freedom of 
conscience. Article 149 of the Criminal Code establishes criminal liability for obstructing 
the exercise of the right to freedom of conscience and religious belief. The Law on 
Freedom of Religion and Religious Association was passed in 1992. Amendments to that 
law were blocked by the Constitutional Council in 2002, on the grounds that they violated 
the Constitution by proposing to: (a) ban religious groups not registered with the State; (b) 
require registration of all missionaries; and (c) deny registration to certain unrecognized 
Muslim organizations. However, on 8 July 2005, President Nursultan Nazarbayev added 
amendments to the national security legislation19 that achieved the same restrictions on 
religious freedoms. Government officials informed the independent expert that they were 
engaged in fighting extremist groups and &#8220;sects&#8221; that promoted intolerance and disruption. 
As a result, all religious communities, missionary activities and religious literature must be 
registered. 
</p>
<p>57. Another amendment, proposed in 2008,20 sought once again to amend the 1992 Law 
on Religion to increase restrictions further. It was found to be unconstitutional by the 
Constitutional Council on 11 February 2009. The Council found that the 2008 proposed 
amendments held &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; religions to a different standard for registration 
purposes. The draft law proposed the establishment of a legal distinction between religious 
groups, having fewer than 50 members in any given locality, and religious associations, the 
former having no status as a legal person. Under the proposals, religious groups would not 
be permitted to engage in missionary work or maintain premises widely accessible for the 
purpose of worship. The Government highlights that the Constitution (art. 39) allows rights 
and freedoms of citizens to be limited by laws necessary for the protection of the 
constitutional system, defence of public order, human rights and freedoms and the health 
and morality of the population. Article 39 (2) states that any action capable of upsetting 
inter-ethnic accord shall be deemed unconstitutional. 
</p>
<p>58. The independent expert met with representatives of religious minorities, including 
Baptists, the Unification Church, Scientologists, the Baha&#8217;i, the Lutheran Church, the New 
Life Pentecost Church, the Agape Church, the Grace Church, the Ahmadi faith, the

</p>
<p>Association of Religious Communities of Kazakhstan and others defined by the 
Government as &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; religions or &#8220;sects&#8221;. Representatives expressed serious 
concern regarding restrictions imposed on them under the national security legislation of 
2005 and their feeling that an even more oppressive draft law would eventually be passed, 
despite the ruling of the Constitutional Council of February 2009. 
</p>
<p>59. Representatives described an environment of increasing oppression of &#8220;non-
traditional&#8221; religions, while noting that they strongly rejected this Government terminology. 
Their applications to join the Congress of Leaders of Religions were not accepted. They 
also described increasingly hostile and negative coverage in the media. 
</p>
<p>60. The representatives of Protestant Churches, Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses and branches of the 
Scientologists reported that bureaucratic delays and administrative regulations were 
regularly employed to create difficulties for them. In some regions, some churches have 
reportedly been trying to register for several years.21 Meanwhile, there were reportedly 
official proceedings to remove some churches from the official register. Excessively long 
delays in responding to registration applications were explained by the Government as 
caused by incomplete details on registration documents, insufficient specialist assessment 
staff and failure to provide tax records (even when documents had been confiscated).22 
</p><p>61. Religious representatives described &#8220;harassment and intimidation&#8221; by law 
enforcement and national security officers. Representatives of the Grace Church, the 
Unification Church, Scientologists and the Ahmadis stated that places of worship had been 
raided by &#8220;authorities&#8221; who confiscated computers, documents and religious materials. 
Some described national security members infiltrating religious meetings and videotaping 
proceedings. Reportedly, some later acted as witnesses in judicial proceedings against 
churches together with allegedly bogus witnesses, who testified against the church&#8217;s 
negative influence on them or discredited the beliefs in question and their legitimacy as 
religious beliefs. One representative stated, &#8220;Now it is very difficult to do anything 
together. People are afraid that the KGB have infiltrated the church.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>62. Charges brought against Churches include conducting illegal commercial or 
educational activities. Scientologists report charges that characterize their religious 
practices as illegal medical activities. Grace Church members reported allegations of drug 
use, espionage and inciting inter-religious enmity, in addition to tax fraud. 
</p>
<p>63. Some representatives stated that their beliefs required them to reach out to the wider 
society and to spread their religious beliefs. Under the legislative amendments of 2005, all 
those engaged in missionary activity must register with the Ministry of Justice. They must 
provide information on their religious affiliation and the territories and time periods during 
which they will conduct missionary work. All literature and materials must be registered 
and approved. Instances were reported in which authorities raided churches during services, 
photographed participants and arrested pastors. Individuals have been charged, fined or 
deported for offences including undertaking illegal missionary activities beyond the 
territories under which they are registered. 
</p>
<p>64. Civil society and some religious groups complain that the Government has, without 
cause, attempted to justify its restrictive policies and the activities of national security 
agencies on the grounds of &#8220;the fight against separatism, extremism and terrorism&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>21
 The Jehovah&#8217;s Witness community in Atyrau province had reportedly been attempting to register for 
</p>
<p>over seven years. 
 
</p>
<p>22
 Scientologists noted that a church in Karaganda was forced to close because taxes had not been paid, 
</p>
<p>despite documents proving payment having been confiscated by police. Ahmadi representatives also 
described having tax documents confiscated and subsequently being required to pay large tax bills. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/23/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>GE.10-10602 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>Because of historic associations, some minorities, including Uighurs, Koreans, Russians 
and Germans are particularly linked with certain non-traditional faiths. Some commentators 
expressed concern that, consequently, discrimination against religious groups also has an 
ethnic dimension. 
</p>
<p>65. In 2006, a Government decree encouraged people to avoid associating with &#8220;non-
traditional&#8221; and &#8220;extremist&#8221; groups.23 Leaflets prepared by the Ministry of Justice entitled 
&#8220;How to avoid the influence of religious sects&#8221; (a copy of which was given to the 
independent expert) warn against the risks of involvement with non-traditional religions 
and provide recommendations. The leaflets describe the activities of certain groups in terms 
of &#8220;treason against the Motherland&#8221; and &#8220;making havoc and spreading discord&#8221;, and should 
therefore be avoided if harmony and security is to be assured. Among the groups 
specifically referred to are Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, Baptists and Ahmadis. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Protection against violence 
</b></p>
<p>66. Government representatives acknowledge some incidents of violence involving 
Kazakhs and members of different ethnic groups. It downplayed their significance by 
noting that they are usually resolved locally, are not ethnic in nature and are motivated by 
socio-economic factors, criminality and &#8220;hooliganism&#8221;. The Government notes that the 
criminal legislation, including the Law on Counteracting Extremism, provides for liability 
for inciting national, racial or religious hatred and violence, and propaganda of superiority 
or inferiority of citizens on the grounds of their religion, ethnicity, tribal or racial origin. 
Although cases of incitement to ethnic or religious hatred in the press and published 
material were also acknowledged, the Government claimed that they were dealt with 
swiftly by the courts. National authorities stressed the extremely good inter-ethnic and 
inter-faith relations and tolerance in all regions. 
</p>
<p>67. Civil society sources described several incidents considered examples of aggressive 
manifestations of nationalism, ethnically-based tensions and violent responses targeted 
against minority communities. 
</p>
<p>68. In October 2007, in the village of Mayatas, the rape of a 4-year-old Kazakh boy was 
blamed on a Kurdish man. The suspect was detained by police, however, a group of 
Kazakhs reportedly attacked the home of his family and the neighbouring Kurdish 
community. A series of riots, attacks against Kurdish individuals and families and 
widespread damage to Kurdish property in the region, including with firebombs, reportedly 
led many Kurds to flee the village. Some have described growing anti-Kurdish attitudes, 
particularly in the media. 
</p>
<p>69. In March 2007, attacks were targeted at Chechen communities following a fight 
between a Kazakh and a Chechen in Malovodnoe. A large crowd reportedly gathered and 
attacked the property of the Chechen Mahmahanov family. Three members of the family 
and two members of the crowd were killed in the ensuing violence. Media sources reported 
that Chechen houses were plundered, property and cars burned, and small trading kiosks 
destroyed. Over 500 Kazakhs subsequently gathered and marched towards areas with large 
Chechen populations before being contained by police. Authorities reportedly blamed 
&#8220;hooligans&#8221;, underlying social conditions and poverty.

<p>70. Kazakhstan is home to an estimated 300,000 ethnic Uighurs, representing the largest 
Uighur community outside China. Representatives highlighted generally good relations 
with other ethnic groups and the State. However, some sources drew attention to a growing 
perception and stereotyping of Uighurs as extremists and separatists. A violent clash 
between Kazakhs and Uighurs in the village of Shelek in the Almaty region in November 
2006 left several wounded. Numerous anti-Uighur articles subsequently appeared in the 
Kazakh media. The country&#8217;s economic and political relations with China lead some to 
believe that this has influenced the Government&#8217;s restrictive response to individuals, 
Uighur associations or bodies considered politically aligned with Chinese Uighurs. The 
Government asserted that regional and local government authorities conduct preventative 
measures to avoid possible confrontation between ethnic Kazakhs and Uighurs. 
</p>
<p>71. The Government has reportedly placed restrictions on media coverage of ethnic 
clashes. Civil society representatives suggest a State policy of downplaying ethnic tensions 
by the Government in order not to damage a carefully cultivated perception of inter-ethnic 
harmony. They note that disregard of the root causes and consequences of tensions has 
resulted in a lack of necessary attention to conflict-prevention measures, including well 
developed mediation instruments and policing responses. The Government notes that an 
Action Plan for strengthening cooperation in inter-ethnic relations was initiated in 2008&#8211;
</p><p>2009. Activities include information sharing, monitoring of relations between ethnic groups 
and the identification of potential &#8220;hot spots&#8221;. In Astana and Almaty regions, permanent 
headquarters have reportedly been established for the early detection and prevention of 
inter-ethnic conflicts. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>72. <b>The Government and diverse people of Kazakhstan must be commended for 
the inter-ethnic tolerance that is generally evident in the society. As a relatively newly 
independent State, Kazakhstan faces the challenge of promoting its independence and 
reasserting its State language and Kazakh culture while fostering an inclusive sense of 
national identity, which encompasses all national and ethnic groups. Many groups 
have strong historical, ethnic, cultural and religious identities that they wish to 
maintain and express, while also seeking to build their futures as equal citizens of 
Kazakhstan.</b> 
</p>
<p>73. <b>In recognition of the complex social dynamics in Kazakhstan, the Government 
has taken positive initiatives in the field of minority rights that have undoubtedly 
helped to ensure stability and respect for diversity and minority rights. These 
initiatives include important policies to help preserve minority languages, the 
establishment and funding of ethno-cultural associations for the preservation of ethnic 
cultures and traditions, minority language media and the establishment of the 
Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan.</b> 
</p>
<p>74. <b>In general, however, Kazakhstan has not fully completed its transition to 
democratic institutions. Democratic deficits, centralized governing structures and a 
lack of transparency generally have a greater negative impact on minority 
communities and their ability to achieve meaningful political representation and 
participation. Persons belonging to some minority communities expressed frustration 
at their lack of meaningful participation in political life and in decision-making bodies 
and the lack of democratic local governance. Full access to democratic structures, 
particularly at the local level, is critical for minorities to voice their concerns and to 
achieve meaningful solutions to their issues. Efforts towards further democratization 
in all governing structures should be intensified, with effective political participation 
of minorities as a priority.</b> </p>

</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan, which plays an advisory role to the 
President, is a valuable national symbol of the recognition of minorities and the 
commitment of the State to the preservation of the cultural heritage of minorities. 
Assembly members are drawn from many minority national and ethnic groups active 
in the cultural associations from all regions. There are also Assemblies at the regional 
level. Nine members of the Assembly are chosen for appointment to the <i>Majilis</i>, the 
lower house of Parliament. The Assembly nonetheless lacks the character of a 
legitimately representative body. Membership is based on a selection process from 
members of ethnic, cultural and other public associations who meet with the approval 
of the President,</b>24<b> rather than a process which recognizes an equal franchise to every 
person within a minority group or all minority groups. Mechanisms should be devised 
to ensure that members of the Assembly are truly representatives of a minority 
electorate and accountable to them. Such a system would better guarantee that the 
true interests of minority communities will be represented at all levels.</b> 
</p>
<p>76. <b>The potential and legitimacy of the Assembly would be greatly enhanced if 
members were elected by each minority group directly and without reference to 
cultural associations, which are themselves not based on a principle of 
representativeness.</b> 
</p>
<p>77. <b>The Assembly&#8217;s work currently has an emphasis on the preservation of culture 
and traditions, the arts and supporting cultural associations. For the Assembly to 
fulfil its potential, its capacity as a consultative and advisory body to the President 
and Parliament should be strengthened in line with its constitutional status. It should 
be empowered to function as a standing body with frequent and regular sessions, and 
consider a wider range of issues of particular relevance to minorities, relating to 
meaningful political participation, religious matters, substantive issues of minority 
education and languages, measures to address practically and prevent ethnic tensions.</b> 
</p>
<p>78. <b>Representation of minorities within the Assembly at the regional and national 
levels is not a substitute for full and effective participation of minorities in 
mainstream processes to elect, on a democratic basis, members of the national 
Parliament and local government. Measures should be taken to build confidence 
among minorities in political processes, to democratize and enhance the powers of 
local governments and to develop concrete mechanisms for effective political 
participation of members of minority communities.</b> 
</p>
<p>79. <b>In this respect the independent expert draws the attention of the Government 
to the recommendations of the second session of the Forum on Minority Issues on the 
subject of Minorities and Effective Political Participation and urges it to consider 
implementation of these recommendations.</b>25 
</p>
<p>80. <b>Since independence, the introduction of policies to promote the Kazakh 
language and Kazakh ethnic identity has proved successful and generally been 
implemented in a measured and gradual manner. However, it has undoubtedly 
contributed to an emergent Kazakh nationalist movement. Equally, among some 
minority communities, which may have been historically powerful and numerically 
dominant, such as ethnic Russians during the Soviet era, pro-Kazakh policies have 
sometimes been viewed as constituting discriminatory measures, causing anxiety and 
leading many to emigrate to their kin-States. For many non-Kazakhs, including both 
Slavic and non-Slavic groups, the preservation of the constitutional guarantee of the 
use of the Russian language on a par with the State language in the public sector is

<p><b>viewed as a key factor ensuring the development of Kazakhstan as a multi-ethnic 
State. The Russian language is an important medium of communication for ethnic 
groups in Kazakhstan.</b> 
</p>
<p>81. <b>Evidence exists that nationality and ethnicity are increasingly important 
individual and group markers within Kazakh society. This may have a negative 
impact on the extent to which a shared sense of national identity emerges, based on 
integration and unity in diversity. Confidence-building measures should include 
strengthening legislation in the field of anti-discrimination and judicial remedies 
available to those who believe they have suffered discrimination on the grounds of 
national or ethnic origin.</b> 
</p>
<p>82. <b>Members of minority communities described an environment of relative 
equality and non-discrimination in private-sector employment, access to services and 
general societal interactions. Non-discrimination provisions exist in both the 
Constitution and individual pieces of legislation. However, no cases challenging 
discriminatory actions on the grounds of ethnicity have ever come before the courts. 
Some Government officials interpret this to mean that there is no discrimination in 
society. On the contrary, the absence of cases may be evidence of an inadequate 
legislative framework, a lack of independent and effective mechanisms for individuals 
to make complaints and a lack of public confidence in the process.</b> 
</p>
<p>83. <b>The independent expert endorses the recommendation of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination following its consideration of Kazakhstan in 
2004. Specific legislation regarding racial discrimination should be adopted to 
implement the provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination, and include a legal definition of racial discrimination 
that complies with the Convention. Legislation should create civil penalties for racial 
discrimination and authorize the establishment of a statutory monitoring and 
enforcement body with effective powers. The office of the Ombudsman should be 
restructured into an independent national institution that complies with 
internationally recognized rules of independence (the Paris Principles). Such 
legislation would considerably enhance enforcement of the rights of individuals to 
seek and receive remedies for acts of discrimination against them.</b> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>The historical and geopolitical circumstances that created modern Kazakhstan 
also produced a social and demographic dynamic in which many citizens, including 
many ethnic Kazakhs, do not speak the Kazakh language. The Government is moving 
forward with its policy to strengthen Kazakh as the State language. However, 
sensitivity must continue to be exercised to ensure that the policy does not have undue 
impact on the rights and opportunities of those communities that might require 
additional assistance, time and resources to gain proficiency in the Kazakh language. 
Long-term expansion of teaching and education in Kazakh alongside minority 
languages will allow a gradual process of learning of Kazakh by minority 
communities.</b> 
</p>
<p>85. <b>In the period of transition towards the use of Kazakh as the primary language 
of State administration, proficiency in Kazakh should in no way be used as a basis to 
confer or deny rights, freedoms and privileges belonging to all citizens. National and 
regional authorities must ensure that no discrimination or undue restrictions are 
experienced, particularly with regard to the recruitment, continuation of employment 
and promotion of civil servants. In addition, the rights of citizens to petition the 
Government or engage government services should not be impaired.</b> 
</p>
<p>86. <b>Minority languages should be accorded a status which allows for their use 
alongside Kazakh and Russian, particularly in regions with large, compact minority </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/23/Add.1

<p>

<p><b>communities. Changing place names or public signs into only Kazakh in areas with 
high minority populations may cause animosity. The Government is urged to use a 
dual language approach (Kazakh/Russian or Kazakh/minority language) when 
renaming towns and villages, in the use of public signs and when issuing public 
information documents.</b> 
</p>
<p>87. <b>While welcoming the provision and support of minority language schools, the 
independent expert requests the Government to take action to ensure the highest 
quality in non-Russian language schools, including minority language schools and 
Kazakh schools; guarantee adequate funding and resources, particularly for schools 
using languages of smaller ethnic groups; ensure sufficient provision of minority 
language textbooks; ensure that all textbooks include appropriate consideration of the 
cultures, traditions and history of minorities and their contributions to Kazakh 
society; and ensure equality of access to university education for students from all 
groups. The Government is commended for supporting the provision of informal 
structures, such as Sunday schools, where circumstances do not allow for the 
provision of permanent, full-time minority schools. Most important is that all schools 
prepare all groups for full inclusion in every aspect of society. Particular measures 
should be taken to ensure that minority girls do not face barriers to equality in access 
to education and equal education outcomes.</b> 
</p>
<p>88. <b>Kazakhstan has exhibited inter-faith harmony and religious freedom for those 
religions recognized as &#8220;traditional&#8221; or orthodox. However, faiths considered to be 
&#8220;non-traditional&#8221;, such as Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, Baptists, evangelicals, Scientologists, 
non-recognized forms of Islam and others, feel that they have not been accorded the 
same freedoms. Rules for the registration of religious groups that may violate both the 
Constitution and international norms, public statements and publications by the 
Government warning the population against certain religious faiths, unjustified 
confiscation of property, imposition of fines, arrests, deportations and other abuses of 
power by police, national security agents and bureaucrats appear to constitute 
repression of religious groups.</b> 
</p>
<p>89. <b>The freedoms accorded to traditional religious groups must be extended to all 
religious groups. No judgement should be made by the Government as to which belief 
systems constitute legitimate beliefs and which do not. The Government would breach 
its obligations to guarantee freedom of religion, freedom of thought and freedom of 
association if it denied registration to an organization as a way to deny the legitimacy 
of its religious doctrine. Furthermore, the Government must not determine that 
someone&#8217;s belief system or activities constitute a threat to national stability or 
individual security that is punishable without the commission of a criminal act.</b> 
</p>
<p>90. <b>The Government is urged to engage in a wide-ranging dialogue with &#8220;non-
traditional&#8221; religious groups about ways to guarantee their full rights and freedoms. 
Existing laws on religious organizations and activities should be brought into 
compliance with the Constitution and international legal standards, and not restrict 
the legitimate activities of individuals or religious groups. Repressive measures 
against religious groups and their members must stop immediately.</b> 
</p>
<p>91. <b>A number of recent incidents suggest that ethnic tensions exist and have 
occasionally flared into violent attacks on minority groups. In some cases, deaths have 
occurred and community members have fled their homes. While the events have been 
sporadic and do not signal a high risk of sustained inter-ethnic violence, the ethnic 
dimensions of such incidents must not be ignored. There may be critical issues 
simmering beneath the surface that must be addressed in an open and transparent 
manner in order to guarantee that inter-ethnic harmony is maintained. Aggressive 
manifestations of nationalism and incitement to racial or religious hatred in the media </b></p>

<p><b>and elsewhere must be met with appropriate responses. Positive models of inter-
community dialogue, mediation and conflict prevention exist in other countries and 
may be useful in this context. Appropriate mechanisms for policing and ensuring the 
rule of law in multi-ethnic societies are crucial to prevent violent incidents.</b> 
</p>
<p>92. <b>Groups, including Roma and <i>Luli</i> (or <i>Lyuli</i>), were generally described as 
nomadic or itinerant and with livelihoods solely in the informal sector. Such groups 
are not represented in the Assembly of the People or other State institutions. They 
often lack identification documents required to secure services and may be vulnerable 
with regard to access to health care, education, housing and the effects of extreme 
poverty. Women and children belonging to these groups may be particularly at risk. 
The Government is urged to constructively engage with such communities in order to 
assess their needs and address discrimination against them. Sustainable solutions 
should be developed to improve access to their rights.</b> 
</p>
<p>93. <b>The independent expert is concerned by reports received directly from human 
rights defenders in Kazakhstan and independent sources that the legitimate and 
lawful activities of some non-governmental organizations and individuals are 
hampered by interference, intimidation, surveillance and harassment by government 
security bodies and unknown actors. Organizations reported experiencing difficulties 
in carrying out activities or producing reports, including in the field of minority rights 
and ethnic relations and in defence of non-traditional religious minorities. Reports 
were received of alleged irregularities in the trial of one prominent human rights 
defender in September 2009. Non-governmental organizations must be allowed to be 
established and registered freely, to obtain funding and to conduct their legitimate 
activities in the field of human rights in an environment of openness, transparency, 
security and full legal protection.</b>
