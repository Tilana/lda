<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government of Azerbaijan, the Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons, Walter K&#228;lin, conducted 
an official mission to Azerbaijan from 2 to 6 April 2007. His main objective was to study the 
situation of internally displaced persons in Azerbaijan, including their rights to have access to 
education, health services, a livelihood and adequate housing, and to engage in dialogue with the 
Government to discuss past achievements, pending measures and future plans, not least 
concerning the eventual return of the displaced. The Representative also sought to exchange 
views with the international community and civil society. He outlined his initial views in a press 
statement released on 6 April 2007, with the complete findings and recommendations being set 
out in the present report. 
</p>
<p> The Representative visited Baku, Sumgait, Sabirabad, Imishli and Bilasuvar. He met with 
the President, the Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the State Committee on Refugees and 
Internally Displaced Persons, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and with other high-ranking 
officials. He also consulted internally displaced persons and their representatives in rural and 
urban areas. 
</p>
<p> While stressing the right of internally displaced persons to return voluntarily to their 
former homes in safety and dignity, the Representative welcomed the Government&#8217;s recent 
efforts to provide adequate living conditions to displaced persons in need. Given the magnitude 
of the displacement problem in Azerbaijan, the Representative was impressed with the results 
already achieved. He was satisfied that the Government takes its responsibilities under 
international law to fulfil the political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights of internally 
displaced persons very seriously. At the same time, the substandard living conditions of 
internally displaced persons who, after many years, continue to live in collective shelters, were 
of great concern to the Representative. Vulnerable groups among the displaced, such as elderly, 
traumatized and mentally ill persons, as well as female-headed households, are particularly 
affected.  
</p>
<p> The Representative encouraged the Government to continue providing humanitarian 
assistance to the displaced and implementing its plans to provide adequate housing solutions to 
all internally displaced persons, including those living in urban areas. The Representative 
stressed that newly-created settlements should be located so as to both guarantee the physical 
security of internally displaced persons and avoid cutting them off from employment and other 
economic opportunities. He suggested that the emphasis of the Government&#8217;s programmes to 
that effect be placed on the creation of livelihoods and on the participation of internally displaced 
persons in the design and implementation of these programmes, all the while paying special 
attention to the health and other needs of particularly vulnerable individuals. 
</p>
<p> The Representative appealed to the international community and to donors to support the 
Government&#8217;s efforts in this regard, particularly through technical assistance. He also called on 
the international community to renew its efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, thus 
enabling those wishing to do so to return to their homes and places of origin.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Following an invitation by the Government of Azerbaijan, the Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons conducted an official 
mission to Azerbaijan from 2 to 6 April 2007, in pursuance of his mandate (Commission on 
Human Rights resolution 2004/55, para. 24) to engage in coordinated international advocacy and 
action for improving protection and respect of the human rights of internally displaced persons 
through dialogue with Governments, non-governmental organizations and other relevant actors. 
His main objective was to study the situation of internally displaced persons in Azerbaijan, 
including their rights to have access to education, health services, a livelihood and adequate 
housing, with a view to assessing to what extent the recommendations made by his predecessor 
after a mission carried out in 1998<b>1</b> had been implemented. At the same time, he intended to 
engage in dialogue with the Government to discuss past achievements, pending measures and 
future plans, not least concerning the eventual return of the displaced. The Representative also 
sought to exchange views with the international community and civil society, and to strengthen 
partnerships among relevant actors. He outlined his initial views in a press statement released 
on 6 April, with the complete findings and recommendations being set out in the present report. 
</p>
<p>2. The Representative visited Baku, Sumgait, Sabirabad, Imishli and Bilasuvar. He met with 
the President, the Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the State Committee on Refugees and 
Internally Displaced Persons, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and with the Ministers for 
Economic Development, Education, Health, Labour and Social Protection, as well as with the 
Chairperson of the State Committee of Family, Women and Children Issues, the Ombudsperson 
and the Head of the Human Rights Commission of Parliament. He also had discussions with 
international agencies and non-governmental organizations, and consulted internally displaced 
persons and their representatives in rural and urban areas. 
</p>
<p>3. The Representative would like to express his gratitude and recognition for the full 
cooperation of the authorities of Azerbaijan and their willingness to receive him, and for the 
open and constructive nature of the meetings. The Representative is indebted to the 
United Nations country team under the leadership of the Resident Coordinator, and in particular 
to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), for the high quality of briefings and advice and the 
generous logistical support to his mission. He is grateful for the information and expertise 
provided to him by representatives of the humanitarian community and by international and 
non-governmental organizations. Finally, he would like to thank the internally displaced persons 
who were ready to share their experiences with him.

</b>  Report of the Representative of the Secretary-General, Francis M. Deng, submitted pursuant 
</p>
<p>to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/50, Profiles in displacement: Azerbaijan 
(E/CN.4/1999/79/Add.<footnote name="1">8. As job opportunities are scarce in remote settlements, only a minority of internally 
displaced persons living there have found employment in schools, clinics or small factories 
constructed by the Government. While pilot projects for upgrading skills and vocational training,

</p>
<p>4. The Representative&#8217;s conclusions and recommendations in the present report are based on 
the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement,<b>2</b> which are recognized by States as an 
important international framework for the protection of internally displaced persons 
(General Assembly resolution 60/1). The Representative stresses that internally displaced 
persons in Azerbaijan are, as citizens of their country, entitled to enjoy the protection of all 
guarantees of international human rights and humanitarian law subscribed to by the State or 
applicable on the basis of customary international law. Internally displaced persons do not lose, 
as a consequence of their being displaced, the rights of the population at large. At the same time, 
they have specific needs distinct from those of the non-displaced population that need to be 
addressed by specific protection and assistance measures. The rights of internally displaced 
persons are reflected and detailed in the Guiding Principles. The primary duty and responsibility 
to provide such protection lies with the national authorities, and internally displaced persons 
have the right to request and receive such protection and assistance from their Government 
(Principle 3). As the Representative stressed in his 2006 report to the Commission on 
Human Rights (E/CN.4/2006/71, paras. 4-12), protection must not be limited to securing the 
survival and physical security of internally displaced persons but relates to all relevant 
guarantees, including civil and political as well as economic, social and cultural rights attributed 
to them by international human rights and humanitarian law. In this regard, Azerbaijan has an 
obligation to prevent any violations of these rights from occurring or re-occurring; to stop them 
while they are being committed; and to ensure reparation to and full rehabilitation of victims. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  CONTEXT OF INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  History of displacement 
</b></p>
<p>5. From 1988 to early in 1991, up to 300,000 ethnic Armenians fled from Azerbaijan to 
Armenia, while 185,000 or more ethnic Azerbaijanis fled from Armenia to Azerbaijan owing to 
rising ethnic violence and growing tensions over the status of the formerly autonomous region of 
Nagorny Karabakh.<b>1</b> According to the Government, 250,000 ethnic Azerbaijanis left Armenia 
and 250,000 ethnic Armenians left Azerbaijan. In 1989, about 50,000 Meskhetian Turks found 
refuge in Azerbaijan. Following the independence of Azerbaijan from the Soviet Union in 
October 1991 and the unilateral, non-recognized declaration of independence by the authorities 
of Nagorny Karabakh in January 1992, the conflict over the region escalated into full-scale war, 
causing a high number of casualties; approximately one-fifth of the territory of Azerbaijan was 
occupied. By the time a ceasefire was concluded in May 1994, an estimated 650,000 persons had 
been forcibly displaced within Azerbaijan. Reportedly, approximately 30,000 additional people, 
mainly ethnic Armenians from different areas of origin, remained displaced within 
Nagorny Karabakh itself,<b>3</b> however, little is known about their situation. The Government 
estimates that, on top of the immense human suffering, the war caused considerable damage to

under adequate conditions, and insists that returnees be able to have access to and restore their 
property where possible. Its assistance to the return, which has been welcomed by the 
Government, would be led by sectors under the overall coordination of UNHCR; UNHCR and 
ICRC would be in charge of ensuring the protection of internally displaced persons, UNICEF </footnote>, annex.

<p>public infrastructure and private assets. Entire towns were levelled and infrastructure, including 
public buildings, such as hundreds of schools, were destroyed or dismantled after the fighting 
stopped. 
</p>
<p>6. The Representative&#8217;s predecessor in office, Francis Deng, following his mission to 
Azerbaijan in 1998, urged the Government to address the substandard living conditions of the 
internally displaced in a comprehensive and effective manner, with particular attention to be paid 
to ensuring that their most basic needs for food, shelter, clothing and medical services were met. 
He observed serious health problems, including malnutrition, and a lack of adequate sanitation. 
One of his main recommendations was to improve educational services and economic 
opportunities for the internally displaced, for instance through skills-training programmes, 
meaningful income-generating activities and opportunities for microcredit, with the full 
participation of women. He also called for measures aimed at improving coordination among and 
between national and local authorities to address the needs of the internally displaced; reforming 
legislation governing activity of non-governmental organizations, especially in relation to 
taxation and their lending activities, in order to create an environment more supportive of their 
work; safeguarding the right to freedom of movement and choice of residence by ensuring the 
removal of remnants of the propiska system; and ensuring that internally displaced persons were 
not discriminated against or otherwise negatively affected by the process of land privatization 
currently under way. Finally, the former Representative stressed the need to find a lasting and 
peaceful solution to the conflict.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>7. At the time of the Representative&#8217;s visit, 686,<footnote name="5">7. Although the political will, effective cooperation between national and international 
demining agencies and sufficient capacity are in place, experts fear that mine clearance in the 
occupied territories may take up to several years. If only to facilitate these efforts and to 
minimize the risk of a high number of casualties, a peaceful solution to the conflict is necessary 
so that precise information about the location of mines can be obtained. </footnote>86 persons (176,<footnote name="2">8. The international community has progressively reduced its attention to internally displaced 
persons in Azerbaijan and has shifted from direct assistance to more broad-based economic 
development programmes or technical support and advocacy. Many United Nations agencies and 
other international actors were forced to reduce their activities owing to a lack of donor support. 
The cuts by WFP in the provision of food rations have been noted with particular concern. 
Waning donor support is apparently due to funding constraints in favour of emergencies 
elsewhere, increasing oil revenues at the State&#8217;s disposal and strengthened Government support 
for internally displaced persons, impatience with the perceived lack of progress towards a 
peaceful resolution of the conflict and the mainstreaming of programmes for internally displaced 
persons into broader economic development programmes. 
</footnote>58 families) from 
Nagorny Karabakh and seven adjacent regions were registered as displaced by the Government.<b>4</b> 
These figures include descendants of internally displaced persons born in displacement and who 
have the right to acquire the status of internally displaced person.<b>5</b> Given an overall population of 
about 8.5 million, Azerbaijan thus continues to suffer from one of the highest proportions of 
displaced persons in the world. Approximately half of the displaced reside in urban areas, such 
as in Baku and Sumgait, either with relatives, in collective shelters and public buildings or in 
private accommodation; the other half live in rural and semi-rural settlements, including in 
remaining tent camps and railway wagons, with a majority clustered around towns in the south 
or in districts adjacent, and in some cases uncomfortably near, to the ceasefire line.

Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families. Azerbaijan is also a signatory to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and it has signed, but not yet ratified, its 
Optional Protocol. Azerbaijan has not issued a standing invitation to the special procedures of 
the Human Rights Council. It is party to other international conventions, including the 
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the Convention 
relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951 and its Protocol of 1967. It is also party to the 
four 1949 Geneva Conventions, but not the 1977 Protocols additional to them. Finally, at the 
international level, Azerbaijan is also party to the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless 
Persons of 1954 and the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness of 1961. At the regional 
level, Azerbaijan is party to the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms, including several of its protocols, as well as the European Convention for the 
Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its protocols. 
</p>
<p>9. Articles 148 and 151 of the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan recognize that 
adopted international agreements constitute an integral part of its legal system, taking precedence 
over contradicting national legislation. As a <i>lex specialis</i>, the Constitution (art. 12) provides for 
the primacy of international human rights over the appropriate constitutional provisions. In line 
with Guiding Principle 5, all State authorities are thus bound by this article to ensure the 
protection of human rights and abide by international humanitarian law guarantees throughout 
the territory under their jurisdiction. 
10. Several human rights problems, including torture and ill-treatment in places of detention, 
acts of intolerance or infringements of freedom of expression, have been noted by international 
experts. According to the Government, the strengthening of efforts in promoting rule of law and 
protection of human rights is one of its main priorities and it has gained significant achievements 
in implementation of its international commitments, although the continuation of systematic 
reforms in the protection of human rights is required.<b>6</b> For this purpose, the President of 
Azerbaijan issued an executive order approving the national action plan on the protection of 
human rights in December 2006. The plan envisages measures aimed at bringing existing 
legislation into line with international standards, further developing cooperation with 
international organizations, ensuring the protection of rights of all segments of the population, 
improving the activities of State bodies in upholding human rights, strengthening interaction 
between State and civil society and promoting human rights education.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>11. Since the establishment in 2002 of the office of the Ombudsman, whose mandate includes 
an individual complaints mechanism, the Ombudsperson has organized training sessions for 
non-governmental organizations and Government officials on the national action plan for human 
rights, created a 24-hour hotline to receive complaints of ill-treatment and torture, monitored 
prisoners&#8217; rights and engaged in awareness-raising and advocacy on behalf of vulnerable groups, 
including internally displaced persons.

</p>
<p>12. With regard to the human rights of internally displaced persons, in 2004, the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted that they suffered from persistently high 
unemployment, an inadequate standard of living and a high incidence of malnutrition, infant 
mortality and other health problems.<b>7</b> In 2005, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination raised concerns about discrimination of, inter alia, displaced persons in the areas 
of employment, education, housing and health.<b>8</b> In 2006, the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child expressed its concern about discriminatory attitudes towards certain groups of children, 
including internally displaced children, and recommended that such children be placed in schools 
in local communities in order to facilitate their integration.<b>9</b> Finally, in 2007, the Committee on 
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women noted that internally displaced women and 
girls remained in a vulnerable and marginalized situation, in particular with regard to access to 
education, employment, health and housing.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  RESPONSES TO INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Domestic responses 
</b></p>
<p>13. The 1999 Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on internally displaced persons and refugee 
status defines an internally displaced person as &#8220;any person who has moved to another place, 
being forced to leave his/her permanent residence within the territory of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan in connection with military aggression, natural or man-made disaster&#8221; (art. 1). The 
status of internally displaced person ceases if the person returns to the place of his/her former 
residence or is provided with appropriate living space in the same region, or, if such resettlement 
is impossible, if he/she is provided with a proper apartment elsewhere under a special decree of 
the State (art. 14). 
</p>
<p>14. In addition, dozens of decrees, legislative acts and Cabinet of Ministers decisions contain 
provisions addressing the special needs of displaced persons. In order to alleviate their difficult 
situation, internally displaced persons are exempt from income tax, higher education fees and 
certain court fees, and their access to bank loans is facilitated. They enjoy free access to 
education and health services. Under the 1998 Labour Code, they are included among the 
vulnerable groups benefiting from special protection against unemployment. They are also 
exempt from the obligation to present their employment record when seeking employment or

<p><b>7
</b>  Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Concluding Observations on 
</p>
<p>Azerbaijan, 26 November 2004 (E/C.<footnote name="1">7. At the time of the Representative&#8217;s visit, the Government had already resettled 
thousands of the most vulnerable families of internally displaced persons to temporary new 
settlements. According to the State Committee on Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons, 
10,450 housing units were constructed between 2004 and 2006. In 2006 alone, 13 settlements 
(3,860 houses) complete with infrastructure were constructed in different regions. It should be 
noted that the Government regards it as expedient to settle displaced communities together in 
order to preserve their social structures predating displacement, so as to facilitate eventual 
reintegration in places of origin. 
</footnote>2/1/Add.<footnote name="1">6. The State programme comprised a range of measures and assigned deadlines and concrete 
responsibilities to competent ministries and State agencies, with the expectation of quarterly 
reports to monitor implementation. A major component of the programme was the closure of 
substandard shelters and the allocation of adequate alternative housing and land plots for 
agricultural purposes. It was also stipulated that relevant officials must not tolerate attempts to 
evict internally displaced persons from public buildings, apartments and land they temporarily 
occupied between 1992 and 1998, regardless of ownership issues, until the displaced returned or 
moved to new temporary settlements or houses. The programme further encouraged private 
companies to recruit refugees and internally displaced persons.

<p>registering for State pensions. A Cabinet decision of 1999 outlawed the eviction of internally 
displaced persons living in public buildings or private property, unless they were offered 
alternative accommodation under adequate conditions. The State covers their expenses for 
communal services, such as gas, water and electricity supply, as well as transport costs. It also 
hands out a monthly food allowance of nine manat (approx. $11) to every internally displaced 
person, which is to be continued for three years following their return in order to facilitate 
reintegration. The Government also assists internally displaced persons living in communal 
settlements with other subsidies and donations, such as seed, fertilizer and agricultural tools. 
</p>
<p>15. During the 1990s, the Government primarily focused on the priority of the return of 
internally displaced persons to their homeland and therefore did little to address the housing and 
economic needs of the displaced. In 2002, it commenced a resettlement programme, pursuant to 
a presidential decree, with the aim of offering improved living conditions to the worst-off among 
the displaced population. The Government then realized that, despite the wide range of measures 
taken to improve the living standards of and generate employment for refugees and internally 
displaced persons, the majority of them were still living in very difficult conditions in tent 
camps, railway carriages, run-down public buildings not suitable for normal living and other 
temporary settlements. In response to these problems, it formalized the State programme for the 
improvement of living standards and generation of employment for refugees and internally 
displaced persons, adopted by presidential decree in 2004 to improve living standards while 
maintaining the goal of return, which the Government affirmed would be subject to the free 
decision of the displaced.

<p>expand them in the near future, the vast majority of internally displaced persons in rural areas 
remain unemployed. In urban areas, they were reportedly more likely to benefit from general 
measures such as the creation of around 340,000 jobs since 2004, as a result of which the 
absolute poverty level fell from 49 per cent in 2002 to 20 per cent in 2006. The Heydar Aliyev 
Foundation, in cooperation with the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic, reportedly 
created special workplaces for internally displaced women. The exercise was deemed successful 
by the Government and is to be replicated. 
</p>
<p>19. The Government acknowledged that the continuously difficult situation for the majority of 
internally displaced persons was partly a reflection of its failure to anticipate the protraction of 
the conflict. At the same time, significant problems remained; in the 1990s, the Government did 
not assist internally displaced persons sufficiently and its responses were less well coordinated. 
Other obstacles to efficient responses, such as corruption and embezzlement, are now reportedly 
being combated and legislation has largely been brought into line with international standards. 
Indeed, the $1 million allocated by the Government for assistance to internally displaced 
persons in 1995 had risen to $200 million by 2006, of which $100 million came from the 
State Oil Fund. At the time of the Representative&#8217;s visit, the Government was planning to 
allocate $225 million (124 million from the State Oil Fund) in 2007. 
</p>
<p>20. The money allocated would be spent to fulfil the President&#8217;s pledge to demolish all 
existing tent camps by the end of 2007. As the next step, the Government planned to address the 
housing needs of internally displaced persons living in urban collective centres, such as public 
buildings. According to the Deputy Prime Minister, the rehabilitation of over 100 collective 
centres is planned, and will be swiftly implemented if funds became available. Although the 
Government stressed that the rapidly rising national income reduced the need for international 
humanitarian assistance, such a need nevertheless persisted owing to the magnitude of other 
problems confronting the Government, such as poverty and unemployment. 
</p>
<p>21. The Deputy Prime Minister, who is also Chairman of the State Committee on Refugees 
and Internally Displaced Persons, is responsible for the Government resettlement programme 
and for coordinating the responses of other governmental agencies to internal displacement as 
well as the activities of international and non-governmental organizations. The Committee 
cooperates closely with local executive committees; in each district, officers of the executive 
committees and the State Committee oversee the assistance programmes and report directly to 
the Deputy Prime Minister&#8217;s office. Reportedly, this arrangement has significantly improved the 
necessary coordination between relevant actors. 
</p>
<p>22. Recently, the Government initiated work on a framework plan on the return of displaced 
persons. It is hoped that the plan will be supported by and implemented in close cooperation with 
the international community. The Government acknowledged that adequate conditions must first 
be put in place before returns can proceed in safety and dignity. As the first step, the daunting 
task of mine clearance would have to be undertaken. The Government had already prepared mine 
clearance activities with the United Nations Mine Action Service, the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank, and has begun to remove mines near the 
ceasefire line, in line with the recommendations of the Representative&#8217;s predecessor. Next, </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/6/Add. 2

</p>
<p>destroyed public and economic infrastructure would need to be restored, a process estimated to 
take several years before the return of internally displaced persons could be envisaged. The 
Government will not shy away from its responsibility to assist internally displaced persons 
during the readjustment, reconstruction and reintegration phase. 
23. The Representative was thoroughly impressed with the most generous hospitality extended 
towards internally displaced persons by the general population. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  International responses 
</b></p>
<p>24. The attention of the United Nations to the issue of internal displacement in Azerbaijan goes 
back to the early 1990s, when the Security Council demanded the immediate cessation of 
hostilities and the withdrawal of occupying forces and urged the parties concerned to resume 
negotiations immediately for the resolution of the conflict within the framework of the peace 
process of the Minsk Group of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and 
refrain from any action that would obstruct a peaceful solution of the problem (resolution 822 
(1993)). In its subsequent resolution 844 (1993), the Council reiterated its demand for the 
immediate cessation of all hostilities and the withdrawal of occupying forces. In its 
resolution 874 (1993), the Council also requested the Secretary-General and relevant 
international agencies to provide urgent humanitarian assistance to the affected civilian 
population and to assist displaced persons to return to their homes. 
</p>
<p>25. The Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe began 
mediation efforts in early 1992.<b>11</b> In 1995, a co-chairmanship was established, resulting in 
management roles for France, the Russian Federation and the United States of America.<b>12</b> 
Representatives from these States have had regular closed meetings with the Presidents and 
Foreign Ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia for well over a decade in the hope of reaching a 
compromise on some of the seemingly intractable conditions of the two parties. Given the lack 
of tangible progress to date, the co-chairs have at times expressed their frustration at the apparent 
lack of political will shown by the negotiating parties. 
</p>
<p>26. A number of United Nations and other specialized agencies are present in Azerbaijan, 
including the International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Organization for 
Migration, UNDP, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the 
United Nations Development Fund for Women, the World Food Programme (WFP) and the

</p>
<p>World Health Organization (WHO), as well as financial institutions, such as the International 
Monetary Fund and the World Bank. WHO is assisting the Government to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals, which include the reduction of child and maternal mortality. In 
tandem with other organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, WHO 
will increasingly focus on addressing mental health problems. ILO endeavours to provide 
internally displaced persons with useful skills, for example in the area of construction work, 
which would enlarge their employment prospects and serve them on their return. In coordination 
with non-governmental organizations, UNHCR has been rehabilitating residential and school 
buildings occupied by internally displaced persons in urban centres, implemented 
community-based projects for the benefit of children and the elderly, and conducted vocational 
training. UNHCR is planning an initial mission to Nagorny Karabakh and subsequently to 
surrounding territories in the near future to assess the situation there and in the other territories 
held by the Armenian forces in the light of the situation of internally displaced persons and 
refugees and in anticipation of a major population movement following a peace agreement. 
WFP has been distributing food aid and supporting coping strategies and income-generation. 
In 2007, it planned to provide monthly food assistance to 136,000 families of internally 
displaced persons. The World Bank provides funding for shelter, employment, education, 
infrastructure and health-care programmes. 
</p>
<p>27. ICRC is focusing on missing persons, detainees in connection with the conflict and 
mine-awareness programmes, as a result of which mine accidents have already been reduced. 
Various non-governmental organizations, such as the Norwegian and Danish Refugee Councils, 
are engaged in advocacy for the human rights of internally displaced persons and in the 
construction and rehabilitation of shelters and schools for them. They also provide loans for 
income-generation projects and support the development of microcredit institutions. A number 
of non-governmental organizations have reportedly experienced unreasonable constraints by 
the registration system of Azerbaijan and by high taxes, despite reforms to simplify procedures 
in 2003.

<p>would be responsible for water supply, sanitation and education, UNDP for early recovery, WFP 
for food provision and WHO for health care. The World Bank would be involved in the planning 
efforts for the return and the funding of some of the infrastructure in the reconstruction process. 
UNHCR also advocates for phased returns subject to the personal preferences of internally 
displaced persons, some of whom will want to return immediately, while others may consider 
remaining in their current places of residence while recovering their former household and 
property.  
</p>
<p><b>IV. PROTECTION NEEDS OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED  
PERSONS DURING DISPLACEMENT 
</b></p>
<p>30. Widespread unemployment and economic and social problems affect large parts of the 
population. The Representative observed that, except for the shortage of adequate housing and 
their lack of property, such as real estate and livestock, internally displaced persons are generally 
not dramatically worse off than the non-displaced population. This achievement, impressive 
given the magnitude of the problem, is mainly due to sustained Government support, such as 
monthly allowances, free accommodation and free services, such as electricity and education for 
internally displaced persons. At the same time, a number of additional needs, specific to 
internally displaced persons could be identified, some of which would require further 
investigation. They include the quality of education for displaced children, nutritional deficits, 
and mental and other health problems. The lack of relevant statistical data and surveys conducted 
in accordance with international standards makes it difficult to develop appropriate responses to 
these challenges. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Access to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>31. Among the most disadvantaged groups of internally displaced persons are those who have 
lived in tent camps, railway wagons and mud brick houses for more than a decade. Their shelters 
provide inadequate protection against the harsh winters and the stifling heat of summer, and they 
suffer from an unreliable supply of water and electricity. Most internally displaced persons in 
urban areas reside in run-down, overcrowded dormitories or public buildings, including former 
schools. Entire families, including an additional young generation now growing up, are cramped 
into single rooms which do not offer any privacy. These substandard shelters lack sufficient or 
adequate sanitary facilities, access to potable water, or waste disposal. A 2005 Government 
survey found that the sanitary conditions (such as sewerage systems and toilets) in the dwellings 
of 41.2 per cent of internally displaced persons did not meet even the most basic requirements.<b>13</b> 
The Representative concluded that these conditions were clearly not in accordance with the right 
to an adequate standard of living, including the right to adequate housing, as provided for by 
Guiding Principle 18.

<p>A/HRC/8/6/Add. 2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Resettlement 
</b></p>
<p>32. Having visited the newly Government-constructed settlements of Bilasuvar, the 
Representative found that, apart from the virtual absence of economic opportunities, basic 
services and adequate conditions seemed to be in place. He regretted that, owing to time 
constraints, he was not able to also visit the new settlements in the Fizuli and Agdam areas. He is 
thus not in a position to comment on complaints reported to him about the poor quality of houses 
in those regions and the lack of utilities, such as medical services, public transport, means of 
communication and the lack of arable land promised but not yet provided to inhabitants.  
</p>
<p>33. Drawing on his experience from other countries, the Representative felt that the quality of 
the new settlements for displaced persons could be further enhanced by involving affected 
communities in the planning and implementation of the Government&#8217;s programmes undertaken 
on their behalf. The need for greater consultation with the communities will be particularly 
important during the next phase of rehabilitation of urban collective centres, for example those in 
Baku, Sumgait and Ganga. Timely consultations would not only ensure the efficient use of 
Government resources, but might also give internally displaced persons a sense of ownership and 
control over their lives. Guiding Principle 18 calls on the authorities to make special efforts to 
ensure the full participation of women in the planning and distribution of supplies, such as 
shelter and medical services. In order to reduce potential anxiety related to what may be 
perceived by some as renewed uprooting, it must be ensured that internally displaced persons are 
fully informed of any resettlement plans. 
</p>
<p>34. Isolated, though seemingly regular, security incidents or threats had reportedly endangered 
the physical security of internally displaced persons settled near the ceasefire line. In accordance 
with Guiding Principle 10, which stipulates that internally displaced persons should be protected, 
in particular, against attacks against their camps or settlements and the use of anti-personnel 
mines, the Representative suggested that, where possible, new settlements near the ceasefire line 
should be constructed at a minimum security distance of several kilometres.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Access to livelihoods 
</b></p>
<p>35. According to UNHCR, some 63 per cent of the displaced (including refugees) live below 
the poverty line. Unemployment, at a rate of 10.7 per cent in 2005 (according to Government 
figures based on a survey done in accordance with ILO standards), was a general problem in 
Azerbaijan, which affected youth disproportionately, and was also higher among internally 
displaced persons, of whom only 20 per cent are fully employed.<b>13</b> The reduction of the officially 
reported overall unemployment rate to 6.8 per cent in November 2006 may have had some, albeit 
unknown impact on the employment of internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>36. Guiding Principle 22 provides that internally displaced persons, whether or not living in 
camps, should enjoy the right to seek freely opportunities for employment and to participate in 
economic activities. The Representative concluded that, in Azerbaijan, second to the 
impossibility to return and inadequate accommodation, the lack of economic opportunities 
seemed to be the main remaining challenge, most of all for internally displaced persons in rural 
areas.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/6/Add. 2 
 page 15 
 
</p>
<p>37. Employment opportunities in rural areas are extremely scarce, making internally displaced 
persons rely almost exclusively on donations and allowances as well as on income from 
agricultural activities. The latter, however, are limited by the size and quality of allocated lands. 
Jobs created in settlements in agriculture and in the few medical, educational and production 
facilities benefit but a minority of families of internally displaced persons with steady 
employment and wages.<b>14</b> The Government&#8217;s resettlement programme includes microcredit and 
income-generation projects, but these did not yet seem to have been fully carried out nor to have 
yielded visible results. 
</p>
<p>38. The Representative was deeply concerned about this absence of livelihoods and economic 
opportunities for internally displaced persons living in rural areas. According to a Government 
survey conducted in 2005, only 12.7 per cent of displaced women were in formal employment 
compared to 92.8 per cent of rural local women. The Representative was concerned that a 
significant number of rural internally displaced persons seemed to suffer from a dependency 
syndrome, which in itself now diminished their prospects of becoming self-sufficient. He 
remarked that experience in other countries had shown that people who had been idle for a 
decade or more were unlikely to be able to rebuild their houses or be self-sufficient upon return.  
</p>
<p>39. In urban centres, internally displaced persons seemed to find employment more easily but 
often in low-paying jobs and in the informal economy. They can sometimes be at a disadvantage 
in relation to resident populations, partly because of their predominantly rural origins and related 
specialized skills, as well as of their lack of key information, established networks and initial 
capital to start a business.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Education 
</b></p>
<p>40. Overall, internally displaced children in Azerbaijan have access to schools. The literacy 
rate of internally displaced persons is equal to that of the general population, and internally 
displaced students benefit from free school bags, uniforms, books and stationery, as well as free 
access to higher education. The Representative was impressed to learn that, since 2004, 
700 schools had been built or renovated by the Government with the support of UNICEF and 
UNFPA, many of them for the purpose of ensuring continued access to education for displaced 
children. He was satisfied that the issue was a priority for the Government and one causing little 
concern to displaced parents, in contrast with many other countries the Representative had 
visited. He concluded that the problem lay primarily in the quality of the education provided 
rather than in ensuring access as such.  
</p>
<p>41. Nevertheless, problems in the education sector persist. Pointing out that education in 
general required significant Government attention, the Minister for Education indicated to the 
Representative that the long-lasting conflict had indeed had a negative impact on the quality of

</p>
<p>education for displaced children. The financial and social hardships for their families, the 
material condition of schools, the quality of teachers and the psychological condition of 
displaced children all played a potentially adverse role. According to the Minister, teachers 
working in schools for internally displaced persons were often themselves stressed and suffering 
from psychological problems due to their displacement. Some were in need of updating their 
professional skills, but the Government was unable to organize special courses for them. Despite 
the Government&#8217;s efforts, many schools for displaced children were in worse shape than local 
schools, some of which also suffered, for example, from a lack of heating during winter months. 
The precarious, overcrowded living conditions in the homes of internally displaced persons 
further contributed to lowering the performance of their children in school. The Minister also 
suspected that displaced children were overall less likely to enrol in university, partly because of 
financial constraints or a socially-induced lack of motivation, but owing to the lack of relevant 
data, this could not be verified.  
</p>
<p>42. Recalling the recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child that States 
ensure that refugee and displaced children are placed in schools in the local communities in order 
to facilitate their integration,<b>16</b> the Representative inquired into the logic and current status of 
separate educational facilities, above all in urban areas. He learned that the Government was 
trying to preserve the social fabric of communities, which would eventually facilitate 
reintegration upon return. This led to some schools in Baku accommodating regional schools 
from Fizuli, Kelbajar or Lachin, so that in effect two schools were housed in one building and 
classes were held in shifts or in separate classrooms. In line with the view of his predecessor, the 
Representative agreed with the Government that keeping communities together could indeed 
constitute an advantage in a situation where return was imminent or where these communities 
were living in isolation. In this way, the overcrowding of local schools could be avoided, and 
children in isolated rural areas would not have to commute to distant schools. Over time, 
however, the social segregation and potentially lower quality of education became problematic. 
</p>
<p>43. The Representative was informed that schools currently under construction were intended 
to cater to both local and displaced children, and that parents were free to choose which of the 
surrounding schools to send their children to, regardless of their displacement status. The 
Representative was pleased to see mixed schools in Sumgait reflecting the Government&#8217;s new 
policy. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Health  
</b></p>
<p>44. While public medical care in Azerbaijan was generally seen to be in need of improvement, 
some vulnerable groups among internally displaced persons are particularly affected. First of all, 
people living in substandard accommodation in rural areas are obviously at a higher risk of 
catching diseases owing to the lack of sanitary facilities and sewage systems and exposure to the 
elements. The extremely overcrowded living conditions of internally displaced persons in urban 
areas have also reportedly led to tensions and negative effects on the psychosocial development

</p>
<p>of children. According to the Government&#8217;s plans, all recently constructed settlements were to be 
provided with well-equipped hospitals; however, the Government admitted that shortages of 
medical supplies, as reported by international observers, might persist in remote villages. 
</p>
<p>45. In its 2005 report to the Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, 
the Government of Azerbaijan pointed out that mortality was generally highest among women of 
low levels of social development, and especially among refugees and displaced persons.<b>17</b> 
During his mission, the Representative was informed that maternal and child mortality differed 
from one settlement to another and was perhaps not particularly high among the displaced. He 
noted that reliable figures on this important issue were not available and a survey would be 
needed.  
</p>
<p>46. Most of all, however, the Representative observed that mental health continued to be a 
significant problem among internally displaced persons, some of whom were traumatized by 
events during the conflict. As the Representative&#8217;s predecessor had remarked during his mission 
to Azerbaijan in 1998, &#8220;the psychological stress experienced by the displaced is not only 
war-related, but also stems from the cramped and poor conditions in which many of them live, as 
well as from feelings of isolation and uncertainty about their future&#8221;.<b>18</b> There is a lack of 
adequate structures and services to properly address the mental health issue. 
</p>
<p>47. The Chairperson of the State Committee on Women, Children and Family Issues, whose 
Committee was about to establish psychological support stations in the country, stressed the need 
to increase the involvement of internally displaced persons in all social, political and economic 
processes. She believed that the protracted conflict situation had led to some (particularly 
middle-aged) displaced persons suffering from a certain &#8220;victim&#8221; or &#8220;immigrant&#8221; attitude, and it 
was important to encourage them to become fully active members of society again.  
</p>
<p><b>F.  Particularly vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>48. Vulnerable groups such as the elderly, female-headed households, traumatized and 
mentally ill persons, are disproportionately represented among the inhabitants of collective 
accommodation facilities and new settlements, whereas young males had reportedly often moved 
to the cities or emigrated to seek better employment opportunities. The difficult social and 
financial situation of these groups, adding to uncertainty about the future, has created feelings of 
dependency, passivity and depression in many, which in turn has hindered their social integration 
and self-reliance and led to an increase in mental disease. Elderly displaced persons seemed to 
have more and bigger health problems than the non-displaced of the same age group, not only 
because of difficulties adapting, but also because their families were often poorer and their 
children could not take care of them to the same extent.

</p>
<p><b>G.  Food security 
</b></p>
<p>49. As a consequence of several of the above-mentioned problems, about one third of 
internally displaced persons are dependent on food aid. Virtually all WFP beneficiaries are 
internally displaced persons. In October 2006, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food called 
on donors to support the WFP programme in Azerbaijan, which was seriously threatened by 
funding shortfalls. He also called on the national authorities to address, in cooperation with 
United Nations agencies, the problem of food security for internally displaced persons in a 
long-term perspective through adequate policies and programmes. The Representative endorsed 
these calls. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Documentation 
</b></p>
<p>50. According to information received by the Representative, fewer than half of internally 
displaced persons are in possession of cards certifying their status and making them eligible to 
receive assistance and allowance as well as exempting them from payments for public services. 
The Representative had the impression that the provision of such services was handled in a 
flexible and generous manner by the authorities to the benefit of displaced persons without such 
cards. While he welcomed this open attitude, it seemed important to him that the granting of 
cards to persons wishing to become registered, for example in view of future measures such as 
return assistance, should not be overly complicated in what has at times been described as a 
lengthy, bureaucratic process centralized in Baku.  
</p>
<p>51. It was brought to the Representative&#8217;s attention that the Government is in the process of 
reforming legislation relating to registration requirements, with a view to improving the rights to 
freedom of movement and choice of residence for internally displaced persons.<b>13</b> He welcomes 
this step and hopes that it will reduce problems formerly experienced related to access to 
communal services and bank loans as well as to judicial procedures, particularly concerning 
property rights.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p><b>V.  PROTECTION NEEDS OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS 
REGARDING RETURN AND OTHER DURABLE SOLUTIONS 
</b></p>
<p>52. One of the main rights of internally displaced persons is their right to return to their places 
of origin; arbitrary forced displacement is in itself a violation of this right. Regrettably, the hope 
of return nurtured by large parts of Azerbaijani society has not been realized, mainly because of 
the failure of peace negotiations, the continued presence of the occupying forces, landmines and 
ceasefire violations. The Representative noted the overwhelming desire of most internally 
displaced persons he consulted to return to their homes or villages, some of them as soon as 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>19
</b>  Procedures for registration are regulated on basis of the Law on Registration of Citizens 
</p>
<p>according to Place of Residence. Legal procedures for registration at the place of residence as 
well as re-registration and thereby access by internally displaced persons to communal services 
is often prevented by corrupt practice by local authorities (executive committees). </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/6/Add. 2 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>possible, and he was struck by the amount of suffering the prolonged displacement created in 
many. Of the displaced persons the Representative met who had started a new life in urban areas, 
some said they would consider staying on even if return became a possibility.  
</p>
<p>53. In this context, it is important to note that, in accordance with Guiding Principle 28, 
internally displaced persons have the right to choose between return and integration in the area of 
displacement or another part of the country. Return should be voluntary and conducted in safety 
and with dignity. Reintegration should be facilitated. According to Guiding Principle 29, 
returnees are entitled to be protected against discrimination and to recover their property and/or 
to receive compensation in the event of damage or loss.  
</p>
<p>54. Experience has shown that the degree of respect for these principles has a direct impact on 
the success of internally displaced persons returning to their former homes and places of habitual 
residence. Successful return is based on three main elements: (a) ensuring the physical safety of 
returnees; (b) returning property to the displaced and reconstructing their houses; and (c) creating 
an environment that sustains return and re-integration, namely, that allows life under adequate 
conditions, including income-generation opportunities, non-discrimination and possibilities for 
political participation. 
</p>
<p>55. The Representative shared the Government&#8217;s approach that timely preparations for return 
were required in the light of the enormous rehabilitation tasks ahead, even if return did not come 
about in the very near future. He was encouraged by the Government&#8217;s acknowledgement, fully 
reflecting Guiding Principle 28, that national authorities had the primary duty and responsibility 
to establish conditions, as well as provide the means allowing internally displaced persons to 
return voluntarily, in safety and with dignity, to their homes or places of habitual residence, or to 
resettle voluntarily in another part of the country, and that such authorities should endeavour to 
facilitate the reintegration of returned or resettled internally displaced persons. He welcomed the 
determination of leading officials to ensure, in compliance with international standards, that local 
integration would be an alternative to return for those wishing to opt for such a solution. 
</p>
<p>56. The Representative was convinced that the success of return would, inter alia, be 
proportionate to the economic opportunities that internally displaced persons enjoyed during 
their displacement. Their capacity to return, reconstruct their houses and rebuild their lives could 
only be enhanced by engaging in meaningful and useful activities, while unemployment and the 
development of a dependency syndrome risked disempowering internally displaced persons even 
further.

<p><b>Property 
</b></p>
<p>58. Reportedly, only a small minority of internally displaced persons hold documentation to 
prove their ownership of their previous homes and real estate; this might be a problem in the 
future if lost or damaged property is to be compensated. The Representative was informed that 
the few families of internally displaced persons who have returned to their original places of 
residence in Fizuli district found their houses and property destroyed. As property restitution or 
compensation mechanisms had not been put in place, these returnees were subsequently 
confronted with legal problems, including recognition of their property rights.<b>13</b> Such problems 
could be avoided if they are addressed in the early stages of return planning. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The main cause of problems encountered by internally displaced persons in 
Azerbaijan is the absence of a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict over 
Nagorny Karabakh and adjacent occupied territories. As a consequence, they are unable to 
exercise their right to return voluntarily to their former homes in safety and dignity. While 
some have rebuilt their lives elsewhere in Azerbaijan, most continue to live in precarious 
temporary arrangements and have not yet found a durable solution to their plight.</b>  
</p>
<p>60.<i> <b></b></i><b>The Representative calls on the international community to renew and intensify its 
efforts to achieve a peaceful solution and to implement Security Council resolutions calling 
for the withdrawal of occupying troops and for supporting the return of displaced persons 
on both sides to their places of origin in safety and dignity. He calls on all parties to put 
humanitarian concerns before political considerations in order to end the suffering of 
displaced civilians. He encourages the Government of Azerbaijan to pursue further its 
chosen path of improving the living conditions of internally displaced persons at their 
current place of residence or elsewhere in the country, pending a solution to the conflict.</b> </p>
<p>61. <b>After a long period of responses to the needs of internally displaced persons that were 
insufficient for diverse reasons, the Government, in accordance with the Representative&#8217;s 
predecessor&#8217;s recommendations made during the latter&#8217;s mission to Azerbaijan in 1998 
and in accordance with its responsibility to provide protection and humanitarian assistance 
to internally displaced persons as recalled by Guiding Principle 3, has begun to implement 
comprehensive strategies to ensure that all human rights of the displaced are respected and 
their basic needs met. Given the magnitude of the problem of forced displacement in 
Azerbaijan, the Representative was impressed by the Government&#8217;s achievements, which 
compare very favourably with national responses in many other countries affected by 
internal displacement. The Government&#8217;s unqualified recognition of its responsibility for 
the protection of and assistance to the displaced, its extensive investment in improving their 
welfare, the priority it places on the issue as demonstrated by the anchoring of main 
responsibilities and coordination in the Deputy Prime Minister&#8217;s office, and its smooth 
cooperation with the international community should all be acknowledged.</b>  
</p>
<p>62. <b>The Representative calls on the Government of Azerbaijan to proceed with and 
strengthen its implementation of the 2004 State programme. He encourages the 
international community to support the Government&#8217;s effort in this regard. At the same 
time, the Representative recommends that the Government and international and </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/8/6/Add. 2 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p><b>non-governmental organizations continue to deliver direct humanitarian assistance, grant 
allowances in cash and in kind, and exempt displaced persons from payments for public 
services. Such benefits have gone a long way to alleviating the often very difficult situation 
of internally displaced persons, removing them would probably put displaced persons in a 
situation significantly worse than that of the resident population.</b> 
</p>
<p>63. <b>Significant progress has been made in resettling internally displaced persons from 
some of the most precarious shelters to specifically constructed compact settlements. 
However, the majority of displaced persons continue to live in substandard shelters, 
including in tents, mud huts and railway cars.</b>  
</p>
<p>64. <b>The Representative encourages the Government to realize its intention to close 
remaining tent and railway camps by the end of the year. In order to increase the success 
of its resettlement programme, the Representative recommends that the Government invite 
persons to be resettled, including women, to participate in the planning of the location, 
design and equipment of new compact settlements, and that competent authorities inform 
communities of internally displaced persons in advance of the conditions awaiting them. 
The location of new settlements should be chosen so as to avoid endangering the physical 
security of displaced persons due to proximity to the ceasefire line. Likewise, internally 
displaced persons should not be cut off from their current places of employment. The 
Representative also suggests revisiting settlements already in use to take stock, in 
consultation with their inhabitants, of outstanding challenges to be addressed. He 
encourages international agencies to lend their expertise and other support for this 
purpose. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>Many internally displaced persons living in urban centres continue to suffer from 
substandard conditions of buildings, in particular the lack of sanitation and harmful 
overcrowding. The Representative welcomes the Government&#8217;s plan to address the needs 
of urban internally displaced persons whose basic needs are not met and who are not 
targeted by the resettlement programme. It may be expedient to adopt a comprehensive 
programme for displaced persons in urban areas, centring on the rehabilitation of 
collective shelters and the provision of appropriate alternative accommodation.</b>  
</p>
<p>66. <b>Building on the Government&#8217;s ongoing efforts to address prevailing housing 
problems, the main challenge now is the creation of livelihoods for internally displaced 
persons, particularly in rural areas, where employment opportunities are scarce. The 
Representative observed that many displaced persons seemed to be suffering from 
dependency syndrome. Experience has shown that displaced persons who have been idle 
for many years lose their capacity to become productive members of society again and to 
rebuild their lives once return is possible. </b> 
</p>
<p>67. <b>The Representative urges the Government to ensure that new settlements are suitable 
for agricultural purposes and that economic opportunities are foreseen in the planning. He 
reiterates his predecessor&#8217;s recommendation that efforts be made to create, improve and 
expand income-generating activities, skills training and microcredit programmes for 
internally displaced persons, with particular attention to be paid to women, with the aim of 
reducing their vulnerability, increasing their self-reliance and preparing them for return 
and reintegration. The Representative appeals to the Government and to international </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/8/6/Add. 2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p><b>agencies to ensure that the needs and concerns of internally displaced persons are 
adequately reflected in general policies and programmes, including those for poverty 
reduction.</b> 
</p>
<p>68. <b>The Representative welcomes the Government&#8217;s new policy of moving forward from 
segregated schools for internally displaced persons in urban areas. Although there are 
indications that such persons attending separate schools are disadvantaged, despite notable 
Government efforts, by an overall lower quality of education provided to them, and that 
displaced children may make less use of higher education opportunities than the resident 
population, the absence of reliable data does not permit unambiguous conclusions nor, 
more importantly, targeted reforms.</b>  
</p>
<p>69. <b>The Representative supports a suggestion by the Minister for Education that the level 
and quality of education of internally displaced persons be studied, with the aim of filling 
remaining gaps through specific programmes implemented in cooperation with the 
international community. He encourages mixed schooling with local children wherever 
feasible. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Representative noted with concern that the special needs of elderly, traumatized 
and mentally ill displaced persons were insufficiently addressed. Elderly internally 
displaced persons seemed to be at a disadvantage compared to their non-displaced peers, 
owing to a variety of factors, such as difficulties in adjusting and diminished family support 
due to the impoverishment of their children. The Representative observed that serious 
mental-health issues were prevalent among the displaced population. He received 
indications that, in addition to trauma caused by the violence that triggered the 
displacement, feelings of insecurity, homelessness and anxiety about the future, as well as 
severe poverty and stressful, overcrowded living conditions lay at their origin; however, he 
was informed that reliable relevant data did not exist. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Representative concluded that specific surveys and needs assessments, meeting 
international standards, into the situation of elderly and mentally ill internally displaced 
persons and their access to counselling and appropriate medical care needed to be 
conducted. He encouraged the Government, in close cooperation with competent 
international agencies, to take the lead in designing effective responses, and welcomed 
donor interest in funding programmes based on reliable data. Both general and specific 
Government programmes should pay special attention to particularly vulnerable groups 
among internally displaced persons, including by continuing and increasing humanitarian 
assistance to persons unlikely to become self-sufficient on their own. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Representative welcomes the Government&#8217;s early-return planning and is 
encouraged by the intention of competent United Nations agencies as well as donors to 
support the plan. He shares the realistic view of the Government that return will not be 
possible immediately and should be conducted through a phased approach. He reiterates 
that, in accordance with international law, eventual return and local integration are not 
mutually exclusive, but rather reinforce each other, as productive, active members of 
society are more likely to muster the strength and possess the skills needed to rebuild their 
communities of origin.</b> </p>

</p>
<p>73. <b>The Representative welcomes the Government&#8217;s affirmation of the principle of 
voluntary return in safety and dignity, as well as its readiness to shoulder the burden of 
mine clearance and reconstruction of the occupied territories, and of facilitating the return 
and reintegration of the displaced. He urges all concerned actors to plan and implement 
any return-related activities on the basis of international law, including those as set out in 
the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. A peaceful solution to the conflict is of 
paramount importance, as renewed hostilities are likely to engender additional 
displacement and would complicate the already daunting tasks of mine clearance and 
reconstruction. Mechanisms for property restitution, reconstruction or compensation 
should be put in place at an early stage. The participation and the informing of affected 
individuals and groups must be ensured during all phases of planning and implementation 
of the return process, including when return is not yet imminent, in order to keep the 
expectations of displaced persons realistic. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Despite the assumption of many responsibilities, the Government informed the 
Representative of the necessity of continued international support, to a lesser extent in 
the form of financial contributions and more in the areas of technical expertise and 
capacity-building. The Representative encourages the international community to continue 
to support the Government in making sure that the outstanding needs of internally 
displaced persons are fully addressed. Humanitarian assistance may continue to be 
required to a lesser extent as the Government scales up its own investment. The 
Representative sees the main role of international and non-governmental organizations as 
contributing technical expertise, monitoring progress and providing technical assistance, 
for example for needs assessment surveys, in particular in the areas of livelihoods and 
economic opportunities for the displaced; in health, including mental health; and in 
education. He also feels that international actors, in particular the United Nations country 
team, have an important role to play in assisting the Government and advising on a 
rights-based approach in its return planning.
