CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This report includes statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These
statements may relate to, but are not limited to, information or assumptions about us, our capital
and other expenditures, dividends, financing plans, capital structure, cash flow, pending legal
and regulatory proceedings and claims, including environmental matters, future economic
performance, operating income, cost savings, and management’s plans, strategies, goals and
objectives for future operations and growth. These forward-looking statements generally are
accompanied by words such as “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “should,”
“seek,” “project,” “plan” or similar expressions. Any statement that is not a historical fact is a
forward-looking statement. It should be understood that these forward-looking statements are
necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of senior management, not guarantees of
future performance. They are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-
looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this report may include, for example,
statements about:
•fluctuations in demand or the prices received for oil and natural gas;
•the amount, nature and timing of capital expenditures;
•drilling, completion and performance of wells;
•competition and government regulations;
•timing and amount of future production of oil and natural gas;
costs of exploiting and developing properties and conducting other operations, in the aggregate
and on a per-unit equivalent basis;
•changes in proved reserves;
•operating costs and other expenses;
•cash flow and anticipated liquidity;
•estimates of proved reserves;
•exploitation of property acquisitions; and
•marketing of oil and natural gas.

Table of Contents
These forward-looking statements represent intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and
beliefs about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Many of those
factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from the
results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties
include those factors described in Item 1A of this report and under the heading “Risk Factors” in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. Specifically, some
factors that could cause actual results to differ include:
•volatility and declines in oil and natural gas prices;
•worldwide supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;
•the significant amount of our debt;
•drilling plans (including scheduled and budgeted wells);
•the number, timing or results of any wells;
•changes in wells operated and in reserve estimates;
•supply of CO2;
•future growth and expansion;
•future exploration;
•integration of existing and new technologies into operations;
•future capital expenditures (or funding thereof) and working capital;
•borrowings and capital resources and liquidity;
•changes in strategy and business discipline;
•future tax matters;
•any loss of key personnel;
•future seismic data (including timing and results);
•the plans for timing, interpretation and results of new or existing seismic surveys or seismic data;
•geopolitical events affecting oil and natural gas prices;
•outcome, effects or timing of legal proceedings;
•the effect of litigation and contingencies;
•the ability to generate additional prospects; and
the ability to successfully complete merger, acquisition or divestiture plans, regulatory or other
limitations imposed as a result of a merger, acquisition or divestiture, and the success of the
business following a merger, acquisition or divestiture.
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions
prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in the forward-
looking statements contained herein. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise,
except as may be required under applicable securities laws. All forward-looking statements
included herein are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or
referred to in this section.

•
•
•
•
•
Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma in which we operate.

Chaparral Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries
Condensed notes to consolidated financial statements (unaudited)
(dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted)
Note 1: Nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies
Nature of operations
Chaparral Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively, “we”, “our”, “us”, or the “Company”) are
involved in the acquisition, exploration, development, production and operation of oil and natural
gas properties. Our properties are located primarily in Oklahoma and Texas.
Interim financial statements
The accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have
been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and do not include all of
the financial information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (“GAAP”) for complete financial statements. These financial
statements and the notes thereto should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.
The financial information as of June 30, 2015, and for the three and six months ended June 30,
2015 and 2014, respectively, is unaudited. The financial information as of December 31, 2014
has been derived from the audited financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. In management’s opinion, such information
contains all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for
a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods. The results of operations for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that
will be realized for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to
current period presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on our previously reported results
of operations.
Cash and cash equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. We maintain cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts and money
market funds which may not be federally insured. As of June 30, 2015, cash with a recorded
balance totaling $26,200 was held at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. We have not experienced
any losses in such accounts and believe we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on such
accounts.
Accounts receivable
We have receivables from joint interest owners and oil and natural gas purchasers which are
generally uncollateralized. We generally review our oil and natural gas purchasers for credit
worthiness and general financial condition. We may have the ability to withhold future revenue
disbursements to recover non-payment of joint interest billings on properties of which we are the
operator. Accounts receivable from joint interest owners are stated at amounts due, net of an
allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable are generally due within 30 days and
accounts outstanding longer than 60 days are considered past due. We establish our allowance
for doubtful accounts by considering the length of time past due, previous loss history, future net
revenues of the debtor’s ownership interest in oil and natural gas properties we operate, and our
assessment of the owner’s ability to pay its obligation, among other things.

We write off accounts receivable when they are determined to be uncollectible. When we recover
amounts that were previously written off, those amounts are offset against the allowance and
reduce expense in the year of recovery.
Accounts receivable consisted of the following at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 :

Inventories
Inventories are comprised of equipment used in developing oil and natural gas properties and oil
and natural gas product inventories. Equipment inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market
using the average cost method. Oil and natural gas product inventories are stated at the lower of
production cost or market. Inventories are shown net of a provision for obsolescence,
commensurate with known or estimated exposure, which is reflected in the valuation allowance
disclosed below. We recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment of $7,296 on our equipment
inventory for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 to reflect lower market prices
resulting from a decline in demand for such equipment as drilling activity has decreased in the
current low commodity price environment. The adjustment is reflected in “Loss on impairment of
other assets” in our consolidated statements of operations.We did not record any significant
inventory adjustments in the prior year periods. Inventories at June 30, 2015 and December 31,
2014 consisted of the following:

and activities. Accordingly, we capitalize all costs incurred in connection with the exploration for
and development of oil and natural gas reserves. Proceeds from the disposition of oil and natural
gas properties are accounted for as a reduction in capitalized costs, with no gain or loss
generally recognized unless such dispositions involve a significant alteration in the depletion
rate. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with exploration and development
activities, but do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or
similar activities. Capitalized costs include geological and geophysical work, 3D seismic, delay
rentals, drilling and completing and equipping oil and natural gas wells, including salaries,
benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities.
The costs of unevaluated oil and natural gas properties are excluded from amortization until the
properties are evaluated. Costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as
the properties are evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined.
Work-in-progress costs are included in unevaluated oil and natural gas properties and as of
June 30, 2015, include $100,362 of capital costs incurred for undeveloped acreage, $72,046 for
the construction of CO2 delivery pipelines and facilities for which there are no reserves, and
$3,251 for wells and facilities in progress pending determination. As of December 31, 2014,
work-in-progress costs included capital costs incurred of $190,356 for undeveloped acreage,
$72,046 for the construction of CO2 delivery pipelines and facilities for which there are no
reserves, and $26,023 for wells and facilities in progress pending determination.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) of
oil and natural gas properties are provided using the units-of-production method based on
estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves and production, which are converted to a
common unit of measure based upon their relative energy content. Our cost basis for depletion
includes estimated future development costs to be incurred on proved undeveloped properties.
The computation of DD&A takes into consideration restoration, dismantlement, and
abandonment costs, and the anticipated proceeds from salvaging equipment.
Ceiling Test. In accordance with the full cost method of accounting, the net capitalized costs of oil
and natural gas properties are not to exceed their related PV-10 value, net of tax considerations,
plus the cost of unproved properties not being amortized.
Our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves as of June 30, 2015 were prepared using an
average price for oil and natural gas the first day of each month for the prior twelve months as
required by the SEC.
Due to the substantial decline of commodity prices that began in late 2014 and which remained
low through June 30, 2015, the cost center ceiling exceeded the net capitalized cost of our oil
and natural gas properties as of June 30, 2015, resulting in a ceiling test write-down during the
second quarter of $217,562. Further write-downs are expected to occur in significant amounts if
prices remain at their depressed levels. The amount of any future impairment is difficult to predict,
and will depend on the average oil and natural gas prices during each period, the incremental
proved reserves added during each period, and additional capital spent.
Impairment of long-lived assets
Impairment losses are recorded on property and equipment used in operations and other long-
lived assets held and used when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash
flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amount.
Impairment is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the
asset. Impairment losses are also recorded on assets classified as held for sale when there is an
excess of carrying value over fair value less costs to sell.
We recorded impairment losses of $6,015 related to four drilling rigs not currently in use for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2015. One of the rigs was last deployed in January 2015
while the remaining three have been stacked for two to three years. As a result of the recent
deterioration in commodity prices and drilling activity, the value of such equipment has declined
while utilizing third party equipment has become more cost effective, resulting in us impairing the
value of the rigs to their estimated fair value. These losses are reflected in “Loss on impairment of
other assets” in our consolidated statements of operations. We had previously recorded $3,490
and $1,500 of impairment related to these rigs during the years ended December 31, 2013 and
2012, respectively.
Stock-based compensation
Our stock-based compensation programs consist of phantom stock, restricted stock units (“RSU”),
and restricted stock awards issued to employees. Generally, we use new shares to grant
restricted stock awards, and we cancel restricted shares forfeited or repurchased for tax
withholding. Canceled shares are available to be issued as new grants under our 2010 Equity
Incentive Plan.
The estimated fair value of the phantom stock and RSU awards are remeasured at the end of
each reporting period until settlement. The estimated fair market value of these awards is
calculated based on our total asset value less total liabilities, with both assets and liabilities
being adjusted to fair value in accordance with the terms of the Phantom Stock Plan and the
Non-Officer Restricted Stock Unit Plan. The primary adjustment required is the adjustment of oil
and natural gas properties from net book value to the discounted and risk-adjusted reserve value
based on internal reserve reports priced on NYMEX forward strips. Compensation cost
associated with the phantom stock awards and RSU awards is recognized over the vesting
period using the straight-line method and the accelerated method, respectively. The fair value of
our restricted stock awards that include a service condition is based upon the estimated fair
market value of our common equity per share on a minority, non-marketable basis on the date of
grant, and is remeasured at the end of each reporting period until settlement. We recognize
compensation cost over the requisite service period using the accelerated method for awards
with graded vesting.

We use a Monte Carlo model to estimate the grant date fair value of restricted stock awards that
include a market condition. This model includes various significant assumptions, including the
expected volatility of the share awards and the probabilities of certain vesting conditions.
Compensation cost associated with restricted stock awards that include a market condition is
recognized over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. The assumptions
used to value our stock-based compensation awards reflect our best estimates, but they involve
inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control. As a result,
stock-based compensation expense could have been significantly impacted if other assumptions
had been used.
The costs associated with our stock-based compensation programs is calculated net of
forfeitures, which are estimated based on our historical and expected turnover rates. If our actual
forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the stock-based compensation cost could
be different from what we have recorded in the current period.
Cost reduction initiatives
Cost reduction initiatives include expenses related to our efforts to reduce our capital, operating
and administrative costs in response to the recent deterioration of commodity prices. Included in
our $9,136 of expenses for cost reduction initiatives for the six months ended June 30, 2015, are
$6,524 and $347 recorded during the first and second quarter of 2015, respectively, for one-time
severance and termination benefits in connection with our reduction in force that we began
implementing in February 2015. The remaining expense is a result of third party legal and
professional services we have engaged to assist in our cost savings initiatives.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that supersedes previous revenue
recognition requirements and requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The FASB
recently proposed a one-year delay which will make the updated guidance effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect the new standard will have
on our financial statements and results of operations.
In August 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires entities to evaluate
whether there is substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern and requires
additional disclosures if certain criteria are met. This guidance is effective for fiscal periods after
December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. We do not expect this guidance to materially
impact our financial statements or results of operations.
In April 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amends the presentation of the cost of
issuing debt on the balance sheet. The amendment requires that debt issuance costs related to a
recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and
measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendment. This
guidance is effective for fiscal periods after December 15, 2015 and interim periods thereafter.
We are currently evaluating the effect the new standard will have on our financial statements and
results of operations.

Senior secured revolving credit facility
In April 2010, we entered into an Eighth Restated Credit Agreement (our “senior secured
revolving credit facility”), which is collateralized by our oil and natural gas properties and, as
amended, matures on November 1, 2017. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we had
additional net borrowings of $80,000 on our senior secured revolving credit facility. As of
June 30, 2015, the weighted average interest rate was 2.4% on outstanding borrowings under
the senior secured revolving credit facility.
Availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base which
is set by the banks semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. In addition, the lenders
may request a borrowing base redetermination once between each scheduled redetermination
and in the event of early termination of our derivative contracts. Our first semiannual borrowing
base redetermination for the current year was finalized ahead of schedule in conjunction with an
amendment to our senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Fifteenth Amendment”), effective
on April 1, 2015. As of result of our semiannual redetermination, our borrowing base was
decreased from $650,000 to $550,000 effective on April 1, 2015.
In connection with the Fifteenth Amendment, the Consolidated Net Debt to Consolidated
EBITDAX covenant previously required by our senior secured revolving credit facility was
replaced by a covenant based on the ratio of Consolidated Net Secured Debt to Consolidated
EBITDAX, as defined in the amendment. Under this covenant, we are required to maintain a ratio
of Consolidated Net Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDAX no greater than 2.25 to 1.0 for each
period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on the last day of such applicable fiscal quarter.
For the same applicable periods, the Fifteenth Amendment also requires us to maintain an
Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined in the amendment, of no less than 2.00 to 1.0. Under the
Fifteenth Amendment, we are allowed to incur an additional $300,000 in Additional Permitted
Debt, as revised in the amendment to now include both secured and unsecured debt. We
incurred $1,404 in fees associated with the Fifteenth Amendment.
We believe we were in compliance with all covenants under our senior secured revolving credit
facility as of June 30, 2015.
Capital Leases
During 2013, we entered into lease financing agreements with U.S. Bank National Association
for $24,500 through the sale and subsequent leaseback of existing compressors owned by us.
The carrying value of these compressors is included in our oil and natural gas full cost pool. The
lease financing obligations are for 84-month terms and include the option to purchase the
equipment for a specified price at 72 months as well as an option to purchase the equipment at
the end of the lease term for its then-current fair market value. Lease payments related to the
equipment are recognized as principal and interest expense based on a weighted average
implicit interest rate of 3.8%. Minimum lease payments are approximately $3,181 annually.
Note 4: Derivative instruments
Overview
Our results of operations, financial condition and capital resources are highly dependent upon
the prevailing market prices of, and demand for, oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. These
commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties. To mitigate a portion
of this exposure, we enter into various types of derivative instruments, including commodity price
swaps, enhanced price swaps, costless collars, put options, and basis protection swaps. We
enter into crude oil derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our natural gas liquids production.
For commodity price swaps, we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a
floating market price to the counterparty. The fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment
are netted, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty.
Collars contain a fixed floor price (purchased put) and ceiling price (sold call). If the market price
exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price, we receive the fixed price and pay
the market price. If the market price is between the call and the put strike price, no payments are
due from either party. A three-way collar contract consists of a standard collar contract plus a sold
put with a price below the floor price of the collar. The sold put option requires us to make a
payment to the counterparty if the market price is below the sold put option price. If the market
price is greater than the sold put option price, the result is the same as it would have been with a
standard collar contract only. By combining the collar contract with the sold put option, we are
entitled to a net payment equal to the difference between the floor price of the standard collar and
the sold
15
Table of Contents

(dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted)
put option price if the market price falls below the sold put option price. This strategy enables us
to increase the floor and the ceiling price of the collar beyond the range of a traditional costless
collar utilizing the value associated with the sale of a put option.
We enhance the value of certain oil swaps by combining them with sold puts or put spread
contracts. Sold puts require us to make a payment to the counterparty if the market price is below
the put strike price at the settlement date. If the market price is greater than the sold put price, the
result is the same as it would have been with a swap contract only. A put spread is a combination
of a sold put and a purchased put. If the market price falls below the purchased put option price,
we will pay the spread between the sold put option price and the purchased put option price from
the counterparty. The use of a sold put allows us to receive an above-market swap price while
the purchased put provides a measure of downside protection. A put spread may also be
constructed by entering into separate sold put and purchased put contracts.
Put options may be purchased from the counterparty by paying a cash premium at the time the
put options are purchased or deferring payment until the put options settle. If the market price is
below the put strike price at the settlement date, we will receive a payment from the counterparty.
Purchased put options are designed to provide a fixed price floor in an environment where prices
have declined. In such an environment, put options may also be purchased to offset the
downside from sold puts that are originally associated with enhanced swaps or three-way collars.
The fair value of our put options include any deferred premiums that are payable under the
contract.
We use basis protection swaps to reduce basis risk. Basis is the difference between the physical
commodity being hedged and the price of the futures contract used for hedging. Basis risk is the
risk that an adverse change in the futures market will not be completely offset by an equal and
opposite change in the cash price of the commodity being hedged. Basis risk exists in natural
gas primarily due to the geographic price differentials between cash market locations and futures
contract delivery locations. Natural gas basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee
a price differential for natural gas from a specified pricing point. We receive a payment from the
counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pay the
counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract.

As a result of the deferred premiums, the above 2,610,000 barrels of crude oil production for
the remainder of 2015 are hedged at an effective price of $78.68/barrel.
Total premiums of $20,609 for the purchased puts were paid at contract inception in December
2014. Excluding the premiums and utilizing an average NYMEX strip price of $61.90 for 2016
as of June 30, 2015, the average realized price from our 3,720,000 barrels of hedged
production that have associated sold puts and purchased puts is $74.32/barrel. In the event
that crude oil prices are below $60.00/barrel, which is indicated by the average NYMEX strip
price for 2016 as of August 10, 2015, the purchase of these put options established a floor on
the realized price for these hedged volumes of $72.42/barrel.

On March 26, 2015, we entered into early settlements of certain oil and natural gas derivative
contracts originally scheduled to settle between 2015 to 2017 covering 495,000 barrels of oil and
12,280 BBtu of natural gas, receiving net proceeds of $15,395, in order to maintain compliance
with the hedging limits imposed by covenants under our senior secured credit facility. The
proceeds are included in non-hedge derivative gains (losses) disclosed below for the six months
ended June 30, 2015.
During July 2015, we entered into swaps covering 520,000 barrels of oil scheduled to settle
during the second half of 2015 with an average notional price of $50.43 per barrel, which offset
our existing swaps disclosed in the table above. By entering into offset positions for these
volumes, we have locked-in the difference between the contract price of our prior swaps and the
contract price of our recent swaps, which we will receive when the contracts settle. In addition,
we also entered into collars covering 260,000 barrels of oil at a call price of $57.50 per barrel and
a put price of $47.50 barrel and purchased puts covering 260,000 barrels of oil at a put price of
$47.50 barrel. The collars and the puts, which are scheduled to settle during the second half of
2015, were purchased for a total premium of $1,245, payable upon settlement of the contracts.

Note 5: Fair value measurements
Fair value is defined by the FASB as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from
such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models
are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and
judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or
market and the instruments’ complexity.
Fair value measurements are categorized according to the fair value hierarchy defined by the
FASB. The hierarchical levels are based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs
used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities as follows:
Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at
the measurement date.
Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
active and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. 
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where
there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.
In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair
value hierarchy. In such cases, the asset or liability is categorized based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance
of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and may affect
the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy.
Recurring fair value measurements
Our financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis consist of commodity
derivative contracts (see Note 4—Derivative instruments). We have no Level 1 assets or
liabilities as of June 30, 2015 or December 31, 2014. Our derivative contracts classified as Level
2 as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 consist of commodity price swaps and basis
protection swaps, which are valued using an income approach. Future cash flows from the
derivatives are estimated based on the difference between the fixed contract price and the
•
•
underlying published forward market price, and are discounted at the LIBOR swap rate.
As of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our derivative contracts classified as Level 3
consisted of three-way collars, enhanced swaps, sold puts and purchased puts. The fair value of
these contracts is developed by a third-party pricing service using a proprietary valuation model,
which we believe incorporates the assumptions that market participants would have made at the
end of each period. Observable inputs include contractual terms, published forward pricing
curves, and yield curves. Significant unobservable inputs are implied volatilities. Significant
increases (decreases) in implied volatilities in isolation would result in a significantly higher
(lower) fair value measurement. We review these valuations and the changes in the fair value
measurements for reasonableness. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and
include a measure of our own nonperformance risk for derivative liabilities or that of our
counterparties for derivative assets.
The fair value hierarchy for our financial assets and liabilities is shown by the following table:

Nonrecurring fair value measurements
Asset retirement obligations. Additions to the asset and liability associated with our asset
retirement obligations are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Our asset retirement
obligations consist of the estimated present value of future costs to plug and abandon or
otherwise dispose of our oil and natural gas properties and related facilities. Significant inputs
used in determining such obligations include estimates of plugging and abandonment costs,
inflation rates, discount rates, and well life, all of which are Level 3 inputs according to the fair
value hierarchy. The estimated future costs to dispose of properties added during the first six
months of 2015 and 2014 were escalated using an annual inflation rate of 2.91% and 2.95%,
respectively, and discounted using our weighted average credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate of
11.90% and 5.90%, respectively. These estimates may change based upon future inflation rates
and changes in statutory remediation rules. See Note 6—Asset retirement obligations for
additional information regarding our asset retirement obligations.
Impairment of long-lived assets. As discussed in Note 1—Nature of operations and summary of
significant accounting policies, we recorded an impairment on four of our stacked drilling rigs
during the second quarter of 2015. The estimated fair value related to the impairment assessment
for our four drilling rigs no longer in service was primarily based on internal and external
estimates and, therefore, is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair value of other financial instruments
Our significant financial instruments, other than derivatives, consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and long-term debt. We believe the carrying
values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate
fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt at June 30, 2015 and
December 31, 2014 were as follows:

The fair value of our Senior Notes was estimated based on quoted market prices. The carrying
value of our senior secured revolving credit facility approximates fair value because it has a
variable interest rate and incorporates a measure of our credit risk. The carrying value of our
other secured long-term debt approximates fair value because the rates are comparable to those
at which we could currently borrow under similar terms.

Counterparty credit risk
Our derivative contracts are executed with institutions, or affiliates of institutions, that are parties
to our senior secured revolving credit facility at the time of execution, and we believe the credit
risks associated with all of these institutions are acceptable. We do not require collateral or other
security from counterparties to support derivative instruments. Master agreements are in place
with each of our derivative counterparties which provide for net settlement in the event of default
or termination of the contracts under each respective agreement. As a result of the netting
provisions, our maximum amount of loss under derivative transactions due to credit risk is limited
to the net amounts due from the counterparties under the derivatives. Our loss is further limited as
any amounts due from a defaulting counterparty that is a lender, or an affiliate of a lender, under
our senior secured revolving credit facility can be offset against amounts owed to such
counterparty lender under our senior secured revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2015, the
counterparties to our open derivative contracts consisted of eight financial institutions, of which
eight were subject to our rights of offset under our senior secured revolving credit facility.
The following table summarizes our derivative assets and liabilities which are offset in the
consolidated balance sheets under our master netting agreements. It also reflects the amounts
outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility that are available to offset our net
derivative assets due from counterparties that are lenders under our senior secured revolving
credit facility.

Since positive and negative positions with a counterparty are netted on the balance sheet only
to the extent that they relate to the same current versus noncurrent classification, these
represent remaining amounts that could have been offset under our master netting
agreements.
We did not post additional collateral under any of these contracts as all of our counterparties are
secured by the collateral under our senior secured revolving credit facility. Payment on our
derivative contracts would be accelerated in the event of a default on our senior secured
revolving credit facility. The aggregate fair value of our derivative liabilities subject to
acceleration in the event of default was $221 at June 30, 2015.

Note 7: Stock-based compensation
Phantom Stock Plan and Restricted Stock Unit Plan
Effective January 1, 2004, we implemented a Phantom Unit Plan, which was revised on
December 31, 2008 as the Second Amended and Restated Phantom Stock Plan (the “Phantom
Plan”), to provide deferred compensation to certain key employees (the “Participants”). Under the
Phantom Plan, awards vest at the end of five years, but may also vest on a pro-rata basis
following a Participant’s termination of employment with us due to death, disability, retirement or
termination by us without cause. Also, phantom stock will vest if a change of control event occurs.
Phantom shares are cash-settled within 120 days of the vesting date.
Effective March 1, 2012, we implemented a Non-Officer Restricted Stock Unit Plan (the “RSU
Plan”) to create incentives to motivate Participants to put forth maximum effort toward the success
and growth of the Company and to enable us to attract and retain experienced individuals who by
their position, ability and diligence are able to make important contributions to the Company’s
success. The RSU Plan is intended to replace the Phantom Plan. Although the Phantom Plan
remains in effect, we do not expect to make any further awards under the Phantom Plan.
Under the RSU Plan, restricted stock units may be awarded to Participants in an aggregate
amount of up to 2% of the fair market value of the Company. Under the RSU Plan, awards
generally vest in equal annual increments over a three-year period. RSU awards may also vest
following a Participant’s termination of employment in combination with the occurrence of a
change of control event, as specified in the RSU Plan. RSU awards are cash-settled, generally
within 120 days of the vesting date.

2010 Equity Incentive Plan
We adopted the Chaparral Energy, Inc. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”) on April 12,
2010. The 2010 Plan reserves a total of 86,301 shares of our class A common stock for awards
issued under the 2010 Plan. All of our or our affiliates’ employees, officers, directors, and
consultants, as defined in the 2010 Plan, are eligible to participate in the 2010 Plan.
The awards granted under the 2010 Plan consist of shares that are subject to service vesting
conditions (the “Time Vested” awards) and shares that are subject to market and performance
vested conditions (the “Performance Vested” awards). The Time Vested awards vest in equal
annual installments over the five-year vesting period, but may also vest on an accelerated basis
in the event of a transaction whereby CCMP Capital Investors II (AV-2), L.P., CCMP Energy I
LTD., and CCMP Capital Investors (Cayman) II, L.P. (collectively “CCMP”) receive cash upon the
sale of its class E common stock (a “Transaction” as defined in the restricted stock agreements).
The Performance Vested awards vest in the event of a Transaction that achieves certain market
targets as defined in the 2010 Plan. Any shares of Performance Vested awards not vested on a
Separation Date (as defined in the 2010 Plan) will be forfeited as of the Separation Date.
Our 2010 Plan allows participants to elect, upon vesting of their Time Vested awards, to have us
withhold shares having a fair market value greater than the minimum statutory withholding
amounts for income and payroll taxes that would be due with respect to such vested shares. As a
result of this provision, the Time Vested awards are classified as liability awards under
accounting guidance and remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period. The
Performance Vested awards are classified as equity awards and are not remeasured to fair value
at the end of each reporting period subsequent to grant date.
We have previously modified the vesting conditions of awards granted under the 2010 Plan.
Please see “Note 10—Stock-based compensation” in Item 8. Financial Statement and
Supplementary Data of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014,
for a discussion of the modifications.

During the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, we repurchased and canceled 5,226 and
1,390 vested shares respectively, and we expect to repurchase and cancel approximately 3,000
restricted shares vesting during the next twelve months. Based on an estimated fair value of
$533.80 per Time Vested restricted share, the aggregate intrinsic value of the unvested Time
Vested restricted shares outstanding was $8,318 as of June 30, 2015.
Stock-based compensation cost
Compensation cost is calculated net of forfeitures, which are estimated based on our historical
and expected turnover rates. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate,
the stock-based compensation cost could be different from what we have recorded in the current
period.
A portion of stock-based compensation cost associated with employees involved in our
acquisition, exploration, and development activities has been capitalized as part of our oil and
natural gas properties. The remaining cost is reflected in lease operating and general and
administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We recognized stock-
based compensation expense as follows for the periods indicated:

Payments for stock-based compensation
Our stock-based compensation expense six months ended June 30, 2015 includes a credit
recorded in the first quarter due to forfeitures that occurred in conjunction with our workforce
reduction in February 2015. As of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, accrued payroll and
benefits payable included $2,438 and $4,830, respectively, for stock-based compensation costs
expected to be settled within the next twelve months. Unrecognized compensation cost of
approximately $10,969 is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0
years.
Note 8: Commitments and contingencies
Standby letters of credit (“Letters”) available under our senior secured revolving credit facility are
used in lieu of surety bonds with various organizations for liabilities relating to the operation of oil
and natural gas properties. We had various Letters outstanding totaling $874 and $920 as of
June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Interest on each Letter accrues at the
lender’s prime rate plus applicable margin for all amounts paid by the lenders under the Letters.
No amounts were paid by the lenders under the Letters; therefore, we paid no interest on the
Letters during the six months ended June 30, 2015 or 2014.
Litigation and Claims
Naylor Farms, Inc., individually and as class representative on behalf of all similarly situated
persons v. Chaparral Energy, L.L.C. On June 7, 2011, an alleged class action was filed against
us in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma (“Naylor Farms Case”)
alleging that we improperly deducted post-production costs from royalties paid to plaintiffs and
other royalty interest owners as categorized in the petition from crude oil and natural gas wells
located in Oklahoma. The purported class includes non-governmental royalty interest owners in
oil and natural gas wells we operate in Oklahoma. The plaintiffs have alleged a number of
claims, including breach of contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and other
claims and seek termination of leases, recovery of compensatory damages, interest, punitive
damages and attorney fees on behalf of the alleged class. We have responded to the Naylor
Farms petition, denied the allegations and raised arguments and defenses. Discovery is ongoing
and information and documents continue to be exchanged. The class has not been certified, but
the motion for class certification is due in the fourth quarter of 2015. We are not currently able to
estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss or what impact, if any, the Naylor Farms
Case will have on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows due to the
preliminary status of the matters, the complexity and number of legal and factual issues
presented by the matter and uncertainties with respect to, among other things, the nature of the
claims and defenses, the potential size of the class, the scope and types of the properties and
agreements involved, and the ultimate potential outcome of the matter. Plaintiffs in the Naylor
Farms Case have indicated that, if the class is certified, they seek damages in excess of $5,000
which may increase with the passage of time, a majority of which would be comprised of interest.
We dispute plaintiffs’ claims, dispute that the case meets the requirements for a class action and
are vigorously defending the case.

Amanda Dodson, individually and as class representative on behalf of all similarly situated
persons v. Chaparral Energy, L.L.C. On May 10, 2013, Amanda Dodson (the “Plaintiff”), filed a
complaint against us in the District Court of Mayes County, Oklahoma, (“Dodson Case”) with
allegation similar to those asserted in the Naylor Farms Case related to post-production
deductions, and include clams for breach of contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust
enrichment, and other claims and seek termination of leases, recovery of compensatory
damages, interest, punitive damages and attorney fees on behalf of the alleged class. The
alleged class includes non-governmental royalty interest owners in oil and natural gas wells we
operate in Oklahoma. We have responded to the Plaintiff’s petition, denied the allegations and
raised a number of affirmative defenses. At this time, a class has not been certified and discovery
has not yet commenced. We are not currently able to estimate a reasonable possible loss or
range of loss or what impact, if any, the Dodson Case will have on our financial condition, results
of operations or cash flows due to the preliminary status of the matter, the complexity and number
of legal and factual issues presented by the matter and uncertainties with respect to, among other
things, the nature of the claims and defenses, the potential size of the class, the scope and types
of the properties and agreements involved, and the ultimate potential outcome of the matter. We
dispute Plaintiff’s claims, dispute that the case meets the requirements for a class action and are
vigorously defending the case.
Martha Donelson and John Friend, on behalf of themselves and on behalf of all similarly situated
persons v. Chaparral Energy, L.L.C. On August 11, 2014, an alleged class action was filed
against us, as well as several other operators in Osage County, in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma (“Donelson Case”), alleging claims on behalf of the
named plaintiffs and all similarly situated Osage County land owners and surface lessees. The
plaintiffs assert claims seeking recovery for trespass, nuisance, negligence and unjust
enrichment. Relief sought includes declaring oil and natural gas leases and drilling permits
obtained in Osage County without a prior NEPA study void ab initio, removing us from all
properties owned by the class members, disgorgement of profits, and compensatory and punitive
damages. We have joined in Motions to Dismiss filed by the other defendants. At this time, a
class has not been certified and discovery has yet to begin. We are not currently able to estimate
a reasonably possible loss or range of loss or what impact, if any, the Donelson Case will have
on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows due to the preliminary status of the
matter, the complexity and number of legal and factual issues presented by the matter and
uncertainties with respect to, among other things, the nature of the claims and defenses, the
potential size of the class, the scope and types of properties and agreements involved, and the
ultimate potential outcome of the matter. We dispute plaintiffs’ claims, dispute that the Donelson
Case meets the requirements for a class action and are vigorously defending the case.
We are involved in various other legal proceedings including, but not limited to, commercial
disputes, claims from royalty and surface owners, property damage claims, personal injury
claims, employment claims, and other matters which arise in the ordinary course of business.
While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not
expect any of them individually to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.
We have numerous contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business including debt
service requirements, operating leases, capital leases and purchase obligations. Our operating
leases primarily relate to CO2 recycle compressors at our EOR facilities and office equipment
while our capital leases are related to the sale and subsequent leaseback of compressors. Our
purchase obligations primarily relate to contracts for the purchase of CO2, drilling rig services,
pipe and equipment. Other than additional debt borrowings during the six months ended June 30,
2015, there were no material changes to our contractual commitments since December 31, 2014.

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of
operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included
elsewhere in this report.
Statements in our discussion may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause
future production, revenues and expenses to differ materially from our expectations.
Overview
Founded in 1988 and headquartered in Oklahoma City, we are pure play Mid-Continent
independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company. We have capitalized on
our sustained success in the Mid-Continent area in recent years by expanding our holdings to
become a leading player in the liquids-rich Mississippi Lime and STACK, which is home to
multiple oil-rich reservoirs including the Oswego, Meramec, Osage, Woodford and Hunton
formations. We are also the nation’s third-largest carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery (“EOR”)
producer based on number of active projects. This position is underscored by our activity in our
world-class North Burbank Unit in Osage County, Oklahoma, which is the largest oil recovery
unit in the state.
Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and
natural gas and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves that are
economically recoverable. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets,
liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves. We use the full cost method of accounting for
our oil and natural gas activities.
Generally, our producing properties have declining production rates. Our reserve estimates as of
December 31, 2014 reflect that our production rate on current proved developed producing
reserve properties will decline at annual rates of approximately 21%, 14% and 12% for the next
three years. To grow our production and cash flow, we must find, develop and acquire new oil
and natural gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production. Substantial capital
expenditures are required to find, develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves.
Oil and natural gas prices fluctuate widely. We generally hedge a substantial portion of our
expected future oil and natural gas production to reduce our exposure to commodity price
decreases. The prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production affect our:
•cash flow available for capital expenditures;
•ability to borrow and raise additional capital;
•ability to service debt;
•quantity of oil and natural gas we can produce;
•quantity of oil and natural gas reserves; and
•operating results for oil and natural gas activities.
Business and Industry Outlook
Crude oil prices decreased significantly in the latter part of 2014 and have remained low in 2015,
dropping to their lowest levels since March 2009. Management's plans and related capital
projections for 2015 are reflective of lower commodity prices.
In response to the decrease in crude oil prices, in February 2015 we began implementation of a
Company-wide effort to decrease our capital, operating and administrative costs. Our cost
reduction initiatives included a reduction in our workforce, which we initiated in February 2015
and to date has encompassed 217 employees, of which 149 were located in the Oklahoma City
headquarters office and 68 were located at various field offices. In connection with our workforce
reduction, we recorded charges of $6.5 million and $0.3 million during the first and second
quarters of 2015, respectively, related to one-time severance and termination benefits.
Given the depressed commodity price environment, we have aggressively pursued price
concessions from third-party service vendors. Based on cost reductions from service providers
and improved operational efficiencies, we believe that we can achieve a target of $2.5 million to
$3.0 million in drilling and completion costs per well, with recent results coming in at the lower
end of the range.

Table of Contents
As part of our cost reduction initiatives, we engaged third party legal and professional services for
which we have incurred expenses of approximately $2.3 million during the first quarter of 2015
and nil during the second quarter. As discussed below in “Liquidity and capital resources,” we
are allowed to exclude up to $25.0 million of expenses incurred in connection with our cost
reduction initiatives, including costs related to our workforce reduction, from our EBITDA-based
covenant under our senior secured revolving credit facility.
We have significantly reduced our 2015 capital expenditures budget compared to the amount
spent in 2014. We reduced our operated rig count from 10 operated rigs at December 31, 2014 to
one rig as of April 7, 2015 and continuing currently. While we have scaled back our 2015 drilling,
we plan to continue the momentum of our long-term growth projects in our Mid-Continent area by
focusing our drilling efforts in core areas of those plays that have the greatest potential to improve
recoveries and rates of return. Approximately 85% - 90% of our planned 2015 non-acquisition
related capital investments in our E&P Areas will be focused on the high-return Mississippian
Lime and STACK plays. The STACK is characterized by resilient economics at lower prices and
includes properties currently depicted within the Mississippian, Oswego and Woodford Shale
E&P Areas in our “Results of operations— production volumes by area” table.
In a further effort to capture gains associated with improved vendor price concessions, we have
delayed many of our completions of newly drilled wells to the second half of the year.
Specifically, out of 20 wells drilled and rig-released during the six months ended June 30, 2015,
we have deferred completion of 17 wells to the second half of the year.
Our 2015 capital budget was established based on an expectation of spending within available
cash flows from operations, which included additional borrowings under our credit agreement
during the first quarter as we reduced our accounts payable, followed by a partial pay-down of
our borrowings in the second quarter. We expect to make further pay-downs on our senior
secured credit facility during the second half of the year. We will continue to monitor our capital
spending closely based on actual and projected cash flows and evaluate our liquidity and capital
requirements accordingly.
We deal with volatility in commodity prices primarily by maintaining flexibility in our capital
investment program with a diversified drilling portfolio and limited long-term commitments, which
enables us to respond quickly to industry price volatility, as well as by aggressively pursuing cost
reductions in a market downturn. However, price volatility impacts our business in various other
ways, including our full cost ceiling test calculation. The ceiling test calculation dictates that we
use the unweighted arithmetic average price of crude oil and natural gas as of the first day of
each month for the 12-month period ending on the balance sheet date. For the year ended
December 31, 2014, those prices were $94.99 per Bbl for oil and $4.35 per MMBtu for natural
gas, while the unweighted arithmetic average prices of crude oil and natural as of the first day of
each month for the 12-month period through June 30, 2015 were $71.68 per Bbl and $3.39 per
MMBtu, respectively. As a result of the decline in average prices, we recorded a ceiling test write-
down of $217.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Since the prices used in the
cost ceiling are based on a trailing 12-month period, the full impact of a sudden price decline is
not recognized immediately. As prices decline, the economic performance of certain properties in
the reserve estimate may deteriorate to the point that they are removed from the proved reserve
category, thus reducing the quantity and value of proved reserves. The use of a 12-month
average will tend to spread the impact of the price change on the financial statements over
several reporting periods. If commodity prices remain at the current level, the average prices
used in the ceiling test calculation will decline further and we expect to record significantly larger
write-downs in the third and fourth quarter of 2015. Continued write-downs of oil and natural gas
properties may occur until such time as commodity prices recover, and remain at recovered
levels, so as to meaningfully increase the 12-month average price used in the ceiling test
calculation. In addition to commodity prices, our production rates, levels of proved reserves,
estimated future operating expenses, estimated future development costs, transfers of
unevaluated properties and other factors will determine our actual ceiling test calculation and
impairment analyses in future periods.

2015 Highlights
During the second quarter of 2015, production decreased 10% to 2,580 MBoe compared to
production of 2,859 MBoe during the second quarter of 2014, primarily due to our significant
property divestitures, partially offset by our drilling activity and increased EOR production
response. Revenue from commodity sales was $98.8 million lower in the second quarter of 2015
compared to the second quarter in 2014, primarily as a result of the 46% decrease in average
realized prices. During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a ceiling test impairment of oil
and gas properties of $217.6 million as a result of the substantial decline in 12-month average
commodity prices. Additionally, due primarily to increases in the NYMEX forward commodity
price curves during the current quarter, we had a non-hedge derivative loss of $41.6 million in the
second quarter of 2015 compared to a $58.0 million non-hedge derivative loss during the same
period last year. As a result of these and other factors, we reported a net loss of $189.0 million
during the second quarter of 2015, compared to a net loss of $8.4 million for the comparable
period in 2014.
The following are material events that have impacted our liquidity or results of operations, and/or
are expected to impact these items in future periods:
Capital expenditures. Our oil and natural gas property capital expenditure budget for 2015 is
expected to range from $175.0 million to $225.0 million. Our capital expenditures during the six
months ended June 30, 2015 were $112.8 million, consisting primarily of $65.4 million in drilling
and completion expenditures in our E&P Areas, $29.9 million for our EOR Project Areas and
$9.8 million for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties and leasehold.
Senior secured revolving credit facility and liquidity. We entered into an amendment to our
senior secured revolving credit facility effective April 1, 2015, pursuant to which our borrowing
base was redetermined to $550.0 million and certain covenants were revised as discussed
further in “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Senior secured revolving credit facility” and “Note 3
—Long-term debt” in Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Proved property impairments. Due to the substantial decline of commodity prices in late 2014,
which remained low through June 30, 2015, the cost center ceiling exceeded the net capitalized
cost of our oil and natural gas properties as of June 30, 2015, resulting in a ceiling test write-
down during the second quarter of $217.6 million as further discussed in “Results of operations”
and “Note 1—Nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies” in Item 1.

E&P Areas
E&P Areas includes our Mississippian, Oswego and Woodford Shale plays in the STACK and
Mississippian Lime, and the Panhandle Marmaton, which are our repeatable resource plays.
E&P Areas also includes our Legacy Production Areas, which primarily include mature
properties with low production decline curves. The majority of the properties in our Legacy
Production Areas are located in and hold leasehold acreage for future exploration in our existing
repeatable resource plays.
The decrease in production in our E&P Areas for the three months ended June 30, 2015
compared to the same period in 2014 is a direct result of the decrease in our capital program as
well as our strategic delay in completing recently drilled wells until the third and fourth quarters of
2015. With our continued drilling and development activities, production from our Mississippian
play accounted for approximately 29% and 24% of our total production during the three months
ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in production in our Legacy
Production Areas is primarily due to strategic divestitures and reduced capital spending within
these areas.
The increase in production in our E&P Areas for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared
to the same period in 2014 is primarily due to our drilling and development activities in our
Mississippian and Woodford Shale plays, slightly offset
by decreased production in our Legacy Production Areas. The Mississippian and Woodford
Shale plays accounted for approximately 34%, and 25% of our total production during the six
months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The
decrease in production in our Legacy Production Areas is primarily due to strategic divestitures
within these areas and reduced capital spending within these areas.
EOR Project Areas
Our EOR Project Areas include both currently Active EOR Projects and Potential EOR Projects.
Potential EOR Projects have no current EOR production or reserves at June 30, 2015. Our Active
EOR Project areas include properties that have proved EOR reserves, ongoing EOR operations,
or that have an approved authorization for expenditure for EOR operations. Production increases
in our Active EOR Projects for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the
same periods in 2014 were primarily due to production response in our North Burbank Unit and
in our Farnsworth Unit.
Non-Core Properties
As discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, we
sold most of our our Ark-La-Tex, Permian Basin, and North Texas properties during 2014.
Production decreases in our Non-Core Properties were primarily due to divestitures within these
areas. The remaining production within our Non-Core Properties is primarily attributable to
properties we still own in our Gulf Coast areas.
Revenues
Our commodity sales are derived from the sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids
production. These revenues do not include the effects of derivative instruments and may vary
significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or
changes in commodity prices.

Our total commodity sales decreased significantly during the three months ended June 30, 2015
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2014 as a result of a decrease in the average
price per Boe combined with a decrease in production volumes sold. Our total commodity sales
decreased significantly during the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the six months
ended June 30, 2014 as a result of a decrease in the average price per Boe combined with a
slight decrease in production volumes sold. The impact of price and production volume changes
on our commodity sales is disclosed in the table below.
Production volumes sold decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to
the three months ended June 30, 2014 primarily a result of strategic divestitures of our Non-Core
and Legacy Production Areas properties and the decline in production in wells that were
producing as of June 30, 2014, which more than offset the new production from wells that were
completed during the twelve months ended June 30, 2015 plus response from our EOR Project
Areas. Average daily production volumes sold in our Mississippian play increased by
approximately 802 Boe per day during the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second
quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of our well completions. Average daily production volumes

sold in our Active EOR project areas increased by approximately 1,231 Boe per day during the
second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of
production response in our North Burbank Unit and in our Farnsworth Unit. These increases
were partially offset by a decrease in average production volumes sold in our Non-Core
Properties and our Legacy Production Areas, primarily due to strategic divestitures combined
with declines in production and reduced drilling activity in these areas.
Production volumes sold decreased slightly during the six months ended June 30, 2015
compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014 primarily a result of strategic divestitures of our
Non-Core and Legacy Production Areas properties and the decline in production in wells that
were producing as of June 30, 2014 almost fully offset by the new production from wells that were
completed during the twelve months ended June 30, 2015 plus response from our EOR Project
Areas. Average daily production volumes sold in our Mississippian and Woodford Shale plays
increased by approximately 1,972 Boe per day, and 652 Boe per day, respectively, during the six
months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014, primarily as a
result of our recent well completions. Average daily production volumes sold in our Active EOR
project areas increased by approximately 1,409 Boe per day during the six months ended June
30, 2015 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014, primarily as a result of production
response in our North Burbank Unit and in our Farnsworth Unit. These increases were partially
offset by a decrease in average production volumes sold in our Non-Core Properties and our
Legacy Production Areas, primarily due to strategic divestitures combined with declines in
production and reduced drilling activity in these areas.

Derivative activities
Our results of operations, financial condition and capital resources are highly dependent upon
the prevailing market prices of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. These commodity prices are
subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties. To mitigate a portion of this exposure, we
enter into various types of derivative instruments, including commodity price swaps, costless
collars, put options, and basis protection swaps.
Entering into derivative instruments allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices
we will receive for associated oil and natural gas production. We closely monitor the fair value of
our derivative contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in
order to lock in a gain or loss. Our derivative activities are dynamic to allow us to respond to the
volatile commodity markets.
Our realized prices are impacted by realized gains and losses resulting from commodity
derivatives contracts. The following table presents information about the effects of derivative
settlements on realized prices:

We do not apply hedge accounting to any of our derivative instruments. As a result, all gains and
losses associated with our derivative contracts are recognized immediately as non-hedge
derivative gains (losses) in our consolidated statements of operations. Non-hedge derivative
gains (losses) were $(41.6) million during the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to
$(58.0) million during the three months ended June 30, 2014. Non-hedge derivative gains
(losses) were $19.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $(87.2)
million during the six months ended June 30, 2014. The fluctuation in non-hedge derivative gains
(losses) from period to period is due primarily to the significant volatility of oil and natural gas
prices and to changes in our outstanding derivative contracts during these periods.
On March 26, 2015, we entered into early settlements of certain oil and natural gas derivative
contracts originally scheduled to settle between 2015 to 2017 covering 495,000 barrels of oil and
12,280 Bbtu of natural gas for net proceeds of $15,395 in order to maintain compliance with the
hedging limits imposed by covenants under our senior secured credit facility. The proceeds are
included in the cash receipts related to the gains (losses) from derivative activities in the table
above.

Lease operating costs are sensitive to changes in demand for field equipment, services, and
qualified operational personnel, which is driven by demand for oil and natural gas. However, the
timing of changes in operating costs may lag behind changes in commodity prices. Our EOR
projects are more expensive to operate than traditional industry operations due to the nature of
operations along with the costs of recovery and recycling of CO2.
Our E&P Areas lease operating expenses on an absolute dollar basis and a per Boe basis
decreased during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the three
and six months ended June 30, 2014, primarily as a result of the divestiture of certain non-core
assets with higher operating costs, temporary shut-in of marginal wells due to the current low
price environment, cost reductions from third party service providers and improved operational
efficiencies, partially offset by the incremental cost associated with new wells added during the
last twelve months.
Our EOR Project Areas lease operating expenses decreased during the three and six months
ended June 30, 2015 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, primarily due
to temporary shut-in of marginal wells due to the current low price environment, cost reductions
from third party service providers and improved operational efficiencies offset partially by
additional costs associated with expansion of our EOR floods at our North Burbank and
Farnsworth units during the last twelve months. Our EOR Project Areas lease operating
expenses on a per Boe basis decreased, primarily as a result of these factors combined with the
overall increase in production volumes between periods.

Production taxes
per Boe
Production taxes generally change in proportion to commodity sales. Some states offer
exemptions or reduced production tax rates for horizontal drilling, enhanced recovery projects
and high cost gas wells. In Oklahoma, new wells currently qualify for a tax incentive and are
taxed at a lower rate of 1% during their initial 48 months of production. Recent legislation
increases the tax incentive rate to 2% for the initial 36 months of production for wells spudded on
or after July 1, 2015. After the incentive period expires, the tax rate reverts to the statutory rate.
Our production taxes decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 compared
to the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 primarily due to our significant decline in
revenues as a result of depressed commodity prices in the current year. Also contributing to the
decline were our strategic divestitures of wells in our Non-Core Properties and Legacy
Production Areas, which generally had higher tax rates, and reduced tax rates for horizontal
drilling and our EOR projects.

We adjust our DD&A rate on oil and natural gas properties each quarter for significant changes in
our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and costs. Thus, our DD&A rate could change
significantly in the future.
DD&A on oil and natural gas properties decreased $6.6 million for the three months ended June
30, 2015, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2014, of which $5.9 million was due to a
decrease in production and $0.7 million was due to a lower rate per equivalent unit of production.
Our DD&A rate per equivalent unit of production decreased for the three months ended June 30,
2015 primarily due to lower estimated future development costs, which were realized in the
second quarter, offset by the decrease in our average reserves as a result of the prevailing lower
price commodity environment and an increase in our capitalized amortization base, which
included the transfer of amounts from unevaluated oil and gas properties to proved oil and
natural gas properties in the last twelve months.
DD&A on oil and natural gas properties increased $3.2 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014, of which $4.1 million was due to a
higher rate per equivalent unit of production offset partially by $0.9 million due to a decrease in
production. Our DD&A rate per equivalent unit of production increased for the six months ended
June 30, 2015, primarily due to the decrease in our average reserves as a result of the prevailing
lower price commodity environment and an increase in our capitalized amortization base, offset
by lower estimated future development costs.

Property impairments. Due to the substantial decline of commodity prices in late 2014, which
remained low through June 30, 2015, the cost center ceiling exceeded the net capitalized cost of
our oil and natural gas properties as of June 30, 2015, resulting in a ceiling test write-down
during the second quarter of $217.6 million. If commodity prices remain at the current level, the
average prices used in the ceiling test calculation will decline further and we expect to record
significantly larger write-downs in the third and fourth quarter of 2015. Continued write-downs of
oil and natural gas properties may occur until such time as commodity prices recover, and remain
at recovered levels, so as to meaningfully increase the 12-month average price used in the
ceiling test calculation. In addition to commodity prices, our production rates, levels of proved
reserves, estimated future operating expenses, estimated future development costs, transfers of
unevaluated properties and other factors will determine our actual ceiling test calculation and
impairment analyses in future periods.
A contributing factor to the ceiling test write-down above were impairments of unevaluated oil
and gas properties, which resulted in a transfer of amounts from unevaluated oil and natural gas
properties to the full cost amortization base. Impairments of unevaluated oil and gas properties
increased $90.5 million in 2015 to $96.2 million. This included $87.4 million recognized in the
second quarter as a result of changes in management’s estimates of undeveloped properties not
expected to be developed before lease expiration in response to the significant decrease in
crude oil prices which has altered our drilling plans combined with lower than expected results
for certain exploratory activities primarily in our Panhandle Marmaton area.
Impairment of other assets. There were no impairment losses on other assets for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2014. We recorded impairment losses of $13.3 million for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2015 of which $6.0 million related to impairments of our stacked
drilling rigs and $7.3 million related to a market adjustment on our equipment inventory. We own
four stacked drilling rigs of which one was last deployed in January 2015 while the remaining
three have been stacked for two to three years. As a result of the recent deterioration in
commodity prices and reduced drilling activity, the value of such equipment has declined while
utilizing third party equipment has become more cost effective, resulting in us impairing the value
of the rigs to their estimated fair value. We had previously recorded $3.5 million and $1.5 million
of impairment related to these rigs during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. The industry conditions described above have also caused the demand for
equipment utilized in drilling to decrease, resulting in lower market prices for such equipment.
The market adjustment on our equipment inventory reflects the decrease in market prices.

Gross G&A expenses decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2015,
compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, primarily due to lower compensation
and benefits costs and forfeitures of deferred compensation awards. Compensation and benefits
were lower due to lower headcount subsequent to our workforce reduction and due to the lower
commodity price environment.
Capitalized exploration and development costs decreased between periods primarily due to a
lower proportion of compensation costs subject to capitalization as we have reduced our
exploration, acquisition and development activities in this low commodity price environment.
Cost reduction initiatives includes expenses related to our efforts to reduce our capital, operating
and administrative costs in response to the recent deterioration of commodity prices. Included in
our expenses for cost reduction initiatives are $0.4 million and $6.9 million for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2015, respectively, in one-time severance and termination benefits in
connection with our reduction in force that was implemented in February 2015. The remaining
cost reduction expense is a result of third party legal and professional services we have engaged
to assist in these initiatives. As discussed below in “Liquidity and capital resources,” we are
allowed to exclude up to $25.0 million of expenses incurred in connection with our cost reduction
initiatives, including costs related to our workforce reduction, from our EBITDA-based covenant
under our senior secured revolving credit facility.
Our G&A expenses on a Boe basis decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2014 primarily due to these same factors offset
partially by the decrease in overall production volumes between periods.

Liquidity and capital resources
Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have been cash generated from our operations, debt,
private equity sales and proceeds from asset dispositions. As of June 30, 2015, we had cash and
cash equivalents of $27.6 million and had borrowed $427.0 million under our senior secured
revolving credit facility with a borrowing base of $550.0 million. As of August 12, 2015, we had
borrowed $409.0 million under our senior secured revolving credit facility.
We believe that we will have sufficient funds available through our cash from operations,
proceeds from asset divestitures and borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit to meet
our normal recurring operating needs, debt service obligations, capital requirements and
contingencies for the next 12 months.
All of our sources of liquidity can be impacted by the general condition of the broader economy
and by fluctuations in commodity prices, operating costs, and volumes produced, all of which
affect us and our industry. We have no control over the market prices for oil, gas, or NGLs,
although we are able to influence the amount of our realized revenues from our oil, gas, and NGL
sales through the use of derivative contracts as part of our commodity price risk management
program. Historically, decreases in commodity prices have limited our industry’s access to capital
markets. The borrowing base under our credit
36
Table of Contents
facility has been and could be further reduced as a result of lower commodity prices and
divestitures of proved properties. Beginning in the third quarter of 2014 and continuing into the
present, oil, natural gas and NGL commodity prices declined significantly and are expected to
fluctuate in the future. We deal with volatility in commodity prices primarily by our derivative
hedging program and maintaining flexibility in our capital investment program with a diversified
drilling portfolio and limited long-term commitments, which enables us to respond quickly to
industry price volatility, as well as aggressively pursuing cost reductions in a market downturn.
The profitability of the oil and gas operations and the ability to realize recorded asset values is
dependent on the success of future development plans and projected long-term market
conditions.

a decrease in commodity sales driven by lower prices on all our commodities.
When available, we use the net cash provided by operations to partially fund our acquisition,
exploration and development activities. Our acquisition, exploration and development activities

As discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, our
initial estimate of capital expenditures by area and category were at the low end of our capital
expenditures budget. We currently anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2015 will trend
towards the mid-point of our capital expenditures budget with the most significant increase in
drilling for funding participation interests in non-operated wells drilled in the STACK.
Net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2015 was comprised
of cash outflows for capital expenditure of $222.7 million, partially offset by cash inflows from
derivative settlement receipts of $118.7 million and asset dispositions of $7.4 million. Our cash
outflows for capital expenditure is greater than our actual costs incurred for the period, disclosed
in the table above, as a result of payments in the current period for expenditures accrued at the
end of the prior year. Net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30,
2014 was comprised primarily of cash outflows
37

for capital expenditure of $322.3 million and derivative settlement payments of $22.0 million,
partially offset by cash inflows from asset dispositions of $173.2 million.
Cash flows from financing activities is comprised primarily of cash inflows from long-term debt
borrowings, offset by cash outflows from repayments of long-term debt and capital leases. During
the six months ended June 30, 2015, we borrowed $120.0 million on our long-term debt and
made repayments of $41.7 million on our long-term debt and $1.2 million on our capital leases.
We also paid $1.4 million in bank fees in connection with the amendment to our senior secured
credit facility discussed below. During the six months ended June 30, 2014, we borrowed $111.3

Senior secured revolving credit facility
We maintain a senior secured revolving credit facility, which is collateralized by our oil and
natural gas properties, and matures on November 1, 2017. As of June 30, 2015, we have $427.0
million of outstanding borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility. Our
borrowing base on the facility decreased from $650.0 million to $550.0 million effective April 1,
2015
Availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base which
is set by the banks semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. In addition, the
lenders may request a borrowing base redetermination once between each scheduled
redetermination and in the event of early termination of our derivative contracts. The banks
establish a borrowing base by making an estimate of the collateral value of our oil and natural
gas properties. If oil and natural gas prices decrease from the amounts used in estimating the
collateral value of our oil and natural gas properties, the borrowing base may be reduced, thus
reducing funds available under the borrowing base.
38
Table of Contents
Our senior secured revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a current ratio, as defined in
our senior secured revolving credit facility, of not less than 1.0 to 1.0. The definition of current
assets and current liabilities used for determination of the current ratio computed for loan
compliance purposes differs from current assets and current liabilities determined in compliance
with GAAP. Since compliance with financial covenants is a material requirement under our
senior secured revolving credit facility, we consider the current ratio calculated under our senior
secured revolving credit facility to be a useful measure of our liquidity because it includes the
funds available to us under our senior secured revolving credit facility and is not affected by the
volatility in working capital caused by changes in the fair value of derivatives. The following table
discloses the current ratio for our loan compliance compared to the ratio calculated per GAAP.

Amendment”) effective April 1, 2015. Among other things, the amendment replaced the
Consolidated Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDAX covenant with a covenant based on the ratio of
Consolidated Net Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDAX, as defined in the Fifteenth
Amendment. Under this covenant, we are required to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Net
Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDAX no greater than 2.25 to 1.0 for each period of four
consecutive fiscal quarters ending on the last day of such applicable fiscal quarter. For the same
applicable periods, the Fifteenth Amendment also requires us to maintain an Interest Coverage
Ratio, as defined in the Fifteenth Amendment, of no less than 2.00 to 1.00. The Fifteenth
Amendment revised the definition of Consolidated EBITDAX to exclude up to $25.0 million in
expenses incurred subsequent to January 1, 2015, in connection with our cost reduction
initiatives, transition, business optimization and other restructuring charges. The charges we
have incurred to date under this category are described above under “Results of operations -
General and administrative expenses.” Under the Fifteenth Amendment, we are also allowed to
incur an additional $300.0 million in Additional Permitted Debt, as defined in the Fifteenth
Amendment to now include both secured and unsecured debt.
As of June 30, 2015, availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility was limited to
$122.1 million, which was not limited by the Consolidated Net Secured Debt to Consolidated
EBITDAX ratio.
Capital Leases
During 2013, we entered into lease financing agreements with U.S. Bank National Association
for $24.5 million through the sale and subsequent leaseback of existing compressors owned by
us. The carrying value of these compressors is included in our oil and natural gas full cost pool.
The lease financing obligations are for 84-month terms and include the option to purchase the
equipment for a specified price at 72 months as well as an option to purchase the equipment at
the end of the lease term for its then-current fair market value. Lease payments related to the
equipment are recognized as principal payments and interest expense.
Asset divestitures and alternative capital sources
As discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, during
2014 we sold various oil and natural gas properties primarily located in our Ark-La-Tex, Permian
Basin, and North Texas areas. Our asset sales in 2014 generated a total of $291.4 million in
cash. Proceeds from our property sales provide us with an additional source of liquidity to pay
down borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility, fund capital expenditures and
for general corporate purposes. Our planned capital expenditures for 2015 will be funded, in part,
by $35.0 million of anticipated proceeds we expect to generate from asset divestitures, most
which are expected to occur in the second half of the year. Our external sources of
39
Table of Contents
liquidity in the future may include asset sales, additional public or private issuances of common
or preferred stock, or project financing. While we believe we would be able to obtain funds
through one or more of these alternative sources if needed, we cannot provide assurance that
these resources would be available on terms acceptable to us.
Contractual Obligations
We have numerous contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business including debt
service requirements, operating leases, capital leases and purchase obligations. Our operating
leases primarily relate to CO2 recycle compressors at our EOR facilities and office equipment
while our capital leases are related to the sale and subsequent leaseback of compressors. Our
purchase obligations primarily relate to contracts for the purchase of CO2, drilling rig services,
pipe and equipment.
Other than additional borrowings under our senior secured credit facility during the six months
ended June 30, 2015, there were no material changes to our contractual commitments since
December 31, 2014.
Non-GAAP financial measure and reconciliation
Management uses adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental financial measurement to evaluate our
operational trends. Items excluded generally represent non-cash adjustments, the timing and
amount of which cannot be reasonably estimated and are not considered by management when
measuring our overall operating performance. In addition, adjusted EBITDA is generally
consistent with the Consolidated EBITDAX calculation that is used in the covenant ratio required
under our senior secured revolving credit facility described in the Liquidity and Capital
Resources section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations. We consider compliance with this covenant to be material. Adjusted
EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business and
should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of our operating
performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, or as a measure of liquidity.
Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP and, accordingly, it may not be a comparable
measurement to those used by other companies.
We define adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted to exclude (1) asset impairments,
(2) interest and other financing costs, net of capitalized interest, (3) income taxes,
(4) depreciation, depletion and amortization, (5) non-cash change in fair value of non-hedge
derivative instruments, (6) interest income, (7) stock-based compensation expense, (8) gain or
loss on disposed assets, (9) upfront premiums paid on settled derivative contracts,
(10) impairment charges, and (11) expenses associated with our cost reduction initiatives,
transition, business optimization and other restructuring charges not to exceed $25.0 million in
2015 (as allowed under our senior secured revolving credit facility) and (12) other significant,
unusual non-cash charges.
The following table provides a reconciliation of our net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA for the
specified periods:

ITEM 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Commodity prices. Our financial condition, results of operations and capital resources are highly
dependent upon the prevailing market prices of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. These
commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of
factors that are beyond our control. We cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices with any
degree of certainty. Sustained declines in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations, and may also reduce the amount of net oil and
natural gas reserves that we can produce economically. Any reduction in reserves, including
reductions due to price fluctuations, can reduce our borrowing base under our senior secured
revolving credit facility and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to obtain capital for our
acquisition, exploration and development activities. Based on our production for the six months
ended June 30, 2015, our gross revenues from oil and natural gas sales would change
approximately $3.8 million for each $1.00 change in oil and natural gas liquid prices and $1.0
million for each $0.10 change in natural gas prices.
To mitigate a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, we enter into various
types of derivative instruments, including commodity price swaps, enhanced swaps, costless
collars, put options, and basis protection swaps. We currently do not apply hedge accounting to
any of our derivative instruments. As a result, all gains and losses associated with our derivative
contracts are recognized immediately as non-hedge derivative gains (losses) in the consolidated
statements of operations. This can have a significant impact on our results of operations due to
the volatility of the underlying commodity prices. Please see “Note 4—Derivative instruments” in
Item 1. Financial statements of this report for further discussion of our derivative instruments.
Derivative positions are adjusted in response to changes in prices and market conditions as part
of an ongoing dynamic process. We review our derivative positions continuously and if future
market conditions change, we may execute a cash settlement with our counterparty, restructure
the position, or enter into a new swap that effectively reverses the current position (a counter-
swap). The factors we consider in closing or restructuring a position before the settlement date
are identical to those we reviewed when deciding to enter into the original derivative position.

As a result of the deferred premiums, the above 2,610,000 barrels of crude oil production in
2015 are hedged at an average effective price of $78.68/barrel.
Total premiums of $20.6 million for the purchased puts were paid at contract inception in
December 2014. Excluding the premiums and utilizing an average NYMEX strip price of
$61.90 for 2016 as of June 30, 2015, the average realized price from our 3,720,000 barrels of
hedged production that have associated sold puts and purchased puts is $74.32/barrel. In the
event that crude oil prices are below $60.00/barrel, which is indicated by the average NYMEX
strip price for 2016 as of August 10, 2015, the purchase of these put options established a floor
on the realized price for these hedged volumes of $72.42/barrel.

During July 2015, we entered into swaps covering 520,000 barrels of oil, scheduled to settle
ratably between September and December 2015, with an average notional price of $50.43 per
barrel, which offset our existing swaps disclosed in the table above. By entering into offset
positions for these volumes, we have locked-in the difference between the contract price of our
prior swaps and the contract price of our recent swaps, which we will receive when the contracts
settle. In addition, we also entered into collars covering 260,000 barrels of oil, scheduled to settle
ratably between September and October 2015, at a call price of $57.50 per barrel and a put price
of $47.50 barrel and purchased puts covering 260,000 barrels of oil, scheduled to settle ratably
between November and December 2015, at a price of $47.50 barrel. The collars and the puts
were purchased for a total premium of $1.2 million, payable upon settlement of the contracts.

Interest rates. All of the outstanding borrowings under our senior secured revolving facility as of
June 30, 2015 are subject to market rates of interest as determined from time to time by the
banks. We may elect to borrow under our senior secured revolving credit facility at either
Eurodollar rate, which is linked to LIBOR, or the ABR. Loans subject to the ABR bear interest at a
fluctuating rate that is linked to the greater of (1) the Prime Rate, as defined in our senior secured
revolving credit facility, (2) the Federal Funds Effective Rate, as defined in the senior secured
revolving credit facility, plus 0.50%, or (3) the Adjusted LIBO rate, as defined in our senior
secured revolving credit facility, plus 1%. Any increases in these rates can have an adverse
impact on our results of operations and cash flow. Assuming a constant debt level of $550.0
million, equal to our borrowing base at June 30, 2015, the cash flow impact for a 12-month period
resulting from a 100 basis point change in interest rates would be $5.5 million.
ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure controls and procedures
We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information
relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify
our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the board of directors.
Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and are effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.
Internal control over financial reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We may make changes in our internal control
procedures from time to time.
PART II—OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Please see “Note 8—Commitments and contingencies” in Item 1. Financial statements of this
report for a discussion of our material legal proceedings. In our opinion, there are no other
material pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the
subject. However, due to the nature of our business, certain legal or administrative proceedings
may arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these legal
matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect them to have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS
Studies by both state or federal agencies demonstrating a correlation between earthquakes and
oil and natural gas activities could result in increased regulatory and operational burdens
In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed March 31, 2015,
we stated that some parties believe there is a correlation between the operation of underground
injection wells for the disposal of produced water and the increased occurrence of earthquakes in
Oklahoma, but that the results of state and federal studies on the existence of a correlation are
uncertain.  On April 21, 2015, the Oklahoma Geologic Survey (“OGS”) issued a document entitled
“Statement of Oklahoma Seismicity,” in which the agency states “[t]he OGS considers it very
likely that the majority of recent earthquakes, particularly those in central and north-central
Oklahoma, are triggered by the injection of produced water in disposal wells.” The Oklahoma
Corporation Commission has issued a directive affecting more than 500 disposal wells in 21
Oklahoma counties restricting injection of high volumes of water into formations below the
Arbuckle formation into the crystalline basement.  We do not operate a disposal well affected by
the directives. This development may result in additional levels of regulation, or increased
complexity with respect to existing regulations, that could lead to operational delays or
45
Table of Contents
increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it
more difficult to inject produced water into disposal wells, and may increase our costs of
compliance and doing business.
Information with respect to other risk factors that we may encounter is included under Item 1A. of
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. Other than the above,
there have been no material changes to the risk factors since the filing of such Form 10-K.
