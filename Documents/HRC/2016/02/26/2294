Human Rights and other applicable human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> all resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, the General 
Assembly and the Human Rights Council on the situation of human rights in Belarus, 
including Council resolutions 17/24 of 17 June 2011 and 20/13 of 5 July 2012, and 
deploring the inadequate response by the Government of Belarus to the requests of the 
Council made in those resolutions, including the denial of access to the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights in Belarus and other special procedures mandate holders to 
the country, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 of 18 June 2007, 
</p>

rights in Belarus;1 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses deep concern</i> at continuing violations of human rights in Belarus, 
which are of a structural and endemic nature, and also at the systemic and systematic 
restrictions on human rights, especially in the case of the freedoms of association, of 
assembly, and of opinion and expression, as well as the guarantees of due process and fair 
trial, and expresses particular concern at the use of torture and ill-treatment in custody, the

</p>

<p>lack of response by the Government to cases of enforced disappearance of political 
opponents, violations of labour rights amounting to forced labour, significant gaps in anti-
discrimination legislation, the impunity of perpetrators of human rights violations and 
abuses, the harassment of civil society organizations, human rights defenders, journalists 
and political opponents, pressure on defence lawyers, the lack of participation of opposition 
political parties in Parliament, and the fact that most international observers regarded the 
polling in Parliamentary elections on 23 September 2012 as inconsistent with basic 
standards for competitive, free and fair elections; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon</i> the Government of Belarus to carry out a comprehensive review 
of relevant legislation, policies, strategies and practices to ensure that the provisions are 
clearly defined, consistent with international human rights law and their human rights 
commitments, and not used to impede or unduly restrict the exercise of any human right, 
including the freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly, or freedom of the 
media; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Notes</i> the attention paid by the Special Rapporteur to the issue of the death 
penalty in Belarus, and takes note of the re-establishment of the parliamentary working 
group on the death penalty, and encourages it to expedite its work; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon</i> the Government of Belarus to carry out a comprehensive reform 
of the justice sector and bar associations in order to guarantee the independence and 
impartiality of the judiciary, the presumption of innocence, fair trial, the right to an 
effective review of sentences and convictions by a higher tribunal established by law and to 
freely chosen legal representation throughout all proceedings, as well as the availability of 
information on the implementation of all sentences; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Strongly urges</i> the Government of Belarus to immediately and 
unconditionally release and rehabilitate all political prisoners, and to rehabilitate those who 
have already been released, to address, through comprehensive, transparent and credible 
investigations, reports of torture and ill-treatment by law-enforcement officials, and to put 
an immediate end to the arbitrary detention of human rights defenders and political 
opponents, arbitrary travel bans and other policies aimed at intimidating representatives of 
the political opposition and the media, as well as human rights defenders and civil society; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Encourages</i> the Government of Belarus to consider expediting its initiative to 
establish a national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles, and to 
enhance the progress made towards reaching the Millennium Development Goals; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in Belarus for a period of one year, and requests the Special Rapporteur to 
submit a report on the situation of human rights in Belarus to the Human Rights Council at 
its twenty-sixth session and to the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Urges</i> the Government of Belarus to cooperate fully with the Special 
Rapporteur, including by providing him access to visit the country, as well as the 
information necessary to facilitate the fulfilment of the mandate; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to provide the Special Rapporteur with the assistance and resources necessary to 
allow the fulfilment of the mandate.
