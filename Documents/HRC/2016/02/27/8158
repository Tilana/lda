<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to Council 
resolution 19/19. In the report, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism lists his key activities 
undertaken from 18 August 2011 to 2 April 2012 and focuses thematically on the human 
rights of victims of acts of terrorism and the corresponding international obligations of 
States.   
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 19 September 2011, the Special Rapporteur participated in the Secretary-
General&#8217;s Symposium on International Counter-Terrorism Cooperation, where he gave a 
statement1 on Promoting human rights and the rule of law while countering terrorism, 
during the fifth session. 
</p>
<p>3.  On 12 October, the Special Rapporteur held consultations in London with 
representatives of civil society, lawyers and national human rights institutions from 
different regions. 
</p>
<p>4. On 20 October, the Special Rapporteur delivered his first statement2 and presented 
his first annual report (A/66/310) to the General Assembly, in which he identified two 
related areas falling within his mandate, on which he intended to focus, namely States&#8217; 
obligations towards victims of terrorism (para. 20),  and States&#8217; duty to promote strategies 
for the prevention of terrorism.   
</p>
<p>5. In October 2011, the Special Rapporteur held meetings in New York with the 
Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee; the 1267/1989 Al Qaeda Sanctions 
Committee and its Ombudsperson; the permanent representatives of Germany and Mexico 
to the United Nations; the United States Deputy Representative for the Economic and 
Social Council and various representatives of civil society. At the Secretariat level, he met 
with the Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF) and  
participated in a round-table meeting with the Working Group on Security Council 
resolution 1624 (2005) of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate 
(CTED), concerning the human rights implications of Security Council resolutions 1624 
(2005) and 1373 (2001).  
</p>
<p>6. On 15 November, the Special Rapporteur delivered a statement3 at the international 
seminar &#8220;Terrorism and human rights standards,&#8221; organized by the regional office of the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Santiago 
de Chile and the Chilean National Institute for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>7.  On 11 March 2012, the Special Rapporteur published an article in the Danish 
newspaper, <i>Berlingske Tidende</i>, authored jointly with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of 
Denmark and the European Union Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, to mark the European 
Day in Remembrance of Victims of Terrorism.

<p>8.  On 2 April 2012, the Special Rapporteur took part in a panel discussion on the rights 
of victims of terrorism, hosted jointly by Spain, the CTITF, the Fundaci&#243;n Miguel &#193;ngel 
Blanco and the Fundaci&#243;n V&#237;ctimas del Terrorismo. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Burkina Faso for having 
extended an invitation to visit the country in November 2011, which he was compelled to 
postpone until 2012. He also expresses his thanks to the Government of Honduras for 
extending an invitation. The Government of Chile indicated that a country visit could take 
place in 2012. Following the issuance of a standing invitation to all special procedures 
mandate holders, the Special Rapporteur sent a reminder concerning his outstanding visit 
request to Thailand. He also sent a visit request to Nigeria, which, like Burkina Faso, is a 
partnering country for the Integrated Assistance for Countering Terrorism initiative of the 
CTITF. There are outstanding visit requests to Algeria, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines 
and the Russian Federation. In addition, he is awaiting an invitation for a second visit to 
Egypt. 
</p>
<p><b> III. State obligations corresponding to the human rights of 
victims of terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>10. The present report identifies the core human rights of victims of terrorism, 
elaborates the international obligations resting on States to protect those rights, and 
recommends that States take steps towards enshrining these rights and obligations in a 
specific international instrument.   
</p>
<p>11.  At the outset, the Special Rapporteur strongly urges States to recognize that the 
deliberate infliction of lethal or potentially lethal violence by non-State actors in the course 
of an act of terrorism amounts, in all cases where death or serious physical or psychological 
injury results, to a grave violation of the human rights of the victim, irrespective of the 
question of direct or indirect State responsibility.   
</p>
<p>12.  Some still argue that terrorists, rebels and other belligerents cannot commit 
violations of international human rights law unless the degree of organization, territorial 
control and State recognition involved in a conflict situation has escalated to the level of a 
full-blown insurgency or internal armed conflict. However, it is a central tenet of 
international human rights law that it must keep pace with a changing world. Some of the 
gravest violations of human rights are nowadays committed by, or on behalf of, non-State 
actors operating in conflict situations of one kind or another,4 including by domestic and 
international terrorist networks. If international human rights law is to keep pace with these 
changes, the victims of acts of terrorism must now be recognized as victims of grave 
violations of international human rights law.5   
</p>
<p>13. For those who seek a nexus to State responsibility, this may be identified in the 
general duty of States, under article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (the &#8220;Covenant&#8221;), to protect the right to life of individuals on their territory, as well 
as &#8220;the involuntary sacrifice of victims on behalf of the State, which is the most frequent 
target of terrorist acts.&#8221;6 Certainly, when viewed from a victim's perspective, the mass 
killing of civilians which is the objective of most terrorist campaigns, involves the 
deprivation of the most fundamental human right of all. The Special Rapporteur 
acknowledges that there is a responsible body of opinion to the effect that only States and 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 4 See for example A/HRC/19/69, paras. 105-120. 
 5 See for example Law No. 29/2011 of Spain, and para. 60 of this report.

</i></p>
<p><i>Victims of Acts of Terrorism</i> (New York, 2011), para. 68. </p>


<p>comparable entities can violate human rights. However, he does not share this view. Indeed, 
it can be argued that allowing victims of terrorism to remain as legally ossified &#8220;prisoners 
of doctrine&#8221;7 is an outdated and retrograde analysis that can lead to various forms of 
secondary victimization.8   
</p>
<p>14.  It is a striking fact that despite the proliferation of international agreements 
concerned with the suppression of terrorism, there is none that specifically addresses the 
human rights of the victims and the corresponding obligations of States. The 
dehumanization of victims of terrorism has been recognized by the General Assembly as a 
condition conducive to the spread of terrorism.9 The Special Rapporteur considers that 
international recognition of victims of terrorism as individuals whose fundamental human 
rights have been violated, and the incorporation of this principle in a specific international 
instrument on the rights of victims of terrorism will strengthen international efforts towards 
an effective global counter-terrorism strategy. 
</p>
<p>15.  Chapter I of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy encourages Member States to 
consider putting in place national systems of assistance that would promote the needs of 
victims of terrorism and their families and facilitate the normalization of their lives. 
Chapter IV stresses the need to promote and protect the rights of victims of acts of 
terrorism.10 The present report aims to contribute to those objectives by recommending that 
States formally recognize victims of terrorism as victims of international human rights 
violations, and agree certain minimum principles in a specific international instrument 
dedicated to securing the protection of their fundamental human rights. 
</p>
<p>16.  For the purposes of this report, the Special Rapporteur identifies four main 
categories of victims of terrorism:11 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Direct victims of terrorism: </b>Natural persons who have been killed or have suffered 
serious physical or psychological injury as the result of an act of terrorism.12 
Terrorist acts often affect a large number of direct victims, whose most fundamental 
human rights, such as their right to life and their rights to physical security and 
moral integrity, have been violated or threatened.13 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Secondary victims of terrorism:</b> Natural persons who are the next of kin or 
dependents of a direct victim of terrorism. The General Assembly has accepted that 
the term <i>victim</i> &#8220;includes, where appropriate, the immediate family or dependants of 
the direct victim.&#8221;14 This has been expressly recognized by regional human rights 
bodies in the context of the State's positive obligations to protect the right to life,15 
and has been extended to include de facto marriages and similar personal 
partnerships.16 Similarly, the Council of Europe&#8217;s Committee of Ministers&#8217;

<p>Guidelines on the protection of victims of terrorist acts extend the protection of the 
Guidelines, in appropriate circumstances, to the close family of the direct victim 
(chap. I - Principles, para. 1).<b> 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Indirect victims of terrorism</b>: Individuals who have suffered serious physical or 
psychological injury as the indirect result of an act of terrorism. This category 
includes (a) members of the public (such as hostages or bystanders) who have been 
killed or injured through the use of potentially lethal force against suspected 
terrorists; (b) eyewitnesses who have sustained serious psychological harm as the 
result of witnessing a violent terrorist incident or its immediate aftermath; (c) 
individuals who have been subjected to potentially lethal force by a public authority 
after being mistakenly identified as a suspected terrorist;17 (d) rescue workers who 
suffer serious physical or psychological harm as the result of taking part in 
emergency relief.18 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Potential victims of terrorism</b>: For the purposes of promoting a comprehensive 
statement of basic rights and obligations in this sphere, potential victims of future 
terrorist acts are an important additional category. They are the principal 
beneficiaries of the State&#8217;s positive obligations under article 6 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Moreover, the prevention of future acts of 
terrorism is an important part of the rationale for the State&#8217;s obligation, under article 
6 of the Covenant, to conduct a prompt, thorough, independent and impartial 
investigation into any act of terrorism.   
</p>
<p><b> A. Legal obligation of States to protect the right to life 
</b></p>
<p>17. The first obligation of any State, and a key component of its raison d&#8217;&#234;tre, is the duty 
to protect the lives of its citizens and of all individuals within its territory or subject to its 
jurisdiction (A/66/310, para. 20). The right to life under article 6 of the Covenant19 has been 
characterized as the supreme human right;20 it is non-derogable within the meaning of 
article 4, paragraph 2, of the Covenant.21  
</p>
<p>18. The States&#8217; obligations under article 6 of the Covenant go beyond the duty of 
refraining from the intentional and unlawful taking of life by public officials. Article 6 also 
embodies States&#8217; positive duty to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of individuals 
within its jurisdiction. Regional human rights organs have established longstanding 
jurisprudence in relation to States&#8217; positive obligation to protect individuals from life-
threatening injury through the criminal acts of third parties.22 More specifically, they have 
elaborated standards regarding States&#8217; duty to protect the right to life in the context of acts 
of terrorism. The Council of Europe Guidelines on human rights and the fight against 
terrorism refer to the &#8220;imperative duty of States to protect their populations against possible 
</p>
<p>terrorist acts,&#8221; (Preamble, para. f) while the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 17 This category is typified by the case of Jean Charles de Menenez, who was fatally shot on a London 
</p>
<p>underground train on 22 July 2005, in the mistaken belief that he was one of those responsible for the 
London bombings.

<p>emphasizes that &#8220;the State has the right and duty to guarantee the security of all.&#8221;23 The 
State&#8217;s duty to uphold national security and its obligation to ensure the protection of the 
</p>
<p>human rights of all those within its jurisdiction thus amount to a series of complementary, 
simultaneous and mutually reinforcing obligations. 
</p>
<p>19. It is axiomatic that States are under the obligation of an international law to put in 
place effective criminal law provisions to deter the incitement,24 preparation and 
commission of terrorist offences, supported by law-enforcement machinery for the 
prevention, suppression and sanctioning of breaches of such provisions.25 Defences 
available under national laws must be drafted with sufficient precision to ensure effective 
protection of the right to life and physical security.26   
</p>
<p>20. The right to life under article 6 of the Covenant cannot be construed in such a way 
as to place States in the position of guarantor against every terrorist threat, as this would 
impose a disproportionate burden on the authorities.27 However, in certain defined 
circumstances, public officials can come under a positive obligation to take operational 
measures to prevent a terrorist act from occurring.28 For such a positive operational 
obligation to arise, it must be established that (i) the authorities knew or ought to have 
known of (ii) the existence, at the relevant time, of a real and immediate (iii) risk to the life 
of an identified individual or group of individuals within its jurisdiction due to (iv) criminal 
acts of a third party, and that they failed to (v) take measures within the scope of their legal 
powers and available resources, and in conformity with their international obligations 
which, judged objectively and reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.29 
</p>
<p>21. In relation to requirement (i), States are required to establish effective mechanisms 
for identifying potential future threats of terrorist attack, to analyse the information with 
reasonable care, to reach an informed risk assessment and to take appropriate action. That 
action may include not only the disruption of threatened attacks by law enforcement 
agencies but also, where appropriate, the provision of information to the public. Many 
States have established dedicated institutions, mostly in the form of intelligence or security 
agencies, whose task is to detect potential national security threats, including terrorist 
threats, through the gathering and analysis of relevant information. The activities of those 
agencies must be fully compliant with international human rights law.30   
</p>
<p>22. In relation to requirement (ii), authorities will not, in general, be in possession of all 
relevant facts in advance, and are therefore often obliged to plan counter-terrorism 
operations on the basis of incomplete factual hypotheses. State authorities are confronted 
on a daily basis with an immense amount of material about possible security threats.31   
Purely ex post facto assessments cannot be the sole basis for a finding of State 
responsibility for a violation of the right to life. They may however be of central 
importance when relevant authorities are called upon to conduct investigations for the

<p>purpose of identifying the lessons learnt from a terrorist incident, so that the authorities 
may be better able to prevent similar future incidents. 
</p>
<p>23. In connection with requirement (iii), there is a distinction to be drawn between cases 
where the authorities have previously accepted an obligation to provide personal protection 
to an individual or group identified as being at specific risk (in which case, the authorities 
may be said to have assumed direct responsibility for guaranteeing the physical safety of 
those individuals or groups32) and cases in which the obligation at issue is the overarching 
duty resting on the State to afford adequate protection against the general threat posed by 
terrorism to the population at large.33 In the latter context, States have competing 
considerations to balance, including protection of the rights of others to liberty and security, 
fair trial, privacy, freedom of expression and freedom of movement. They may also be 
constrained by the allocation of scarce resources. States must therefore be afforded a certain 
discretion in planning general counter-terrorism strategies and in choosing from the 
legislative, executive and operational means at their disposal for discharging their positive 
operational obligations under article 6 of the Covenant.34 
</p>
<p>24.  Regarding the term &#8220;criminal&#8221; in requirement (iv), no distinction is to be drawn in 
this connection between terrorism and other crimes against person or property.  The Special 
Rapporteur adopts and reiterates the approach of his predecessor that all acts of terrorism 
should be categorized as ordinary crimes, and dealt with within the legal and institutional 
framework of ordinary criminal law.35   
</p>
<p>25. In relation to requirement (v), counter-terrorism measures must be fully in 
compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law. They must respect the 
right to life of suspects and bystanders; the absolute prohibition on the use of torture or 
other ill-treatment or punishment during interrogation or detention; the right to liberty and 
security; the right to a fair and public trial by an independent and impartial tribunal; the 
principle of legal certainty and non-retrospectivity in the application of the criminal law; as 
well as the qualified rights to privacy, freedom of expression and freedom of association.  
Counter-terrorism measures must also be carefully tailored to meet the specific threat that 
has been identified, while avoiding discrimination, including unjustified differences in the 
treatment of particular religious or ethnic groups or of foreign nationals.36  The adoption of 
human rights-abusive, counter-terrorism measures has been recognized by the General 
Assembly as one of the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism.37  The Special 
Rapporteur considers it self-evident that human rights abuses by States in countering the 
threat of terrorism hand a propaganda victory to the terrorists and provide them with 
distorted arguments by which they recruit others to their cause. Not only are such measures 
internationally unlawful, but they also increase, to an unknown extent, the risk to potential 
future victims of terrorism. 
</p>
<p>26. An important dimension of requirement (v) is the State&#8217;s positive duty to intervene 
in the course of a major terrorist incident and its aftermath.  The requirements of article 6 of 
the Covenant imply that any rescue operation should be based on a carefully considered 
general emergency plan, prepared and approved in advance by the authorities. States have a 
</p>

<p>duty to plan such operations in a manner that minimizes the risk of physical injury to the 
greatest possible extent.38 
</p>
<p>27. Where lethal force is deliberately inflicted by State officials, there may be a threat 
not only to the life of the suspect, but also to the life of any innocent bystander. This is 
particularly so where firearms are used. In a case involving terrorist hostage-taking, the 
European Court of Human Rights has held that &#8220;the primary aim of the [rescue] operation 
</p>
<p>should be to protect lives from unlawful violence.&#8221;39 Counter-terrorist operations that result 
in loss of life must therefore be subjected to penetrating judicial or other independent 
scrutiny to determine not only whether the actions of the State officials who administered 
lethal force were lawful, but also whether the operation as a whole, including its planning 
and control, was strictly proportionate.40 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur is profoundly conscious of the multifaceted difficulties 
States encounter in protecting their populations from terrorist violence, and expresses his 
recognition of the complexity of the problem. More specifically, one must bear in mind the 
difficulties involved in policing modern societies, the unpredictability of human conduct 
and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources.41 The 
choice of means may depend on the extent to which the authorities are in control of a 
particular situation.42 Nonetheless, the conscientious discharge of these important and 
difficult duties is a central responsibility of Statehood. 
</p>
<p>29. In addition to the law enforcement measures defined in chapter II of the Global 
Counter-Terrorism Strategy,43 States have a responsibility for implementing preventive 
initiatives aimed at reducing the risk of future acts of terrorism. This can be seen as a 
dimension of the State's positive obligation under article 6 of the Covenant to take steps to 
protect the lives of future potential victims of acts of terrorism.  States must tackle not only 
the manifestations of terrorism, but its causes, as foreseen in chapter I of the Strategy. 
Conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, as identified by Member States, include 
prolonged unresolved conflicts; dehumanization of victims of terrorism in all its forms and 
manifestations; lack of the rule of law; violations of human rights; ethnic, national and 
religious discrimination; political exclusion; socio-economic marginalization and lack of 
good governance.44 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur considers that the capacities of the United Nations in 
conflict prevention, negotiation, mediation, conciliation, peacekeeping and peacebuilding45 
should be more actively sought and deployed in national counter-terrorism strategies.  In 
this connection, he welcomes the initiative by the CTITF Working Group on preventing 
and resolving conflicts to issue guidelines for United Nations mediators.46

<p>31. The suggested link between poverty and terrorism is controversial.47  However, in 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, there are at least &#8220;patterns of correlation&#8221; suggesting that 
societies characterized by economic, social, political and educational exclusion &#8220;are often 
breeding, or recruitment, grounds for terrorism&#8221; (A/HRC/6/17, para. 64).  The Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has suggested that efforts at 
terrorism prevention should focus on grievances arising from inequality and social 
exclusion.48  
</p>
<p>32. Finally, in this connection, the Special Rapporteur strongly believes that human 
rights-compliant counter-terrorism measures help to prevent the recruitment of individuals 
to acts of terrorism (A/HRC/16/51, para. 12). Human rights abuses have all too often 
contributed to the grievances which cause people to make the wrong choices and to resort 
to terrorism.  Singling out communities and disproportionately addressing law enforcement 
measures against them entails the risk of collective alienation. States that have derogated 
from their human rights obligations on grounds of national emergency, or resorted to 
military responses in countering terrorism, have witnessed an erosion of institutional, 
procedural and substantive safeguards. The collective commitment of the international 
community to protect the rights of potential future victims of terrorism necessarily entails 
an equally resolute commitment to the principles of international human rights law in the 
conception and implementation of counter-terrorism strategies. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  </b>States&#8217; adjectival obligation to conduct an independent <b> 
and impartial investigation 
</b></p>
<p>33. Article 15 of the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism 
recognizes States&#8217; duty to investigate the facts of an alleged terrorist crime and, where 
appropriate, to prosecute or extradite the alleged perpetrator. With the increasingly 
transnational character of terrorist networks, there has been a corresponding evolution of 
cross-border cooperation and mutual legal assistance in the investigation and prosecution of 
terrorist suspects.  States are now obliged to cooperate with one another in transnational 
counter-terrorist investigations (including in the arrest and detention of suspects), in 
responding to requests for mutual legal assistance and in extraditing suspects and 
fugitives.49 These obligations, however, take effect subject to States&#8217; a priori international 
obligations to refuse such assistance where it would expose an individual to a real risk of 
torture or inhuman or degrading treatment50 or to a &#8220;flagrant denial of justice.&#8221;51

Intelligence Officers and Service Personnel on the Detention and Interviewing of Detainees Overseas, 
and on the Passing and Receipt of Intelligence Relating to Detainees&#8221; (United Kingdom, July 2010). 
This Guidance was considered by the Administrative Court of the High Court of Justice of England 
and Wales in <i>Equality and Human Rights Commission v Prime Minister &amp; Ors</i> [2011] EWHC 2401 
(Admin) (3 October 2011), which held that cooperation with the interrogation of a suspect by another 
State would always be unlawful when &#8220;hooding&#8221; is used. 
</p>
<p> 51 See ECHR, <i>Othman (Abu Qatada) v. The United Kingdom</i>, no. 8139/09. </p>


<p>34. Regional courts have made the point that prosecution or extradition of individuals 
alleged to be responsible for unlawful killings serves as a measure of prevention.52 In this 
way, the State&#8217;s duty to investigate and prosecute terrorist suspects is directly linked to its 
obligation to end impunity and prevent future acts of terrorism. Individuals suspected, on 
objectively reasonable grounds, of having engaged in the incitement, preparation, 
instigation or commission of terrorist acts should be duly investigated and, if appropriate, 
prosecuted, convicted and punished according to the ordinary rules of criminal law and 
procedure,53 or else extradited to another State to face trial.  This implies, in either event, 
that the eventual trial of a person accused of involvement in an act of terrorism will meet 
international standards for a fair and public hearing before an independent and impartial 
civilian court. A public court hearing provides visible justice to the victims and their 
families. In contrast, indefinite or secret detention of terrorist suspects, without charge or 
trial, is not only contrary to international law54 but also precludes the possibility of victim 
participation in the process of bringing offenders to justice.  
</p>
<p>35.  The Special Rapporteur concurs with the view of the European Court of Human 
Rights that the State&#8217;s obligation to protect life requires an effective official investigation 
</p>
<p>whenever individuals have been killed or sustained life-threatening injuries through the use 
of lethal or potentially lethal force in a terrorist context, whether from an unlawful act of 
terrorism committed by a non-State actor, or from the acts or omissions of public officials 
in the implementation of counter-terrorism strategies.55 
</p>
<p>36. In its evolving jurisprudence, the European Court of Human Rights has established a 
number of criteria to assess the effectiveness of such an investigation, which may be 
discharged by an inquest, a public inquiry, an independent investigation or a combination 
of mechanisms. The State&#8217;s obligation cannot however be discharged merely through the 
availability of a civil remedy at the initiative of the victim or his/her next-of-kin. In the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the following minimum requirements must be satisfied in every 
case: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Once the matter has come to the attention of the authorities, they must act ex officio 
and not wait for a formal complaint lodged by the deceased's next of kin.56 This 
applies not only to deaths resulting from a lethal terrorist act, but also to deaths 
caused by State officials during a counter-terrorist operation, and cases where it is 
plausibly alleged that public officials have culpably failed in the responsibility to 
take preventive measures to avert an act of terrorism.   
</p>
<p>&#8226; The investigation should always begin promptly. A timely investigation is more 
likely to secure reliable evidence. While there may be obstacles delaying progress in 
an investigation, it must be carried out with reasonable expedition.57 
</p>

 54 Even where States have entered formal derogations, in international or regional human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments on grounds of national emergency, measures of detention must nevertheless be 
exceptional and temporary in nature and the extent of the derogation must, in all respects, meet the 
standards of proportionality and non-discrimination; see for example ECHR, <i>A and others v. The 
United Kingdom</i>, no. 3455/05.

<p>&#8226; In all cases, once an investigation has been opened, the authorities must ensure that 
the next-of-kin are kept fully informed of its progress, and are provided with an 
adequate opportunity to participate. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The investigation must be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of 
those responsible. The principle of accountability extends to situations in which it is 
alleged that public officials have caused death or life-threatening injury through the 
negligent use of lethal force, or have negligently failed to prevent a terrorist act. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In cases where State responsibility is at issue the investigative authorities must be 
wholly independent from those potentially implicated,58 which implies not only a 
lack of hierarchical or institutional connection but also a practical independence.59 
Those potentially implicated should have no supervisory role, whether direct or 
indirect, over those conducting the investigation.60 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation and its 
results to secure public accountability. This is essential to maintaining public 
confidence in the authorities&#8217; adherence to the rule of law, and prevents any 
</p>
<p>appearance of collusion in, or tolerance of, unlawful acts or omissions.61 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The authorities must have taken reasonable steps to secure and evaluate all 
potentially relevant evidence. Investigators should commission the necessary 
forensic and post-mortem reports, providing a complete and objective account of the 
scientific findings; record all potentially relevant evidential sources; conduct site 
visits; and identify, question and take comprehensive written statements from all 
relevant witnesses.62 Any conclusions must be based on a complete, objective and 
impartial analysis of the evidence, including an examination of the authorities&#8217; own 
actions.63  
</p>
<p>&#8226; In all cases, investigators must be genuinely impartial and must not harbour 
preconceptions about the matter they are investigating or the identity of those 
responsible for any fatalities. Nor should they approach the investigation in a way 
that might promote or protect the interests of any public official who may be at 
fault.64 They should be demonstrably free of undue influence.65 
</p>
<p>&#8226; If the investigation leads to criminal or other judicial proceedings, there must be a 
possibility for the effective participation of the next-of-kin.66 
</p>
<p>37. The victim or the victim's family must in all cases be provided with the information 
necessary to exercise any rights they may have in domestic law to participate in criminal 
proceedings against the suspected perpetrator. All States should establish a support service 
to assist victims of terrorism throughout the process, until the conclusion of any ordinary

<p>avenues of appeal. Professionals should brief victims or their next-of-kin as to their rights, 
and direct them to institutions where they can obtain the required assistance.67   
</p>
<p>38. Depending on the specificities of the domestic criminal justice system, victims may 
have standing to intervene in criminal proceedings. In some States, victim participation 
may take the form of replacing the prosecutor, or providing assistance to the prosecution. In 
others, victims may be allowed to participate as a third party. In yet other States, they are 
permitted to submit &#8220;victim impact statements,&#8221; describing the effect of the alleged crime 
and/or presenting their concerns independently of the prosecution.68 
</p>
<p>39. Generally, rights of victim participation are more extensively recognized in 
inquisitorial systems than in adversarial systems.69 Any prosecution for terrorist-related 
crime, however, involves a triangulation of interests between the accused, the victim and 
the prosecutor. Making due allowance for the differences in national systems, the Special 
Rapporteur strongly recommends that States which currently have no possibility for a 
victim of terrorism, or his/her next-of-kin, to participate in criminal proceedings against the 
perpetrator (other than as witnesses of fact) should give serious and urgent consideration to 
implementing one or more of the initiatives described above.70 The Special Rapporteur 
considers the formal recognition of victims of terrorism in criminal proceedings to be an 
important part of recognizing the humanity of the victims, thereby publicly reinforcing the 
human costs of terrorism.    
</p>
<p>40. In addition to the requirement for a State-funded support service, legal aid or 
assistance is often indispensable for ensuring that any victim, regardless of financial means, 
can participate effectively in any judicial proceedings.71  Where the victim group consists of 
a large number of individuals, provision should be made, where appropriate, for their joint 
representation by one legal professional or association. Victims and their families should 
also have the right to free interpretation in a language they understand, irrespective of their 
role in the proceedings.72 
</p>
<p>41. Where the victims or next-of-kin reside in a State other than the State in which the 
alleged offenders are prosecuted, the prosecuting State must make effective provision for 
remote participation. The State in which the victim resides may also have obligations in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>42. In order to avoid secondary victimization, States must ensure a victim-sensitive 
criminal justice procedure. Where victims of terrorism have given information to the 
authorities, or are called upon to provide testimony during a prosecution, their rights to life, 
physical security and privacy may be in danger.73 States must &#8220;organise their criminal 
proceedings in such a way that those interests are not unjustifiably imperilled,&#8221;74 subject 
always to the need to put safeguards in place to ensure that any protective measures are 
compatible with the accused person's right to a fair and public hearing under article 14 of 
</p>

<p>the Covenant.75 States should therefore ensure that they have the means available to protect 
informants and witnesses through the adoption of suitably tailored protective measures.  
Such measures are not only a part of the State's positive obligations towards the witness, 
they are also indispensable in encouraging witnesses to come forward in the first place. 
</p>
<p>43.  Criminal proceedings, including any ordinary appeal procedures, should be 
conducted with reasonable expedition, as required by article 14 of the Covenant. Not only 
does this guarantee the right of the accused to a trial within a reasonable time, it also avoids 
prolonging the agony of uncertainty for the victim or his/her next-of-kin. 
</p>
<p>44.  Where, following an investigation into an act of terrorism, a criminal prosecution is 
not initiated the competent prosecuting authority must give reasons for its decision.76 States 
should allow victims to challenge any such decision before an independent court or tribunal 
or other comparable authority.77 
</p>
<p>45. The right of victims of terrorism to privacy and respect for their family life should 
be protected against unjustified intrusion. In some circumstances, victims and their families 
may need to be protected against over-exposure to the media.78 Medical and other personal 
information may also need to be protected from unnecessary disclosure to the public in the 
course of criminal proceedings.79 
</p>
<p><b> C.  The right of victims of terrorism to form representative organizations 
</b></p>
<p>46.  Non-governmental organizations have been established in a number of countries 
with the aim of promoting the interests of victims of terrorism.80 Such organizations 
perform a vital role in ensuring that the needs of the victims are properly understood and 
communicated. They are to be applauded for their efforts in advocating the cause of the 
victim by helping to personalize and convey the human tragedies that terrorism inflicts.   
</p>
<p>47.  Organizations representing victims of terrorism enjoy the rights to freedom of 
association and expression under articles 19 and 22 of the Covenant, including the right to 
articulate criticism of public authorities. Any State interference with the unfettered exercise 
of those rights (including requirements for official registration) must be prescribed by law, 
pursue a legitimate public interest, and be strictly proportionate in scope.81 Such 
organizations should have unimpeded access to an independent and impartial court or 
tribunal with power to overturn the restriction. 
</p>
<p>48.  States must also secure the rights of organizations representing victims of terrorism 
against unlawful interference by non-State actors.82 Where necessary, such organizations 
must be afforded effective measures of protection against the risk of reprisals from the 
perpetrators of acts of terrorism, or their supporters, as well as against any attempt, from 
any quarter, to intimidate or silence them.

<p><b> D.  </b>States&#8217; responsibility to provide reparation to victims of terrorism<b> 
</b></p>
<p>49. The principle of State responsibility is at the core of the right to reparation. As long 
ago as 1927, the Permanent Court of International Justice affirmed that any act or omission 
by a public official, qualifying as an unlawful act under public international law, gives rise 
to international responsibility, and imposes on the State a corresponding international law 
duty of reparation.83

<p>50. The emergence of human rights in international law altered the traditional concept of 
State responsibility. International human rights law regulates relations between States and 
the human beings under their jurisdiction, making individuals the subject of international 
law, and direct beneficiaries of legally enforceable human rights. The official commentaries 
on the articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, adopted by the 
International Law Commission in 2001, note that in relation to a breach of a human rights 
treaty, the individual should be regarded as the ultimate beneficiary of the relevant rights.84 
This obligation, which exists as a matter of public international law, is reflected in specific 
&#8220;just satisfaction&#8221; provisions of the principal international and regional human rights 
</p>
<p>treaties. 
</p>
<p>51. The United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and 
Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious 
Violations of International Humanitarian Law states that full and effective reparation 
should include, as appropriate, restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and 
guarantees of non-repetition.85<b> 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Restitution</b> consists of measures re-establishing the situation of the victim prior to 
the violation. Restitution of the status quo ante is, however, rarely possible in the 
present context, since acts of terrorism, by their very nature, often have irreversible 
consequences. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Compensation</b>, or indemnity, is a specific form of reparation providing just 
satisfaction (monetary awards for pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss resulting from 
the violation, together with costs for legal and other expenses reasonably incurred). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Measures of <b>rehabilitation</b> include medical and psychological care, as well as other 
social services. Acts of terrorism leave deep scars on the survivors as well as the 
relatives of those who have died, eyewitnesses and members of the intervening 
rescue services.   
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Satisfaction</b> is a non-financial form of reparation that includes, inter alia, full and 
public verification of the facts, and formal acceptance of any State responsibility. 
Satisfaction can play an important role in achieving reparation in those cases where 
public officials have caused or contributed to a death through culpable acts or 
omissions. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Guarantees of non-repetition</b> or non-recurrence include the investigative 
obligation to take all reasonable steps to identify system failures and human errors, 
and the obligation to reform laws and administrative practices that may have caused 
or contributed to the opportunity for an act of terrorism to be committed.   
</p>

 83 See Permanent Court of International Justice, Factory at Chorz&#243;w (<i>Germany v. Poland</i>), 26 July 
</p>

</p>
<p>judgement of 27 November 1998, para. 85. </p>


<p>52. Where a public official is directly or indirectly responsible for a violation of the 
right to life or physical integrity, on the principles of either the positive or negative 
obligation to respect the relevant rights, the position is straightforward. On orthodox 
principles of State responsibility, the State is obliged to make reparation to the victim in 
one or more of the forms identified in the preceding paragraph, suitably tailored to the 
circumstances.   
</p>
<p>53.  The Special Rapporteur considers that the same principle should apply to <i>all victims 
of terrorism or their next-of-kin, without distinction</i>. As emphasized in paragraphs 11 and 
following above, it must now be recognized that a death or serious injury resulting from an 
act of terrorism amounts to an interference with the rights to life and/or physical security, 
whether or not the acts or omissions of a public official caused or contributed to the death. 
Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur urges States to voluntarily accept a binding 
international obligation to provide reparation to the victims of all acts of terrorism 
occurring on their territory in which a natural person has been killed or has suffered serious 
physical or psychological harm irrespective of the nationality of the perpetrator or the 
victim, and thereby to fill an existing protection gap. 
</p>
<p>54. There are sound reasons of principle in favour of recognizing that States should now 
accept a special obligation to victims of terrorism. It is inherent in the nature of terrorism 
that it involves the use or threat of force aimed at influencing a State or group of States or 
an international organization.86  The Special Rapporteur concurs with description put 
forward by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) of victims of 
terrorism as human beings who have made an involuntary sacrifice &#8220;on behalf of the 
State.&#8221;87  There is almost always a direct or indirect motivational connection (however 
misguided) between acts of terrorism and policies of state. A terrorist killing is thus 
different in character from a purely private murder.   
</p>
<p>55. There are additional practical reasons for adopting the approach advocated in this 
report. Where bystanders or hostages are killed in the course of counter-terrorism 
operations, it may be impossible to determine whether the acts of a public official were both 
causative and culpable. Similarly, the determination of State responsibility for an alleged 
failure to take positive operational steps to prevent an act of terrorism can be fraught with 
evidential difficulties. If the approach advocated by the Special Rapporteur is followed, 
States will be under an obligation to provide reparation without imposing an additional 
burden on the victims or their next-of-kin to prove conclusively that public officials were at 
fault. 
</p>
<p>56.   Perhaps the most fundamental point is that the direct perpetrator of a terrorist act is 
unlikely ever to be in a position to compensate the victims. The perpetrator will usually 
have been sentenced to a long term of imprisonment (if they have not been killed or evaded 
capture). A victim-centred approach does not permit reliance on an indigent, deceased or 
untraceable individual to provide reparation for death or serious injury.   
</p>
<p>57. Many States have voluntarily accepted an international law obligation to establish 
schemes to provide State-funded compensation to the victims of all crimes of violence 
resulting in death or serious physical or psychological injury.88 Such schemes already make 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 86 See A/HRC/16/51, para. 28, practice 7, para. 2. 
 87 UNODC, <i>The Criminal Justice Response to Support Victims of Acts of Terrorism</i> (New York, 2011). 
 88 See Council of Europe, Committee of Ministers Guidelines on the Protection of Victims of Terrorist 
</p>
<p>Acts; see also European Convention on the Compensation of Victims of Violent Crimes (1983), art. 3, 
which imposes an obligation on States to compensate the victims of violent crimes resulting in bodily 
injury or death, where the offence was committed on the territory of the State concerned, regardless of 
the nationality of the victim. The Convention entered into force on 1 February 1988; as at 30 April 
2012, 25 European States had ratified the Convention and implemented its provisions. </p>


<p>provision for the payment of State-funded compensation to the human victims of terrorism. 
The Special Rapporteur recommends that all States now accept an obligation to establish 
such a scheme for the victims of terrorism.  In the context of transitional justice, broader 
reparation programmes have been established to provide additional forms of reparation for 
gross and systematic human rights violations committed in conflict situations.89 The Special 
Rapporteur believes that such schemes provide an appropriate model for affording full 
reparation to the victims of terrorism, particularly where large scale or repeated terrorist 
acts have resulted in large numbers of victims. Several States have adopted a model for 
compensating victims of terrorism that closely resembles existing compensation schemes 
for military and civilian victims of war. Such programmes are specifically tailored to meet 
the needs of the victims and designed in a manner that encourages their participation.90 
</p>
<p>58.  While the primary responsibility for compensating the victims of terrorism rests on 
the State, dependants of deceased victims are sometimes able to make claims under a life 
insurance policy. However, such claims have often been refused under policy exclusions 
for deaths resulting from an act of terrorism. States should actively consider whether to 
legislate to prohibit the sale or marketing of life insurance policies that contain such an 
exclusion.91   
</p>
<p>59.  In the report on his mission to Turkey, the previous mandate holder commended the 
Act on Compensation for Victims of Terrorism (A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, paras. 40, 44, 92 (a) 
and (b)). During his visit to the United States, he underlined the importance of addressing 
the situation of victims of terrorism with appropriate compensation and access to health 
care and rehabilitation (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, para. 43), and during his visit to Peru, he 
welcomed the reparations plan established under Law No. 28592 (A/HRC/16/51/Add.3, 
para. 7).  
</p>
<p>60.  The Special Rapporteur commends the legislation recently adopted in Spain as a 
model for the recognition of the rights of victims of terrorism in a single normative 
framework. Under Law No. 29/2011 on the Recognition and Integral Protection of the 
Victims of Acts of Terrorism, Spain has enacted a unified scheme setting out the assistance, 
support and protection to which victims of terrorism are entitled. The Law expressly 
recognizes all victims of terrorism as being victims of human rights violations, irrespective 
of questions of State responsibility.  
</p>
<p>61. The contemporary recognition that acts of terrorism involve grave human rights 
violations; the State's duty to protect and secure the right to life; the emerging international 
consensus in favour of a victim-centred approach; the absence of any alternative source of 
compensation or reparation; and the inexorable connection between the misguided 
motivation of the terrorist and the policies of the State that is the terrorists&#8217; ultimate target, 
together provide a sound rationale for recognizing an obligation on the State to provide 
compensation and reparation to the victims of all acts of terrorism occurring on their 
territory, without imposing on the victims the added burden of proving State 
responsibility.92   
</p>
<p>62. The previous mandate holder identified an obligation on States to provide victims of 
terrorism with &#8220;legal, medical, psychological and other assistance required for their social 
</p>

<p>rehabilitation&#8221; (A/HRC/16/51, para. 25). The Special Rapporteur adopts this 
recommendation. To promote prompt and effective action at the United Nations level, the 
recommendations in the present report are restricted to the obligations owed by States to 
natural persons who have suffered death or serious injury or to their next-of-kin. The 
distribution of financial responsibility for compensating the purely commercial interests of 
legal persons and the provision of compensation for damage to property raise complex 
questions of social policy and insurance where national practices vary widely. These 
differences should not be allowed to obscure or delay effective international action to 
protect the human victims of terrorism through the adoption of a single normative scheme 
declaring and protecting their rights.  Furthermore, in recognition of the special status of 
victims of terrorism, the Special Rapporteur recommends that States establish reparation 
programmes that are independent of any remedies available for alleged violations of the 
rights of persons suspected or accused of involvement in acts of terrorism. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> The Special Rapporteur considers that the victims of terrorism share certain 
common characteristics which distinguish them from the victims of other crimes of 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence. Those shared characteristics call for international recognition through a 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific normative framework developed under the auspices of the United Nations. 
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> The Special Rapporteur considers deliberate infliction of lethal or potentially 
lethal violence by non-State actors in the course of an act of terrorism amounts, in all 
</b></p>
<p><b>cases where death or serious physical or psychological injury results, to a grave 
</b></p>
<p><b>violation of the human rights of the victim, irrespective of the question of direct or 
</b></p>
<p><b>indirect State responsibility. He notes, however, that acceptance of this principle is not 
</b></p>
<p><b>essential for acceptance of the recommendations made in this report.  
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> The following persons are to be considered as victims of terrorism: (a) natural 
persons who have been killed or suffered serious physical or psychological injury 
</b></p>
<p><b>through the commission of an act of terrorism (direct victims); (b) the next-of-kin or 
</b></p>
<p><b>dependants of a direct victim (secondary victims); (c) innocent individuals who have 
</b></p>
<p><b>been killed or suffered serious injury indirectly attributable to an act of terrorism 
</b></p>
<p><b>(indirect victims); and (d) potential future victims of terrorism. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that States take effective international 
action to protect the human victims of terrorism through the adoption of a specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>normative framework declaring and protecting their rights. The international 
</b></p>
<p><b>community, acting under the auspices of the United Nations, should therefore take 
</b></p>
<p><b>steps towards enshrining the human rights set out in this report and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>corresponding obligations on States in a specific international instrument. 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> Pending the adoption of such an instrument, States should review their national 
legislation, procedures and practice and make all necessary amendments to bring 
</b></p>
<p><b>them into line with the following Framework principles for securing the human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>of victims of terrorism: </b></p>
<p><b>(a) </b>The State&#8217;s obligation to protect and secure the right to life includes the 
</p>
<p><b>duty to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of individuals within its </b></p>


<p><b>jurisdiction.  Consequently, (i) the State has a duty under international law to put in 
</b></p>
<p><b>place effective criminal law provisions to deter the incitement, preparation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>commission of terrorist offences, supported by law-enforcement machinery for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevention, suppression and sanctioning of breaches; (ii) relevant public officials come 
</b></p>
<p><b>under a positive operational duty to take preventative action where they know, or 
</b></p>
<p><b>ought to know, of the existence, at the relevant time, of a real and immediate risk to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the life of an identified individual or group of individuals, and yet fail to take 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures, within the scope of their legal powers and available resources, and in 
</b></p>
<p><b>conformity with the State's international obligations, which judged reasonably, might 
</b></p>
<p><b>be expected to avoid that risk. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Individuals suspected of having engaged in the incitement, preparation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>instigation or commission of acts of terrorism should be duly investigated, and if 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate, prosecuted, convicted and punished, according to the ordinary rules of 
</b></p>
<p><b>criminal law and procedure, or else extradited to face trial in another jurisdiction.  
</b></p>
<p><b>This implies a fair and public hearing before an independent and impartial civilian 
</b></p>
<p><b>court. States are under a duty to provide mutual legal assistance in the investigation 
</b></p>
<p><b>and prosecution of terrorist offences and to cooperate, as far as they consider 
</b></p>
<p><b>reasonable, in the exchange of intelligence with other States. These duties, however, 
</b></p>
<p><b>take effect subject to the a priori obligation of all States to refuse such assistance 
</b></p>
<p><b>where it would entail the commission of, complicity in, or any form of direct or 
</b></p>
<p><b>indirect assistance to, an internationally wrongful act, including any violation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The State is obliged to conduct an effective official investigation 
</b></p>
<p><b>whenever individuals have been killed or seriously injured as the direct or indirect 
</b></p>
<p><b>result of an act of terrorism, with a view to securing accountability and learning 
</b></p>
<p><b>lessons for the future.  The key features of such an investigation are that (i) the 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities must act ex officio; (ii) the investigation should always begin promptly and 
</b></p>
<p><b>be carried out with reasonable expedition;  (iii) the authorities must ensure that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>victim or his/her next-of-kin are kept fully informed of the progress of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigation, and are provided with an adequate opportunity to participate in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>process;  (iv) investigators must be genuinely impartial; (v) the investigation must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>capable of leading to the identification, accountability and, where appropriate, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>punishment of those responsible for any act or omission which has caused or 
</b></p>
<p><b>contributed to the death or serious physical or psychological injury of a victim of 
</b></p>
<p><b>terrorism, including any public official implicated in the events; (vi) there must be a 
</b></p>
<p><b>sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation and its results to secure 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability; (vii) the authorities must have taken all reasonable steps to secure the 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant evidence; and (viii) any conclusions must be based on a complete, objective 
</b></p>
<p><b>and impartial analysis of all relevant elements, including an examination of the 
</b></p>
<p>authorities&#8217; own actions. Where State responsibility is <b>at issue the investigative 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities must be independent from those potentially implicated.   
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Making due allowance for the differences in national systems, the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur strongly recommends that States which currently have no possibility for a 
</b></p>
<p><b>victim of terrorism or his/her next-of-kin to play an active part in criminal 
</b></p>
<p><b>proceedings (other than as witnesses of fact) should give serious and urgent 
</b></p>
<p><b>consideration to implementing a system for effective victim participation.   
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) The victim or the victim's family must in all cases be provided with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>information necessary to exercise any rights they may have in domestic law to 
</b></p>
<p><b>participate in judicial proceedings. In this connection, (i) States should establish a 
</b></p>
<p><b>support service to assist the victim in the process; (ii) legal aid or assistance should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>accorded so as to ensure that victims can participate effectively; (iii) provision should </b></p>


<p><b>be made, where appropriate, for joint legal presentation; (iv) victims and their 
</b></p>
<p><b>families should enjoy the right to free interpretation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Where a decision is taken not to initiate a criminal prosecution the 
</b></p>
<p><b>competent prosecuting authority should give reasons for its decision, and States should 
</b></p>
<p><b>allow victims of terrorism the opportunity to challenge the decision before an 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent court or tribunal, or other comparable authority. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Where victims of terrorism have given information to the authorities, or 
</b></p>
<p><b>are called upon to provide testimony during a prosecution, their rights to life, physical 
</b></p>
<p><b>security and privacy must be fully protected, subject to safeguards to ensure that any 
</b></p>
<p><b>protective measures adopted are compatible with the accused person's right to a fair 
</b></p>
<p><b>and public hearing under article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Criminal proceedings, including the exhaustion of any ordinary appeal 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures, should be conducted with reasonable expedition. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) The right of victims of terrorism to privacy and respect for their family 
</b></p>
<p><b>life should be protected against unjustified intrusion by the media. Personal 
</b></p>
<p><b>information must also be protected against unnecessary disclosure to the public in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>course of judicial proceedings. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Victims of terrorism have the right to form representative organizations 
</b></p>
<p><b>whose rights to freedom of association and expression must be fully guaranteed.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Where any restriction is imposed, such organizations should have unimpeded access 
</b></p>
<p><b>to an independent and impartial court or tribunal with power to overturn the 
</b></p>
<p><b>restriction. In addition, States are under a positive duty to secure the rights of such 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations against reprisals or other forms of unlawful interference by non-State 
</b></p>
<p><b>actors.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Where a public official is directly or indirectly responsible for a violation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the right to life in the context of an act or threatened act of terrorism, the State is 
</b></p>
<p><b>already bound as a matter of international law to make reparation to the victim. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) The Special Rapporteur urges <i>all </i>States to recognize an international 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligation (already recognized by many States) to provide reparation where death or 
</b></p>
<p><b>serious injury results from an act of terrorism committed on their territory. Full and 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective reparation should include, as appropriate, restitution, compensation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition. Reparation schemes 
</b></p>
<p><b>should make provision for financial compensation and a considered programme of 
</b></p>
<p><b>medical and social rehabilitation.   
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) States should actively consider whether to legislate to prohibit the sale or 
</b></p>
<p><b>marketing of life insurance policies that contain a exclusion for deaths resulting from 
</b></p>
<p><b>acts of terrorism.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) The Special Rapporteur urges States involved in unresolved conflicts in 
</b></p>
<p><b>which one or more parties to the conflict are designated as a terrorist organization, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and where acts of violence are committed against the civilian population, to make 
</b></p>
<p><b>greater use of the United Nations mechanisms for conflict prevention, negotiation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>mediation, conciliation, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Counter-Terrorism 
Implementation Task Force (CTITF) commission empirical research into the question 
</b></p>
<p><b>of whether and to what extent economic, social, political and educational exclusion 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be recognized by the General Assembly as conditions conducive to the spread </b></p>


<p><b>of terrorism, with a view to tacking such problems as part of an integrated counter-
</b></p>
<p><b>terrorism strategy. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>This report should be brought to the attention of the General Assembly for the 
purposes of its upcoming review of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism 
</b></p>
<p><b>Strategy on 28 and 29 June 2012.
