<p><b>  24</b>/&#8230;  <b>Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that no one 
shall be held in slavery or servitude and that slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited 
in all their forms, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>the Slavery Convention of 1926, the Supplementary Convention on the 
Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery of 
1956 and the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), of the International Labour 
Organization, as well as other relevant international instruments which prohibit all forms of 
slavery and call upon Governments to eradicate such practices, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action strongly 
condemned the fact that slavery and slavery-like practices still exist today in parts of the 
world and urged States to take immediate measures as a matter of priority to end such 
practices, which constitute flagrant violations of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>Human Rights Council resolutions 6/14 of 28 September 2007 and 15/2 
of 29 September 2010, 
</p>
<p><i>Condemning </i>contemporary forms of slavery, while acknowledging that it is a global 
issue that affects all continents and most countries of the world, and calling upon States to 
take appropriate measures as a matter of priority to end such practices, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>that the minimum estimate of the number of people subjected to 
contemporary forms of slavery is that of 21 million victims of forced labour worldwide, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that discrimination, social exclusion, gender inequality and poverty lie 
at the heart of contemporary forms of slavery as well as the particular vulnerability of 
migrant workers, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing the importance</i> of criminalizing all forms of slavery through national 
legislation, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the challenges to slavery eradication highlighted by the Special 
Rapporteur, including the absence of legislation in some countries, deficiencies and 
loopholes in legal frameworks, insufficiently dissuasive sanctions, a lack of will and/or 
resources for implementing law and policy measures, the difficulty in locating and 
identifying victims, and a lack of effective rehabilitation measures, </p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that broad international cooperation among States as well as between 
States and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations is essential for 
effectively countering contemporary forms of slavery, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the 
Council and 5/2 on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the 
Council of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her 
duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced </i>that the issue of contemporary forms of slavery continues to require the 
attention of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>

Slavery and its importance for addressing the issues raised by the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of slavery,

as all other issues covered previously by the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of

practice, respond effectively to reliable information on alleged human rights violations with 
a view to protecting the human rights of victims of slavery and preventing violations; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Recommend actions and measures applicable at the national, regional and 
international levels to eliminate slavery practices wherever they occur, including remedies 
that address the causes and consequences of contemporary forms of slavery, such as 
poverty, discrimination and conflict, as well as the existence of demand factors and relevant 
measures to strengthen international cooperation; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Focus principally on aspects of contemporary forms of slavery that are not 
covered by existing mandates of the Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur, in carrying out the mandate, to continue:

mandate and to include examples of effective practices as well as relevant 
recommendations; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To take account of the gender and age dimensions of contemporary forms of 
slavery; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur to compile and analyse examples of 
national legislation relating to the prohibition of slavery and slavery-like practices in order 
to assist States in their national efforts to combat contemporary forms of slavery; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Calls upon </i>all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special 
Rapporteur in the performance of the tasks and duties mandated, to supply all necessary 
information requested by the mandate holder and to give serious consideration to 
responding favourably to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s requests to visit their countries, so as to 
enable the mandate holder to fulfil the mandate effectively; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Encourages </i>the United Nations, including its specialized agencies, regional

and non-governmental organizations to cooperate to the fullest extent possible with the 
Special Rapporteur in the fulfilment of the mandate; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur to continue to cooperate fully and
