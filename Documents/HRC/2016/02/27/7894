</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 20/14,

the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in 
assisting the development of independent and effective national human rights institutions in 
accordance with the Paris Principles. It also welcomed the important role of the 
International Coordinating Committee, working in close cooperation with OHCHR, in 
assessing the conformity of national human rights institutions with the Paris Principles and 
in assisting governments and those institutions in capacity-building and strengthening. In 
resolution 20/14, the Council recognized the important role played by national human rights 
institutions in the Council, including in the universal periodic review and special 
procedures mechanisms, and in the treaty bodies, as well as the contributions of national 
institutions compliant with the Paris Principles to the work of the Commission on the Status 
of Women and the Conference of States Parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities and the Open-ended Working Group on Ageing.

regions. During the period under review, fellows from the national human rights institutions 
of India, Mauritania, Morocco, the Philippines, Qatar and South Africa participated in the

support in reviewing a number of Commission training modules, including a training 
manual for the Palestinian police, to be published jointly by OHCHR and the Commission 
in 2013. 
</p>
<p>60. On 14 and 15 January 2913, a conference on the theme &#8220;Strengthening the capacity 
of national institutions for the protection of human rights in the Arab region&#8221; was held in 
Doha. The event was jointly organized by the National Human Rights Committee of Qatar 
and OHCHR. The conference focused on supporting national human rights institutions 
when addressing current challenges in the region and strengthening their capacity to work 
in accordance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>61. In Lebanon, OHCHR took an active role in drafting a law on a national human rights 
institution, designated as a national preventive mechanism. The draft law was approved by 
the Administration and Justice Committee of Parliament in December 2012 and is pending 
adoption by the plenary.  
</p>
<p>62. OHCHR, UNAMI and UNDP provided training and support to the newly 
established national human rights institution of Iraq. 
</p>
<p>63. UNSMIL conducted induction training for the newly established human rights 
institution in Libya. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Support of the Office of the High Commissioner for regional and 
</b></p>
<p><b>subregional initiatives by national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1.  Americas and the Caribbean 
</b></p>
<p>64. In January 2012, OHCHR participated in the annual General Assembly of the 
Network of Americas National Human Rights Institutions. OHCHR reiterated the 
importance of a strong regional network of Paris Principles-compliant institutions, and 
shared experience and good practices of activities conducted by other regional networks of 
human rights institutions, in particular the capacity assessment project developed and 
implemented by OHCHR, UNDP and the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights 
Institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Africa 
</b></p>
<p>65. In May 2012, the OHCHR Central Africa regional office organized, in Bujumbura, 
the third meeting of national human rights institutions from the Central Africa subregion. 
Representatives of human rights institutions from nine countries participated in the 
meeting, which focused on capacity-building of institutions in the area of economic, social 
and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>66. In July 2012, the OHCHR East Africa regional office organized a training workshop 
on monitoring economic, social and cultural rights for the national human rights institutions 
of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania. The activity provided 
the institutions with relevant tools to fulfil their monitoring mandate. As a result, shortly </p>


<p>after the event, the national institution of the United Republic of Tanzania submitted a 
report to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Asia and the Pacific 
</b></p>
<p>67. During the period under review, OHCHR, the Asia Pacific Forum of National 
Human Rights Institutions and the Pacific Islands Forum secretariat continued to work in 
partnership to support the establishment of national human rights institutions. Such efforts 
included advocacy with a range of actors and continued technical assistance. As a result of 
the universal periodic review, most States in the Pacific have accepted recommendations to 
establish a national human rights institution compliant with the Paris Principles. Samoa has 
prepared draft legislation to that end. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Europe and Central Asia 
</b></p>
<p>68. In 2012, OHCHR provided technical and financial assistance for the establishment 
of a permanent secretariat of the European Group of National Human Rights Institutions. In 
April, a one-year grant agreement was signed between OHCHR and the Chairperson of the 
European Group aimed at supporting the establishment and the initial activities of the 
secretariat.  
</p>
<p>69. In April 2012, the OHCHR regional office for Central Asia organized a regional 
workshop on the United Nations human rights system. Participants included State officials 
and representatives of Ombudsman institutions and civil society from Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The meeting raised awareness on the issues of the timely 
submission of reports, human rights indicators and the implementation of recommendations 
received from the United Nations human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Contribution of the Office of the High Commissioner to international 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiatives supporting national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. International Conference of National Human Rights Institutions 
</b></p>
<p>70. The eleventh International Conference of National Human Rights Institutions was 
held in Amman from 5 to 7 November 2012. The Conference was hosted by the Jordan 
National Centre for Human Rights and co-organized by OHCHR and the International 
Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights. The overall theme of the Conference was &#8220;The human rights of women and 
girls, gender equality: the role of national human rights institutions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>71. OHCHR provided financial support for the participation of national human rights 
institutions from the least developed States and international experts. The Conference was 
attended by 260 participants, including representatives of national human rights institutions, 
local and international non-governmental organizations, intergovernmental organizations, 
United Nations agencies and experts. The Conference adopted the Amman Declaration and 
Plan of Action.1

<p><b> 2. Bureau meetings 
</b></p>
<p>72. OHCHR provided secretarial and technical support for two statutory Bureau 
meetings of the International Coordinating Committee, held in Geneva on 19 and 20 March 
2012, and in Amman on 4 November 2012. The Bureau members discussed their strategic 
priorities, including the engagement of national human rights institutions in the 
international human rights system. They endorsed the report of the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation of March 2012, and amended the statute of the International Coordinating 
Committee to include exceptional circumstances leading to immediate special review of 
accredited institutions.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Subcommittee on Accreditation 
</b></p>
<p>73. OHCHR provided secretarial support for the sessions of the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation, held in Geneva in March and November 2012.  
</p>
<p><b> 4.  National human rights institutions in Portuguese-speaking countries  
</b></p>
<p>74. In October 2012, in Cape Verde, OHCHR, in collaboration with the Ombudsman, 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Parliament of Portugal, and the Ministry of Justice 
of Cape Verde, organized a workshop for Portuguese-speaking countries on national human 
rights institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles. Representatives from Angola, 
Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao Tome and Principe and 
Timor-Leste participated in the meeting, and adopted the Praia declaration which called on 
States to establish national human rights institutions, and encouraged such institutions to 
seek accreditation or re-accreditation with the International Coordinating Committee.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. National human rights institutions and discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>75. OHCHR organized a seminar for national human rights institutions to validate a 
draft OHCHR publication on national mechanisms for protection against and the 
elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. The 
publication is aimed at providing States, national human rights institutions, equality bodies, 
other similar mechanisms and relevant stakeholders with a tool to implement the 
commitments made at the World Conferences held in Durban in 2001 and Geneva in 2009, 
and in particular to establish institutions or to strengthen the capacity of existing national 
mechanisms to handle discrimination issues.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Cooperation between United Nations human rights 
mechanisms and national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>76. The cooperation of national human rights institutions with international and regional 
human rights mechanisms is a key requirement of the Paris Principles. OHCHR, in 
coordination with the International Coordinating Committee and its Geneva representative, 
continued to support the engagement of such institutions with the Human Rights Council 
mechanisms. In June 2011, the General Assembly, in its resolution 65/281, adopted the 
outcome of the review of the work and functioning of the Human Right Council, which 
included provisions on the participation in and interaction with the universal periodic 
review of A-status national human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p>77. In 2012, national human rights institutions were active before and during the 
sessions of the Human Rights Council: delivering statements, submitting written </p>


<p>documentation, participating in general debates and under specific agenda items, organizing 
parallel events and interacting with the special procedures. A total of 30 institutions 
participated in the sessions of the Council sessions (see annex I), a significant increase over 
the 21 institutions that participated in 2011.  
</p>
<p>78. At the nineteenth session of the Human Rights Council, a new cost-effective practice 
was introduced: three video statements were delivered by national human rights institutions 
following the presentation of reports by special procedures mandate holders. Two video 
statements were made at the twentieth session and eight at the twenty-first.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>79. The second cycle of the universal periodic review started with the thirteenth session 
of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, held in May and June 2102. A 
separate section in the stakeholders&#8217; report was included to reflect contributions by A-status 
national human rights institutions.  
</p>
<p>80. In 2012, there was a 40 per cent increase over the same period in the first cycle in 
the number of written contributions from A-status national human rights institutions for the 
stakeholders&#8217; report submitted for the universal periodic review. A total of 17 A-status and 
two B-status institutions submitted such contributions. 
</p>
<p>81. In 2012, eight A-status national human rights institutions delivered a statement 
immediately after the State under review with regard to the adoption of the outcome at a 
plenary meeting of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Special procedures  
</b></p>
<p>82. During the general debates at the sessions of the Human Rights Council, a number of 
national human rights institutions interacted with special procedures mechanisms and 
submitted written contributions on reports written by them. 
</p>
<p>83. OHCHR regularly provides special procedures mandate holders with information on 
the work of national human rights institutions in the preparation of their country missions. 
Increasingly, mandate holders seek the assistance of such institutions in ensuring that their 
recommendations are implemented at the national level.  
</p>
<p>84. In her report submitted to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-second session, 
the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders focused on the role of 
national human rights institutions as human rights defenders (A/HRC/22/47). 
</p>
<p>85. During the period under review, a representative of the South African Human Rights 
Commission participated as a panellist in a discussion on engagement with special 
procedures mechanisms organized on the occasion of Human Rights Day at the University 
of Pretoria, in South Africa. 
</p>
<p>86. OHCHR supported special procedures mandate holders in issuing communications 
relating to national human rights institutions under threat, focusing on the former 
chairpersons Human Rights Commissions of Malawi and Togo. 
</p>
<p>87. OHCHR supported the national human rights institution of Mauritania in conducting 
a workshop on the development of a road map to implement the recommendations of the 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and 
consequences. </p>


<p><b> B. Treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>88.  OHCHR continued to support the participation of national human rights institutions 
in the sessions of the treaty bodies. The secretariats of the treaty bodies, the National 
Institutions and Regional Mechanisms Section and the Geneva representative of the 
International Coordinating Committee liaised with national human rights institutions prior 
to each session to encourage them to provide written or oral information and to attend the 
sessions. OHCHR also prepared briefings on institutions for the attention of treaty bodies, 
and disseminated relevant recommendations and concluding observations to the institutions 
concerned. 
</p>
<p>89. In 2012, human rights treaty bodies examined national human rights institutions in 
80 of 127 States. Of the 80, 49 interacted with treaty bodies by submitting reports, briefing 
the treaty bodies prior to the review or attending the sessions.2 There was a 10 per cent 
increase in the participation of national human rights institutions in three years: in 2009, of 
69 countries with such institutions 36 engaged with treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>90. Treaty bodies have been providing national human rights institutions with advice 
and tools to facilitate their effective engagement, including by issuing general comments, 
information notes and statements, as well as by inviting the institutions to their meetings. 
Three treaty bodies (the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child) have adopted general comments on national human rights institutions, 
one (the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination) has amended its rules of 
procedure to allow A-status institutions to address the Committee in plenary session, and 
six (the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the 
Committee against Torture, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) have included in their working methods a 
section on the participation of national human rights institutions in their activities.  
</p>
<p>91. At its 106th session, held in October and November 2012, the Human Rights 
Committee adopted a paper on the relationship of the Committee with national human 
rights institutions.3 In the paper, the Committee recognized the important role that the 
institutions, particularly those in full compliance with the Paris Principles, play in bridging 
the gap between international and national human rights systems, and provided them with 
guidelines on the reporting procedure, the individual communication procedure under the 
Optional Protocol and drafting and use of the Committee&#8217;s general comments.  
</p>
<p>92. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, at its eighth session, held 
in October and November 2012, adopted a briefing note on the participation of national 
human rights institutions in the Committee&#8217;s work. 
</p>
<p>93. National human rights institutions engage with treaty bodies in following up on the 
implementation of their concluding observations. In 2012, the institutions of Armenia, 
Ireland, Norway and Poland provided the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination with information on the implementation of specific recommendations under 
the Committee&#8217;s follow-up procedure. 
</p>
<p>  
 2  Does not include the upcoming sessions of certain treaty bodies, such as the 82nd session of the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (11 February &#8211; 1 March 2013), the 107th 
session of the Human Rights Committee (11 &#8211; 28 February 2013) and the 54th session of the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (11 February &#8211; 1 March 2013).  
</p>
<p> 3  CCPR/C/106/3. </p>


<p>94. In October 2012, OHCHR organized a seminar in Lusaka to promote the 
implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Ten national 
human rights institutions from Southern Africa participated and adopted a declaration for 
the implementation of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>95. In April, the Mongolian National Human Rights Commission hosted a national 
seminar in Ulaanbaatar to encourage ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture and to facilitate discussions among institutions designated as a national 
preventive mechanism under the Protocol. A member of the Subcommittee for the 
Prevention of Torture and an expert on national preventive mechanisms from the OHCHR 
Central Asia regional office were invited as resource persons. The seminar was organized 
in partnership with the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions, the 
Association for the Prevention of Torture and Amnesty International Mongolia.  
</p>
<p>96. The European Group of National Human Rights Institutions submitted a written 
contribution to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on 
access to justice. 
</p>
<p>97. In October 2012, a member of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances visited 
Mexico and held consultations with the Mexican national human rights institution. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Commission on the Status of Women 
</b></p>
<p>98. In 2012, the International Coordinating Committee, with the Asia Pacific Forum of 
National Human Rights Institutions and the support of OHCHR, continued its advocacy for 
the participation of A-status national human rights institutions at the fifty-seventh session 
of the Commission on the Status of Women. At present, national human rights institutions 
may participate in Commission sessions only if they are invited to attend as part of their 
Government&#8217;s delegation. Support of the participation of national human rights institutions 
in the Commission was endorsed by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 20/14, in 
which the Council encouraged institutions to continue to interact with and advocate for 
independent participation in all relevant United Nations mechanisms, including the 
Commission. 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Other meetings 
</b></p>
<p>99.  In December 2012, 45 national human rights institutions participated in the Forum 
on Business and Human Rights. The Forum was established by the Human Rights Council 
in its resolution 17/4 to map the road for the implementation of the United Nations Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights. Discussions focused on trends, best practices 
and challenges in the implementation of the Guiding Principles and the United Nations 
&#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework. 
</p>
<p>100.  In December 2012, OHCHR organized an international workshop on enhancing 
cooperation between United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms from Africa, 
Europe, the Americas, the Middle East and Asia. Discussions included means to enhance 
information-sharing, joint activities and follow-up to recommendations made by United 
Nations and regional human rights mechanisms. National human rights institutions actively 
participated in the discussion and made a number of recommendations aimed at improving 
their collaboration with regional mechanisms. </p>


<p><b> IV. Cooperation with and support for national human rights 
institutions by United Nations agencies and programmes, and 
international and regional organizations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. United Nations Development Programme 
</b></p>
<p>101. Engagement with national human rights institutions is a priority area for OHCHR 
and UNDP. They currently support the establishment and strengthening of such institutions 
in a number of countries through joint technical cooperation initiatives, advocacy 
initiatives, capacity needs assessments, enhancing the capacity of Governments to meet 
international treaty obligations, and to prepare and follow up on the universal periodic 
review. 
</p>
<p>102. A second annual meeting to review the strategic partnership between UNDP, 
OHCHR and the International Coordinating Committee was held in July 2012 in New 
York. The purpose of the meeting was to take stock of the progress of the partnership and 
to identify areas for future cooperation to support national human rights institutions and 
their regional and global networks. Discussions focused on joint activities for the period 
2012-2013, capacity and gaps assessment projects, and support for national human rights 
organizations on follow-up to universal periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>103. The independent review of the OHCHR/UNDP/Asia Pacific Forum of National 
Human Rights Institutions capacity assessment project included a stakeholders meeting in 
Bangkok, in September 2012. A report on the project was prepared by a consultant. 
</p>
<p>104. Technical support for the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka continued 
through a joint United Nations programme on human rights. This included support for the 
protection and monitoring mechanisms of the Commission. In 2012, OHCHR and UNHCR 
also contributed funds to the programme.  
</p>
<p>105. UNDP Mozambique (see also paragraph 14 above) and OHCHR supported the 
process of selection of civil society members of the Mozambique Human Rights 
Commission by drafting rules of procedures for selection and by organizing a meeting of 
human rights civil society organizations. UNDP also supported four working sessions of 
the Commission and provided technical assistance in drafting by-laws and a strategic plan. 
A needs assessment of the Commission was conducted to enhance its fundraising capacity. 
</p>
<p>106. UNDP Kenya and OHCHR supported the re-establishment of three constitutionally 
entrenched institutions in Kenya, including the Human Rights Commission, and were 
involved in the development of their strategic plans and administrative rules and 
procedures. A four-year programme for institutional development and programmatic 
assistance for core strategic areas was developed to support their interrelated mandates.  
</p>
<p>107. UNDP Bangladesh provided capacity support to the national human rights 
institution by means of a project focused on institutional development; human rights 
monitoring and investigation; human rights awareness-raising; and research, reporting and 
policy development. As a result, the institution organized a consultation among 
stakeholders for the preparation of the report in view of the universal periodic review 
submitted to the Human Rights Council in October 2012. The institution also held 
countrywide public awareness campaigns and strengthened its capacity to provide policy 
advice to the Government. 
</p>
<p>108. In 2012, UNDP, in partnership with the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human 
Rights Institutions, supported the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission to </p>


<p>finalize its plan action based on an internal capacity assessment of the Commission 
conducted in 2011. 
</p>
<p>109. Under the capacity-building project of UNDP (see also paragraph 15 above) and the 
European Union to support the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission, in November 2012, 
a training session was held on international and African human rights mechanisms for the 
commissioners to enable them to cooperate with the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women and the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights. Expert advice was provided to support the Commission in the preparation and 
submission of its budget and for the procurement of equipment. 
</p>
<p><b> B. </b>United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund <b> 
</b></p>
<p>110. UNICEF supported the development of a website for the national human rights 
institution of Mexico.

Ombudsman (Defensoria del Pueblo) of Bolivia (Plurinational State of) to implement 
activities relating to children&#8217;s and adolescents&#8217; rights to participation. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  
</b></p>
<p>112. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs provided the Office of the 
Ombudsman of Colombia with support to develop activities for the benefit of vulnerable 
communities and communities affected by gross violations of humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><b> D.  International Organization of la Francophonie  
</b></p>
<p>113. Within the framework of their standing partnership, OHCHR and the International 
Organization of la Francophonie developed and implemented joint capacity-building and 
technical cooperation programmes to establish and strengthen national human rights 
institutions in French-speaking countries, including Benin, Burundi, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Haiti 
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. States 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>States are encouraged to implement the recommendations made by their 
national human rights institutions. 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>States are encouraged to establish a national human rights institution</b> <b>where 
none exists, and to strengthen the structures and independence of existing ones in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to enable the effective fulfilment of their mandate, taking into account the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations made by the Subcommittee on Accreditation and the advice 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided by OHCHR. 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>States are encouraged to ensure that national human rights institutions</b> <b>are 
provided with a broad mandate to protect and promote all human rights, including

<p>119. <b>Open, participatory and pluralistic processes are important when establishing 
or strengthening national human rights institutions</b> <b>in compliance with the Paris 
Principles, as well as during the selection and appointment of their members and staff.  
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>Budget cuts have affected the capacity of OHCHR to contribute to the 
establishment of national human rights institutions</b> <b>and to ensuring their compliance 
with the Paris Principles, in particular, its secretarial support for the International 
</b></p>
<p><b>Coordinating Committee and its Subcommittee on Accreditation. Member States are
