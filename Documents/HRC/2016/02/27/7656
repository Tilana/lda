</p>
<p>(f) The accession, on 8 October 2013, to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which entered into force for Haiti on 8 January 
2014; 
</p>
<p>(g) The implementation of the 400/100 Programme for the construction of 400 
social housing units in 100 districts, which was executed with support from the Inter-
American Development Bank, and the launch of the first phase of a programme for the 
construction of 3,000 social housing units on 16 May 2013; 
</p>
<p>(h) The establishment of the Interministerial Human Rights Committee to 
coordinate and harmonize public human rights policies. 
</p>
<p>2. The Council welcomes the signature of the El Rancho Accord on 14 March 
2014, which gives voice to the desire of Haitian political actors to move forward with the 
planning of elections and the consolidation of democracy in Haiti. To that end, the Council 
also welcomes the publication of the electoral law and the law on political parties, which 
pave the way for legislative and local elections to be held in late October 2014. The Council 
encourages the political authorities of Haiti to maintain their spirit of cooperation and to 
take swift action with a view to scheduling elections; 
</p>
<p>3. The Council welcomes the reaffirmation of the commitment of the Haitian 
authorities to improve the living conditions of Haitian women and men by, inter alia, 
devoting greater attention to respect for human rights. The Council also welcomes the 
priorities set out in that regard by the President of Haiti (known as the &#8220;five Es&#8221; in French): 
ensuring the rule of law, education, the environment, employment and energy, along with 
the recent addition of elections to that list. It urges the Government of Haiti to pursue these 
priorities in a way that will produce concrete, sustainable results for the population of Haiti; 
</p>
<p>4. Within this context, the Council encourages the Government of Haiti to work 
to strengthen the rule of law by, inter alia, combating impunity, crime and its causes, and 
the use of prolonged pretrial detention so as to ensure the operation of public institutions 
and services and the enjoyment of all human rights; 
</p>
<p>5. The Council also encourages the Government of Haiti to strengthen national 
human rights institutions, particularly the Office of Citizen Protection, which the 
International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights accredited with an A status on 4 December 2013 in recognition 
of its compliance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the 
promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles).2 The Council further 
encourages the authorities of Haiti to redouble their efforts to strengthen judicial 
institutions and to make them fully compatible with the commitments made by Haiti in 
relation to respect for human rights; 
</p>
<p>6. The Council urges the Government of Haiti to continue to adopt the 
necessary political and legal measures to safeguard the rights of members of vulnerable 
groups, including women, children, particularly child domestic workers, and persons with 
disabilities, to increase women&#8217;s participation in political affairs and to continue to combat 
gender-based violence and discrimination; 
</p>
<p>7. The Council is aware of the many obstacles to development in Haiti and the 
difficulties which the population of Haiti and its leaders continue to encounter since the 
earthquake of 12 January 2010. It recognizes that families whose members were separated 
by the earthquake, including unaccompanied children and displaced persons in camps and 
outside the scope of the main rescue operations, are more vulnerable to human rights

particular, international donors, the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, the 
group of countries known as the Friends of Haiti, specialized agencies of the United 
Nations and, in particular, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, to step up their cooperation with the Haitian authorities with a view to the full 
realization of all human rights in Haiti; 
</p>
<p>9. The Council welcomes and approves the request of the Haitian authorities for 
a one-year extension of the mandate of the Independent Expert on the situation of human 
rights in Haiti, which concerns technical assistance and capacity-building; 
</p>
<p>10. The Council encourages the Independent Expert to continue to work with 
international institutions, donors and the international community to raise their awareness 
of the need to provide their expertise and appropriate resources to support the efforts of the 
Haitian authorities to rebuild the country and pursue sustainable development; 
</p>
<p>11. The Council also encourages the Independent Expert to continue to work 
with the Government of Haiti, non-governmental organizations of Haiti and civil society in 
Haiti. It invites the Government of Haiti to continue its active cooperation with civil 
society; 
</p>
<p>12. The Council invites the Independent Expert to assist the Government of Haiti 
in acting upon its own recommendations and those made by other special procedures, in 
particular those of the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right 
to an adequate standard of living and on the right to non-discrimination in this context;3 
</p>
<p>13. The Council also invites the Independent Expert to submit his report on the
