<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Twenty-ninth session

<p>Agenda item 3<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council on 2 July 2015 
</b></p>
<p><b>  29/4.   Elimination of discrimination against women 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and all other relevant 
</p>
<p>international human rights instruments,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Programme of 
</p>
<p>Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing 
</p>
<p>Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review 
</p>
<p>conferences, the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the outcome document 
</p>
<p>of the Durban Review Conference,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> all relevant resolutions on the elimination of discrimination against 
</p>
<p>women of the Human Rights Council, the General Assembly, the Security Council and 
</p>
<p>other United Nations agencies and bodies,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the inclusion of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and 
</p>
<p>girls as a stand-alone goal in the proposed sustainable development goals, and looking 
</p>
<p>forward to the integration of a gender perspective into the post-2015 development agenda,  
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> that international human rights treaties, including the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights, prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender and include guarantees 
</p>
<p>to ensure the enjoyment by women and men, and girls and boys, of their civil, political, 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights on a basis of equality, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the full, equal and effective participation of women of all ages and 
</p>
<p>in all spheres of life, on an equal basis with men, is essential for the full and complete 
</p>
<p>economic, political social and cultural development of a country and for achieving lasting 
</p>
<p>solutions to global challenges and the realization of peace, and that gender equality and the 
</p>
<p>empowerment of women benefit women, men, girls and boys and society as a whole, 
</p>
<p> 
 
 
</p>

<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that women&#8217;s equal rights and their enjoyment in the cultural and 
</p>
<p>family life are closely linked to the enjoyment of human rights in all areas, including in 
</p>
<p>public, political, social and economic life,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that, while the significance of national and regional particularities and 
</p>
<p>various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, it is the duty 
</p>
<p>of States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to promote and 
</p>
<p>protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that respect for cultural and religious diversity and of cultural rights and 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion for all enhances pluralism and contributes to advancing the application 
</p>
<p>and enjoyment of human rights,  
</p>
<p><i>Reiterating</i> that, to secure equal enjoyment by women of all human rights in all 
</p>
<p>aspects of life, discriminatory, repressive and violent practices against them should be 
</p>
<p>eliminated, regardless of their origin, including those occasions where culture and religion 
</p>
<p>are misused or misinterpreted,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing and deeply regretting</i> that many women and girls, particularly those 
</p>
<p>belonging to vulnerable groups, face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and 
</p>
<p>are still subjected to discriminatory laws and practices, and that de jure and de facto 
</p>
<p>equality has not been achieved, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that gender responsiveness is an essential part of the role played by 
</p>
<p>national human rights institutions as established by the principles relating to the status of 
</p>
<p>national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles), 
</p>
<p>adopted by General Assembly in its resolution 48/134 of 20 December 1993,  
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the work undertaken by the United Nations Entity for Gender 
</p>
<p>Equality and the Empowerment of Women, the Commission on the Status of Women, the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the special procedures 
</p>
<p>mandate holders of the Human Rights Council and other relevant United Nations bodies, 
</p>
