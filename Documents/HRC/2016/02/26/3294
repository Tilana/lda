<p> The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council 
resolution 17/23 concerning the matter of non-repatriation of funds of illicit origin. Chapter 
II describes the main obstacles to the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, the process 
established for the return of assets by the United Nations Convention against Corruption 
and the mutual obligations imposed on States involved in the recovery process under the 
human rights framework. Chapter III discusses how the non-repatriation of funds of illicit 
origin impacts on States&#8217; capacity to fulfil their human rights obligations, in particular with 
regard to economic, social, and cultural rights. It analyses ways by which a human rights-
based approach to asset recovery enhances existing procedures, by addressing its most 
problematic issues and existing barriers. The report concludes with policy 
recommendations directed at improving repatriation processes with a view to enhancing  
States&#8217; capacity to better fulfil their human rights obligations.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 17/23, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations  
High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare a comprehensive study on the negative 
impact of the non-repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin on the 
enjoyment of human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights, and to submit 
a report thereon to the Human Rights Council at its nineteenth session.  
</p>
<p>2. The present report is submitted in follow up to this request.   
</p>
<p><b> II. The main obstacles to the repatriation of funds 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Funds of illicit origin: Estimated flows of funds of illicit origin and of 
</b></p>
<p><b>funds not repatriated 
</b></p>
<p>3. As Human Rights Council resolution 17/23 refers to funds of illicit origin with 
regards to corruption, for the purpose of this report, &#8220;funds of illicit origin&#8221; and &#8220;proceeds 
of corruption&#8221; are used interchangeably. Both terms are understood as any property derived 
from or obtained, directly or indirectly, through the commission of a crime covered by the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption.1 
</p>
<p>4. Proceeds of corruption are difficult to measure. The data is scarce and hard to 
collect. All methodologies resort to different assumptions and, when the task is of a global 
nature, the margin of confidence substantially decreases. Results are, therefore, rough 
estimations.2 For example, global bribery &#8211; both petty and grand &#8211; has been estimated at 
between US$ 600 billion and $1.<footnote name="5">2 In many jurisdictions, criminal fines are not adopted with a punitive purpose but as a substitute of a 
confiscation. In such cases, criminal fines may also be subject to the procedures for return suggested 
in paras. 59-65. In order to decide when this should be the case, the definition of proceeds of 
corruption adopted by the United Nations Convention against Corruption as well as the precedents  of 
the European Court of Human Rights for distinguishing punitive measures from remedial measures 
are good guidance. </footnote> trillion, that is to say, a median estimate of US$ 1 
trillion.3  
</p>
<p>5. Annual estimates for international flows of the proceeds of corruption range between 
US$ 30 and $ 50 billion with a median estimate of US$ 40 billion and for flows out of 
developing and transition economies estimates range between US$ 20 and 40 billion for a 
median estimate of US$ 30 billion.<footnote name="4">8 International documents have even considered large scale corruption to be a &#8220;crime against 
humanity&#8221;. See the Seoul Findings, 11th International Anti-Corruption Conference, Seoul, 2003; the 
Nairobi Declaration, adopted at the Regional Conference on the Human Rights Dimensions of 
Corruption convened by the Kenya National Commission of Human Rights (KNCHR), 2006. </footnote> This figure represents half of the official development

</p>
<p> 4 Raymond Baker, <i>Capitalism&#180;s Achilles Heel</i> (New Jersey, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005). According to 
Baker, proceeds of corruption represent around 3 per cent of the estimated illicit financial flows. 
Flows originating in organized crime activities &#8211; drugs, counterfeit goods and currency, human 
trafficking, illegal arms trade, smuggling and racketeering - amount to 33 per cent, and flows 
originating in illegal commercial activities -mispricing for tax evasion, abuses of transfer pricing, and 
commercial fraud- to 64 per cent.   </p>


<p>assistance for 2000 &#8211; when global attention to asset recovery began5 &#8211; and still represents 
more than 25 per cent of ODA reported for 2010.6 
</p>
<p>6. By contrast with illicit financial flows originating in organized crime or commercial 
activities, where around 50 per cent of the money flows between developed countries, in 
the case of proceeds of corruption 80 per cent of the money is believed to be outflow from 
developing countries. Given the relative weight of diverted funds in each economy, the 
impact of outflows of proceeds of corruption substantially increases in the developing 
world. For instance, in 2002 the African Union estimated the direct and indirect costs of 
corruption at US$ 148 billion, which at that time amounted to 25  per cent of the 
continent&#8217;s GDP.7  
</p>
<p>7. Most of the estimated annual outflow of US$ 20-40 billion goes undetected, and 
even less is repatriated to the countries of origin. Though not intended to be exhaustive, a 
recent database launched by the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative shows that less than US$ 
2 billion had been repatriated since 1990.8 More than 70 per cent of these repatriation 
efforts took place after the United Nations Convention against Corruption entered into force 
in 2005, and around US$ 1 billion is currently frozen in ongoing investigations, a figure 
pointing out a growing rate of detection.9  
</p>
<p>8. Despite progress made since the United Nations Convention against Corruption 
entered into force, only around 2 per cent of the estimated funds of illicit origin annually 
leaving the developing world are repatriated to their countries of origin.10  
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal and factual obstacles to repatriating funds of illicit origin  
</b></p>
<p>9. There are multiple legal and factual obstacles to the repatriation of proceeds of 
corruption.11 Many legal barriers are associated to difficulties in implementing and 
enforcing the legal framework for preventing and detecting the transfer of proceeds of 
corruption. For instance, in order to detect these flows, a fundamental standard set by article 
52, paragraph 1, of the United Nations Convention against Corruption requires State Parties 
to &#8220;take such measures as may be necessary, in accordance with its domestic law, to require 
financial institutions within its jurisdiction&#8230; to conduct enhanced scrutiny of accounts 
</p>
<p>sought or maintained by or on behalf of individuals who are, or have been, entrusted with 
prominent public functions and their family members and close associates. Such enhanced 
scrutiny shall be reasonably designed to detect suspicious transactions for the purpose of

<p>reporting to competent authorities&#8221;<i>. </i>The rate of compliance with this standard remains low, 
both in the developed and the developing worlds.12 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>10. Even if flows of illicit origin are reported or otherwise detected, additional legal 
obstacles can be found in the subsequent stages of the process. Most of them take place in 
the context of mutual legal assistance in criminal matters between the originating and the 
recipient jurisdictions. Many cases fail at the tracing phase due to exigent requirements 
imposed by requested jurisdictions in a stage where the requesting jurisdiction is in a weak 
position for collecting evidence. Typical examples include requiring the originating 
jurisdiction to provide an exact link between the assets and the offence, the names of bank 
account holders or to identify the assets with an extreme degree of accuracy. These 
requirements, which are usually higher in jurisdictions applying strict bank secrecy laws, 
are difficult to meet at early stages of the investigation. Chapters IV and V of the United 
Nations Convention against Corruption, which oblige requested jurisdictions to assist in the 
tracing stage, should be sufficient to overcome this barrier. Nonetheless, the central 
authorities of many State parties either do not resort to these rules as a legal basis for 
cooperation or read them in accordance with their preexisting domestic legislation and 
practices, reducing their scope and innovative broad approach.13   
</p>
<p>11. The success of most recovery efforts depends upon timely adoption of provisional 
measures to freeze or restrain the assets. Although the risks of dissipation are inherent to 
the context, many jurisdictions impose important burdens on the requesting State for 
freezing assets, even when the rights of the accused are restricted on a rational and 
proportional basis. Some jurisdictions give ample rights to the asset-holder, allowing for 
long lasting parallel proceedings in the requested State, when the rights of the asset-holder 
&#8211; being a defendant or not &#8211; should be exercised before the Courts of the requesting 
jurisdiction. When these measures take place in the tracing stage, they usually lead to the 
dissipation of the assets.14   
</p>
<p>12. When confiscation depends on obtaining a criminal conviction, as is the case in most 
jurisdictions, the requesting country might need to reach that stage within time constraints 
imposed by the legislation of the requested jurisdiction, for example the lifting of 
provisional measures and/or the statute of limitations. Many jurisdictions do not provide for 
an alternative when conviction is impossible to reach, for example when the defendant 
enjoys immunity, is a fugitive, dies, or when the case reached the statute of limitation. This 
obstacle could be overcome by following article 54, paragraph 1 (c), of the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption, which recommends de-linking confiscation from conviction 
for the purposes of providing mutual legal assistance.  
</p>
<p>13. If proceeds of corruption are confiscated, requested States need to have legislation 
allowing for their repatriation. It has been reported that &#8220;only a very limited number of 
jurisdictions have the legal authority to return 100 percent of stolen assets&#8221;15, even when 
article 57, paragraph 2, of the United Nations Convention against Corruption requires State 
Parties to adopt such measures.   
</p>
<p>14. While variances in legal traditions increase the obstacles, differences in experience, 
technical resources and even in the risks faced by the authorities in requesting and 
requested jurisdictions can play an important role. In 97 per cent of the cases included in 
</p>
<p>  
 12 Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative, &#8220;Politically Exposed Persons: Preventive Measures for the Banking 
</p>
<p>Sector&#8221; (Washington D.C., 2010), available at 
http://www1.worldbank.org/finance/star_site/publications/politically_exposed.html.  
</p>

<p>the Asset Recovery Watch database, the requesting country is a developing one. Out of 
these requests, 83 per cent were addressed to members of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development and 17 per cent to other developing countries, most of which 
were offshore financial centres. 
</p>
<p>15. Legal barriers are exacerbated by factual and institutional obstacles; the most salient 
being the lack of will to cooperate. Requested jurisdictions, especially financial centres, 
&#8220;often maintain an unresponsive and inefficient mutual legal assistance regime and systems 
that are known to be arduous, discouraging states from submitting requests for assistance&#8221;, 
prioritize domestic cases over foreign requests and rarely take a proactive approach, even 
though they do have the expertise, capacities or resources to provide better assistance. It has 
been suggested that this institutional behavior is reinforced by the perception that &#8220;some 
requests from developing jurisdictions are submitted simply as a &#8217;smoke screen&#8217;, contrived 
for domestic and international political reasons in a case that would never be seriously 
prosecuted&#8221;, and that &#8220;developing jurisdictions do not always respond positively when 
</p>
<p>developed countries inform them of the discovery of assets believed to be illegally 
obtained&#8221;.16  
</p>
<p>16. While this perception might sometimes be correct, there are cases where there is a 
failure in adequately distinguishing between the State authorities and the society suffering 
the consequences of corruption. When this distinction has been taken into account, a more 
proactive intervention of the requested State was able to unbalance the field in favor of 
seriously prosecuting cases.17   
</p>
<p><b> C. The legal framework for the realization of human rights in the context 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the asset-recovery process   
</b></p>
<p>17. The international human rights framework primarily establishes the relationship 
between individuals and States in terms of rights and duties. Typically, the human person is 
identified as a rights-holder, while States are duty-bearers. The Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights describes the specific obligations of States as the responsibility 
to respect, protect and fulfil human rights.  
</p>
<p>18. The nature of States&#8217; human rights obligations has been debated at length, 
particularly their alleged differential nature with regards to civil and political rights, on the 
one hand, and economic, social, and cultural rights on the other.  
</p>
<p>19. It has been recognized that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are 
indivisible and interdependent, and that equal attention and urgent consideration should be 
given to the implementation, promotion and protection of all civil, political, economic, 
social, and cultural rights, that States have the duty to respect, protect, and fulfill all human 
rights, comprising both negative and positive duties.18 
</p>
<p>20. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stressed that the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights establishes obligations of 
both conduct and result, and that &#8220;while the Covenant provides for progressive realization 
and acknowledges the constraints due to the limits of available resources, it also imposes 
</p>
<p>  
 16 Ibid., pp. 25-26.  
 17 Tim Daniels and James Maton, &#8220;The kleptocrat&#8217;s portfolio decision&#8221;, in Peter Reuter (ed.) <i>Draining 
</i></p>
<p><i>Development: Controlling the Flow of Illicit Funds from Developing Countries</i> (World Bank Press, 
2012).   
</p>

<p>various obligations which are of immediate effect.&#8221;19 Thus, the Committee held that &#8220;while 
the full realization of the relevant rights may be achieved progressively, steps towards that 
goal must be taken within a reasonably short time after the Covenant's entry into force for 
the States concerned. Such steps should be deliberate, concrete and targeted as clearly as 
possible towards meeting the obligations recognized in the Covenant&#8221;.20 Thus, the 
progressive realization of economic, social, and cultural rights &#8220;should not be 
misinterpreted as depriving the obligation of all meaningful content&#8221;.21 
</p>
<p>21. In addition, the Committee stressed that article 2, paragraph 1, of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights &#8220;must be read in the light of the overall 
objective, indeed the raison d'&#234;tre, of the Covenant which is to establish clear obligations 
for States parties in respect of the full realization of the rights in question, &#8230; it thus 
</p>
<p>imposes an obligation to move as expeditiously and effectively as possible towards that 
goal [and that] any deliberately retrogressive measures in that regard would require the 
most careful consideration and would need to be fully justified by reference to the totality 
of the rights provided for in the Covenant and in the context of the full use of the maximum 
available resources&#8221;.22 For this reason it is understood that States have a minimum core 
obligation to ensure the satisfaction of, at the very least, minimum essential levels of every 
right, and that &#8220;in order for a State party to be able to attribute its failure to meet at least its 
minimum core obligations to a lack of available resources it must demonstrate that every 
effort has been made to use all resources that are at its disposition in an effort to satisfy, as 
a matter of priority, those minimum obligations&#8221;.23 
</p>
<p>22. That corruption impedes States from complying with their human rights obligations 
has been increasingly emphasized.24 It is believed that diversion of available resources due 
to corruption impacts the obligation to take steps, to the maximum of available resources, to 
progressively achieve the full realization of economic, social, and cultural rights.25 Rights  
violation due to corruption-related diversion of funds is particularly apparent when States 
cannot fulfil their minimum core obligations regarding each right. 
</p>
<p>23. In this context, under certain conditions a successful procedure of asset repatriation 
might remedy the State&#8217;s corruption-related failure to complying with human rights 
obligations. Being a component of any anti-corruption strategy, the asset-recovery process 
should be understood in light of the human rights framework, as part of the several efforts 
that States must make in order to comply with their human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>24. These obligations apply to both countries of origin and recipient countries of funds 
of illicit origin due to the principle of international cooperation and assistance towards the 
realization of human rights, particularly economic, social, and cultural rights.26 According

two conferences linking anti-corruption work with human rights protection (Seminar on Good 
Governance Practices for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, 2004, Seoul; UN 
Conference on Anti-Corruption Measures, Good Governance and Human Rights, 2006, Warsaw). 
Moreover, Human Rights Council resolution 11/7 recognized effective anti-corruption measures and 
human rights protection as mutually reinforcing.

</p>
<p>Cultural Rights, art. 2, para. 1; Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International 
 </p>


<p>to this principle, States&#8217; obligations to respect, protect, and fulfil human rights are not only 
applicable in relation to their own domestic populations but do have an extraterritorial 
scope, applying to both countries in a position to assist and countries in need of 
assistance.27  
</p>
<p>25. As with other forms of international cooperation, such as international cooperation 
for development and for the realization of economic, social, and cultural rights, mutual 
legal assistance implies a mutual responsibility. In the context of asset-recovery processes, 
on the one hand, countries of origin must seek repatriation as part of their duty to ensure the 
application of the maximum available resources to the full realization of economic, social, 
and cultural rights. On the other hand, recipient countries have the duty to assist and 
facilitate repatriation as part of their obligation of international cooperation and assistance. 
</p>
<p>26. Therefore, a human rights-based approach28 to the asset-recovery process not only 
demands that countries of origin make every effort to achieve the recovery and repatriation 
of proceeds of corruption for implementation of their international human rights 
obligations, it also demands that recipient countries understand repatriation not as a 
discretionary measure but also as a duty derived from the obligations of international 
cooperation and assistance.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Impacts on S</b>tates&#8217; capacity to fulfil <b>their human rights 
obligations   
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The negative impact of the non-repatriation of funds of illicit origin to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the countries of origin on the enjoyment of human rights, in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>27. On the surface, it seems apparent that any resource that the State is deprived of 
because of corruption has the same negative effect, regardless of whether it is exported or 
domestically retained.29 Along the same lines, proceeds of corruption reintegrated into the 
State budget will, if invested in accordance with human rights obligations, positively 
impact these rights.  
</p>
<p>28. As recovered resources are not foreseen or public income included in the budget, 
States must allocate them in accordance with their obligation to devote the maximum of 
available resources to the fulfilment of economic, social, and cultural rights. This is the 
starting point with regards to the measures that must be taken with repatriated funds. 
</p>
<p>29. There is no straightforward answer about how money is best invested in order to 
realize economic, social, and cultural rights. While the duty to allocate restituted funds in 
</p>
<p>  
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, principles 28 and 29; Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, art. 4; Declaration on the Right to Development, arts. 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 4.2; Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action, arts. 1, 4, 10, and 11. 
</p>

<p>conformity with the &#8220;maximum available resources&#8221; principle must govern allocation 
</p>
<p>decisions, no general one-fits-all rule can be suggested, since claims are dependent on the 
particular situation of each country. However, the human rights-based approach provides 
important guidance to take into account. 
</p>
<p>30. In the first place, it requires that the decision-making process complies with both 
principles of transparency and participation. Decisions over resources allocation cannot be 
made behind closed doors, but publicly and openly, with due attention to civil society&#8217;s 
demands. In some cases, lack of transparency and participation in the allocation decisions 
can end up in the use of the recovered assets to ends different from those sought by human 
rights principles.30 Moreover, publicity for and accessibility of budget information, which 
should be compiled in easy-to-monitor categories, is essential in order to notice spending 
priorities and make the right allocation decisions.31 Lastly, the allocation decision-making 
process would benefit from comparing actual budget allocations against human rights 
indicators.32 
</p>
<p>31. On the other hand, the allocation decision-making process should also be informed 
by the human rights-based approach principle of providing effective remedies, including 
the creation of conditions for avoiding new human rights violations in the future. Applied to 
the context of repatriation agreements envisaged by article 57, paragraph 5, of the United 
Nations Convention against Corruption, this principle could be used as a framework for 
these usually difficult negotiations. The human rights-based approach requires that 
repatriated funds be appropriately used in the creation of conditions for complying with 
human rights obligations and for avoiding new corruption-based diversions. There are 
national precedents that show a path for future reference in search of matching both the 
needs of the society harmed by the consequences of corruption and the recipients&#8217; concerns 
</p>
<p>about the final destination of the returned funds. 
</p>
<p>32. Additionally, managing and oversight mechanisms can be as important as making 
the correct decision for the final destination of the funds. These include establishing the 
procedures and the authorities that will be accountable for guaranteeing that the allocation 
decisions will be strictly followed. Well-designed tracking arrangements facilitate oversight 
activities and continuous monitoring, particularly by civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>33. These management arrangements are enhanced when they are in line with the human 
rights-based approach, since transparency, participation and accountability are three main 
pillars of any scheme devised for pursuing proper and efficient administration, including 
public recordings of receipts, public declarations of intended use of funds and public 
budgeting, public reporting on actual expenditures and on the achieved results, proper 
mechanisms of auditing, and official response and measures to correct identified 
weaknesses or mismanagement. The need for transparency in budget spending is a lesson 
that has been learned from situations in which the recovered assets transfered to an off-
budget fund gave rise to a number of questionable transactions.

<p>34. Finally, it is remarkable that such transparency measures seem consistent with the 
commitments endorsed by both developed and developing countries in point 24 of the 
Accra Agenda for Action.33  
</p>
<p><b> B. The impact on the rule of law in the country of origin 
</b></p>
<p>35. Beyond the relationship between available economic resources and human rights 
obligations, the non-repatriation of funds of illicit origin has an impact on the rule of law in 
the country of origin. As recalled by Council resolution 17/23 mandating this study, &#8220;the 
illicit acquisition of personal wealth can be particularly damaging to democratic 
institutions, national economies and the rule of law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>36. Where both the incentives for and opportunities to export illicit wealth are 
significant, as it seems to be the case in many developing countries, it is very likely that the 
damage to the rule of law be exacerbated. It has been pointed out that &#8220;the potential to hide 
illicit capital securely in tax havens is a direct stimulus to corruption and other illicit 
activities like transfer mispricing. It decreases the chances of detection and therefore 
increases the likely returns. Especially in polities characterized by high degrees of socio-
economic inequality and little or no effective institutionalized popular control of the actions 
of political elites (&#8220;democracy&#8221;), those fractions of the political elite that are able and 
willing to participate in this nexus of corrupt internal accumulation and illicit capital 
outflows are also motivated or able to create or change the rules of the game, in order to 
ensure that they can continue playing it in a rewarding way. In practice this is likely to 
mean: tax agencies collect enough money to run basic government services but have overall 
low capacity, especially in dealing with complex international issues like transfer pricing; 
police services lack investigatory powers; court systems are vulnerable to corruption; weak 
public audit offices lack independent authority; legislatures lack collective cohesion and 
authority; fragile, unstable political parties are motivated by money and patronage; and 
public services lack a collective, professional ethos. Indirectly, these processes may further 
weaken the protection of property rights through their incentive effects on political elites. 
Powerful groups that control considerable (illicit) capital but locate much of it overseas do 
not have strong incentives to strengthen property rights at home (for everyone)&#8221;.34 
</p>
<p>37. In other words, the opportunities to export funds of illicit origin generate perverse 
incentives against building a democratic society. The non-repatriation of funds of illicit 
origin increases the conditions leading to this kind of institutional damage. By requiring 
obligations to both countries of origin and recipient countries, a human rights-based 
approach to the asset recovery process contributes to remedying that negative impact. 
</p>
<p><b> C. How a human rights-based approach to the asset-recovery process 
</b></p>
<p><b>contributes to reducing the negative impact of non-repatriation  
</b></p>
<p>38. The relevant role that recipient countries play in the asset-recovery process should 
not only be associated with the fact that the assets are located within their jurisdiction, but 
also that, regardless of the capacities, resources and willingness of the requesting State&#8217;s 
institutions and authorities, there is a victim society suffering the consequences of public 
corruption. An important number of the barriers to asset recovery that were outlined above 
in chapter II are a consequence of insufficient understanding of this reality. By focusing on

</p>
<p>High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, 2008, Accra, Ghana.  
 34 Moore, cited in note 32 above.   </p>


<p>the whole population as rights-holders and on States as duty-bearers, a human rights-based 
approach to the asset recovery process will contribute to remedying some of these barriers. 
</p>
<p>39. Undoubtedly, there are many instances in which competent agencies from recipient 
jurisdictions lack the capacity or the legal authority to cooperate without information from 
the victim country. There are many others, however, where &#8220;the interests and perspectives 
of authorities of recipient countries may be poorly aligned with those of the societies 
affected by corruption. Consequently, they may either fail to implement portions of the 
regime, or implement them in ways that are incompatible with the interests of the affected 
societies&#8221;<i>.</i>35 While many of the barriers described in chapter II are related to the failure of 
both developing and developed countries to make every effort to comply with their 
obligations under the United Nations Convention against Corruption, it should not be 
neglected that anti-corruption authorities in developing countries usually face more 
constraints than those in requested jurisdictions. Thus, while it is not possible to make 
progress in asset-recovery cases without political will in both the country of origin and the 
recipient country, the latter country&#8217;s authorities are generally in a better position to lower 
or address the obstacles for the recovery of assets, by taking into account the domestic 
constraints existing in countries of origin.  
</p>
<p>40. The following section will outline how this argument applies to the different stages 
of the asset recovery process.  
</p>
<p><b>  Preventing and detecting 
</b></p>
<p>41. Article 52 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption establishes the rules 
for preventing and detecting transfers of funds of illicit origin. It relies on the legal 
framework designed to prevent the laundering of the proceeds of crime. This system 
expects that private financial institutions will organize themselves to comply with &#8220;know 
your customers&#8221; rules, perform &#8220;ongoing due diligence&#8221; on clients that show specific risks, 
</p>
<p>keep records of the transactions, and report suspicious transactions to the financial 
intelligence unit, a centralized agency usually empowered with unrestricted access to 
financial information. This agency must analyze the reported transactions and, if suspicions 
are confirmed or raised, derive the analysis to law enforcement authorities. 
</p>
<p>42. However, detection fails when financial intelligence units in developing jurisdictions 
do not enjoy autonomy, since gatekeepers may be afraid of formal or informal retaliation if 
reporting transactions of elite members or, in some cases, they may simply find cost-
effective to launder their money.36 Thus, as gatekeepers in recipient jurisdictions are less 
dependent on the political processes of the countries of origin, they are usually more likely 
to report proceeds of corruption than such a country&#8217;s gatekeepers. Nonetheless, as reports 
are a firstsign, even in these cases either the financial intelligence unit or a prosecutor at the 
recipient country will need to resort to its respective peer in the country of origin in order to 
collect evidence for supporting a prima facie case that will eventually lead to the restraint of 
the assets. In a &#8220;low-intensity&#8221; democracy, such requests may remain unanswered or only 
answered in order to reject suspicions when referring to a current public official or a well 
connected member of the elite. This is why it has been said that &#8220;anti-money laundering controls that matter more for developing countries are those that operate in the destination 
countries&#8221;.37  
</p>
<p>  
 35 Kevin Davis and others, &#8220;Transnational responses to political corruption&#8221;, forthcoming, 2012.  
 36 Michael Levi, &#8220;How well do anti-money laundering controls work in developing countries?&#8221;, in 
</p>
<p>Reuter (ed.), cited in note 17. 
 37 Peter Reuter, &#8220;Policy and Research Implications of Illicit Flows&#8221;, in Reuter (ed.), cited in note 17. </p>


<p>43. However, this will only be true if the authorities at the destination country make 
every possible effort to reduce the conditions under which a case might be started. 
Currently, recipient countries do not usually take ownership over the cases, even when they 
are in a good position to move the process forward. The human rights-based approach to 
the asset-recovery process, which emphasizes the recipient country&#8217;s duty to cooperate and 
be accountable, reinforces the argument for proactive investigation.  
</p>
<p>44. Indeed, the framework for the prevention and detection of illicit flows under the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption enshrines human rights principles. By 
increasing oversight over public officials&#8217; transactions, it strengthens accountability. In 
</p>
<p>addition, the principles of participation and transparency, which are enshrined in chapter II 
of the United Nations Convention against Corruption on preventive measures, cover all 
required measures related to the implementation of the anti-money laundering framework in 
both the public and private sectors. 
</p>
<p>45. Finally, the framework of the United Nations Convention against Corruption also 
reinforces business responsibility towards complying with applicable laws, an aim that has 
been pursued in the last decade by several initiatives focused on making companies respect 
human rights. The United Nations Global Compact, for example, aims to make companies 
embrace 10 principles in the areas of labour, environment, anti-corruption, and human 
rights. In the same vein, the &quot;Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights&#8221; (see 
A/HRC/17/31, annex) set a framework based on (a) the State duty to protect against human 
rights abuses, (b) the corporate responsibility to comply with and respect all applicable laws 
and human rights, and (c) the need for greater access to effective remedies by victims in 
order to achieve &#8220;the effective prevention of, and remedy for, business-related human rights 
harm&#8221;.38 These complementary initiatives should reinforce the implementation of the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption.  
</p>
<p><b>  Freezing or restraining and confiscating 
</b></p>
<p>46. The adoption of measures aimed at freezing, restraining and confiscating funds of 
illicit origin need not be detrimental to due-process rights, neither to defendants nor to asset 
holders, being in criminal or civil procedures. Some provisions recommended by the United 
Nations Convention against Corruption have been previously challenged on a human rights 
basis. Article 31, paragraph 8, recommends requiring an offender to demonstrate the lawful 
origin of not only the alleged proceeds of crime but also of other property liable to 
confiscation. Similar provisions were analysed in a set of precedents that established the 
conditions that must be met in order not to violate due-process rights. Such precedents held 
that the right to be presumed innocent is not an absolute right,39 and that legal presumptions 
in criminal law are not per se restrictive to such right as long as States take into account the 
importance of what is at stake, and respect the right to defense.40 Thus, as far as in 
employing presumptions State parties conduct a balancing approach and so far as the means 
employed are reasonably proportionate to the legitimate aim sought to be achieved, 
challenges based on the presumption of innocence will not succeed.41 The possibility of 
non-conviction-based confiscations was also upheld on the grounds that, depending on how

<p>it is domestically regulated, confiscation of proceeds of crimes might not be a punitive 
sanction but rather a remedial measure.42  
</p>
<p>47. Provided that provisional measures are taken within these limits, their successful 
adoption requires active cooperation between the country harmed by corruption and the 
country to which the proceeds of corruption were exported. While these measures may be 
adopted by any competent authority (art. 31), given their restrictive nature they usually take 
place within the framework of judicial proceedings. In the context of mutual legal 
assistance, taking such measures is conditioned upon the requiring jurisdiction having 
initiated a criminal investigation. This is coherent with State parties&#8217; obligations to 
criminalize several corruption-related offences,43 to establish liability of legal persons,44 set 
a long statute-of-limitations period for proceedings related to corruption offences and a 
longer statuteof limitations &#8211; or its suspension &#8211; for cases in which the alleged offender has 
evaded the administration of justice,45 and endeavour to ensure that any discretionary legal 
powers relating to the prosecution of these offences are exercised to maximize the 
effectiveness of law enforcement measures.46 
</p>
<p>48. Thus, the process aimed at freezing or restraining and confiscating funds of illicit 
origin is grounded in two well-established human rights principles, that of international 
cooperation towards the realization of human rights, and that of the States&#8217; duty to 
investigate human rights violations.47 The latter has been interpreted as applicable to 
corruption offences on the grounds that corruption directly, indirectly or remotely harms 
human rights.48 The applicability of the former, on the other hand, is consistent with the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption. And both are consistent with the Accra 
Agenda for Action.  
</p>
<p><b>  Returning proceeds of corruption 
</b></p>
<p>49. The United Nations Convention against Corruption envisages two major legal 
avenues for repatriating proceeds of corruption: direct recovery and international 
cooperation. Under the heading of &#8220;direct recovery&#8221;, article 53 groups instances in which 
the victim country stands before the recipient country&#8217;s courts. These instances do not 
</p>
<p>present repatriation issues, as the country acts as a plaintiff and courts in recipient countries 
directly order restitution or compensation or recognize damages in their favor.   
</p>
<p>50. International cooperation, on the contrary, refers to cases where the victim country 
exercises jurisdiction to prosecute the crime of corruption and requests mutual legal 
assistance to the recipient country to trace, freeze, confiscate and repatriate its proceeds. 
The rules for the return of assets to the countries of origin are only established for cases 
where the victim country requests assistance.

</p>

<p>51. Mandatory provisions for repatriation follow the principle of prior ownership 
(ownership at the time of the offence).49 According to article 57, paragraph 3 ,of the United 
Nations Convention against Corruption, the return of proceeds of embezzlement of public 
funds or of laundering of embezzled public funds &#8211; where prior ownership of the victim 
state is assumed &#8211; is mandatory, provided that property has been (a) confiscated, (b) this 
has been done at the request of the victim country and that (c) it was done on the basis of a 
final judgement in the requesting State party, a requirement that can be waived by the 
requested State party. 
</p>
<p>52. By contrast, return of proceeds of any other offence covered by the Convention 
against Corruption under both the mandatory and non-mandatory provisions, is conditioned 
by the requesting party&#8217;s reasonable establishment of its prior ownership of such 
confiscated property. When this condition cannot be met, return is still possible, although 
not mandatory, if the requested State party is able to recognize damage to the requesting 
State party. In all other cases, State parties are required to give priority consideration to 
returning confiscated property to the requesting State party, returning such property to its 
prior legitimate owners or compensating the victims of the crime (art. 57, para. 3 (c)). 
</p>
<p>53. Lastly, article 57, paragraph 5, establishes that, where appropriate, States Parties 
may also give special consideration to concluding agreements or mutually acceptable 
arrangements, on a case-by-case basis, for the final disposal of confiscated property. 
</p>
<p>54. The more successful these procedures are in returning proceeds of corruption to their 
countries of origin, the more resources States will have for complying with their duties to 
respect, protect, and fulfil human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, 
should the repatriated funds be spent in line with the human rights-based approach. 
</p>
<p>55. An example in this direction, going even beyond conventional requirements, is 
provided by the Swiss Restitution of Illicit Assets Act. This piece of legislation provides for 
the autonomous freezing, forfeiture and restitution of the assets of politically exposed 
persons in cases where a request for mutual legal assistance fails due to the impossibility of 
the requesting State to meet the standards required by the Swiss legislation. In such cases, 
the act allows Swiss courts to presume the illicit nature of the assets, provided that the 
patrimony of the politically exposed person is clearly disproportionate to its legal sources of 
income and that the degree of corruption of the State or of such person is notoriously high. 
In those cases, if the politically exposed person is unable to prove the legal acquisition of 
the assets, these will be confiscated and returned to the country of origin for investments in 
programmes directed at improving the living conditions of the population, strengthening the 
rule of law, and/or combating impunity. 
</p>
<p>56. Another important development is the recommendation that countries engage in a 
broader international policy debate about how assets-repatriation can be incorporated into 
the settlement agreements achieved in foreign bribery cases under the legislation 
implementing the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  
Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business 
Transactions.50   
</p>
<p>57. As mentioned in paragraph 51 above, the rules governing the return of assets to the 
country of origin require that the assets had been confiscated at the request of the victim 
country. In other words, if confiscation did not occur at the request of the victim country or 
if the proceeds of corruption were recovered through a legal mechanism other than

<p>confiscation, such instances are out of the scope of the obligation to return established by 
the United Nations Convention against Corruption.  
</p>
<p>58. The progress made in the last decade in enforcing the OECD Anti-Bribery 
Convention is of extreme importance in this regard. Almost all cases of foreign bribery 
have been settled in the jurisdictions where the company doing the bribery is headquartered 
or lists its shares. Settlements neither involve traditional confiscation procedures nor the 
participation of the victim country. Table 1 compares estimated amounts of proceeds of 
corruption repatriated to the countries of origin to estimated amounts recovered by 
members of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention in foreign bribery cases since 2005, when 
the United Nations Convention against Corruption entered into force. The data is not meant 
to be precise, but illustrative for the purposes of the argument.

<p>59. Both criminal fines and &#8220;disgorgement&#8221; or surrender of profits exceed the total 
amount of funds of illicit origin repatriated to the countries of origin. Criminal fines are 
punitive in nature and therefore are imposed in order to deter the offender and/or the 
general population.52 By contrast, disgorgement of profits is a remedial measure that forces 
a defendant to &#8220;return&#8221; the profits of crime to the State, an objective aligned with the 
</p>
<p>purposes of returning assets at the country of origin.  
</p>
<p>60. Disgorgement of profits is a remedy originally designed for domestic cases. 
However, when extraterritorially applies to foreign bribery cases it opens the question of 
</p>
<p>  
 51 Asset Recovery Watch (http://assetrecoverywatch.worldbank.org/) was used to retrieve data about 
</p>
<p>assets repatriated to their country of origin; the Trace Compendium 
(https://secure.traceinternational.org/Knowledge/Compendium.html) was used to retrieve data on 
combined penalties imposed in foreign bribery cases.  
</p>

<p>whether the public treasury of the jurisdiction where the briber is head-quartered or lists its 
shares is the rightful destination for such funds. Neither the enforcement agency nor the 
society it represents has been the prior owner of such assets. On the contrary, in most cases 
of procurement of public goods and services, where foreign bribery usually takes place, it is 
the society where the contract was awarded who suffers from the consequences of 
corruption. 
</p>
<p>61. Pursuant to the United Nations Convention against Corruption, in foreign bribery 
cases, the State party should return the confiscated assets when the requesting State party 
reasonably establishes its prior ownership or when the requested State party recognizes 
damage as a basis for return. Foreign bribery usually takes place in the context of public 
procurement contracts. The bribe may be a form of reducing fair competition in the tender, 
overpricing the contract and arranging for underperformance of some services. In each 
case, the question of prior ownership and compensation should be open to discussion. 
</p>
<p>62. As a consequence, it is consistent with article 57, paragraph 3 (b), of the United 
Nations Convention against Corruption to require jurisdictions enforcing the Convention on 
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. This is 
especially true when negotiating and settling cases, to include a procedure directed to allow 
victim countries to argue their prior ownership and, if successful, provide for the return of 
the disgorged profits to the country of origin. Given the obstacles to mutual legal assistance 
and the successful alternative ways to recover proceeds of corruption developed by the 
jurisdictions enforcing the Convention on Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in 
International Business Transactions, this solution is consistent with the objectives and 
purposes of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (art. 1). This procedure 
would further be enhanced if the recipient countries made the processes public, thus 
allowing for the human rights-based approach principle of participation to play a role, 
especially given the different interests that society and public officials of the country of 
origin may have. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>In order to diminish the negative impact of the non-repatriation of funds of 
illicit origin to the country of origin on the enjoyment of human rights, especially on 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic, social and cultural rights, the following measures are recommended: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a)  All stages of the asset-recovery process should be understood as 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprising mutual responsibilities of States, which should make every effort to 
</b></p>
<p><b>achieve the return of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin. Such efforts must 
</b></p>
<p><b>be in line with international human rights law for the benefit of societies affected by 
</b></p>
<p><b>corruption and should include: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Applying the human rights principles of accountability, transparency 
</b></p>
<p><b>and participation in order to improve prevention and detection procedures at 
</b></p>
<p><b>the countries of origin and the fair administration of justice;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (ii) </b>Affirming States&#8217; obligation to investigate and prosecute corru<b>ption, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthening criminal proceedings directed at freezing or restraining funds of 
</b></p>
<p><b>illicit origin at both countries of origin and recipient countries; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (iii) Lowering the barriers that recipient countries impose on requiring 
</b></p>
<p><b>jurisdictions at the tracing stage, especially taking into account the risks of 
</b></p>
<p><b>dissipation of funds; and </b></p>


<p><b> (iv) When appropriate, recipient countries of funds of illicit origin should de-
</b></p>
<p><b>link confiscation measures from a requirement of conviction in the country of 
</b></p>
<p><b>origin; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b)  Repatriated funds of illicit origin should be allocated to the realization of 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic, social, and cultural rights in compliance with the maximum-available 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources principle, through decision-making processes and implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures that incorporate the principles of transparency, participation, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c)  The human rights standard of providing effective remedies directed at 
</b></p>
<p><b>creating conditions for avoiding new human rights violations should be applied to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>context of repatriation agreements; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d)  A wide and participatory policy debate should be oriented to achieve a 
</b></p>
<p><b>better articulation between the procedures implementing the Convention on Bribery 
</b></p>
<p><b>of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and the obligations 
</b></p>
<p><b>established by the United Nations Convention against Corruption with regard to asset 
</b></p>
<p><b>recovery, so that countries of origin have the opportunity to claim prior ownership 
</b></p>
<p><b>over remedial sanctions imposed by recipient countries of funds of illicit origin; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Human rights-based policy coherence is of essential importance in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>deliberations and actions by Member States at the Human Rights Council in Geneva 
</b></p>
<p><b>and at the intergovernmental process of the implementation of the United Nations 
</b></p>
