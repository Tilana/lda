IN THE MAGISTRATE'S COURT (FAMILY DIVISION) AT LAUTOKA

Family Case No 142 / 09

BETWEEN

PRABHA KARAN
Applicant

AND

DAMYANTI
Respondent

RULING

1.      
The applicant, Prabha Karan filed an application for dissolution of marriage on the 01st April 2009 with an attached marriage certificate bearing a note " This Marriage record has been superceded as a result of divorce Case no 102/2005 divorce date 09/06/2005 Court name Nadi Magistrate's Court".

2.      
When the case was called on the 18th September 2009 the counsel for the Applicant informed court that the applicant is challenging the decree Nisi and Absolute granted on 09/06/05 and informed court that he requires time to make necessary application. On the date this case was first called no affidavit of service of the application for dissolution for marriage is filed and it does not appear that the application is served on the Respondent.

3.      
After three adjournments the applicant filed an application along with a supporting affidavit on the 10th February 2010 seeking an order to set aside and / or vacate the decree nisi in Action N 102 of 2005.

4.      
In the affidavit the applicant has stated that "upon service of the Divorce proceedings File No. 09/LTK/0142 on the Respondent, the Respondent meet me and told me that they were already divorced". However it should be noted as it was said earlier up to date no affidavit of service is filed although the Respondent says that he got to know about a previous divorce through the Respondent upon the service of divorce proceedings in this case.

5.      
Be that as it may, the applicant has further stated in the affidavit that he overlooked the note on the Marriage certificate when he filed this case. It should be noted that from the very out set the applicant was represented by a counsel and the application itself says that the application was prepared by the lawyer for the applicant. I would like to stress that the note on the marriage certificate is very clear and conspicuous.

6.      
Further the Applicant has stated in the affidavit that "we had already filed the Divorce proceedings in 09/LTK/0142 when the over site was noted". 

7.      
The applicant has stated that his wife obtained the divorce without his knowledge and he has stated in the affidavit "that thereafter I asked my wife, the respondent as to when the Decree Nisi in Divorce Action No 102 of 2005 happened, she said it was done in Nadi Magistrate's Court at the time when we were both residing in Lautoka and she admitted to me that I would not have being served with the Divorce papers and the Divorce was done without my knowledge". 

8.      
It is very clear that the law does not provide for, to vacate or to set aside an order of dissolution of marriage once it is made absolute. The copies of order Nisi dated 09th June 2005 and the Order absolute is filed of record. When this case was first called in court, it was informed to court that the Applicant is challenging the order nisi and absolute. Yet it appears the Applicant made the present application to set aside or to vacate the order nisi although it is already made absolute. It seems the Applicant attempts to suppress the fact that the conditional order has become absolute.

9.      
I am compelled to state that this case does not seem to have filed bona fide. Even if the court believes that the Applicant and his lawyers did not know about the previous divorce case or that they did overlooked the note on the marriage certificate regarding the divorce, still I cannot fathom as to how an application can be made in a different magistrate court to set aside or to vacate an order for dissolution of marriage which was made absolute about 5 years ago. It should be said that the real application of the Applicant is to set aside the final order of the Nadi Magistrate's court although the Applicant is very careful in trying to word it as the "nisi order".

10.     
The applicant was given an opportunity to substantiate his application by way of written submissions. But I do not see any relevant provision is mentioned to be resorted by this court to consider this application. The attempt of the applicant is patently a chase of wild goose and it is more discernible according to the following passages of the written submissions filed by the Applicant;

" That the applicant further submits that the action and the conduct of the respondent amounts to fraud and therefore applying the above principles enumerated in the above cases the decree nisi should be set aside or the maintenance orders be set aside.

The magistrate's court pursuant to the very broad powers given to it under the Family Law Act, Regulations, and Rules set aside the Decree Nisi or at the very least revoke the maintenance orders obtained in the Decree Nisi.

In the event this honourable court is of the view that the action/conduct of the Respondent does not amount to fraud, than it still has the powers to set aside the Decree Nisi invoking its High Court inherent jurisdiction in the interest and administration of justice taking in to account the facts and circumstances of this case.

There is an issue whether or not the Magistrate's Court  family division is now functus. In the event this honourable court is of the view that because the matter has being determined or because the Decree Nisi has become final and therefore cannot preside over the matter, it has powers under the Family Law Act, Rules and Regulations to transfer these proceedings to the High Court- Family Division( Section 28 of the Family Law Act)"

11.     
I will now deal with those varieties of remedies mentioned by the Applicant in his written submissions. Firstly it should be stated that Section 38(2) of the Family Court Act stipulates what remedies available when an order is obtained by fraud and when such remedy can be resorted to. In this case no circumstances warrant this court to consider this application on the basis of fraud.

Section 38(2)  If a conditional order has been made but has not become final, the court by which the order was made may, on the application of a party to the proceedings, or on the intervention of the Attorney General, if it is satisfied that there has been a miscarriage of justice by reason of fraud, perjury, suppression of evidence or any other circumstance, rescind the order and, if it thinks fit, order that the proceedings be re heard.

12.     
Secondly I re iterate that the Family Court Act does not set out any provision to cater to the application made by the Applicant. If the court has no power to set aside the order I do not understand why the Applicant tries to fire a second shot asking at least the maintenance order to be varied. 

13.     
The applicant has thirdly asked to invoke the "High Court inherent jurisdiction in the interest of justice". I should say that this is nothing less than a frivolous and baseless application and I do not understand how the magistrate court could invoke the inherent powers of the High Court.

14.     
Finally it can be seen that the Applicant falls back on to a different position and seeks this court to transfer the case to the High Court under Section 28 of the Family Law Act. According to the provisions laid down in Section 28 the circumstances of this case do not warrant this court to act under Section 28 of the Family Law Act.

15.     
There is no provision in the Family Law Act for the magistrate's Court to set aside or vary an order of dissolution of marriage once a conditional order becomes final. It appears the Applicant in this case acted in a manner which amounts to nothing less than abuse of process. 

16.     
Accordingly I dismiss the application filed on the 10th February 2010 to set aside and / or to vacate the Decree Nisi. Further I dismiss the application for dissolution of marriage since the marriage is already dissolved in Nadi Magistrate's Court case No 102/2005.
