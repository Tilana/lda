GENERAL INFORMATION
Q:   Who is soliciting my proxy?
A:   We, the Board of Directors of Chaparral (the "Board"), are sending you this
     Proxy Statement in connection with our solicitation of proxies for use at
     Chaparral's Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Specified directors, officers,
     and employees of Chaparral may also solicit proxies on our behalf by mail,
     phone, fax, or in person.
Q:   Who is paying for this solicitation?
A:   Chaparral will pay for the solicitation of proxies, including the cost of
     preparing, assembling, and mailing this Proxy Statement, the proxy card,
     the Annual Report and all other materials which may be sent to stockholders
     in connection with this solicitation.
Q:   On what am I voting?
A:   You will have the chance to vote on, specifically:
o    the election of John G. McMillian, James A. Jeffs, David A. Dahl, Ted
          Collins, Jr., Richard L. Grant, Mark L.G. Turner, and Judge Burton B.
          Roberts to the Board; and
o    the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as
          Chaparral's independent auditors for fiscal year 2000.
Q:   Who can vote?
A:   Only holders of Chaparral's Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock at the
     close of business on October 23, 2000, the record date for the Annual
     Meeting, can vote. If you beneficially owned any Common Stock on the record
     date, you have one vote per share of Common Stock. If you beneficially
     owned any Series A Preferred Stock on the record date, you have 8.578 votes
     per share of Series A Preferred Stock. In general, the Securities and
     Exchange Commission defines "beneficial ownership" of shares to mean shares
     over which a person has sole or shared voting or investment power.
Q:   How do I vote?
A:   You may vote your shares either in person or by proxy. To vote by proxy,
     you should mark, date, sign, and mail the enclosed proxy card in the
     postage-paid envelope. Granting a proxy will not affect your right to vote
     your shares if you attend the Annual Meeting and want to vote in person; by
     voting in person you will revoke your proxy. You may also revoke your proxy
     at any time before the voting by providing Chaparral's Secretary written
     notice of your revocation or by submitting a later-dated proxy. If you
     return your proxy but do not mark your voting preferences, Messrs.
     McMillian and Jeffs, the proxy holders, will vote your shares as follows:
o    FOR the election of each of the nominees for director; and
o    FOR the ratification of the appointment of the independent auditors.
Q:   What constitutes a quorum?
A:   On the record date, Chaparral had 12,670,731 shares of Common Stock, issued
     and outstanding and 50,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, issued and
     outstanding. In order for the Annual Meeting to be properly held, a
     majority of the outstanding shares, consisting of our outstanding Common
     Stock and our Series A Preferred Stock on a converted basis (a quorum) must
     be present at the meeting or represented by proxy.

<PAGE>
Q:   What vote is required to approve each proposal?
A:   For the election of directors, the affirmative vote of a plurality of the
     votes cast at the meeting is required for the election of directors. A
     properly executed proxy card marked WITHHOLD AUTHORITY with respect to the
     election of one or more directors will not be voted with respect to the
     director or directors indicated, although it will be counted for purposes
     of determining whether there is a quorum. For all matters other than the
     election of directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast
     by person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting is required for approval of
     such matter. A properly executed proxy marked ABSTAIN with respect to any
     other matter will not be voted, although it will be counted for purposes of
     determining whether there is a quorum. Accordingly, if there are any other
items on which the stockholders vote at the Annual Meeting, an abstention
     will have the effect of a negative vote on such other item.
Q:   What if my shares are held in "street name?"
A:   If you hold your shares in "street name" through a broker or other nominee,
     your broker or nominee may only exercise voting discretion with respect to
     matters deemed routine by The Nasdaq Stock Market, such as the election of
     directors and the selection of independent auditors. On a non-routine
     matter, a broker or other nominee cannot cast a vote (a so-called "broker
     non-vote"). Broker non-votes will not be treated as votes cast, and
     therefore, will not affect the outcome of the matters referred to above.
Q:   Can I vote on other matters?
A:   The matters presented at an annual meeting are limited to those properly
     presented by the Board and those presented by stockholders so long as the
     stockholder gave Chaparral's Secretary prior written notice of the matter
     by April 11, 2000. We do not currently expect any other matter to come
     before the Annual Meeting. If any other matter is presented at the Annual
     Meeting, your signed proxy gives Messrs. McMillian and Jeffs, the proxy
     holders, authority to vote your shares.
Q:   How does the Board recommend I vote on the proposals?
A:   Unless you give other instructions on your proxy card, Messrs. McMillian
     and Jeffs, the proxy holders, on the proxy card will vote in accordance
     with the recommendations of the Board. The Board recommends a vote FOR:
o    the election of the nominated slate of directors (see page 5); and
o    the ratification of the appointment of the independent auditors (see
          page 17).
With respect to any other matter that properly comes before the meeting,
     the proxy holders will vote as recommended by the Board, or if no
     recommendation is given, in their own discretion.
Q:   When are stockholder proposals for the 2001 annual meeting due?
A:   Stockholders interested in presenting a proposal to be considered for
     inclusion in next year's Proxy Statement and form of proxy may do so by
     following the procedures prescribed in Rule 14a-8 under the Securities
     Exchange Act of 1934. To be eligible for inclusion, stockholder proposals
     must be submitted in writing to the Secretary, Chaparral Resources Inc.,
     16945 Northchase Drive, Suite 1620, Houston, Texas 77060, before
     __________, 2001.
Q:   How do I get copies of the exhibits filed with Chaparral's Form 10-K/A?
A:   A copy of Chaparral's Annual Report for 1999, which contains Chaparral's
     Form 10-K/A and consolidated financial statements, was delivered to you
     with this Proxy Statement. Chaparral will provide to any stockholder as of
     the record date, who so specifically requests in writing, copies of the
     exhibits filed with Chaparral's Form 10-K/A for a reasonable fee. Requests
     for such copies should be directed to Assistant Secretary, Chaparral
     Resources, Inc., 16945 Northchase Drive, Suite 1620, Houston, Texas 77060.
     In addition, copies of all exhibits filed electronically by Chaparral may
     be reviewed and printed from the SEC's website at: http://www.sec.gov.

Director Interlocks.
During Chaparral's last fiscal year, Messrs. Jeffs, who is the Co-Chairman
of the Board, and Dahl served on the Compensation Committee of the Board and
acted as officers or directors to Whittier or one of its affiliates. Mr. Jeffs
is a Vice President of Whittier and a Director of Whittier Energy Company. Mr.
Dahl is President of both Whittier and Whittier Energy Company. Whittier
currently owns approximately 18.29% of the outstanding Common Stock of
Chaparral. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" immediately
below for a description of transaction between Whittier and Chaparral.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Allen & Company, Chaparral's largest stockholder, loaned to Chaparral, at
an interest rate of 8% per annum, an aggregate of $700,000 in three transactions
during January 1999 and an aggregate of $1,050,000 in three transactions during
February 1999.
Whittier for which Chaparral's Co-Chairman, Mr. Jeffs, and a Chaparral
director, Mr. Dahl, act as executive officers, loaned Chaparral, at an interest
rate of 8% per annum, an aggregate of $1,000,000 in two transactions in March
1999. Whittier is an affiliate of Chaparral, owning greater than 5% of
Chaparral's outstanding Common Stock.
In March 1999, Chaparral issued a promissory note to Allen & Company, in
the principal amount of $2,769,978, representing an additional $1,000,000 loan
to Chaparral and the retirement of the January and February 1999 notes, plus
accrued interest. In June 1999, Chaparral borrowed an additional $1,000,000 from
Allen & Company. The promissory notes all bore interest at a rate of 8% per
annum.
In August 1999, Chaparral restructured its indebtedness with Allen &
Company to enable Mr. McMillian, Chaparral's Co-Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, to acquire a portion of such indebtedness. In connection with the
restructuring, Allen & Company surrendered its promissory notes, and Chaparral
replaced them with two new promissory notes, each bearing interest at a rate of
8% per annum, in principal amounts of $2,494,978 and $900,000, respectively.
Also related to the restructuring, Chaparral issued to Mr. McMillian two
promissory notes, which also bore interest at 8% per annum. The principal
amounts on those notes were $275,000 and $100,000, respectively.
In August 1999, Chaparral borrowed additional funds from Allen & Company
and Mr. McMillian by the issuance of three demand promissory notes. The
principal amount of the two notes issued to Allen & Company was $280,000, and
the principal amount of the one note issued to Mr. McMillian was $20,000. The
notes all bore interest rates of 8% per annum.
As collateral for the promissory notes issued by Chaparral, each of Allen &
Company, Whittier and Mr. McMillian received a non-exclusive junior security
interest in all of the capital stock of Central Asian Petroleum (Guernsey)
Limited, a subsidiary of Chaparral. These junior security interests in the
shares were to be subordinate to a senior security interest held by Whittier in
the same stock.
The promissory notes held by Whittier, Allen & Company, and Mr. McMillian
permitted the holders to elect to exchange the outstanding balance of the notes,
together with accrued interest, for any convertible securities issued by
Chaparral, including any debt or equity instrument convertible into Common
Stock, on or before March 31, 2000.
In October 1999, Chaparral borrowed $2,000,000 from Allen & Company in
exchange for Chaparral's 8% Non-Negotiable Convertible Subordinated Promissory
Notes, or convertible notes.

of Chaparral's convertible notes in full settlement of an undertaking to Shell
Capital to acquire an aggregate of $4,000,000 of securities or indebtedness of
Chaparral in the event Chaparral had not raised a total of $10,000,000 in equity
or indebtedness on or before September 30, 2000. Chaparral also repaid the
$500,000 promissory note to Whittier in September 2000.

INSIDER PARTICIPATION IN COMPENSATION DECISIONS
                           AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
                        REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Compensation Committee of the Board determines the compensation of the
executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table on page 11. The
Compensation Committee has furnished the following report on executive
compensation in connection with the Annual Meeting:
Compensation Philosophy.
As members of the Compensation Committee, it is our duty to administer the
executive compensation program for Chaparral. The Compensation Committee is
responsible for establishing appropriate compensation goals for the executive
officers of Chaparral, evaluating the performance of such executive officers in
meeting such goals and making recommendations to the Board with regard to
executive compensation. Chaparral's compensation philosophy is to ensure that
executive compensation be directly linked to continuous improvements in
corporate performance, achievement of specific operations, financial and
strategic objectives, and increases in shareholder value. The Compensation
Committee regularly reviews the compensation packages of Chaparral's executive
officers, taking into account factors which it considers relevant, such as
business conditions within and outside the industry, Chaparral's financial
performance, the market composition for executives of similar background and
experience, and the performance of the executive officer under consideration.
The particular elements of Chaparral's compensation programs for executive
officers are described below.
Compensation Structure.
The base compensation for the executive officers of Chaparral named in the
Summary Compensation Table is intended to be competitive with that paid in
comparable situated industries, taking into account the scope of
responsibilities and internal relationships. The goals of the Compensation
Committee in establishing Chaparral's executive compensation program are:
o    to compensate the executive officers of Chaparral fairly for their
          contributions to Chaparral's short-term and long-term performance; and
o    to allow Chaparral to attract, motivate and retain the management
          personnel necessary to Chaparral's success by providing an executive
          compensation program comparable to that offered by companies with
          which Chaparral competes for management personnel.
The elements of Chaparral's executive compensation program are annual base
salaries, annual bonuses and equity incentives. The Compensation Committee bases
its decisions on the scope of the executive's responsibilities, a subjective
evaluation of the executive's performance and the length of time the executive
has been in the position.
During fiscal year ended December 31, 1999, the Compensation Committee
determined not to grant incentive compensation to the executive officers of
Chaparral named in the Summary Compensation Table due to the performance of
Common Stock in relation to the Nasdaq Market Index and the SIC Code Index (see
Stock Performance Graph on page 10).
During 1999, Chaparral retained an outside consulting firm to assist the
Compensation Committee in formulating a new incentive compensation plan to be
implemented in fiscal year 2000. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the
consultant's report has not been finalized.
14
<PAGE>
Executive Compensation Deductibility.
Chaparral intends that amounts paid under Chaparral's compensation plans
generally will be deductible compensation expenses. The Compensation Committee
does not currently anticipate that the amount of compensation paid to executive
officers will exceed the amounts specified as deductible according to Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation.
No executive officer or director of Chaparral serves as an executive
officer, director, or member of a compensation committee of any other entity,
for which an executive officer, director, or member of such entity is a member
of the Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board. There are no other
interlocks.

PROPOSAL TWO
RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board has appointed Ernst & Young LLP, certified public accountants, as
auditors to examine the consolidated financial statements of Chaparral for the
fiscal years ending December 31, 1999 and 2000, and to perform other appropriate
audit and advisory services and is requesting ratification of such appointment
by the stockholders. In the event that the stockholders do not ratify the
appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, the adverse vote will be considered as a
direction to the Board to select other auditors for the next fiscal year.
However, because of the difficulty and expense of making any substitution of
auditors after the beginning of the current fiscal year, it is contemplated that
the appointment for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2000, will be permitted
to stand, unless the Board finds other reasons for making a change. It is
understood that even if the selection of Ernst & Young LLP is ratified, the
Board, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a new independent
accounting firm at any time during the year if the Board feels that such a
change would be in the best interests of Chaparral and its stockholders.
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting,
will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be
available to respond to appropriate questions. This proposal will be approved if
it receives the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of
Common Stock voted or represented and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.
Recommendation of the Board.
The Board recommends that stockholders vote FOR the proposal to ratify the
appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Chaparral's independent auditors for fiscal
year 2000.
OTHER BUSINESS
Management knows of no other business to be presented for action at the
meeting. If other matters properly come before the meeting or any adjournment of
the meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote upon them in accordance with
their best judgment.
By Order of the Board of Directors,
/s/ Alan D. Berlin
