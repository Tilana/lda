<p><b>Introduction 
</b> 
1. In its decision 1998/269, the Economic and Social Council, taking note of Commission on 
Human Rights resolution 1998/72, endorsed the Commission&#8217;s recommendation to establish a 
follow-up mechanism to make further progress towards the realization of the right to 
development as elaborated in the Declaration on the Right to Development, initially for a period 
of three years.  The mechanism included the establishment of an open-ended Working Group 
with a mandate: (a)  to monitor and review progress made in the promotion and implementation 
of the right to development as elaborated in the Declaration on the Right to Development, at the 
national and international levels, providing recommendations thereon and further analyzing 
obstacles to its full enjoyment, focusing each year on specific commitments in the Declaration; 
(b) to review reports and any other information submitted by States, United Nations agencies, 
other relevant international organizations and non-governmental organizations on the 
relationship between their activities and the right to development; and (c) to present for the 
consideration of the Commission on Human Rights a sessional report on its deliberations, 
including advice to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) with regard to the implementation of the right to development, and suggesting 
possible programmes of technical assistance at the request of interested countries with the aim 
of promoting the implementation of the right to development.   
 
2. At its fifth session, in February 2004, the Working Group on the Right to Development 
agreed to recommend to the Commission on Human Rights that it establish a high-level task 
force on the implementation of the right to development, within the framework of the Working 
Group, in order to assist it in fulfilling its mandate as reflected in paragraph 10(a) of Commission 
resolution 1998/7. At its seventh session in January 2006, the Working Group agreed to 
recommend to the Commission to extend the mandate of the Working Group and the high-level 
task force for a further period of one year (see E/CN.4/2006/26, paras. 76 and 77). 
 
3. In its resolution 1/4, the Human Rights Council decided to renew the mandate of the Working 
Group for a period of one year, requested the high-level task force to meet with a view to 
implementing the relevant recommendations contained in the report of the seventh session of the 
Working Group, and requested the Working Group to meet for a period of five working days in 
the first three months of 2007, to consider the findings and recommendations of the task force 
and further initiatives in accordance with its mandate. 
 
4. The third session of the high-level task force on the implementation of the right to 
development took place in Geneva from 22 to 26 January 2007 and submitted its conclusions and 
recommendations contained in its report (A/HRC/4/WG.2/TF/2) for the consideration of the 
Working Group. 
 
5. The Working Group on the Right to Development convened its eighth session in Geneva 
from 26 February to 2 March 2007 to consider the report of the task force and further initiatives 
in accordance with its mandate. 
 
 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  ORGANIZATION OF THE SESSION 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Opening of the session 
</b> 
6. The eighth session of the Working Group was opened by Ms. Kang Kyung-wha, Deputy 
High Commissioner for Human Rights. In her opening address, she welcomed the sustained 
focus by the Working Group and the high-level task force on the operational dimensions of 
realizing the right to development. The Deputy High Commissioner recognized the adoption by 
the Working Group of the criteria for periodic evaluation of global partnerships, as a milestone in 
the right to development process. In this context, she pointed out the positive and encouraging 
responses to this initiative, including from the Human Rights Council and multilateral 
development and financial organizations.  She expressed her deep appreciation to institutional 
members of the task force, such as the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which had 
made noticeable and positive contributions to the work. In relation to the report submitted by the 
task force, she noted the excellent work undertaken on the operationalization and progressive 
development of the criteria. 
 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Election of the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</b> 
7. At its first meeting, on 26 February 2007, the Working Group re-elected by acclamation Mr. 
Ibrahim Salama (Egypt) as Chairperson-Rapporteur.  In his statement following the election, the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group stated that the right to development was moving 
into an era of clarity, implementation and added value through innovative tools. He pointed out 
that the expanding range of actors participating in the right to development debate, the deepening 
involvement of relevant United Nations agencies and international financial institutions, and the 
support of the Secretariat, were factors that had contributed to the success of the third session of 
the task force. He highlighted, inter alia, the already proven usefulness of identified criteria for 
periodic evaluation of Millennium Development Goal 8 in mainstreaming the right to 
development; the consensual approach and political commitment supporting the work; the need 
for additional time and resources for the work of the task force; and that the right to development 
was not a panacea that could solve all world problems, but that could certainly contribute to 
making the world a safer and more just and prosperous place for all people. 
 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Organization of work and adoption of the agenda

</p>
<p><b>II. SUMMARY OF THE PROCEEDINGS 
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Consideration of the report of the high-level task force on the implementation of the 
right to development and consideration of next steps (agenda items 4(a) and (b)) 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>18. Algeria made a general statement on behalf of the Group of African States. Referring to 
resolution 60/251 of the General Assembly, it underscored the centrality of the right to 
development in the framework of promoting and protecting human rights and its importance in 
relation to the mandate of the Human Rights Council. The Group of African States reaffirmed 
that only a non-fragmented approach, including equitable international trade rules and responses 
to energy, raw material and debt burden issues, could reduce the growing gap between 
developing and developed countries. In a framework of fighting poverty, the Group of African 
States called for international cooperation exclusive of conditionality. In relation to the future 
work of the task force, the African Group recommended examining questions contributing to the 
elaboration of a convention on the right to development. 
 
19. Cuba, on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), reasserted the importance and 
centrality of the right to development in the mandate of the Human Rights Council and stressed 
that, since the adoption of the Declaration on the Right to Development,  20 years ago, very little 
had been shown in terms of implementation of this right by the international community. In the 
current globalization context, NAM underscored inter alia the lack of autonomy of developing 
countries as regards decision-making to formulate development policies suitable to their realities; 
unfair trade rules and practices that restrict market access and allow for export subsidies; a 
decrease in and failure to comply with commitments to official development assistance and 
transfer of technology and heavy debt burdens, as a factor of permanent decapitalization of 
developing countries. Referring to the Declaration on the Right to Development, NAM 
reaffirmed the duty of States to cooperate for the creation of conditions conducive to realizing 
the right to development. In this context, it called for international cooperation that is not subject 
to conditionality, nor be treated as a matter of charity. The instrumental nature of Millennium 
Development Goal (MDG) 8 in realizing the other seven Goals was underlined. In the context of 
the work of the task force on the criteria for periodic evaluation of global development 
partnerships from a rights-to-development perspective, NAM called for the identification of gaps 
in the consideration of the various partnerships and contributing to the elaboration of a 
convention on the right to development, in line with the General Assembly resolution 61/169. 
 
20. In a general statement on behalf of the European Union (EU), the candidate countries Turkey, 
Croatia and The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the countries of the Stabilization and 
Association Process and potential candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, 
Serbia, and the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) country Norway, member of the European 
Economic Area, as well as Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova, Germany reaffirmed the firm 
commitment of the EU to the realization of the right to development. The EU underscored the 
primary responsibility of States for the promotion and protection of all human rights, including 
the right to development; responsibility to create internal conditions favourable to their 
development, and to cooperate at an international level in eliminating obstacles to development. 
The EU reiterated its support to the work of the task force, and welcomed the development of 
innovative instruments and indicators, as reflected in the consideration of the African Peer </p>

 <p> 
Review Mechanism and providing useful guidance for the implementation of the right to 
development. The development by the task force of an initial implementation checklist in relation 
to the criteria was welcomed (A/HRC/4/WG.2/TF/2, annex III). The EU noted elements of 
clarification of responsibilities between developing countries and development partners (such as 
questions 1-4, and 14-15) and important linkages to a human rights-based approach to 
development, such as non-discrimination, inclusion of vulnerable groups and principles of 
transparency and accountability (e.g. questions 8, 9, 11, 16, 17). The EU recommended the 
examination of sample bilateral partnerships, and also partnerships based on a formal legal 
agreement on development cooperation. By focusing on identified rights, such as rights of the 
child and gender aspects, the EU expressed the view that the Working Group could contribute to 
conceptualizing implementation strategies for particular human rights in the field of development 
cooperation. 
</p><p> 
21. Following these general statements, the Working Group had the opportunity to make general 
comments on the report of the high-level task force (A/HRC/4/WG.2/TF/2). Argentina, 
Bangladesh, Canada, China, Indonesia, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, South Africa and 
Thailand made opening statements on issues relating to the realization of the right to 
development and on the report of the task force. Delegations commended the work of the task 
force, and welcomed its focus on the operative aspects of the right to development and its 
examination of partnerships applying identified criteria. Specific proposals were made to expand 
the coverage and evaluation of partnerships. The categorization of criteria into structure/enabling 
environment, process and outcome, was seen as useful structured approach to reflect the multiple 
dimensions of the criteria and enhance their applicability.  Regarding the initial checklist 
identified by the task force, several delegates considered it to be preliminary, partial and non-
exhaustive. Views in favor of the adoption by the Human Rights Council of a universal periodic 
review that covers the right to development were expressed. 
 
22. In the afternoon meeting, a substantive presentation of the report of the high-level task force 
was done by the Chairperson of the task force, Mr. Stephen Marks. In his introductory remarks, 
Mr. Marks noted that, after a first report focusing on impact assessments and MDGs in general 
and a second on developing criteria for assessing global partnerships as defined by Goal 8 from 
the perspective of the right to development, the third report covers the task force&#8217;s first attempt to 
apply the 15 criteria to three such partnerships. 
 
23. The African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) is by African States for African States and 
thus difficult to characterize as an MDG 8 global partnership. The task force sought to measure 
the success of APRM and was assisted in this task by a member of the APRM Panel of Eminent 
Persons, a member of the APRM Secretariat and the Executive Secretary of Ghana&#8217;s APRM 
Governing Council. The focus on governance and accountability and the degree of local 
ownership and outreach to civil society in the case of Ghana were remarkable. The APRM also 
demonstrates the potential advantage of integrating the normative framework of the African 
Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the Declaration on the Right to Development into the 
review process; the potential advantage of developing a transparent process for dealing with 
country follow-up to shortcomings the review process might uncover and to improving the 
response of regional and international partners to opportunities to advance the right to 
development among participating countries.    
 </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>24. Regarding the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)-Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development/Development Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC) Mutual 
Review of Development Effectiveness in the context of the New Partnership for Africa&#8217;s 
Development (NEPAD), the task force welcomed OECD&#8217;s plan to issue its Action-Oriented 
Policy Paper on human rights and development (DCD/DAC(2007)15/FINAL) and the strategic 
shift towards greater civil society participation; however, the Mutual Review would gain by 
explicit attention to human rights including the right to development. 
 
25.  In the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the task force noted the value to be gained 
from greater attention to ownership, to gender equality and to the research commissioned by 
OECD on the systematic integration of human rights into the five major themes of aid 
effectiveness. 
 
26. Mr. Marks then pointed out that the conclusions and recommendations of the task force relate 
to refining the periodic evaluation and extending them to the Cotonou Partnership Agreement 
and the World Bank Africa Action Plan. Finally, he identified continuity in the assessment 
process, methodological rigor, and attention to the political will of governments and other actors 
to take the right to development seriously, as the three conditions for the success of assessment 
of global partnerships from the right to development perspective. 
 
27. Considering the recommendations in the task force report, the Working Group discussed the 
articulation and structuring of the criteria for periodic evaluation of global development 
partnerships from a right-to-development perspective and the implementation checklist (see 
A/HRC/4/WG.2/TF/2, annex III). Proposals were made to refer more explicitly in the criteria and 
checklist to, inter alia, principles of sustainable development, democracy, governance, 
transparency and accountability, issues on trade, aid, debt burden and technological transfer. 
Several delegates argued for more systematic and explicit linkages between the criteria and the 
checklist by subsuming the latter under the former. The view was expressed that, 
notwithstanding the right of each State to freely choose its own development strategy and 
priorities, the impacts of tied aid are not necessarily negative in all circumstances. Several 
delegates also expressed the view that the checklist was unbalanced between developing and 
developed countries. In relation to their trade component, several delegates expressed interest in 
considering for examination by the task force the Cotonou Partner Agreement between ACP 
countries and the EU. The representative of the World Bank (WB) presented the WB Africa 
Action Plan and outlined reasons for having it considered in light of the identified criteria, 
highlighting multiple aspects addressed by the plan, including on aid, trade, debt relief and role 
of non-State actors issues. 
 
28. In the ensuing discussion, the Working Group considered the report of the task force and 
discussed: the general conclusions; the pilot application of the criteria; refinement of the criteria 
and other methodological considerations; follow up to the review of global partnerships; and the 
articulation and structuring of the criteria for periodic evaluation of global development 
partnerships from a right-to-development perspective and the implementation checklist.  
 
29. Switzerland, Bangladesh, the Islamic Republic of Iran, China, Egypt, Germany, Rwanda, 
South Africa, Argentina, and representatives of OECD and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation (FES) </p>

 <p> 
raised questions or made comments about the conclusions and recommendations of the task force 
report, which were addressed by the chairpersons of the Working Group and the task force. 
</p><p> 
30. It was pointed out that APRM is a South-South partnership and the Paris Declaration is a 
North-South partnership; some degree of skepticism was expressed as to the value of deeper 
analysis of these partnerships. The Chairperson of the task force explained that success of APRM 
should be seen by developed countries as being consistent with mutual responsibility of the 
developing countries, and deeper dialogue and analysis can contribute to ameliorating the 
functioning of these partnerships, including greater responsiveness of developed countries to the 
needs of developing countries.  
 
31. Other comments highlighted the role of the task force and the Working Group in addressing 
the issue of policy space on the right to development and requested clarification of the reference 
to the &#8220;elaboration of a comprehensive and coherent set of standards to asses the implementation 
of the right to development&#8221; in the conclusions, and supported expansion of the role of the task 
force to elaborate on these standards as basis for a treaty rather than an assessment tool. Mr. 
Marks recalled that elaborating an international convention was not part of the mandate of task 
force; however, if it succeeded in creating a consensus around a set of standards on implementing 
the right to development with a wide enough range of partners, those standards might be widely 
accepted as a basis for consideration of a treaty at a later stage.  
 
32. Mr. Salama pointed out that the conditions are ripe for elaborating standards for 
implementing the right to development and that five elements were needed for creation of 
normative standard: (a) a social demand; (b) precision of content (and not defining of 
redefining); (c) the political will to support the outcome; (d) the element of application or 
implementation; (e) a follow-up mechanism. He also highlighted that the key notion of this 
conclusion was &#8220;to facilitate&#8221; the creation of a conducive environment for elaborating on 
standards. 
 
33. NAM declared for the record that a majority of States was in favour of an international 
legally binding instrument on the right to development, and that it should be reflected explicitly 
in the conclusions and recommendations of the Working Group. 
 
34. Other delegates proposed that bilateral development partnerships be also considered by the 
task force. As an observer, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation proposed to conduct an evaluation of 
selected bilateral partnerships along the lines of the criteria and checklist of the task force.  
 
35. A number of other comments focused on expanding the work of the task force to cover other 
areas in addition to aid effectiveness (e.g., trade, transfer of technology, migration, etc.) and 
other regions in addition to Africa (e.g., Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe). The 
Chairperson of the task force stated that it was conscious of the need to focus on other regions, 
including Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America and hoped that thematic expansion would be 
achieved by, inter alia, engaging WTO and UNCTAD more actively in the work of the task 
force. UNICEF presented some initiatives it had launched since the first session of the high level 
task force and which are directly relevant to the work of the task force, in particular analysis of 
debt assistance to Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and a project on social 
budgeting. UNEP, for its part, stressed its interest in engaging with the task force in relation to </p>

 <p> 
the principle of sustainable development, given the link between development and the 
environment.  
</p><p> 
36. Another delegate underlined the importance of engaging civil society and ensuring the 
participation of the most marginalized in partnerships under review. Some delegates also 
underlined the importance of clarifying that the criteria equally applied to all parties to a 
partnership. 
 
37. On the recommendations for a continued dialogue with the partnerships that were reviewed 
by the task force, and the addition of new partnerships, some delegates reiterated the fact that all 
the previous partnerships reviewed by the task force were related to Africa and requested that the 
review in the next phase of the task force activities be limited to the Cotonou partnership, 
without excluding the possibility of reviewing other partnerships at a later stage. 
 
38. Several delegates and groups reiterated their position that the work of the task force 
contribute to an eventual elaboration of a convention on the right to development. However, 
other delegations and groups opposed any reference to starting work on drafting such a 
convention or an automatic link between the work of the task force and a convention. The 
Chairperson of the Working Group called upon the delegates to focus on common ground, such 
as the importance of the right to development and the primary objective of its implementation 
and realization. The Chairperson pointed out that the work of the task force was focused on 
precision of the content of the right to development, which would be a prerequisite for any move 
towards an international legal instrument on the right to development. 
 
39. Concerning the recommendation that the task force undertake technical missions to continue 
the dialogue with the partnerships hitherto considered, as well as to continue the work on refining 
the criteria, Japan stated that it reserved its position on the possibility of undertaking such 
missions in the context of negotiations concerning a resolution on the right to development at the 
fourth session of the Human Rights Council. 
 
40. Finally the proposal to add two days to the next meeting of the task force was supported by 
the Working Group, as well as the recommendation to request the Human Rights Council to 
renew the mandate of the Working Group and the task force for a period of two years. 
 
</p>
<p><b>B. Consideration of the reports of the United Nations High Commissioner 
 for Human Rights</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>41. The Working Group considered the reports of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights on the right to development (E/CN.4/2006/26 and A/HRC/4/55), which were 
presented by the secretariat, and discussed the type of support that the Working Group and the 
task force would need from OHCHR for the work ahead. Both the Chairperson of the task force 
and the Chairperson of the Working Group expressed their deep appreciation for the high-quality 
level of substantive and material support and assistance provided by the Secretariat on this 
mandate and stated that the support of the Secretariat in continuing reviews of the previous 
partnerships, as well as in reviewing new partnerships, would be essential. 
 </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>42. Mr. Salama also noted that the work of the task force and the Working Group would bolster 
the High Commissioner&#8217;s own efforts to encourage implementation of the right to development 
in the future.    
 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Address by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b> 
43. In her closing statement to the Working Group, the High Commissioner welcomed the 
constructive participation by a large number of States and institutions and she congratulated the 
Chairperson of the Working Group on his able leadership and guidance in the process. The 
Working Group&#8217;s criteria for evaluating global development partnerships, in her view, offered 
potentially valuable tools for States, development practitioners and other relevant entities striving 
for more effective global partnerships.  
 
44. She said that a focused and strategic approach, such as the one taken by the Working Group 
and the task force, was promising for the consolidation of the right to development as an 
operational concept, while minimizing the risks of &#8220;partnership proliferation&#8221;, which might 
otherwise tax limited resources and institutional capacities at the national and international 
levels, and offered a workable balance between ambition and pragmatism, aiming towards 
impact.    
 
45. She welcomed these challenging and positive developments, and their potential to bolster her 
own efforts to promote the right to development and to deepen the dialogue with multilateral and 
regional development, trade and financial institutions. She concluded by underlining that 
OHCHR would continue to provide the highest level of support to the Working Group and the 
task force in its work on the practical application of these criteria and in all its other efforts to 
advance the right to development.

<p><b>III. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
46. Based on the discussions in the Working Group, the Chairperson prepared and 
circulated his draft text for the conclusions and recommendations of the eighth session of 
the Working Group.  The draft text was subsequently discussed, negotiated and amended 
by delegations.  At its final meeting on 2 March 2007, the Working Group adopted, by 
consensus, its conclusions and recommendations. All regional groups and several States 
expressed their appreciation for the outcome of the Working Group, the able guidance by 
the Chairperson, the high quality of support provided by the secretariat, and the quality of 
work of the task force. 
 
47. In conclusion, the Chairperson stated that the conclusions and recommendations 
adopted by consensus by the Working Group represented a major breakthrough in the 
right to development process, and he thanked all delegations for their contributions to this 
achievement. After adoption by consensus of the conclusions and recommendations, several 
States and groups presented explanations of their positions with regard to the conclusions 
and recommendations, namely the NAM, Canada, the EU, and Australia (see annex III).

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>A. Conclusions 
 
48. The Working Group takes note with appreciation of the report of the high-level task 
force on the implementation of the right to development, as well as the general approach 
that the high-level task force has outlined in applying the criteria based on the right-to-
development framework to selected development partnerships, consistent with the objective 
to move the right to development from conceptual debates and general principles to its 
operationalization.  
 
49. The Working Group recognizes the value-added of developing concrete 
implementation criteria based on the Declaration on the Right to Development and the 
work undertaken by the follow-up mechanism established by the Commission on Human 
Rights resolution 1998/72, including the current Open-ended Working Group, and 
applying them to the global partnership for development, as defined in Millennium 
Development Goal 8.  The application of these criteria facilitates the incorporation by 
current and future partnerships of essential elements of the right to development into their 
respective operational frameworks, thereby furthering the implementation of the right to 
development and, at the same time, providing the empirical basis for progressively 
developing and refining these criteria.   
 
50. The Working Group agrees that there is a need to take this work forward through 
both a deeper dialogue with the three partnerships examined by the high-level task force at 
its third session and the evaluation of additional partnerships dealing with other aspects of 
international cooperation, including trade, aid, debt, technology transfers, migration, and 
other issues identified under Goal 8, in a step-by-step and an analytically rigorous manner. 
 
51. The Working Group recognizes that the right-to-development criteria would benefit 
from further review of their structure, coverage of aspects of international cooperation 
identified under the MDG 8 and of the methodology for their application.  The current 
objective of such elaboration should be to enhance the criteria as a practical tool for 
evaluating global development partnerships from the perspective of the right to 
development, including by actors in the relevant partnerships themselves.  In this regard, 
the Working Group encourages the task force to provide a consistent mapping of the 
criteria and relevant checklists, viewing the latter as operational sub-criteria, for the 
consideration of the Working Group.  
 
52. The Working Group agrees that the ongoing work of the task force constitutes a 
process of progressively identifying and refining right-to-development standards. The 
experience gained from further work of the task force in applying, refining and developing 
the criteria would be conducive to the elaboration and implementation of a comprehensive 
and coherent set of standards. These standards could take various forms, including 
guidelines on the implementation of the right to development, and evolve into a basis for 
consideration of an international legal standard of a binding nature, through a 
collaborative process of engagement.

<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b> 
53. <b>The Working Group recommends that the right-to-development implementation 
criteria, as adopted by the Working Group at its seventh session, be further applied to 
identified global development partnerships, progressively developed and refined, using the 
approach outlined by the task force in its report (A/HRC/4/WG.2/TF/2) and in light of the 
specific suggestions made at the eighth session of the Working Group. </b> 
 
54. <b>In this context, the Working Group recommends that the task force adopt a gradual 
approach based on rigorous empirical analysis and constructive consolidation of its 
findings in a phased manner. In phase I, covering work in 2007, the task force is requested 
to deepen its study on the three development partnerships considered in its third session, 
and take up an additional partnership (mentioned in paragraph 56  below) with a view to 
refining the right to development criteria and corresponding sub-criteria. In phase II, 
covering work in 2008, the task force is requested to study additional partnerships with a 
view to broaden its coverage of the regions implementing development partnerships, as well 
as its analysis of thematic issues of international cooperation identified under MDG 8 and 
as agreed by the Working Group at its ninth session. Finally in phase III, covering work in 
2009, the task force is requested to consolidate its findings and present a revised list of right 
to development criteria along with corresponding operational sub-criteria and outline 
suggestions for further work, including aspects of international cooperation not covered 
until then, for the consideration of the Working Group.</b> 
 
55. <b>The Working Group recommends that the current dialogue concerning the APRM, 
the ECA/OECD-DAC Mutual Review of Development Effectiveness and the Paris 
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness be continued to elaborate on areas of potential congruence 
and synergy of each of these partnerships with the right to development, identify existing 
gaps in light of the criteria, as they exist now, as well as appropriate additional means to 
bridge them, and in the process progressively develop and further refine the criteria, based 
on actual practice.  In this regard, the Working Group encourages the task force to 
undertake technical missions, as required, to the respective institutions involved in the 
implementation of these partnerships, with a view to continuing the dialogue and to further 
refining the criteria.</b> 
 
56. <b>The Working Group recognizes the need to explore additional strategic and 
representative partnerships in the context of MDG 8.  In this regard, the Working Group 
decides that priority be given initially to the Cotonou Partnership Agreement between ACP 
countries and the EU.  Thereafter, in accordance with the work in the phases mentioned in 
paragraph 54 above, the Working Group recommends that further additional partnerships 
be examined in light of the criteria.</b> 
 
57. <b>In implementing the follow-up work on operationalizing the right-to-development 
criteria, the Working Group recommends the continuing active participation of 
international financial, trade and development institutions, including the World Bank, 
UNDP, IMF, UNCTAD and WTO, other specialized agencies, funds and programmes of 
the United Nations, and relevant civil society organizations. The task force is encouraged in </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>its engagement with the World Bank on Africa Action Plan, as well as UNDP with regard 
to its work on inclusive globalization.</b> 
 
58. <b>In order to implement the work programme outlined above, the Working Group 
recommends that the Human Rights Council renew the mandate of the Working Group 
and the high-level task force on the implementation of the right to development for a 
further period of two years. During this period, it is recommended that the Working Group 
will continue to meet annually for five working days, as at present, and that the high-level 
task force will meet annually for a total of seven working days instead of the five days at 
present.</b> 
 
59. <b>The Working Group appreciates the support extended by the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to the Working Group and the high-level task force and 
requests that the Office continue to provide all necessary assistance to these bodies in 
implementing the work programme outlined above.</b>

<p><b>Annex III 
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>COMMENTS SUBMITTED BY GROUPS AND MEMBER STATES 
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Explanation of position by the Non-Aligned Movement</b> 
 
60. The Non-Aligned Movement interprets the phrase &#8220;international legal standard of a 
binding nature&#8221;, contained in paragraph 52 of the conclusions and recommendations, to mean 
&#8220;internationally legally binding convention.&#8221;  
 
<b>Explanation of position by Canada 
 
</b>61. Canada is pleased with the Working Group&#8217;s work at its eighth session, during which the 
report of the high-level task force was analyzed in depth. Canada supports the task force&#8217;s 
continued focus on developing criteria and other practical tools for evaluating global partnerships 
on a voluntary basis, as well as the proposed pilot partnerships and program of work. Canada can 
also support the proposed renewed mandate for a period of two years, as outlined in the 
recommendations section of the Working Group outcome document.  
 
62. Canada would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that it does not believe it is 
appropriate for the Working Group or high-level task force to consider the development of a 
legally binding instrument on the right to development, as suggested in paragraph 52. It is clear 
from the high-level task force&#8217;s recent report that there is much work to be done on developing 
the criteria to support the practical implementation and operationalization of the right to 
development. In this context, Canada interprets paragraph 52 to not mandate the Working Group 
or task force to look specifically at a binding instrument, but rather that the paragraph is 
suggestive that, in the future, this may be an option of many that may be considered. Canada will 
join consensus with this understanding.  
 
<b>Explanation of position by the European Union 
 
</b>63. The EU expresses its appreciation for the outstanding work of the Chairperson of the 
Working Group and the Chairperson of the task force. The EU values the consensus reached at 
the meeting and hopes that this consensual approach will be preserved in the future. The EU 
would like to clarify its interpretation of paragraph 52 of the adopted conclusions and 
recommendations as follows:  the EU joins consensus on this paragraph on the understanding 
that it does not imply a process leading to an international legal standard of a binding nature. 
Rather, the EU considers that paragraph 52 describes an open-ended process of developing 
criteria promoting the operational implementation of the right to development. 
 
<b>Explanation of position by Australia 
 
</b>64. Australia has serious reservations about the need for the elaboration of an international 
legal standard of a binding nature, and certainly does not believe that the time is now right for 
moving into such a process, having heard many comments from a variety of speakers during the 
course of the eighth session that confirmed this assessment. Australia&#8217;s interpretation of </p>

 <p> 
paragraph 52 is that &#8211; while it does not preclude the possibility that a clear need for the 
elaboration of a legal standard of some form may in time be identified &#8211; it recognizes that the 
reflection of a coherent set of standards could take other forms and that one of these other forms 
may be found to be more appropriate than a legal standard of a binding nature. Therefore, 
paragraph 52 and the other adopted conclusions and recommendations correctly focus attention 
at this stage on the practical work of the task force. This work will serve to provide the tools and 
understanding necessary for taking the work on the right to development forward. It is on this 
understanding of paragraph 52 and the other conclusions and recommendations generally that 
Australia can join the consensus.
