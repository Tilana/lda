<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its thirteenth 
session from 21 May to 4 June 2012. The review of Algeria was held at the 12th meeting on 
29 May 2012. The delegation of Algeria was headed by Mourad Medelci, Minister for 
Foreign Affairs. At its 17th meeting, held on 1 June 2012, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Algeria. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Algeria: Costa Rica, Nigeria, the Philippines. 
</p><p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Algeria: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/13/DZA/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/13/DZA/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/13/DZA/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, 
Slovenia and Sweden was transmitted to Algeria through the troika. These questions are 
available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, in introducing the national report, 
recalled that Algeria was especially interested in the universal periodic review mechanism 
since it was a particularly useful universal tool for assessing and improving the human 
rights situation in the world. 
</p>
<p>6. Since the submission of the country&#8217;s first report on 14 April 2008, Algeria had 
made considerable progress in expanding freedoms and increasing respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>7. He emphasized that the report had been the fruit of an intense interministerial 
consultation process, which had been extended to include other consultative bodies and 
representatives of civil society. A summary was then given of the implementation of 
recommendations accepted during the first review. 
</p>
<p>8. The fight against terrorism had made it necessary to take exceptional measures in the 
1990s to protect people and property. Nonetheless, the State had always respected the law, 
human dignity and basic freedoms.  
</p>
<p>9. Over and above the lifting of the state of emergency in February 2011, terrorism 
cases were now tried in the ordinary courts. 
</p>
<p>10. The moratorium on the death penalty, initiated in Algeria in 1993, was still 
observed. </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.12-14978 
</p>
<p>11. The protection of detainees in police custody was strictly regulated by the Code of 
Criminal Procedure and the Criminal Code, which criminalized torture, and was monitored 
through other measures, such as the visits made to places of detention by the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the National Consultative Commission for the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>12. With regard to the tragic issue of disappeared persons, the Minister referred to the 
statement in the report of the Working Group that it was &#8220;impressed&#8221; by the Algerian 
Government&#8217;s determination to solve the cases before the Group.  
</p>
<p>13. The Minister reported the steps taken to further the dialogue with religious 
minorities, which included authorizing the two Catholic and Protestant associations to 
import Christian literature and the facilitation of entry and residence visa procedures for 
members of religious orders. 
</p>
<p>14. Reiterating Algeria&#8217;s commitment to cooperating with the human rights 
mechanisms, he said that once all the pending visits had been completed, the Government 
would in due course consider the requests to visit submitted by other mandate holders, in 
accordance with the importance of their mandates to Algeria. 
</p>
<p>15. The Minister also reiterated Algeria&#8217;s commitment to the promotion of women&#8217;s 
rights and outlined the legal and practical measures taken to ensure women&#8217;s full 
participation in public life.  
</p>
<p>16. He drew attention to the launch of the 2008&#8211;2015 national plan for children entitled 
&#8220;Algeria Worthy of its Children&#8221;, which aimed to provide for a better life, to guarantee a 
quality education for children and to better protect them against abuse, exploitation and 
violence. 
</p>
<p>17. He also mentioned the criminalization of human trafficking. The Minister recalled 
the progress made in various areas; Algeria was well on the way to attaining the eight 
Millennium Development Goals by the 2015 deadline. 
</p>
<p>18. With regard to the changes under way since 2008, the Minister highlighted the 
political reform process launched by the President in 2011, which was set to culminate with 
the adoption of a new Constitution.  
</p>
<p>19. He stressed that the reforms stemmed from a strong desire to expand democracy in 
Algeria and to fulfil the expectations of the Algerian people. The legislation adopted to that 
end was based on the most progressive standards on the subject, and both established the 
rule of law and enhanced representative democracy in the country.  
</p>
<p>20. It was in that spirit that the legislative elections had been held in optimum conditions 
of transparency and freedom, and in the presence of 500 international observers. Women 
now held 146 of the 426 seats in the new Assembly, or 31.6 per cent. 
</p>
<p>21. Under those reforms, real and broad opportunities had opened up for increasing the 
involvement of civil society in all aspects of public life. 
</p>
<p>22. The Minister reaffirmed the Government&#8217;s determination to consolidate the 
achievements obtained with the reform of the justice system, to further promote the well-
being and potential of young people and to pursue socioeconomic development, in 
particular through its five-year development plan for 2010&#8211;2014. 
</p>
<p>23. With regard to Algeria&#8217;s contribution to international efforts to promote human 
rights, Mr. Medelci confirmed Algeria&#8217;s candidacy to become a member of the Human 
Rights Council for the 2014&#8211;2016 mandate.  </p>

<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>30. Norway supported Algeria&#8217;s lifting of the state of emergency, but noted that

recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Pakistan welcomed initiatives such as the lifting of the state of emergency. It noted

women&#8217;s participation in decision-making. Pakistan made recommendations. 
</p>

</p>

</b></p>
<p>46. Swaziland commended Algeria&#8217;s efforts to improve the lives of its citizens and its 
leading role in Geneva in defending Africa&#8217;s interests, which showed the importance 
Algeria attached to the promotion and protection of human rights. It appreciated the 
financial contributions made by Algeria to OHCHR and other United Nations institutions. 
</p>
<p>47. Sweden was concerned at reports of torture and ill-treatment in places of detention,

</p>
<p>48. Switzerland expressed concern about discrimination against women in family law

that Algeria had co-sponsored General Assembly resolution 65/2006 in which the 
Assembly called for a worldwide moratorium on the use of the death penalty. Switzerland

</p>
<p>49. Thailand encouraged Algeria to consolidate democracy, the rule of law, the 
independence of the judiciary and respect for human rights in its reform process. It 
welcomed progress made in women&#8217;s participation in politics and decision-making and in 
achieving the MDGs in health and education, but noted that regional disparities persisted. 
Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria thanked the delegations that had made 
statements for their encouragement and their recommendations. Algeria had always had 
faith in all international human rights mechanisms and in the conventions to which it had 
acceded, which consolidated human rights. It had constantly worked to promote 
international cooperation on human rights matters. As a founding member of the Human 
Rights Council, Algeria was involved in the series of reforms under way at the United 
Nations, and supported the reform-minded approach both as a country and as a member of 
regional organizations. The importance Algeria attached to its work with treaty mechanisms 
did not prevent it from continuing to cooperate with other ones as well. In that regard, 
Algeria was cooperating with the special procedures. The Algerian Government had invited 
seven special procedures mandate holders to visit the country. Three visits by special 
rapporteurs had already been carried out: one on violence against women, one on freedom 
of opinion and expression, and one on adequate housing. He reiterated the invitation to the 
other four special rapporteurs, namely those on the rights to education, health, food, and 
safe drinking water and sanitation. Once those visits had been completed, the Algerian 
Government would be willing to examine the possibility of receiving visits from other 
special rapporteurs. Algeria&#8217;s cooperation with universal mechanisms had extended to the 
African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. Two consecutive visits had been 
arranged, in December 2009 and 2010, for two Commission delegations comprising five 
thematic mandate holders. In addition, Algeria had submitted periodic reports to the 
Commission. 
</p>
<p>51. Algeria was emerging from a painful decade that had had major consequences for 
the Algerian people. In that extremely difficult context, the country had had to initiate a 
process of national unity and reform of the legal system to bolster freedoms and democracy. 
</p>
<p>52. The national tragedy had made it necessary to take steps to combat terrorism, which 
had been defeated thanks only to the sacrifices of the security forces and the vigilance and 
participation of the population. The decision to lift the state of emergency, which marked a 
return to order and security, was an important decision, and had been carefully considered. 
It did not, however, preclude the need to exercise vigilance by being particularly careful 
about freely allowing meetings to take place with extensive media coverage. Such </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.12-14978 
</p>
<p>precautionary measures could be relaxed to allow citizens to enjoy the full range of 
possibilities for expressing their views and ideas.  
</p>
<p>53. The right to freedom of expression was guaranteed since the changes made to the 
system in 1989. Freedom of expression had also recently been consolidated with the 
passing of the new 2012 Information Act, which strengthened the protection of journalists 
and opened up television and radio to the Algerian private sector. With regard to the visit 
by the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression, he noted that the Special Rapporteur had 
been able to see for himself the total freedom of expression enjoyed by the people of 
Algeria and the remarkable output of the printed media. The preliminary recommendations 
issued by the Special Rapporteur, Mr. La Rue, after the visit, had already been taken into 
account in the drafting of the new Information Act of 2012. 
</p>
<p>54. With regard to freedom of association, and specifically authorization for the 
establishment of associations &#8212; be they political or not &#8212; the conditions had improved 
under a new law on the subject. The authorities were now obliged to respond to 
applications within specific deadlines, and denials were subject to appeal in the courts.  
</p><p>55. Turning to the issue of freedom of worship, he referred to the steps taken to better 
guarantee the exercise of that freedom, which included the regularization of the status of the 
Protestant Church of Algeria, the authorization for the two Catholic and Protestant 
associations to import Christian literature and the facilitation of visa procedures for 
members of religious orders. The high-level meetings that Algeria had organized 
demonstrated its desire to consider the matter as part of the dialogue among civilizations. 
</p>
<p>56. The laws passed under the political reforms under way since April 2011 had all been 
adopted in compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As the 
Covenant stipulated that the only acceptable restrictions on the freedoms it established were 
those for which provision was made in domestic law, Algeria was in compliance. 
</p>
<p>57. In the light of the importance attached by delegations to the rights of women and 
children, he highlighted the Algerian authorities&#8217; efforts to increase women&#8217;s participation 
in politics. The constitutional reform of 2008 had paved the way for the latest legislative 
elections, in which the proportion of seats held by women in the National People&#8217;s 
Assembly had increased fourfold. Women were increasingly involved in civil society 
organizations, which were a key element in promoting economic and social development. 
</p>
<p>58. The Minister then gave the floor to another member of the delegation, Ms. 
Boureghda, who referred to the 2010&#8211;2014 National Plan for the Advancement and 
Integration of Algerian Women, which had two main objectives: to ensure that men and 
women benefited equally from national development programmes and to help create a 
favourable climate for the pursuit of sustainable development on the basis of partnership 
between men and women. Cooperation with United Nations agencies and bilateral 
partnerships encompassed several programmes, including some addressing gender equality, 
the empowerment of women, the strengthening of female leadership and the participation of 
women in public and political life in the context of cooperation with international 
organizations. She also presented the national strategy to combat violence against women 
and the measures taken to implement it, which involved the participation of different public 
agencies and civil society organizations. She illustrated her point with examples of the steps 
taken to improve the services provided in women&#8217;s shelters, outreach points and social 
rehabilitation centres for women victims of violence. 
</p>
<p>59. Timor-Leste was confident that the legal, policy and institutional frameworks in 
Algeria would allow it to consolidate and further enhance its achievements. It underlined 
concerns raised by civil society on women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights, disparities in education 
and services in remote areas and youth participation. Timor-Leste made a recommendation. </p>


<p>GE.12-14978 <b>9

achievements regarding women, children, health and education. It made one 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>64. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed legislation to 
improve women&#8217;s participation in public life and the Government&#8217;s interaction with 
religious groups, but noted concerns about the implementation of religious laws at local 
level. It also noted that domestic legislation was not in conformity with international human 
rights obligations regarding freedom of association and expression. It asked when the 
Government would facilitate Special Rapporteur visits. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. The United States of America commended Algeria on partially lifting restrictions on 
freedom of assembly, but was concerned by remaining restrictions on civil society 
organizations under the revised Law on Associations and about continued restrictions on 
free assembly. It was further concerned by reports that many incidents of violence against 
women were insufficiently investigated and prosecuted. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Uruguay welcomed progress made towards achieving the MDGs, legislation 
introducing quotas for women in legislative and local elections and the criminalization of 
trafficking in persons, human organs and migrants in the Criminal Code. It noted that 
corporal punishment was prohibited in schools. It welcomed the signing of the CED.

the institutional, social and economic reforms and the ratification of international

</p>
<p>81. France welcomed the lifting of the state of emergency (2011) but noted with concern 
the persistent restrictions on the enjoyment of fundamental rights It saluted the death

not yet been resolved. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>82. Chad noted Algeria&#8217;s human rights progress since the first review as well as its 
cooperation with OHCHR, treaty bodies and special procedures. It made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>83. In his response to the second round of statements from delegations, the Minister 
addressed the concerns voiced about the issue of disappeared persons, emphasizing the fact 
that if the Algerian people had to choose there and then between security and the broadest 
possible freedom to hold public demonstrations, they would choose security because they 
knew the price of insecurity. The demonstrations held to date had been well handled by the 
security forces. They had fulfilled their role, and if there had been any injuries, they had 
been among their ranks. The security forces had been strictly instructed not to resort to the 
use of force or to carry weapons or tear gas grenades. Although Algeria was completely in 
favour of the full enjoyment of freedoms, vigilance was still called for as long as the 
chapter on terrorism had still not been definitively closed. Vigilance was essential in the 
eyes of the Algerian people, who had had to confront terrorism alone in the face of the 
international community&#8217;s indifference and lack of understanding.  
</p>
<p>84. Returning to the issue of freedom of association, he referred once more to Act No. 
12-06, the Associations Act, of January 2012, noting that it was modelled in keeping with 
article 41 of the Constitution, which guaranteed freedom of association and freedom of 
assembly. At the time the Act was made law, over 90,000 associations had been counted in 
the country, while 15 years earlier there had not been so many. While some had voiced 
concerns about reports of restrictions on the establishment of associations, the situation 
needed to be viewed in context.  
</p>
<p>85. With regard to the foreign funding of associations, the Associations Act did not 
prohibit such funding; on the contrary, it encouraged partnerships, while demanding 
transparency as a precautionary measure required because the State must ensure the 
security of its citizens. The civil society movement was now a source of pride in Algeria, as 
it indicated the progress made in the long march towards democracy on which the country 
had embarked. 
</p>
<p>86. On the subject of children, the Minister referred to the 2008&#8211;2015 national plan for 
children which aimed to protect them from violence and illegal employment. In addition to 
the current legislation to protect children, which included penalties up to imprisonment for 
life, support measures had been put in place, including a monitoring strategy coordinated by 
an inter-agency committee. 
</p>
<p>87. As far as children&#8217;s education was concerned, school attendance had risen to record 
rates at all levels. School attendance for children in rural areas &#8212; a reference point for the 
Millennium Development Goals &#8212; had in some aspects already reached the targets in 
Algeria, in particular in respect of Goal No. 4 and the attendance rate, and also the 
proportion of female students at each level. 
</p>
<p>88. As for regional disparities, since gaining independence, Algeria had pursued 
regional balance and addressed potential imbalances generated by geographical constraints 
in all its development programmes, including the land management plan for up to 2025 and 
the development programme for the high plateaux and the Sahara region.  </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.12-14978 
</p>
<p>89. With regard to the constraints reportedly placed on freedom of worship, he again 
pointed out that decisions had been made to facilitate the granting of visas to members of 
religious orders. 
</p>
<p>90. In response to the fears expressed by some delegations that there were prisoners of 
conscience, he denied the existence of such cases in Algeria, recalling the provisions of the 
Information Act, which had decriminalized press offences. 
</p>
<p>91. The Minister then gave the floor to another member of the delegation, Mr. Rezzag 
Bara, to address the issue of disappeared persons. Mr. Rezzag Bara first placed the issue in 
the context of the wave of terrorism that had gripped the country between 1992 and 1996. 
The acts of terrorism had been perpetrated by a host of armed groups who had often been 
confused with the security forces by the civilian population. 
</p>
<p>92. The situation had given rise to a large number of enforced disappearances, which 
were currently being looked into by Algeria together with the Working Group on Enforced 
or Involuntary Disappearances. Several situations could lead to people disappearing. In 
most cases, relatives had reported a person as missing and accused the security forces of 
being involved at the request of that person, when in fact he or she had voluntarily joined a 
group of armed terrorists. Nevertheless, all families of victims of enforced disappearances 
had been taken into account under the provisions of the Charter for Peace and National 
Reconciliation.  
</p>
<p>93. The compensation provided under the Charter could take the form of a monthly 
payment or a one-off payment depending on the family&#8217;s situation. A total of 2,960 cases 
had been listed by the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. In over 
1,700 of those cases, the person had been declared legally disappeared and compensation 
had been awarded to the survivors; in over 215 cases, the person in question had been 
identified as a terrorist killed by the security forces, and in over 65 the person had been 
found alive, either in prison or at home. Investigations were under way to resolve the 500 
cases still pending before the Working Group. The Working Group had been invited to visit 
Algeria to examine the documentation related to those cases and possibly to meet with the 
relatives of the persons who had been found alive, as well as with the relatives of those who 
had been declared legally dead and whose family members had thus been awarded 
compensation. A meeting had been scheduled with the Working Group for the following 
July to discuss the arrangements for the visit. 
</p>
