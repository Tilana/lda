to human rights 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> the Declaration on the Right to Development, adopted by the 
General Assembly through its resolution 41/128 on 4 December 1986, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/69 of 20 April 2005, in 
which the Commission established the mandate of Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
enterprises, and all previous Human Rights Council resolutions on the issues of human 
rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, including Council 
resolutions 8/7 of 18 June 2008 and 17/4 of 16 June 2011, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the approval of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 17/4, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking into account</i> all the work undertaken by the Commission on Human Rights 
and the Human Rights Council on the question of the responsibilities of transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises1 with respect to human rights, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><i>Stressing</i> that the obligations and primary responsibility to promote and protect 
human rights and fundamental freedoms lie with the State, and that States must protect 
against human rights abuse within their territory and/or jurisdiction by third parties, 
including transnational corporations, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that transnational corporations and other business enterprises have a 
responsibility to respect human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that transnational corporations and other business enterprises have 
the capacity to foster economic well-being, development, technological improvement and 
wealth, as well as causing adverse impacts on human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the progressive development of this issue, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Decides</i> to establish an open-ended intergovernmental working group on a 
legally binding instrument on transnational corporations and other business enterprises with 
respect to human rights, the mandate of which shall be to elaborate an international legally 
binding instrument to regulate, in international human rights law, the activities of 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises; 
</p>
<p>2.  <i>Also decides</i> that the first two sessions of the open-ended intergovernmental 
working group on a legally binding instrument on transnational corporations and other 
business enterprises shall be dedicated to conducting constructive deliberations on the 
content, scope, nature and form of the future international instrument, in this regard; 
</p>
<p>3.  <i>Further decides</i> that the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the open-ended 
intergovernmental Working Group should prepare elements for the draft legally binding 
instrument for substantive negotiations at the commencement of the third session of the 
working group on the subject, taking into consideration the discussions held at its first two 
sessions; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Decides </i>that the open-ended intergovernmental working group shall hold its 
first session for five working days in 2015, before the thirtieth session of the Human Rights 
Council; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Recommends</i> that the first meeting of the open-ended intergovernmental 
working group serve to collect inputs, including written inputs, from States and relevant 
stakeholders on possible principles, scope and elements of such an international legally 
binding instrument; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Affirms</i> the importance of providing the open-ended intergovernmental 
working group with independent expertise and expert advice in order for it to fulfil its 
mandate; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
provide the open-ended intergovernmental working group with all the assistance necessary 
for the effective fulfilment of its mandate; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Requests </i>the open-ended intergovernmental working group to submit a report 
on progress made to the Human Rights Council for consideration at its thirty-first session; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Decides</i> to continue consideration of this question in conformity with its 
annual programme of work.
