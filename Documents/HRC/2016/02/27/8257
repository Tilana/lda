<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present document is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Juan E. M&#233;ndez, to the Human 
Rights Council, pursuant to its resolution 16/23.  
</p>
<p>2. In the present addendum, the Special Rapporteur provides observations, where 
considered appropriate, on communications sent to States between 1 December 2010 and 
30 November 2011, as well as on responses received from States in relation to these 
communications until 31 January 2012. Communications sent and responses received 
during the reporting period are accessible electronically through hyperlinks. 
</p>
<p>3. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
while countering terrorism, the Vice-Chair of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
and Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, 
sent letters to 59 States  related to the mandate holders&#8223; joint study on global practices in 
relation to secret detention in the context of countering terrorism (A/HRC/13/42).  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the receipt of responses from nine States 
through to 31 January 2012. The current report does not comment on the substance of 
responses received so far to the joint study on secret detention. Subject to agreement with 
the other mandate-holders responsible for that joint report, and after more responses are 
received, a special report on those contributions will be issued. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to all States which have transmitted responses to 
communications sent. He considers response to his communications an important part of 
cooperation by States with his mandate. In this context, the Special Rapporteur recalls 
paragraph 6(a) of the Human Rights Council resolution 16/23 which urges States to 
&#8220;cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of his or her task, to 
</p>
<p>supply all necessary information requested by him or her and to fully and expeditiously 
respond to his or her urgent appeals, and urges those Governments that have not yet 
responded to communications transmitted to them by the Special Rapporteur to answer 
without further delay.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b> II. Observations by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a)   </b>JUA 14/01/2011 Case No. AFG 1/2011  State reply: None to date <b>Alleged detention of 
Christian converts.</b> 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Afghanistan has not 
responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by 
the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged detention and ill-
treatment of two Christian converts, including the assertion that Mr. X was subjected to 
sleep deprivation, sexual abuse, and beatings by prison staff and three other detainees. The 
Special Rapporteur notes that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 
April 2011 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Moreover, as previously </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>asserted by the Special Rapporteur, &#8220;countries should take effective measures to prevent 
prisoner-on-prisoner violence by investigating reports of such violence, prosecuting and 
punishing those responsible, and offering protective custody to vulnerable individuals, 
without marginalizing them from the prison population more than is required by the need 
for protection and without putting them at further risk of ill-treatment&#8221;  (E/CN.4/2003/68, 
para. 26 (j)). Accordingly, based on the information received, the Special Rapporteur 
determines that Mr. X&#8223;s rights under the UN Convention against Torture have been 
violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to immediately release both Mr. 
X and Mr. Y from detention, ensure that they obtain redress, including fair and adequate 
compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible. 
</p>
<p><b>(b)    </b>AL 17/10/2011 Case No. AFG 4/2011 State reply: None to date <b>Alleged torture in 
detention.</b> 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Afghanistan has not 
responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established 
by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged torture of 
conflict-related detainees, including five children, by National Directorate of Security 
officials. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; In light of the fact that no 
evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur finds that the rights of 
the individuals mentioned in the communication under the UN Convention against Torture 
have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to investigate, 
prosecute and punish those responsible and to provide full redress to the victims, especially 
children victims.  
</p>
<p><b>  Angola 
</b></p>
<p>JAL 03/03/2011 Case No. AGO 1/2011 State replies: 30/03/2011 12/04/2011 <b>Alleged mass 
deportations.  
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Angola for its replies to this 
communication. In its first reply, dated 30 March 2011, the Government of Angola 
indicated that it had formed an inter-ministerial committee coordinated by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs to complete an investigation regarding alleged ill-treatment of DRC 
migrants by Angolan Security Forces. In its reply on 12 April 2011, the Government of 
Angola reported on the activities of this &#8220;Multidisciplinary Commission,&#8221; which the 
Government reported &#8220;determined that no facts exist to prove the allegations in [the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council's] letter, but rather the condition of constant violations of the Angolan 
border by DRC citizens.&#8221; The Government reported that this Commission confirmed only 
one case of sexual abuse against a DRC citizen. The Special Rapporteur notes the 
insufficiency of the Government's response to the credible allegations of torture and cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment, particularly in light of allegations of more than 1357 
reported cases of sexual violence and of the use of invasive anal and vaginal searches of 
detainees by Angolan authorities. Based on the information presented, the Special 
Rapporteur concludes that the rights of detainees under the UN Convention against Torture 
have been violated, and calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and independent 
investigation, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full 
redress to the victims. </p>

<p><b>  Argentina 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a)   </b>AL 18/03/2011 Case No. ARG 1/2011 State reply: 07/07/2011 <b>Alegados actos de tortura 
en la C&#225;rcel de Mendoza.   
</b></p>
<p>9. El Relator Especial agradece al Gobierno de Argentina por su respuesta, de fecha 7 
de julio de 2011, a esta comunicaci&#243;n. En su respuesta, el Gobierno confirm&#243; que del 
informe elaborado por la autoridad provincial a ra&#237;z de la difusi&#243;n de las grabaciones en 
referencia en la comunicaci&#243;n &#8220;es posible inferir la posible comisi&#243;n de presuntos actos de 
</p>
<p>tortura y/o tratos crueles, inhumanos o degradantes por parte de personal penitenciario 
contra personas privadas de la libertad&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>10. Asimismo, el Gobierno indic&#243; que hab&#237;a adoptado medidas con el fin de &#8220;hacer 
efectiva la responsabilidad administrativa y penal&#8221; de los agentes penitenciarios 
</p>
<p>responsables por los hechos. El Gobierno inform&#243; sobre la apertura de sumario 
administrativo a los efectivos involucrados, lo cual result&#243; en la expulsi&#243;n de 3 de los 7 
agentes nombrados en &#233;l; as&#237; como la imputaci&#243;n penal a 3 agentes por el delito de tortura, 
1 por el delito de &#8220;severidades y vejaciones&#8221;, 1 por los delitos de tortura y severidades y 
</p>
<p>vejaciones, y 2 por el delito de &#8220;omisiones funcionales que permitieron la tortura&#8221;. Se 
</p>
<p>inform&#243; que las 7 personas se encuentran detenidas &#8220;ante el temor fundado de que por su 
condici&#243;n de agentes penitenciarios pudieran obstaculizar la investigaci&#243;n judicial&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Asimismo, el Gobierno indic&#243; que se hab&#237;an realizado entrevistas psicol&#243;gicas individuales 
con las presuntas v&#237;ctimas y testigos, as&#237; como revisiones psiqui&#225;trica, cl&#237;nica y 
traumatol&#243;gica con las presuntas v&#237;ctimas para evaluar la necesidad de tratamiento m&#233;dico. 
El Gobierno indic&#243; que se estudiaron los expedientes judiciales de las presuntas v&#237;ctimas, lo 
cual result&#243; en la libertad condicional del Sr. William Vargas Garc&#237;a y el traslado del Sr. 
Walter F. Correa, entre otros. Como medida de no repetici&#243;n, el Gobierno inform&#243; que 
hab&#237;a establecido delegaciones de la Direcci&#243;n Provincial de Derechos Humanos de la 
Provincia de Mendoza en cada una de las penitencias provinciales con la presencia de 
abogados que reciben denuncias de las personas detenidas en ellas. 
</p>
<p>11. El Gobierno no inform&#243; sobre los resultados de los ex&#225;menes m&#233;dicos llevados a 
cabo. Tampoco inform&#243; sobre el tipo de compensaci&#243;n o indemnizaci&#243;n que habr&#237;an 
recibido las v&#237;ctimas o sus familiares. El Relator Especial pide que el Gobierno remita 
informaci&#243;n sobre las medidas adoptadas por el Estado orientadas hacia la compensaci&#243;n o 
indemnizaci&#243;n a las v&#237;ctimas o sus familiares como asimismo que mantenga informada a la 
Relator&#237;a sobre el resultado de las investigaciones y procesos en curso.

<p>12. El Relator Especial agradece al Gobierno de Argentina por su atenta respuesta, de 
fecha 7 de julio de 2011, a la comunicaci&#243;n en referencia a varios videos que fueron 
divulgados en diversos medios de comunicaci&#243;n que pondr&#237;an en evidencia presuntos actos 
de tortura contra personas privadas de su libertad en un centro penitenciario en la Provincia 
de Mendoza. El Relator Especial celebra que el Gobierno de Argentina haya tomado 
acciones en relaci&#243;n con los hechos de la comunicaci&#243;n, en particular la iniciaci&#243;n de 
investigaciones y denuncias penales contra los supuestos perpetradores, las medidas 
dirigidas a asegurar la seguridad y la recuperaci&#243;n de las presuntas v&#237;ctimas y las adoptadas 
para prevenir la repetici&#243;n de los hechos denunciados. El Relator Especial agradece al

</b></p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Australia for its response to 
allegations and questions mentioned in the communication dated 14 October 2011, in 
relation to the alleged involuntary repatriation of Mr. X to Sri Lanka in a detailed manner. 
He encourages the Government to continue its engagement with the mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>  Bahrain 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a)   </b>JUA 17/02/2011 Case No. BHR 1/2011 State reply: 05/04/2011 <b>Alleged excessive use of 
force in the context of peaceful protests. 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bahrain for its response to this 
communication regarding the alleged excessive use of force in the context of peaceful 
protests, resulting in at least six deaths and numerous others injured. The Special 
Rapporteur notes that &#8220;[l]aw enforcement officials may use force only when strictly 
necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty&#8221; according to article 
3 of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, adopted by General Assembly 
resolution 34/169 of 17 December 1979. In respect of the alleged deaths as a result of the 
excessive use of force by the riot police, the Special Rapporteur further notes that the 
&#8220;obligation of all States to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all 
suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, to identify and bring to 
justice those responsible, . . . to grant adequate compensation within reasonable time to the 
victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial 
measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and to prevent the recurrence of such  
executions&#8221; (Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation  of  Extra-legal, 
Arbitrary and Summary Executions, para. 4). The Special Rapporteur thanks the 
Government for its explanation of the investigations undertaken to date into the allegations 
of torture and other ill-treatment. The Special Rapporteur nonetheless encourages the 
Government to ensure that all allegations of torture and other ill-treatment are investigated 
and punished, and reminds the Government of its obligation to provide full redress, 
including fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible to all 
victims of torture or other ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>(b)    </b>JUA 18/03/2011 Case No. BHR 3/2011 State reply: 20/04/2011 <b>Alleged excessive use of 
force by security forces against protesters.  
</b></p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bahrain for its reply, dated 20 
April 2011, to this communication regarding excessive use of force and ill-treatment 
against protesters by security forces on 15, 16 and 17 March 2011. In its reply, the 
Government indicated that &#8220;[t]he Ministry of the Interior denies that the incidents 
</p>
<p>mentioned in the [urgent appeal] took place.&#8221; The Government described the procedures in 
effect in its national laws governing the use of force by security forces in protests and 
detention settings, as well as the possibilities of compensating victims or their families 
under existing law. However, the Government provided no further information regarding 
the content of the communication. The Government did not report on the fate or 
whereabouts of Mr. Mohammed al-Buflasa, nor did it address specific allegations of 
torture. Based on the information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that the 
rights of the named individuals in the communication under the UN Convention against 
Torture may have been violated, and calls on the Government of Bahrain to undertake a 
prompt, impartial, and effective investigation of the alleged acts of torture, leading to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide redress to the victims and 
their family members.

detention and possible enforced disappearance.  
</b></p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bahrain for its reply, dated 7 June 
2011, in response to this communication in reference to the alleged incommunicado 
detention and possible enforced disappearance of Mr. Abdulhadi Alkawaja, as well as 
Messrs. Wafi Almajid and Hussein Ahmed. In its reply, the Government of Bahrain 
indicated that Mr. Alkhawaja was arrested and questioned on charges of &#8220;knowingly 
</p>
<p>becoming a member of a terrorist group; attempting with the help of others to overthrow the 
monarchy and change the State Constitution; promoting political change in Bahrain through 
the use of force; and spreading false information and malicious rumours with a view to 
disrupting public security and damaging public interests,&#8221; as well as &#8220;inciting individuals to

brought, the circumstances of the arrest, the public prosecutor's assessment of the injuries, 
and the National Security Court Proceedings against Mr. Alkhawaja. However, the 
Government of Bahrain did not respond to allegations that Mr. Alkhawaja had been 
subjected to torture and ill-treatment during detention. Based on the information provided, 
the Special Rapporteur concludes that the rights of Mr. Abdulhadi Alkhawaja under the UN 
Convention against Torture have been violated, and calls on the Government of Bahrain to 
undertake a prompt and impartial investigation of the alleged acts of torture, and to provide 
redress. If Mr. Alkhawaja is to be tried, the Government must ensure that any evidence 
against him obtained under torture is declared inadmissible.  Messrs. Yusuf Abdullah and

Khawaja were the subject of earlier communications (see A/HRC/13/22/Add. 1, para 103;

2011, in response to the urgent appeal of 20 May 2011 regarding alleged torture and 
mistreatment of Mr. Abdulhadi Alkhawaja in detention. The Government's report provided

<p>19. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain for its 
response to the communication dated 4 July 2011, regarding the alleged detention, solitary 
confinement and ill-treatment of Mr. Matar Ebrahim Matar, an opposition politician and 
former Member of Parliament. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Government rejects 
the allegation of solitary confinement. However, the Special Rapporteur regrets that the

calls on the Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain to provide the results of any 
investigation, medical examinations and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to 
this case and urges the Government to investigate, prosecute and punish all those 
responsible. The Special Rapporteur therefore recalls paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall 
remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified,

<p>20. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain for its 
response to the communication dated 8 July 2011, regarding the alleged ill-treatment of Mr. 
Mohammed al-Buflasa, a former military officer, after his lawyer&#8223;s visit and the alledged 
denial of family visits. A previous joint communication dated 18 March 2011 regarding the 
case had been sent and a reply was provided on 20 April 2011, however without any 
reference with regard to the specific case of Mr. al-Buflasa. The Special Rapporteur thanks 
the Government for its explanation of the legal grounds and the administrative and judicial 
proceedings regarding this case. However, the Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government&#8223;s response failed to substantively address the allegations of ill-treatment and 
the denial of family visits of Mr. al-Buflasa during his detention. The Special Rapportuer 
therefore would like to draw the attention of the Government to article 12 of the

been committed, and article 7 of the Convention against Torture, which requires State

ill-treatment of Bahrain correspondent of France 24 and Radio Monte Carlo Doualiya, Ms. 
Nazeeha Saeed, who was summoned to a police station in the city of Rifa&#8223;a (Bahrain) 
where she was allegedly held for more than 12 hours of interrogation on 22 May. The 
Government indicated that the Minister of Interior himself ordered a swift investigation into 
the incident and emphasized that those found to have perpetrated the attack were to be 
brought to trial. Furthermore the Government reported that an investigation was conducted 
into Ms. Saeed&#8223;s claims by the Office of the Military Prosecutor. The Government added 
that the female police officer in question has been identified and has been brought before 
the competent military tribunal; that the defendant was convicted on 21 July 2011 and that 
the Office of the Military Prosecutor has appealed against the decision. The Special

</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain for its 
response to the communication dated 5 August 2011, regarding the alleged life 
imprisonment of human rights defenders, the alleged incommunicado detention, the alleged 
torture and the allegation that confessions may have been extracted under duress. With 
regard to the Court proceedings the Government indicated that the Kingdom of Bahrain was 
under a state of national safety according to the Royal Decree No. 18 of 2011 and as 
provided for under its Constitution. In addition, the Government refers to article 4 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In its response the Government 
explains in detail the national legislation and court proceedings. The Special Rapporteur 
thanks the Government for its explanation of the legal grounds and the administrative and 
judicial proceedings regarding this case. However, he regrets that the Government failed to 
address the specific allegations of the alleged incommunicado detention and torture of all 
defendants as well as the acquisition of confessions under duress.  Moreover the Special 
Rapporteur regrets that the Government did not provide further information about the 
investigation of the alleged ill-treatment, torture and the denial of medical care of Mr. Abd 
al-Hadi Al-Khawajah although a forensic physician, assigned by the Bahraini Office of the 
Public Prosecutor, concluded that the defendant&#8223;s injuries could have been sustained as 
</p>
<p>described by the defendant. The Special Rapporteur therefore would like to reiterate that 
article 12 of the Convention against Torture, which requires the competent authorities to 
undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that torture has been committed, and that article 7 requires State parties to prosecute 
suspected perpetrators of torture. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of the 
Kingdom of Bahrain to undertake prompt and impartial investigations into all cases of 
alleged torture and ill-treatment and to provide the results of these investigations. Finally he 
encourages the Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain to continue its engagement with the

Mr. Abduljalil Al Moqdad, Ms. Zahra Atiya, Mr. Wafi Al Majid, Mr. Ghazi Farhan, the son 
of Mr. Akeel Ahmed Al Mafoodh). The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the 
Government provided extensive information concerning the legal grounds for the arrest and 
detention of the persons involved. He also thanks the Government for its explanation of the 
administrative and judicial proceedings regarding these cases. Nevertheless, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that with regard to the alleged torture, ill-treatment and incommunicado 
detention the Govenments&#8223;s response failed to substantively address these allegaitons. In 
the case of Mr. Ghazi Farhan the Government replied that an investigation into the alleged 
ill-treatment is ongoing but no reference was made to the alleged incommunicado 
detention. On the basis of a personal interview with Mr Farhan in February 2012 (he was 
paroled while his conviction is on appeal), the Special Rapporteur concludes that his rights 
under the Convention against Torture have in fact been violated. In the cases of Ms. Zahra 
Rashid Sawr and Mr. Hussein Abduljalil Al Singace the Government stated that the claims 
of ill-treatment and torture have no basis in truth but no details or results of any 
investigation and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to these cases have been 
provided. In the case of Messrs. Mahdi Abu Deep, Wafi Al Majid, Akeel Ahmed Al 
Mafoodh, the son of Mr. Abduljalil Al Moqdad and Ms. Zahra Atiya the Government did 
not address the allegation of torture or ill-treatment at all. The Special Rapportuer therefore 
would like to draw the attention of the Government again to article 12 of the Convention 
against Torture, which requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and 
impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has 
been committed, and article 7 of the Convention against Torture, which requires State 
parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. He calls on the Government to 
investigate, prosecute and punish all cases of ill-treatment and to to provide the result of 
any investigation, medical examination, and judicial or other inquiries which may have 
been carried out in relation to this case. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain to continue its engagement with the mandate.

Special Rapporteur are allegations of beating of the opposition leader Mr. Neklyayev by

with applicable law and that its Penal Enforcement Code establishes that &#8220;the corpse of an 
executed person is not handed over or the place of burial communicated.&#8221; The Special

</p>
<p>(E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3, paras. 26 and 32) The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government

</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Belarus for its reply, dated 16 
May 2011, in response to this communication in reference to the alleged detention and ill-
treatment of Mr. Ales Mikhalevich. The Government indicated that Mr. Mikhalevich was 
placed in pre-trial detention at a KGB detention center on suspicion of committing the 
crime of &#8220;organising and participating in mass riots&#8221; on 20 December 2010. The 
</p>
<p>Government indicated that on 19 February 2011, Mr. Mikhalevich was released from 
custody and restricted not to leave Minsk, but was taken back into custody on 18 March 
</p><p>2011. The Government reported that an inquiry was conducted into Mr. Mikhalevich's 
claims that he was subjected to torture and ill-treatment while in detention and the 
complaint was dismissed. The Government noted that his defense lawyers were present 
during interrogations, clarified the scope of strip searches, and denied reports that he had 
been forced to remain in the cell after it was painted.  The Government added that he did 
not register complaints about detention facility staff, and that he received medical attention 
upon request. The Government denied that Mr. Mikhalevich was tortured or mistreated 
while handcuffed. The Special Rapporteur believes that the information submitted by the 
Government is insufficient to rebut the credible allegations received about Mr 
Mikhalevich&#8223;s treatment.  Based on information available, the Special Rapporteur believes 
that it is likely that Mr. Mikhalevich&#8223;s right to physical and psychological integrity has been

submitted a detailed reply to the communication dated 17 June 2011, regarding the alleged 
denial of medical treatment to Mr. Dzmitry Bandarenka while in detention. In its response, 
the Government stated that Mr. Bandarenka was examined 14 times by a doctor while in 
pre-trial detention. It was indicated that since Mr. Bandarenka was transferred to the 
Detention Facility No.1 of Minsk and Minsk Regional Department on 10 May 2011, he has 
received medical examinations on several occasions. The Government further stated that on 
26 July 2011, Mr.Bandarenka underwent surgery in Minsk Clinical Hospital No. 5, where 
he had received medical treatment prior to his arrest. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to 
receive such information and encourages the Government to continue its engagement with

which notes the responsibility of states to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and, 
in accordance with national legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether

evidence, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that this young woman was indeed raped in

other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, 
which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus 
never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-

of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011, &#8220;[i]ntimidation and coercion, 
as described in article 1 of the Convention including serious and credible threats, as well as 
death threats, to the physical integrity of the victim or of a third person can amount to cruel,

<p>to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of Mr. Bezerra de Silva 
and his family members under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated. The 
Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of Brazil to undertake a prompt, independent

perpetrators, and to provide full redress to the victims.

defenders in China following the award of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to Mr. Liu Xiaobo,

notes that paragraph 8(a) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011, 
which reminds States that &#8220;[i]ntimidation and coercion, as described in article 1 of the

<p>36. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of China has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to allegations of arbitrary arrest, torture and 
harassment of Dr. Fan Yafeng, a Christian human rights lawyer. The Special Rapporteur 
reiterates that paragraph 8(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011 
asserts that &#8220;[p]rolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places can 
facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to 
respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person and to 
ensure that secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221; Moreover, with 
respect to the allegations that Mr. Yafeng was threatened by the police with disappearance, 
prosecution and punishment, the Special Rapporteur asserts that paragraph 8(a) of Human

and forced disappearance of human rights activists and lawyers following the 20 February 
2011 call for protests inspired by the so-called &#8220;Jasmine Revolution.&#8221; In the absence of

individuals under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated, and urgently calls 
on the Government of China to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation, leading to 
prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full redress to the victims, 
including restitution and measures of non-repetition. The Special Rapporteur also calls on 
the Government of China to abolish the practice of incommunicado and unacknowledged

<p>38. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of China for its response, dated 16 
May 2011, to this communication in reference to the conditions of detention of Mr. Jigme 
Gyatso. In its reply, the Government confirmed that Mr. Gyatso was sentenced to 15 years 
imprisonment and 5 years deprivation of political rights by the Lhasa Municipal 
Intermediate People's Court on charges of &#8220;threat to national security,&#8221; and that while in 
prison in 2004 Mr. Gyatso was sentenced to 3 additional years of prison on charges of 
&#8220;seeking to divide the country and damage its unity&#8221; for his support of Tibetan 
</p>
<p>independence. The Government confirmed that Mr. Jigme Gyatso &#8220;suffers from chronic 
</p>
<p>gastritis, high blood pressure, neuritis and arthritis, and has been hospitalized many times 
for medical treatment,&#8221; and indicated that treatment continued when he left the hospital. 
</p>
<p>The Government reported that in September 2010, Mr. Gyatso &#8220;was not granted the right to 
see relatives for breaking prison rules,&#8221; and indicated that visits &#8220;resumed to normal 
</p>
<p>frequency in October.&#8221; Finally, the Government stated that &#8220;Mr. Jigme Gatso did not lodge 
</p>
<p>any complaint, nor did his [sic] request to a third party to lodge any complaint on his 
behalf.&#8221; In light of the information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that the 
</p>
<p>rights of Mr. Jigme Gyatso under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated. 
The Special Rapporteur takes note of Mr. Gyatso's deteriorating health conditions. The 
Special Rapporteur also urges the Government of China to investigate the allegations of 
torture, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide redress to 
Mr. Gyatso, including provision of appropriate and adequate medical care. He also 
reiterates the Rapporteurship&#8223;s previous recommendation that since Mr. Gyatso had been 
convicted of a political crime, possibly on the basis of information extracted by torture, he 
should be released. Mr. Gyatso was the subject of earlier communications (see 
A/HRC/7/3/Add.1, para 35; and A/HRC/13/39/Add.1, para 30).

individuals, including monks and laymen, were detained by security forces while publicly 
protesting following a demonstration in which ten Tibetans were reportedly killed and one

<p>reported that monks in the Kirti Monastery had &#8220;engaged in acts aimed at disturbing social

frequented places of entertainment, prostitution, alcohol and gambling, and spread 
pornographic CD-ROMs&#8221; and indicated that the Government had engaged in legal 
education in the Kirti Monastery. The Government denied the presence of Mrs. Serkyi and 
Mr. Dhonko in Aba Prefecture, and indicated that &#8220;news of their death is pure fabrication.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>The Government confirmed that Lobsang Tenzin, Lobsang Choephel and Lobsang Tsepak 
were arrested and detained on 27 March, 30 March, and an unspecified date in March, 
respectively. However, the Government of China provided no information regarding the 
location or duration of detention of the named parties, nor did it provide information 
regarding the alleged detentions of Mr. Dhonyoe Dorjee, Mr. Tenzin Gyamtso, an 
additional unidentified monk, Mr. Lobsang Ngodup, or Messrs. Palko, Dorjee, A-Dor, or 
Woeser Dorjee. The Special Rapporteur considers that the rights of the individuals named 
in the communication under the UN Convention against Torture may have been violated, 
and calls on the Government to ensure investigation and prosecution of perpetrators and the 
provision of redress to all victims. He urges the Government of China to end the practice of

</b></p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of China for its response to this 
communication regarding the alleged torture and death of Mr. Qin Yueming, Mr. Yu 
Yungang, and Mr. Liu Chuanjiang, all Falun Gong practitioners, while in detention. The 
Special Rapporteur reiterates that when the State detains an individual, it is held to a 
heightened level of diligence in protecting that individual&#8223;s rights. When an individual dies 
</p>
<p>as a consequence of injuries sustained while in State custody, there is a presumption of 
State responsibility. In order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a 
death resulting from injuries sustained in custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and 
</p>
<p>impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary 
executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest 
unnatural death in the above circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective 
</p>
<p>Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). These 
obligations to investigate, identify those responsible and bring them to justice arise also 
under articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Regrettably, the Government&#8223;s response failed to 
indicate whether investigations into the death of Mr. Qin, Mr. Yu, and Mr. Liu have been 
initiated. Accordingly, based on the information received, the Special Rapporteur 
determines that the rights of Mr. Qin, Mr. Yu, and Mr. Liu under the UN Convention 
against Torture have been violated, and calls on the Government to launch an impartial and 
independent investigation into their alleged torture and deaths, leading to prosecution and 
punishment of those responsible. The government must also ensure that the families of Mr. 
Qin, Mr. Yu, and Mr. Liu obtain redress, including fair and adequate compensation, and as 
full rehabilitation as possible.

Government's communication reported that Mr. Zhu Yufu was &#8220;detained according to law&#8221; 
on 5 March 2011 and the investigative organ approved the arrest of 11 April 2011 and the

<p>and his case is &#8220;currently under further investigation&#8221;; and that both are charged with

China did not report on the status of the other individuals named in the urgent action letter, 
nor did it provide dates or places of detention except as noted above. In this respect, the 
Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that &#8220;[p]rolonged incommunicado detention or 
detention in secret places can facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, 
and urges all States to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity 
of the person and to ensure that secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished,&#8221; 
</p>
<p>per paragraph 8(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011. The 
Special Rapporteur considers that the rights of the individuals named in the communication

<p>42. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of China has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged imminent execution, 
torture and ill-treatment of Mr. Chiou Ho-shun. The Special Rapporteur recalls that article 
15 of the Convention against Torture provides that, &#8220;[e]ach State Party shall ensure that any 
statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked 
as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that 
the statement was made.&#8221; In light of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the 
contrary, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the rights of Mr. Chiou Ho-shun under 
the UN Convention against Torture have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government to investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible and provide the results 
of any investigation, medical examinations, judicial or other inquiries into the alleged 
torture. Should the investigations suggest the allegations mentioned in the communication 
to be correct, the Special Rapporteur requests the Government to undertake effective 
measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.

<p>47. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Egypt has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. This communication detailed the alleged arbitrary detention and enforced 
disappearance of Mr. Ayman Ahmed Salem Mohamed, a human rights activist. Since his 
arrest on 9 December 2010 the fate and whereabouts of Mr. Salem remain unknown. In 
view of these allegations, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that paragraph 8(b) of Human 
Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011, which reminds States that &#8220;[p]rolonged 
incommunicado detention or detention in secret places can facilitate the perpetration of

<p>48. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Egypt for its response to this 
communication regarding allegations of arbitrary detention and torture of Mr. Adel 
Mahmoud Diab, but makes note that its untimely response did not fall within the requested 
period of time. Regrettably, the Government&#8223;s response failed to fully explain the 
justification for and the conditions of Mr. Diab&#8223;s detention between 12 December 2009 and 
</p>
<p>February 2011. The Special Rapporteur notes that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are 
and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be 
justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable 
prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Moreover, paragraph 8(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 reminds States that 
&#8220;[p]rolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places can facilitate the

Regrettably, the Government&#8223;s response failed to fully explain the justification for and the

</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Egypt has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to allegations of arrests, enforced 
disappearance, excessive use of force, killings, and attacks against journalists in Egypt 
since 25 January 2011. According to the information received, the following demonstrators 
were killed between 25 and 29 January 2011: Mutapha Ragab, aged 21, Sulaiman Saber, 
aged 35, Ghareeb Abdulall, Fayez Fahim, Mohamed Ahmed Yosph, aged 23, Mahmoud 
Ahmed Mahmoud, aged 26, Alae Abdelmehsen, Mustapha Abdellah, Mohamed Sha&#8222;ban 
</p>
<p>Bashir, aged 30, Mutafa Jamal Wardani, Eraddi Mohamed &#8222;eraddi, Ahmed Ali Mohamed, 
Achraf Nour Al DIn Mohamed, aged 40, Islam Metwali Mohamed, Sharif Al Sayed 
Redwan, Faraj Abdelfatah Awad, Mohamed Mahrous Anwar, Samir Abdellah, aged 55, Ali 
Ahmed Ali, Abdelmajeed Abdelalim Abdelmajeed, aged 41. Moreover, information 
received indicates that the following journalists suffered beatings and other ill-treatment by 
security forces while covering the demonstrations: Mr. Asadallah al-Sawi, Mr. Ahmad 
Mansour, Mr. Ben Wedemen and Ms. Mary Roger. Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur is 
gravely concerned about the fate and whereabouts of demonstrators identified in the 
communication. The Special Rapporteur affirms that repression of demonstrations with 
excessive use of force constitutes either torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, 
depending on the gravity of the pain and suffering inflicted on demonstrators.  The Special 
Rapporteur considers enforced disappearance a form of incommunicado detention and 
notes that paragraph 8(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011 
asserts that &#8220;[p]rolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places can 
facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to 
respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person and to 
ensure that secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221;  Accordingly, based 
on the information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights under the UN 
Convention against Torture of the identified journalists have been violated. The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government to immediately investigate the whereabouts and fate of 
the disappeared journalists, and ensure that perpetrators of torture and other ill-treatment 
are prosecuted, no matter their military rank or other affiliation. Moreover, the Government 
must ensure that all individuals whose rights have been violated obtain redress, including 
fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible.

<p>51. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Egypt has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred, inter alia, to the alleged torture of 18 women 
detained by the Egyptian military during a peaceful protest in Tahrir Square. The women 
were reportedly handcuffed, beaten, given electric shocks, and called prostitutes. 17 were 
transferred to a military prison where prison guards subjected them to &#8220;virginity tests.&#8221; In 
</p>
<p>the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of 
these individuals under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated, and calls on 
the Government of Egypt to undertake a prompt, impartial and effective investigation of the 
alleged acts of torture, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to 
provide redress to the victims. </p>

</b></p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Egypt has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged ill-treatment of Mr. 
Ahmad Sayed Mohammad Sayed in detention. With regard to the allegation that the court 
did not address the reported ill-treatment of Mr. Sayed, the Special Rapporteur reiterates 
that article 12 of the Convention against Torture requires the competent authorities to 
undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that torture has been committed, and article 7 requires State parties to prosecute 
suspected perpetrators of torture. In light of the fact that no evidence has been provided to 
the contrary, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the rights of Mr. Sayed under the UN 
Convention against Torture have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation and to provide full redress to 
the victim.

</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Ethiopia has not responded 
to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged ill-treatment of Mr. 
Eskinder Nega, the alleged torture of Mr. Woubshet Taye, and the lack of access to doctors 
of Ms. Reeyot Alemu while in detention. In this context, the Special Rapporteur recalls that 
article 12 of the Convention against Torture requires the competent authorities to undertake 
a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
torture has been committed, and article 7 requires State parties to prosecute suspected 
perpetrators of torture. In light of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the 
contrary, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the rights of the aforementioned 
individuals under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated. The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government to investigate, prosecute and punish all cases of torture 
and ill-treatment and to ensure full redress to the victims.

Kumar, Mr. Mohammad Khalil, Mr. Anand Singh, and Mr. Samisoni Speight Tikoinasau,

<p>55. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Fiji has not responded to this 
communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged ill-treatment of Mr. Mohammed 
Khalil by army officers. In this context, the Special Rapporteur recalls that paragraph 7(b) 
of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 urges States &#8220;[t]o take persistent, determined 
and effective measures to have all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment investigated promptly, effectively and impartially by an 
independent, competent domestic authority, as well as whenever there is reasonable ground 
to believe that such an act has been committed; to hold persons who encourage, order, 
tolerate or perpetrate such acts responsible, to have them brought to justice and punished in 
a manner commensurate with the gravity of the offence, including the officials in charge of 
the place of detention where the prohibited act is found to have been committed; and to take 
note, in this respect, of the Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the updated 
set of principles for the protection of human rights through action to combat impunity as a 
useful tool in efforts to prevent and combat torture.&#8221; In the absence of contrary evidence, 
the Special Rapporteur finds that Mr. Khalil&#8223;s rights under international standards 
prohibiting torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment have 
been violated and calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and impartial 
investigation and to submit the results of such investigation.

respondido a esta comunicaci&#243;n de fecha 9 de junio de 2011. La comunicaci&#243;n se refer&#237;a al

de los Principios B&#225;sicos sobre el Empleo de la Fuerza y de Armas de Fuego por los

</b></p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of India has not responded to 
this communication, thereby withholding cooperation with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the reported beatings of Messrs. 
Mofijur Rahman and Mainul Molla by Border Security Guards and the failure of authorities 
to undertake serious investigations of the reported acts. Without any evidence to the 
contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of Messrs. Rahman and Molla 
under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated, and calls on the Government 
to ensure a prompt, independent and impartial investigation, leading to prosecution and 
punishment of perpetrators, and to provide redress to the victims, including fair and 
adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible.

</b></p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of India has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged prolonged stays on </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>30</b>  
</p>
<p>death row of Mr. Devender Pal Singh and Mr. Mahendra Nath Das. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur reiterates that long periods of time spent awaiting execution, combined 
with other aggravating circumstances, may lead to severe deterioration of mental and 
physical health. With respect to the allegation that the statement made by Mr. Singh 
extorted under pressure was not excluded from judicial proceedings, the Special Rapporteur 
recalls that paragraph 7(c) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 urges States &#8220;[t]o 
ensure that no statement established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked as 
evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the 
statement was made, and calls upon States to consider extending that prohibition to 
statements made as a result of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
recognizing that adequate corroboration of statements, including confessions, used as 
evidence in any proceedings constitutes one safeguard for the prevention of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; In light of the fact that no 
evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the 
rights of Mr. Singh and Mr. Das under international standards prohibiting torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment have been violated.

<p>67. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of India acknowledged 
receipt of the communication dated 22 July 2011 regarding the alleged gang rape by four 
members of the security forces of a 14 year-old girl. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation and ensure that the child

<p>68. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its acknowledgment of receipt of 
the communication dated 15/09/2011 concerning the alleged gang rape of Ms. X by two 
army personnel. He would like to draw the attention of the Government of India to article 4 
(c) and (d) of the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against 
Women, which notes the responsibility of states to exercise due diligence to prevent, 
investigate and, in accordance with national legislation, punish acts of violence against 
women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the State or by private persons. The Special 
Rapporteur encourages the Government to submit information about the results of any 
investigation carried out in relation to this case. <b>

<p>69. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of India acknowledged 
receipt of the communication dated 2 September 2011 concerning the death of Messrs. 
Nazim Rashid Shalla, Saidul Mondal and Salam Sanjoy. He would like to emphasize that in 
order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death resulting from injuries 
sustained in custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all 
</p>
<p>suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, including cases where 
complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural death in the above 
circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation 
</p>
<p>of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). The Special Rapporteur looks forward 
to receiving substantive information about, in particular, the results of any investigations,

<p>70. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Indonesia has not responded 
to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to allegations of attacks against and other ill-
treatment of members of the Ahmadiyya community on 6 February 2011. The Special 
Rapporteur reiterates that article 12 of the Convention against Torture requires the 
competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been committed, and article 7 of the same 
Convention requires State parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. Based on 
the information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of the 
aforementioned Ahmadiyya community under the UN Convention against Torture have 
been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to immediately conduct a 
full investigation and prosecution of those responsible, and ensure that members of the 
Ahmadiyya community obtain redress, including fair and adequate compensation, and as 
full rehabilitation as possible.

</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has failed to reply to this communication regarding the alleged arrest and detention of Ms. 
Nasrin Sotoudeh, a lawyer and human rights activist. According to the information 
received, since her arrest and detention on 4 September 2010, Ms. Sotoudeh has been held 
in periods of solitary confinement. In paragraphs 79 and 80 of the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s 
report A/66/268, it is stressed that &#8220;solitary confinement is a harsh measure which may 
</p>
<p>cause serious psychological and physiological adverse effects on individuals regardless of 
their specific conditions&#8221;. Moreover, &#8220;[d]epending on the specific reason for its application, 
conditions, length, effects and other circumstances, solitary confinement can amount to a 
breach of article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and to an act 
defined in article 1 or article 16 of the Convention against Torture. In addition, the use of 
solitary confinement increases the risk that acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment will go undetected and unchallenged.&#8221; Based on the 
</p>
<p>information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that Ms. Sotoudeh&#8223;s rights under 
international standards prohibiting torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment have likely been violated, and calls on the Government to cease the isolation 
of Ms. Sotoudeh and ensure that she obtains redress, including fair and adequate 
compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible.

confinement and imposition of the death penalty on the charge of moharebeh (enmity 
</b></p>
<p><b>against God).</b> 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for 
its response to this communication regarding the alleged solitary confinement and 
imposition of the death penalty on Mr. Habibollah Latifi on the charge of morarebeh 
(enmity against God) and other security-related crimes. Regrettably, the Government&#8223;s 
response failed to address the allegation that Mr. Latifi has been held in solitary 
confinement since 16 January 2010. The Special Rapporteur&#8223;s report A/66/268, stressed </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>32</b>  
</p>
<p>that &#8220;solitary confinement is a harsh measure which may cause serious psychological and 
</p>
<p>physiological adverse effects on individuals regardless of their specific conditions. [The 
Special Rapporteur] finds solitary confinement to be contrary to one of the essential aims of 
the penitentiary system, which is to rehabilitate offenders and facilitate their reintegration 
into society.&#8221; Moreover, &#8220;[d]epending on the specific reason for its application, conditions, 
</p>
<p>length, effects and other circumstances, solitary confinement can amount to a breach of 
article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and to an act defined in 
article 1 or article 16 of the Convention against Torture. In addition, the use of solitary 
confinement increases the risk that acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment will go undetected and unchallenged.&#8221; Furthermore, the 
Government&#8223;s response neglected to indicate whether there has been an investigation into 
the allegation that Mr. Latifi was subjected to corporal punishment. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur asserts that Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8 states that corporal 
punishment, including of children, can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment 
or even to torture. Both the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture 
have called for the abolition of judicial corporal punishment. In paragraph 5 of General 
Comment No. 20 (1992), the Human Rights Committee stated that the prohibition of torture 
and ill-treatment must extend to corporal punishment, including excessive chastisement 
ordered as punishment for a crime of as an educative or disciplinary measure. Based on the 
information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that Mr. Latifi&#8223;s rights under 
</p>
<p>international standards prohibiting torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment have been violated, and calls on the Government to set aside any conviction 
based on evidence obtained under torture, and to ensure that Mr. Latifi obtains redress, 
including fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible. 
</p>
<p><b>(c)   </b>JUA 31/12/2010 Case No. IRN 38/2010 State reply: 27/06/2011 <b>Alleged solitary

</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Iran for its response to this 
communication regarding the alleged solitary confinement, torture and death sentence of 
Mr. Saeed Malekpour, a web programmer and developer, in October 2008. Regrettably, the 
Government&#8223;s response failed to substantively address the allegations contained within the 
communication. Of particular concern to the Special Rapporteur are the allegations that Mr. 
Malekpour was placed in solitary confinement for more than one year and was subjected to 
severe acts of torture which has seriously impacted his physical and mental health. The 
Special Rapporteur notes that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 
April 2011 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Moreover, in paragraphs 79 
and 80 of the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s report A/66/268, it is stressed that &#8220;solitary confinement 
is a harsh measure which may cause serious psychological and physiological adverse 
effects on individuals regardless of their specific conditions. The report further asserts that 
&#8220;[d]epending on the specific reason for its application, conditions, length, effects and other 
</p>
<p>circumstances, solitary confinement can amount to a breach of article 7 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and to an act defined in article 1 or article 16  of the 
Convention against Torture. In addition, the use of solitary confinement increases the risk 
that acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment will go

</p>
<p>determines that Mr. Malekpour&#8223;s rights under international standards prohibiting torture 
</p>
<p>and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment have likely been violated, 
and calls on the Government to cease the isolation of Mr. Malekpour and ensure that he </p>

pattern of unlawful executions, arrests and detentions.</b> 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for 
its response to this communication regarding numerous alleged unlawful executions, 
arrests, detentions, torture and other forms of ill-treatment. Regrettably, the Government&#8223;s 
response failed to substantively address the claims that Mr. Hossein Khezri was repeatedly 
subjected to torture between his arrest in July 2008 and execution in January 2011. 
Moreover, no explanation was provided for the denial of Mr. Khezri&#8223;s March 2010 request 
</p>
<p>for an investigation of the allegations of torture. The Government&#8223;s response additionally 
</p>
<p>failed to address the allegations that Mr. Jaafar Kazemi and Mr. Javad Lari were arrested 
for their political activism in September 2009 and August 2010 respectively, and subjected 
to torture during interrogation in order to obtain confessions to false charges. With regard to 
Mr. Khezri&#8223;s allegations of torture and ill-treatment, the Special Rapporteur notes that 
paragraph 8(a) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011, which 
reminds States that &#8220;[i]ntimidation and coercion, as described in article 1 of the Convention 
against Torture, including serious and credible threats, as well as death threats, to the 
physical integrity of the victim or of a third person can amount to cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or to torture.&#8221; Lastly, with regard to the allegations of forced 
confessions of Mr. Kazemi and Mr. Lari, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that confessions 
obtained under torture or other forms of ill-treatment are strictly inadmissible in court 
proceedings, as established by article 14(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. The Special Rapporteur again requests information on the measures 
undertaken to ensure that any statement or confession obtained under torture is excluded 
from judicial proceedings. Based on the information received, the Special Rapporteur 
determines that the rights of Mr. Khezri, Mr. Kazemi, and Mr. Lari under international 
standards prohibiting torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment have been violated. Because Mr. Khezri is no longer alive, the Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government to provide full redress, including compensation, to his 
dependents in accordance with international standards prohibiting torture and cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. With regard to Mr. Kazemi and Mr. Lari, 
the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to set aside any conviction based on 
evidence obtained under torture, and ensure that both individuals obtain redress, including 
fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible. 
</p>
<p><b>(e)   </b>JUA 11/02/2011 Case No. IRN 3/2011 State Reply: None to date <b>Alleged imposition of 
the death penalty on minors.  
</b></p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to allegations of 
imposition of death penalty and the use of torture and other forms of ill-treatment in 
interrogation of Ms. Fatemeh Salbehi and Mr. Ehsan Rangraz Tabaatabaa&#8223;ie, both of whom 
</p>
<p>are minors. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the allegations that Mr. 
Rangraz Tabaatabaa&#8223;ie was beaten, blackmailed and forced to confess. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur reiterates that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 
April 2011 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Moreover, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporter asserts that the use of confessions extracted under torture in judicial proceedings </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>34</b>  
</p>
<p>is strictly prohibited under international law. Article 15 of the Convention against Torture 
which provides that, &#8220;[e]ach State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established 
to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made.&#8221; In addition to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this principle is also an essential 
</p>
<p>aspect of the non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set forth, inter alia, in 
article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Based on the 
information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of Ms. Fatemeh 
Salbehi and Mr. Ehsan Rangraz Tabaatabaa&#8223;ie under international standards prohibiting 
</p>
<p>torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment have been violated. In 
addition, the Special Rapporteur believes that eventual imposition of the death penalty to 
these minors under the circumstances would constitute by itself cruel, inhuman or 
degrading punishment. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to immediately 
investigate all allegations of torture and other forms of ill-treatment, and ensure that 
perpetrators are prosecuted. Moreover, the Government must ensure that Ms. Fatemeh 
Salbehi and Mr. Ehsan Rangraz Tabaatabaa&#8223;ie obtain redress, including fair and adequate 
compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible. In February 2012 the Government of 
Iran announced that death penalty was abolished for under-age defendants, a development 
that the Special Rapporteur commends.

issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to allegations of arrest, 
detention, and torture of members of religious minorities, in particular those belonging to 
the Christian and Baha&#8223;i faiths. In particular, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about 
</p>
<p>allegations that Mr. Reza Estifan and Mr. Ehsan Behrouz were subjected to torture. The 
Special Rapporteur notes that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 
&#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States 
to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Moreover, paragraph 6 of General 
Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights Committee states that prolonged solitary 
confinement of the detained or imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by article 
7 [on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment] of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (adopted at the 44th 
session of the Human Rights Committee, 1992).  Based on the information received, the

international standards prohibiting torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to

Mohammad Reza Houtan Kian against Torture have been violated, and calls on the 
Government of Iran to ensure a prompt, independent and impartial investigation, leading to 
prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators of torture, and to provide full redress to the 
victim, including fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible. The 
Special Rapporteur additionally notes that while Iran has not ratified the Convention 
against Torture, the rights cited therein are reflective of customary international law and, 
indeed peremptory norms binding on all States (<i>jus cogens</i>).

<p>78. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iran has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged denial of necessary 
medical treatment to Ms. Mahnaz Mohammadi and the alleged denial of family visits of 
Ms. Mahnaz Mohammadi and Mr. Ashkan Zahabian. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur recalls rule 22(2) of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of 
Prisoners, which provides that, &#8220;[s]ick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be 
transferred to specialized institutions or to civil hospitals. Where hospital facilities are 
provided in an institution, their equipment, furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies shall be 
proper for the medical care and treatment of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of 
suitable trained officers.&#8221; With regard to the alleged denial of family visit, the Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure that all detained or imprisoned individuals 
have the right to be visited by family members. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that 
denial of family visits and of medical attention to persons in custody consititutes, under the 
appropriate circumstances, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of 
international standards.  In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur 
believes that the rights of Ms. Mohammadi and Mr. Zahabian have been violated.

<p>79. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iran has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the

that prolonged solitary confinement, in excess of 15 days, should be subject to an absolute 
prohibition (paragraph 88, A/66/268). The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to 
provide information regarding the legal grounds of the use of solitary confinement on Mr. 
Soltani and to ensure that solitary confinement is used only in very exceptional 
circumstances, as a last resort, for as short a time as possible, provided with adequate 
procedural safeguards.

contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the rights of the aforementioned individuals 
under international standards prohibiting torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading

Government to investigate, prosecute and punish all allegations of ill-treatment and to end 
the practice of incommunicado detention.

Tahmasb and Ms. Katayoun Shahabi were pressured to make a confession. In this context, 
the Special Rapporteur stresses that paragraph 7(c) of Human Rights Council Resolution 
16/23 urges States &#8220;[t]o ensure that no statement established to have been made as a result 
of torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of

that prohibition to statements made as a result of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

used as evidence in any proceedings constitutes one safeguard for the prevention of torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur 
calls on the Government to ensure that evidence obtained through recourse to unlawful

<p>82. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iran has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the allegation that Mr. Lo Zaniar 
Moradi and Mr. Loghman Moradi were coerced into confessing to the offense of murder 
after being tortured for 25 days. In this context, the Special Rapporteur stresses that 
paragraph 7(c) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 urges States &#8220;[t]o ensure that no 
statement established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in any

to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur affirms that these two persons were in fact brutally 
tortured to make them confess to crimes and that their rights under international standards 
prohibiting torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment may 
have been violated. Given the irremediable nature of capital punishment, the Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government not to proceed with the executions and to set aside any 
criminal conviction based on evidence obtained under torture. </p>

<p>83. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Iraq for its response to this 
communication regarding alleged torture and ill-treatment of Iraqi citizens by Iraqi security 
forces originating from official files of the United States of America disclosed through 
Wikileaks. Regrettably, the Government&#8223;s response fails to substantively address any of the

<p>specific allegations contained in the joint allegation letter.  In particular, the response sheds 
no light on whether Iraqis arrested by American and Coalition forces and delivered to Iraqi 
custody were indeed tortured, or whether the numerous allegations to that effect were ever 
effectively investigated. The Special Rapporteur insists that the Government must 
investigate, prosecute and punish all cases of torture.  He also calls on the government to 
create a credible system of prevention of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.

</b></p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iraq has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to reported excessive use of force by Iraqi 
security forces on 28 and 29 July 2009 in Camp Ashraf, including the alleged killing of 
some 34 residents of the camp and injury to over 300, as well as the detention and ill-
treatment of six residents of the camp, Messrs. Bahman Toloo, Mehdi Ghafouri, Hamid 
Makki, Hossein Eyni, Babak Karimi, and Asghar Mehdizadeh. In the absence of evidence 
to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the aforementioned acts constitute 
violations of international law as codified in the UN Convention against Torture, which 
Iraq ratified on 7 July 2011. He calls on the Government of Iraq to ensure a prompt and

<p>85. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iraq has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the reported use of excessive force against 
protesters in peaceful demonstrations including, inter alia, six protesters who were allegedly 
arrested and subjected to torture and other ill-treatment before being released and one 
demonstrator, Mr. Haidar Shihab Ahmad Abdel Latif, whose fate and whereabouts remain 
unknown. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that 
the rights of Messrs. Oday Alzaidy,  Abdel-Jabbar Shaloub Hammadi, Hadi al-Medhi, 
Sharwan Azad Faqi 'Abdallah, 'Ala Nabil, and Firas'Ali under the UN Convention against 
Torture, which Iraq ratified on 7 July 2011, have been violated. The Special Rapporteur 
calls on the Government of Iraq to ensure a prompt and impartial investigation, leading to 
prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and the provision of redress to all victims, 
including measures of rehabilitation and non-repetition. With respect to Mr. Abdel Latif, 
the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that under paragraph 8(b) of Human

or detention in secret places can facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel,

<p>86. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iraq has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human

residents by Iraqi security forces resulting in grave injuries including gunshot wounds, to at 
least 73 named victims; additionally, 25 residents were reportedly killed, including from 
gunshot wounds, being hit or run over by bulldozers and Humvees and due to lack of timely 
medical intervention. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur 
determines that the aforementioned acts against the named individuals constitute grave 
violations of international law as codified in the UN Convention against Torture which Iraq 
ratified on 7 July 2011. He calls on the Government of Iraq to ensure a prompt and

<p>87. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Iraq for its response regarding the 
communication dated 21 June 2011, which referred to the alleged attack on peaceful 
protesters in Baghdad&#8223;s Tahrir Square; however, he regrets that the Government&#8223;s response 
failed to provide substantive information pertaining to the allegations of ill-treatment and 
sexual assaults on female protestors. While the investigation conducted by the Government 
is appreciated, the Special Rapporteur would like to draw the attention of the Government 
to paragraph 2 of General Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights Committee, article 4(c) 
and article 4(d) of the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against 
Women, and paragraph 18 of the General Comment No. 2 of the Committee against 
Torture. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern that the failure of the Government to 
intervene in the ill-treatment of peaceful demonstrators may have been a form of 
encouragement and/or de facto permission. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government to protect both dignity and physical and mental integrity of the individuals 
inflicted by people acting in a private capacity in all contexts including demonstrations. <b>

<p>88.  The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iraq has not responded to

Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the allegation that Messrs. Yousri 
Fakher Mohamed Al Tariqi, Mohamed Fraj Fraj Allah, Adel Omar Mohamed Ali and 
Nasser Mubarak Mojib were sentenced to death on the basis of evidence extracted under 
torture. In this context, the Special Rapporteur stresses that article 15 of the Convention

established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made.&#8221; In light of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special 
Rapporteur concludes that the aforementioned individuals were indeed brutally tortured to 
obtain confessions and that their rights under the UN Convention against Torture have been 
violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to investigate, prosecute and 
punish all cases of torture and to ensure that any evidence obtained under torture is declared 
inadmissible. </p>

<p>89. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Israel for its reply, dated 7 June 
2011, to this communication regarding the alleged arbitrary detention and ill-treatment of 
Mr. Dirar Abu Sisi. In its reply, the Government reported that Mr. Abu Sisi was captured 
by government authorities, on suspicion of charges including &#8220;alleged activity in a terrorist 
</p>
<p>organization.&#8221; The Government indicated that a &#8220;gag order&#8221; was in effect and provided a 
copy of the indictment against Mr. Abu Sisi. However, the Government did not provide 
information regarding the alleged extradition from Ukraine, solitary confinement and 
incommunicado detention, and torture and ill-treatment against Mr. Abu Sisi.  In the 
context of reports that Mr. Abu Sisi was held incommunicado for ten days, the Special 
Rapporteur draws the Government's attention to paragraph 8(b) of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011, which reminds States that &#8220;[p]rolonged incommunicado 
detention or detention in secret places can facilitate the perpetration of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute a form of 
such treatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, 
security and the dignity of the person and to ensure that secret places of detention and 
interrogation are abolished.&#8221; Regarding the reported solitary confinement of Mr. Abu Sisi, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur recalls paragraph 6 of General Comment No. 20 of the Human 
Rights Committee. It states that prolonged solitary confinement of the detained or 
imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by article 7 [on the prohibition of torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment] of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Adopted at the 44th session of the Human Rights 
Committee, 1992), and article 7 of the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners,

punishment, or to the restriction of its use, should be undertaken and encouraged.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(Adopted by the General Assembly by resolution 45/111 of 14 December 1990). Regarding 
reports that Mr. Abu Sisi was subjected to ill-treatment including by being left chained to a 
metal &#8220;bed&#8221; by both hands and legs spread apart for 14 hours, paragraph 1 of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011 which &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, 
which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus 
never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-
derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; Based on the information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that 
</p>
<p>Mr. Abu Sisi's rights under the UN Convention against Torture were violated, and calls on 
the Government to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation of the alleged torture, 
leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full redress to Mr. 
Abu Sisi.

Government for its explanation of the administrative and judicial proceedings undertaken to 
determine the fate of this group of refugees and appreciates that the office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees was allowed to take part in the process. The Special 
Rapporteur believes, in any case, that prior history of persecution is highly relevant to the

Committee states that State parties &#8220;must not expose individuals to the danger of torture or

<p>cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon return to another country by 
way of extradition, expulsion or refoulement&#8221;. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, 
the Special Rapporteur fears that the situation of Mr. X resulted in violation of rights 
protected by the UN Convention against Torture. Given the context and concerns of Mr. X 
being subjected to torture and harsh sentences, including life imprisonment, in case of 
extradition, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure that rights and

days following his arrest on 7 June 2011, for posting messages on his Twitter account. In 
the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that there

Special Rapporteur would like to draw the attention of the Government to paragraph 1 of

<p>93. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Kyrgyz Republic for its reply, 
dated 31 May 2011, to this communication regarding, inter alia, alleged torture and ill-
treatment of individuals detained in relation to the June 2010 violence. In its reply, the 
Government indicated that its penal enforcement system &#8220;does not allow any acts of racism, 
torture or anti-Semitism.&#8221; The Government indicated that it did not receive any &#8220;official 
complaints&#8221; regarding the allegations. The Government noted that the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs Internal Security Service found no proof of the alleged death from torture of Mr. 
Khairullo Amanbaev. It also indicated that authorities decided &#8220;not to bring criminal cases 
</p>
<p>in respect of all the information submitted&#8221; due to lack of evidence. The Government 
reported that 20 inspections of detention conditions had been undertaken since May 2010, 
and that these did not confirm torture. The Government described the offenses of which Mr. 
Askarov was accused and denied that he had been subjected to torture, noting also that the 
provincial prosecutor's office did not bring charges regarding alleged acts of torture and ill-
treatment against him. The Government reported that the municipal prosecutor's office 
decided not to bring criminal proceedings regarding allegations of torture against Mr. 
Gapirov, citing lack of evidence. It also reported that, of 122 applications for searching for 
missing individuals, 89 individuals have been found and 33 investigations remain ongoing. 
Nonetheless, the Government did not address allegations that a significant number of 
defendants, in trials relating to inter-ethnic violence since June 2010, were subjected to 
torture and ill-treatment to extract confessions or statements implicating co-defendants, 
which were admitted as evidence in court. It did not address reports that judges failed to 
order prompt and impartial investigations of allegations of torture. Similarly, the 
Government did not present evidence to refute reports that between 27 August 2010 and 31 
December 2010, 46 cases of torture and ill-treatment by law enforcement officers have 
been documented, of which 43 involved ethnic Uzbeks. The Special Rapporteur 
interviewed Mr. Askarov in prison in December 2011 and is persuaded that he was indeed 
tortured at the time of his detention, the Government&#8223;s response notwithstanding.  In 
addition, Mr Askarov has been sentenced to a life term on the basis, at least in part, of 
evidence obtained under torture from the defendant and from others.  In this sense, the 
Special Rapporteur recalls that under paragraph 7(a) of Human Rights Council Resolution 
16/23 of 12 April 2011, States are urged &#8220;[t]o take persistent, determined and effective 
</p>
<p>measures to have all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment investigated promptly, effectively and impartially by an independent, 
competent domestic authority, as well as whenever there is reasonable ground to believe 
that such an act has been committed.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also reminds the 
Government that article 12 of the Convention against Torture requires competent 
authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that torture has been committed, and article 7 of the Convention against 
Torture requires State parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. Based on the 
information presented, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of the named 
individuals under the Convention against Torture have been violated. The Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government to immediately undertake prompt, impartial and effective 
investigations of all allegations of torture, leading to prosecution and punishment of the 
perpetrators, and to provide full redress to victims, including measures of non-repetition. In 
addition, the Government must undertake a review of all judicial verdicts to ensure 
compliance with the international standard that forbids the use against criminal defendants 
of any evidence obtained under coercion. </p>

<p><b>(a)   </b>JUA 23/02/2011 Case No. LBY 1/2011 State reply: None to date <b>Alleged excessive use of 
force against protesters. </b> 
</p>
<p>97. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has 
not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued 
by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to allegations of excessive use 
of force against protestors by security forces resulting in the deaths of at least 233 people. 
The Special Rapporteur reiterates that Principle 4 of the UN Basic Principles on the Use of 
Force and Firearms by Law Officials, which provides that, &#8220;[l]aw enforcement officials, in 
carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to 
the use of force and firearms.&#8221; Moreover, article 12 of the Convention against Torture 
requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation 
wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been committed, and 
article 7 of the Convention against Torture, requires State parties to prosecute suspected 
perpetrators of torture.   
</p>
<p>98. Similarly, paragraph 7(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 
2011 urges States &#8220;[t]o take persistent, determined and effective measures to have all 
allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
investigated promptly, effectively and impartially by an independent, competent domestic 
authority, as well as whenever there is reasonable ground to believe that such an act has 
been committed; to hold persons who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate such acts 
responsible, to have them brought to justice and punished in a manner commensurate with 
the gravity of the offence, including the officials in charge of the place of detention where 
the prohibited act is found to have been committed; and to take note, in this respect, of the 
Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the updated set of principles for the 
protection of human rights through action to combat impunity as a useful tool in efforts to 
prevent and combat torture.&#8221; Based on the information received, the Special Rapporteur 
determines that the rights of many of the aforementioned protesters under the UN </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>44</b>  
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the new 
Government of Lybia to immediately conduct a full investigation and prosecution of those 
responsible, in appropriate cases to surrender suspects to the International Criminal Court in 
accordance with the Security Council resolution that referred the Lybian situation to that 
judicial body, and to ensure that all victims of torture obtain redress, including fair and 
adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible. 
</p>

</p>
<p>99. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has 
not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued 
by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the use of excessive force by 
security forces resulting in death and injury, as well as the arrest and incommunicado 
detention of human rights defenders. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special 
Rapporteur determines that the rights of the individuals named in the communication under 
the UN Convention against Torture have been violated. He calls on the new Government of 
Lybia to undertake an investigation, leading to the prosecution and punishment of the 
perpetrators, or to their surrender to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in 
accordance with the Security Council resolution referring the Lybian situation to that Court, 
and to provide full redress to the victims, including measures of rehabilitation and non-
repetition. 
</p>
<p><b>(c)   </b>JUA 18/03/2011 Case No. LBY 3/2011 State reply: None to date <b>Alleged cases of

</p>
<p>100. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has 
not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued 
by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged incommunicado 
detention, ill-treatment, and possible enforced disappearance of Mr. Mohamed Al Shareef, 
Mr. Adel Abdallah Almadaa Salah, Mr. Abdalsalem Alqanashi, Mr. Ali Mubarak Omran, 
Mr. Alsadek Almabrouk Hamada Bridan, Mr. Abdalkarin Mohamed Abdalkarim, Mr. Salah 
Almabrouk Saad, Mr. Abdallah Abdalsilam Khalifa, Mr. Nasser Amar Ali, Mr. Farj Amar 
Ali, Mr. Assam Mohamed Abdalrazak Shahat, Mr. Ali Mohamed Salah, Mr. Souad Ali 
Boumbrika, Mr. Abdessalam Youness, and Mr. Adam Masaoud Mohamed Idriss, as well of 
hundreds of other persons allegedly detained in unknown locations. The Special Rapporteur 
recalls paragraph 8(b) of  Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011, which 
states: &#8220;[p]rolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places can facilitate the 
perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and 
can in itself constitute a form of such treatment.&#8221; In the absence of evidence to the contrary, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of the aforementioned individuals under 
the UN Convention against Torture have been violated, and calls on the new Government 
of Lybia to undertake prompt, impartial and effective investigations of these acts, leading to 
prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators of torture, and in appropriate cases to their 
surrender to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in accordance with the 
Security Council resolution that referred the Lybian situation to that judicial body, and to 
provide full redress to all victims. The Special Rapporteur calls on the new Government to 
abolish the practice of incommunicado detention and secret places of detention and 
interrogation. 
</p>
<p><b>(d)    </b>JAL 07/04/2011 Case No. LBY 5/2011 State reply: none to date <b>Alleged abduction and 
rape by security forces. </b> 
</p>
<p>101. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Lybia has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred, inter alia, to the reported torture, rape and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>45 
</b></p>
<p>sexual assault of Ms. Eman al-Obaidi by members of Gaddafi security forces. In the 
absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of 
Ms. al-Obaidi under the UN Convention against Torture were violated. The Special 
Rapporteur draws the Government's attention to article 12 of the Convention against 
Torture, which requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial 
investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been 
committed, and article 7 of the Convention against Torture, which requires State parties to 
prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. The Special Rapporteur also recalls a recent 
report to the Human Rights Council, which stresses that &#8220;rape and other serious acts of 
</p>
<p>sexual violence by officials in contexts of detention or control not only amount to torture or 
ill-treatment, but also constitute a particularly egregious form of it, due to the stigmatization 
they carry&#8221; (A/HRC/7/3, para. 69). The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to 
</p>
<p>immediately undertake a prompt, impartial and effective investigation of these facts, 
leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full redress to the 
victim.

<p><b>expression and assembly.  
</b></p>
<p>102. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Malawi has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged denial of medical 
treatment to Mr. Brian Nyasulu while in detention. The Special Rapporteur recalls rule 
22(2) of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that, 
&#8220;[s]ick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialized 
institutions or to civil hospitals. Where hospital facilities are provided in an institution, their 
equipment, furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies shall be proper for the medical care 
and treatment of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of suitable trained officers.&#8221; In the 
absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that medical 
treatment in detention was indeed denied to Mr. Nyasulu, constituting cruel, inhuman and 
degrading treatment. He encourages the Government to provide the results of any 
investigation into the mistreatment of Mr. Nyasulu.

</p>
<p>103. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Malaysia for its response to this 
communication regarding allegations of risk of ill-treatment and discrimination in the 
deportation proceedings of Mr. X, an Ahmadiyyah man from Karachi, Pakistan. The 
Special Rapporteur notes that paragraph 9 of General Comment No. 20 of the Human 
Rights Committee states that State parties &#8220;must not expose individuals to the danger of 
</p>
<p>torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon return to another 
country by way of extradition, expulsion or refoulement.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur thanks 
</p>
<p>the Government for its explanation of the administrative proceedings undertaken to 
determine the fate of Mr. X and appreciates that the office of the UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees is taking part in the process. The Special Rapporteur believes, in any case, that 
prior history of persecution is highly relevant to the determination of risk and cautions that </p>

de los presuntos secuestros, en coordinaci&#243;n con la Delegaci&#243;n del Ministerio P&#250;blico de la

determinado que unos 30 extranjeros indocumentados fueron capturados el 16 de diciembre 
de 2010 por un grupo armado en el tren que se dirig&#237;a a Ixtepec, a la altura de Chahuites, 
Estado de Oaxaca. En referencia a la situaci&#243;n de los migrantes detenidos, el Gobierno

<p>117. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Myanmar has not responded 
to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged use of solitary 
confinement and limiting family visits on political prisoners in response to their hunger 
strike. In this context, the Special Rapporteur recalls principle 19 of the Body of Principles 
for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, which 
states that, &#8220;[a] detained or imprisoned person shall have the right to be visited by and to 
correspond with, in particular, members of his family and shall be given adequate 
opportunity to communicate with the outside world [&#8230;]&#8221;. With regard to the use of solitary 
confinement as punishment, the Special Rapporteur stresses that solitary confinement 
should be used only in very exceptional circumstances, as a last resort, for as short a time as 
possible (paragraph 89, A/66/268). He urges the Government to prohibit the imposition of 
solitary confinement as punishment - either as a part of a judicially imposed sentence or a 
disciplinary measure.

<p>118. The Special Rapporteur thanks the response transmitted by the Government of 
Myanmar regarding the communication dated 26 July 2011. The communication referred to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>52</b>  
</p>
<p>the alleged solitary confinement, incommunicado detention and ban on family visits of Ms. 
Hnin May Aung, a student activist. Regrettably, the Government&#8223;s response failed to 
address the allegation of ban on family visits since 7 July 2011. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to draw the attention of the Government to principle 19 of the Body 
of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or 
Imprisonment and rule 37 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. 
In the absence of contradictory evidence, the Special Rapporteur concludes that Ms. Hnin 
May Aung has been subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in violation of 
international standards. He calls on the Government of Myanmar to provide the result of 
any investigation into allegations of bans on family visits after 29 June 2011 and to prevent 
recurrence of these acts.

<p>119. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Myanmar has not responded 
to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged ill-treatment and the use 
of prolonged solitary confinement on Mr. Shin Gambira. The Special Rapporteur recalls 
article 7 of the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that &#8220;efforts 
addressed to the abolition of solitary confinement as a punishment, or to the restriction of 
its use, should be undertaken and encouraged&#8221;. In light of the fact that no evidence has been 
provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the rights of Mr. Gambira 
under the international standards prohibiting torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment have been violated. With respect to the use of prolonged solitary 
confinement, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that prolonged solitary confinement, in 
excess of 15 days, constitutes either cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or torture, and 
should be subject to an absolute prohibition.

<p>120. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Nigeria has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to allegations of torture and killing of children 
suspected of witchcraft in Akwa Ibom State, and death threats against Mr. Sam Itauma, the 
coordinator of a local NGO that cares for children accused of witchcraft. The Special 
Rapporteur notes that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 
2011 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States 
to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Based on the information received, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of these children under the UN Convention 
against Torture have been violated, and calls on the Government to ensure that all children 
are specially protected against abuse and, if subjected to torture and other forms of ill-
treatment, they obtain redress, including fair and adequate compensation, and as full 
rehabilitation as possible. </p>

<p>121. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Nigeria has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred, inter alia, to the alleged ill-treatment of Mr. 
Mallam Aliyu Tasheku while in detention, including denial of access to health care. The

detention of protesters in the context of peaceful demonstrations. </b> 
</p>
<p>122. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Oman for its reply, dated 6 June 
2011, to this communication in reference to the alleged killings of Mr. Abdullah al-
Ghamalasi and one other, the detention and torture of Messrs. Ahmed al-Shezawi and 
Abdul Gufar al-Shewazi, and the incommunicado detention of nine protesters including 
Messrs. Ali al-Badi and Hilal al-Alawi during the demonstrations of 29 March 2011. In its 
response, the Government of Oman indicated that one person was killed during the protests 
and confirmed that detainees have been placed in solitary confinement, including Mr. al-
Alawi, who the Government indicates was charged with forcibly preventing the public 
authorities from doing their work, resisting arrest, possession of an unlicensed firearm, and 
disrupting public traffic. The Government reported that  &#8220;a few people have been placed in 
solitary confinement [...] as they had to be separated from the others to stop them from 
colluding with each other in order to come up with a common version of the events.&#8221; The 
</p>
<p>Government indicated that &#8220;solitary confinement&#8221; is governed by the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, and allows isolation of an accused from other detainees without prejudice to the 
right to remain in contact with the accused's defense lawyer. The Government also 
indicated that two cases have gone to criminal courts, and that a judge decided to release 
Hilal al-Alawi and Ali al-Badi on 18 May 2011, along with others who were &#8220;charged with 
the lesser offense.&#8221; However, the Government responded that the remaining defendants are 
</p>
<p>still in pretrial detention, and indicated that compensation has not been provided to the 
victims as the case is &#8220;still under investigation.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur notes that the 
</p>
<p>practice of solitary confinement can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
torture, particularly when used during pre-trial detention, due to the punitive nature of 
solitary confinement and the pain and suffering it may inflict on the accused. In this 
context, the Special Rapporteur draws the Government's attention to article 7 of the Basic 
Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that &#8220;efforts addressed to the 
abolition of solitary confinement as a punishment, or to the restriction of its use, should be 
undertaken and encouraged.&#8221; (Adopted by the General Assembly by Resolution 45/111 of 
</p>
<p>14 December 1990.)  The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that , per paragraph 
8(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011, &#8220;[p]rolonged 
incommunicado detention or detention in secret places can facilitate the perpetration of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself 
constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards 
concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person and to ensure that secret places 
of detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
</p>
<p>Government of Oman to ensure a prompt and independent investigation of all possible 
cases of torture, leading to prosecution of perpetrators, and to provide redress to all victims 
of ill-treatment or torture. In order to ensure non-repetition of these acts, the Special </p>

</p>
<p>123. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Pakistan for its two responses to 
this communication regarding the alleged arbitrary detention, torture, and imposition of 
death sentence on Mr. Sarabjit Singh. Regrettably, the Government&#8223;s response failed to 
address the allegation that Mr. Singh&#8223;s whereabouts remained unknown for the first 9 
months after his arrest on 30 August 1990. In view of these allegations, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that paragraph 8(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 
April 2011 asserts that &#8220;[p]rolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places 
can facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to 
respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person and to 
ensure that secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221; Furthermore, the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8223;s response neglected to indicate whether an investigation has been conducted 
into the allegation that Mr. Singh was in fact held in solitary confinement from 1991 until 
</p><p>2003. Based on the information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that Mr. 
Singh&#8223;s rights under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated, and calls on 
the Government to set aside any criminal conviction based on evidence obtained under 
coercion and ensure that Mr. Singh obtains redress, including fair and adequate 
compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible.

torture in Balochistan. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur 
determines that the rights of at least 56 persons killed in Balochistan since July 2010 have 
been violated under the UN Convention against Torture. The Special Rapporteur calls on 
the Government to undertake a prompt, impartial and effective investigation of the torture 
and extrajudicial killing of these individuals, leading to prosecution and punishment of the 
perpetrators, and to provide full redress to all victims and family members, including 
measures of non-repetition. The killings in Balochistan were the subject of two earlier

Mr. Jam Bhutto, whose fate and whereabouts remain unknown. The Special Rapporteur 
draws the Government's attention to paragraph 8(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution

facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

torture. The victims were the subject of an earlier communication (PAK 17/2010). In the 
absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of 
Mr. Eido and Mr. Nazar under the UN Convention against Torture were violated, and calls

alleged risk of deportation of Mr. Abdoolla Raviev. The Government of the Republic of

subsequently rejected on appeal on 10 August 2009, and again rejected under an 
administrative lawsuit on 24 June 2010, the decision of the Seoul High Court of 19 January 
2011, and the Supreme Court of Korea on 28 April 2011. The Government indicated that 
Mr. Raviev was repatriated to Uzbekistan on 18 May 2011, and that Mr. Raviev's 
deportation had been suspended for 3 years to give time for a thorough investigation of Mr. 
Raviev's claim after he had overstayed his visa in 2009. In its reply, the Government of the

not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued 
by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged raid on the

upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and

<p><b>(b)    </b>JAL 14/01/2011 Case No. RUS 1/2011 State reply: 28/03/2011 <b>Alleged pattern of 
impunity regarding the deaths of lawyers and human rights activists.</b> 
</p>
<p>132. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Russian Federation for its 
response to this communication concerning allegations of a pattern of impunity for the 
deaths of lawyers and human rights activists including Mr. Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who 
died in custody on 16 November 2009. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that 
when the State detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in 
protecting that individual&#8223;s rights, especially his or her right to physical integrity. When an 
individual dies as a consequence of injuries sustained while in State custody, there is a 
presumption of State responsibility, particularly when the person was in good health at the 
time of his arrest (see ECHR, Selmouni v France and Aksoy v Turkey).  In the Magnitsky 
case, attempts to present the cause of death as arising from natural causes is particularly 
unpersuasive given the medical records available and the fact that urgent medical attention 
was denied to him as his condition deteriorated. To overcome the presumption of State 
responsibility for a death resulting from injuries sustained in custody, there must be a 
&#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary 
and summary executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable 
reports suggest unnatural death in the above circumstances&#8221; (principle 9 of the Principles 
on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary 
Executions). This obligation to investigate and punish all acts of torture and other forms of 
ill-treatment also arises under articles 7 and 12 of the UN Convention against Torture. The 
Special Rapporteur is especially concerned that, although officials presumably involved in 
Magnitsky&#8223;s arrest and treatment in detention have been identified, their conduct has not 
been properly investigated. Instead, Magnitsky&#8223;s relatives are being asked to contribute 
evidence or be portrayed as not being interested in the investigation. The Special 
Rapporteur insists that torture is such a serious crime that it requires investigation and 
prosecution ex officio under all circumstances.

</p>
<p>133. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Russian Federation for its 
reply, dated 11 May 2011, to this communication regarding the alleged torture of Mr. Rasul 
Kudaev. Mr. Kudaev had also been the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Chair-
Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on 27 May 2004. In its reply, the 
Government indicated that Mr. Kudaev had been arrested on 23 October 2005 and on 21 
March 2011 his remand in custody was extended until 26 June 2011. The Government 
reported that Mr. Kudaev underwent medical examinations, the results of which showed 
him to be suffering from &#8220;chronic gastritis, cholecystitis and osteochondrosis of the lumbar 
vertebrae.&#8221; The Government indicated that &#8220;[w]hen examined on 15 April 2011, Mr. 
</p>
<p>Kudaev's condition was found to be satisfactory, and he was considered to be in reasonable 
health.&#8221; The Government noted that &#8220;[i]ndependent inspections have not been instituted by </p>

</b></p>

</p>
<p>the Office of the Procurator, or any judicial or monitoring bodies.&#8221; The Government 
</p>
<p>additionally indicated that &#8220;[n]o evidence has been found to substantiate the claims that 
</p>
<p>physical force and special measures were used against Mr. Kudaev&#8221; during a transfer on 4 
March 2010. The Government reported that on 10 March 2011, during a full personal 
search and inspection of Mr. Kudaev's belongings, nine complaints and petitions were 
confiscated from him by authorities, and noted that the Office of the Procurator found this 
confiscation to be illegal and that &#8220;disciplinary action was taken against four members of 
</p>
<p>staff of the remand center&#8221; for this confiscation. The Government reports that Mr. Kudaev's 
</p>
<p>transfer to a &#8220;punishment cell&#8221; for 15 days on 10 March 2011 was punishment for 
&#8220;breaking the internal rules of the remand centre&#8221; and &#8220;was not connected with the search 
</p>
<p>and confiscation of documents,&#8221; and notes that the Office of the Procurator &#8220;deemed the 
</p>
<p>decision legal and well founded.&#8221; The Government notes that the Kabardino-Balkaria 
division of the National Investigation Committee has registered nine complaints from Mr. 
Kudaev since 2005, has not initiated a criminal case for any of them, and on 18 April 2011 
overturned the decisions on five of the complaints &#8220;on grounds of incomplete 
verifications.&#8221; The Government indicated that on 11 February 2008, Mr. Kudaev's 
</p>
<p>complaint regarding detention regulations was rejected, and that the criminal division of the 
Supreme Court of Kabardino-Balkaria upheld this decision on an appeal of cassation. The 
Government states that &#8220;[n]o information is available on whether torture was used during 
</p>
<p>the preliminary investigation.&#8221; The Government also indicated that &#8220;[i]nformation on 
</p>
<p>intereference in Mr. Kudaev's hearing with his lawyers is unfounded.&#8221; Based on the 
information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that Mr. Kudaev's rights under the 
UN Convention against Torture have been violated. The Special Rapporteur draws the 
Government's attention to article 15 of the Convention against Torture, which provides that 
&#8220;[e]ach State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made 
</p>
<p>as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings except against a 
person accused of torture as evidence the statement was made.&#8221; He also takes note that Mr. 
Kudaev was not provided with adequate and independent medical care while in detention. 
The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that article 12 of the Convention against 
Torture requires competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation 
wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been committed, and 
article 7 of the Convention against Torture requires State parties to prosecute suspected 
perpetrators of torture. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake 
prompt, impartial and effective investigations into the alleged incidents of torture against 
Mr. Kudaev, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full 
and effective redress to Mr. Kudaev, including adequate and independent medical care and 
measures of non-repetition to guarantee his physical and mental integrity. He calls on the 
Government to promptly report on measures undertaken.

reply, dated 20 May 2011, to this communication in reference to the alleged torture and 
death of detainees in the correctional facility IK-1 in Kopejsk, Chelyabinks. In its reply, the 
Government confirmed that Mr. Sergei Samujlenkov was &#8220;found hung in the cell of the 
correctional facility&#8221; on 3 January 2011 and stated that Mr. Samujlenkov &#8220;repeatedly 
committed acts of self-mutilation and on many occasions attempted to commit suicide.&#8221; 
The Government indicated that Mr. Samujlenkov &#8220;did not lodge any official or formal 
</p>
<p>complaints or petitions regarding confinement conditions.&#8221; The Government noted that an 
</p>
<p>investigation of his death concluded the cause of death was &#8220;self-hanging.&#8221; It reported that 
on 14 April 2011, in the framework of a second investigation, the body was disinterred and 
it was determined that &#8220;wounds on his forearms, an abrasion on his forehead and a bruise 
on his left ear auricle&#8221; were all self-inflicted. The Government denied that videos allegedly </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>59 
</b></p>
<p>showing Mr. Samujlenkov hanged from his cell were staged by authorities. The 
Government reported that on 22 April 2011 the Investigation Committee of the Russian 
Federation decided &#8220;not to initiate a criminal case due to the absence of criminal intent.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>The Government acknowledged that &#8220;officers used physical force and special means&#8221; 
</p>
<p>against Messrs. Mamukov, Aivaseda, and Sakhabaev, which &#8220;resulted in [their] death.&#8221; The 
</p>
<p>Government reported that &#8220;[a]ll together, 18 officials of the criminal correctional system in 
Chelyabinsk Region of the Russian Federation were charged with criminal offense[s] and 
put on trial,&#8221; and indicated that sentencing had been set for 24 May 2011. The Government 
reported that the Investigation Commission of the Russian Federation opened a criminal 
case for the offenses of &#8220;exceeding official powers&#8221; and &#8220;intentional infliction of a grave 
</p>
<p>injury [involving] death of the victim by negligence.&#8221; The Government reported that the 
head of the Main Directorate of the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences 
(MDFSES) was &#8220;severely reprimanded,&#8221; nine agents of the MDFSES were given a &#8220;strong 
</p>
<p>incompetence note,&#8221; and three others were &#8220;reprimanded.&#8221; The Government indicated that 
</p>
<p>in criminal court seven officers of IK-1 were charged with the offenses of murder, 
exceeding official powers, preparations for a crime and attempted crimes, and official 
forgery; the heads of IK-1 and MDFSES were charged with abuse of official powers, 
&#8220;concealment of crimes,&#8221; &#8220;knowingly false denunciation,&#8221; and official forgery. The 
Government reported that all of the named officials were dismissed from their positions, 
including the Head of the MDFSES and the Head of the Security Directorate of MDFSES. 
However, the Government did not address the reported death of Mr. Sergei Polyaev, nor did 
it provide information regarding the alleged ill-treatment of eight other detainees during the 
same incident. Based on the information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that 
Mr. Sergei Samujlenkov's death in custody was likely the result of torture and ill-treatment, 
and calls on the Government to seriously undertake a prompt, independent, impartial and 
effective investigation of the death of Mr. Samujlenkov, leading to the prosecution and 
punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide redress to his family members. He also 
determines, based on the information provided, that the rights of Messrs. Aivaseda, 
Mamukov, Sahkabaev, Polyaev, and the other named individuals under the UN Convention 
against Torture have been violated, and calls on the Government promptly and impartially 
to investigate the remaining allegations of torture, prosecute and punish the perpetrators, 
and provide full redress. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to acknowledge that 18 officials

<p>135. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Russian Federation for its 
reply, dated 1 June 2011, in response to this communication in reference to the alleged 
excessive use of force and ill-treatment used by security forces against Mr. Magomed 
Khazbiev, member of the Expert Council under the Human Rights Ombudsperson of the 
Russian Federation, and his brothers Berd and Murad. The Government indicated that Mr. 
Khazbiev and his brothers organized a demonstration that illegally blocked traffic and 
began throwing stones at law enforcement officers, confirmed that they were detained by 
military officers, and reported that they were allowed to contact defense counsel and 
relatives but that Mr. Khazbiev &#8220;refused the help of (defense) counsel.&#8221; The Government 
reported that Magomed, Berd and Murad Khazbiev were found guilty of an administrative 
offense (&#8220;failure to comply with the lawful demands of militia officers&#8221;) and sentenced to 
</p>
<p>10 days, 5 days, and 1 day administrative detention respectively, and the decisions were 
upheld on appeal. The Government did not report on the alleged acts of ill-treatment, 
including beatings and denial of medicine. The Special Rapporteur draws the Government's </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.4 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>attention to paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011, 
which &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States 
to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Based on the information provided, the 
Special Rapporteur concludes that the rights of Mr. Khazbiev and his brothers under the 
UN Convention against Torture have been violated, and calls on the Government to 
undertake a prompt and impartial investigation of the alleged acts of torture, to provide full 
redress, and to ensure that any evidence against the victims obtained under torture is 
inadmissible.

</p>
<p>136. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Russian Federation for its 
reply, dated 1 June 2011, to this communication in reference to the alleged detention of Mr. 
Nizomnhon Juraev, an asylum seeker at risk of extradition to Tajikistan, where it is alleged 
that he will be tortured. In its reply, the Government indicated that at the time of 
submission the case of Mr. Juraev was on a cassation appeal before &#8220;the highest court of the 
Russian Federation&#8221; following a ruling by the Moscow municipal court of 12 April 2011 to 
</p>
<p>extradite him. The Government additionally stated that the present communication does not 
fall within the mandate of the Special Rapporteur as the named party &#8220;has not been 
subjected to torture during his detention (in Russia).&#8221; In this respect, the Special Rapporteur 
reminds the Government of the Russian Federation of article 3 of the Convention against 
Torture, which provides that no State party shall expel, return (refouler), or extradite a 
person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person 
would be in danger of being subjected to torture. This obligation is reaffirmed in paragraph 
9 of General Comment 20 of the Human Rights Committee and paragraph 9 of the 
Resolution A/RES/61/253 of the UN General Assembly. The Special Rapporteur also 
draws the attention of the Government to article 3 of the Convention against Torture, which 
provides that no State party shall expel, return (refouler), or extradite a person to another 
State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger 
of being subjected to torture. The Special Rapporteur draws the attention of the 
Government to paragraph 16 of the Resolution A/RES/65/205 of the UN General Assembly 
which urges States &#8220;not to expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), extradite or in any other way transfer a 
</p>
<p>person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person 
would be in danger of being subjected to torture, and recognizes that diplomatic assurances, 
where used, do not release States from their obligations under international human rights, 
humanitarian and refugee law, in particular the principle of non-refoulement.&#8221; The Special 
Rapporteur also recalls that paragraph 7(d) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 
12 April 2011 urges States &#8220;[n]ot to expel, return (refouler), extradite or in any way transfer 
</p>
<p>a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person 
would be in danger of being subjected to torture.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur urges the 
</p>
<p>Government of the Russian Federation to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the 
rights and freedoms of Mr. Juraev are respected and, if investigations support or suggest the 
allegations to be correct, to adopt effective measures to prevent Mr. Juraev's extradition. </p>

<p>that the rights of Mr. Al Manasif under the UN Convention against Torture have been

<p>141. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of South Africa has not 
responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by 
the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to allegations of  &#8220;corrective&#8221; rape 
of Ms. X, a lesbian woman. According to the information received, since this incident took 
place, the court-case addressing it had reportedly been postponed numerous times, and the 
alleged perpetrator was released on bail. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that paragraph 2 
of General Comment 20 of the Human Rights Committee asserts that &#8220;[t]he aim of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>63 
</b></p>
<p>provisions of article 7 [on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading

of the State party to afford everyone protection through legislative and other measures as 
may be necessary against the acts prohibited by article 7, whether inflicted by people acting 
in their official capacity, outside their official capacity or in a private capacity&#8221; (Adopted at

<p>the 44th session of the Human Rights Committee, 1992). Moreover, article 12 of the UN

authorities proceed to a prompt and impartial investigation, wherever there is reasonable 
ground to believe that an act of torture has been committed in any territory under its 
jurisdiction.&#8221; Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to act expediently 
</p>
<p>to ensure the full investigation and prosecution of relevant perpetrators. Based on the 
information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that Ms. X&#8223;s rights under the UN

of Mr. Wickramasinghe Arachchige Ranjith Chandrasiri Perera while in detention. In light 
of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur 
concludes that the rights of Mr. Wickramasinghe under the UN Convention against Torture

contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of Mr. Gunasundaram

can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect the 
safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person and to ensure that 
secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221;  Accordingly, based on the 
</p>
<p>information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of the identified 
individuals under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated. The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government to immediately investigate all allegations of torture

</b></p>
<p>that under the UN Convention against Torture the rights of Mr. Suleiman Wida'a, Ms.

Wida'a, Bashir, Tinga, and Ibrahim. He also calls on the new Government to undertake a 
prompt, independent and effective investigation of alleged acts of torture against all named

</p>
<p>but that suspects of &#8220;sabotage, arson, or murder&#8221; are being prosecuted and punished. 
</p>
<p>However, the Government did not provide specific information on the fate or whereabouts 
of any of the detainees by name. The Special Rapporteur recalls paragraph 8(b) of Human 
Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011, which reminds States that &#8220;[p]rolonged 
incommunicado detention or detention in secret places can facilitate the perpetration of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself 
constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards 
concerning the liberty, security and dignity of the person and to ensure that secret places of 
detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221; In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur determines that the rights under the UN Convention against Torture of 
the detained individuals named in the communication have been violated, and calls on the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>66</b>  
</p>
<p>Government to ensure the physical and mental integrity of all detainees and undertake a 
prompt and impartial investigation of alleged acts of torture, including prosecution and 
punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide appropriate and adequate redress. 
Additionally, he urges the Government to abolish the practice of incommunicado detention.

</p>
<p>149. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the reported torture 
and forced disappearance of Mr. Mohammed Hasan al-Labwani, as well as possible torture 
during the detention of Mr. Najati Tayara and Mr. Mazen Adi; incommunicado detention of 
Mr. Mohamed Yassin Al-Hamwi and Mr. Amjad Baiazy; and alleged enforced 
disappearance of Mr. Wael Al-Hamada, Mr. Abdel Rahman Al-Hamada, Mr. Hassan Abd 
al-Adhim, Mr. Omar Qashaash, and Mr. Yasser Al-Khayyat in connection with 
demonstrations. Without any evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines 
that the rights of Mr. Mohammed Hasan al-Labwani and the other Syrian nationals under 
the UN Convention against Torture have been violated, and calls on the Government to 
investigate, prosecute, and punish all cases of torture, providing full redress to the victims, 
including fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible.

<p><b>(c)   </b>JUA 17/06/2011 Case No. SYR 7/2011 State reply: None to date <b>Alleged killings of 
protesters, excessive use of force and denial of life-saving medical treatment.</b> 
</p>
<p>150. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Syrian Arab Republic has 
failed to cooperate with the mandate established by the Human Rights Council through its 
lack of reply to the communication dated 17 June 2011. The communication, among other 
allegations, referred to the excessive use of force by Syrian security forces against peaceful 
protesters resulting in several hundred deaths; the alleged denial of access to life-saving 
medical assistance to wounded protesters, namely Mr. Moataz Bellah Shaar and Mr. Gassan 
Khalifa; the alleged abduction and secret detention of a large number of injured protesters; 
the alleged torture of a large number of detainees including children; and at least the alleged 
rape of one male detainee. The Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 1 of Human Rights 
Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall 
remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, 
and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special 
Rapporteur would like to draw the attention of the Government to paragraph 7(a) of 
Resolution 8/8 of the Human Rights Council which reminds the Governments that corporal 
punishment, including of children, can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment 
or even to torture. The Special Rapporteur refers to the mandate&#8223;s report to the Human 
Rights Council (A/HRC/7/3, para. 69), in which he stressed that &#8220;rape and other serious 
</p>
<p>acts of sexual violence by officials in contexts of detention or control not only amount to 
torture or ill-treatment, but also constitute a particular egregious form of it, due to the 
stigmatization they carry&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to recall article 
12 of the UN Convention against Torture, which requires the competent authorities to 
undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that torture has been committed, and article 7 of the UN Convention against 
Torture, which requires State parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture.  In light 
of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur 
determines that there have been various and extremely serious violations of rights of 
victims and urges the Government to undertake prompt and impartial investigation of all 
cases of alleged torture, secret detention, and denial of access to medicine. The Special </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>67 
</b></p>
<p>Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure the accountability of those responsible and to 
provide full redress to the victims, including fair and adequate compensation, and as full 
rehabilitation as possible.

<p><b>(d)    </b>JAL 29/06/2011 Case No. SYR 6/2011 State reply: 25/10/2011 <b>Alleged arrest and 
detention of human rights activists following peaceful protests. 
</b></p>
<p>151. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for its 
response to the communication dated 29 June 2011 regarding the arrest, the alleged 
incommunicado detention and ill-treatment of 13 human rights activists from the Assyrian 
Democratic Organization (ADO). According to the information received, all 13 persons 
were detained for a total of six days incommunicado at the Political Security branch of Al-
Hasakah and some of them were allegedly brutally beaten and insulted by State security&#8223;s 
agents. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its explanation of the legal 
grounds and the administrative and judicial proceedings regarding this case. However, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate paragraph 8(b) of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23, which states that &#8220;[p]rolonged incommunicado detention or detention in 
secret places can facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment.&#8221;  The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur would also like to draw the attention of the Government to article 12 of the 
Convention against Torture, which requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt 
and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has 
been committed, and to article 7, which requires State parties to prosecute suspected 
perpetrators of torture. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that on 31 May 2011 a 
Legislative Decree No. 61 was issued, granting a general amnesty for a number of offences 
including those allegedly committed by the persons concerned. He also notes that according 
to the Government none of the persons concerned were beaten or abused in any way and 
not detained in solitary confinement. However, The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government&#8223;s response neglected to indicate whether an investigation has been conducted 
into the allegation of ill-treatment or not. The Special Rapporteur therefore calls on the 
Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to investigate, prosecute and punish all cases of 
ill-treatment and to provide the result of any investigation, medical examination, and 
judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to this case. The 
Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue its engagement with the 
Mandate.<b>

</b></p>
<p>152. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Syrian Arab Republic has 
not responded to the communication dated 3 August 2011, thereby failing to cooperate with 
the mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
alleged arrest and secret detention of three brothers: Mr. Bashar Al Sahyoni, Mr. Mohamed 
Al Sahyoni, and Mr. Ghassan Al Sahyoni, following their active participation in 
demonstrations in the area of Banias. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
draw the attention of the Government to paragraph 7(b) and paragraph 8(b) of Human 
Rights Council Resolution 16/23; to article 12 of the Convention against Torture, which 
requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation 
wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been committed; and to 
article 7, which requires State parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. In light 
of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur 
expresses his conviction that the rights of Messrs. Al Shahyoni under the UN Convention 
against Torture have been violated. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to cease 
the practice of secret detention; calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and </p>

</b></p>
<p>153. The Special rapporteur regrets that the Government of Syrian Arab Republic has 
failed to cooperate with the mandate established by the Human Rights Council through its 
lack of response to the communication dated 4 August 2011. The communication referred 
to the alleged incommunicado detention of Mr. Moutaz Mourad; the alleged secret 
detention and solitary confinement of Mr. Anas Al-Shughri; the alleged denial of food and 
medication during detention of Mr. Sabri Mirza; and the alleged secret and incommunicado 
detention of Mr. Rami Mohamed Dalati, Mr. Osama Nasser, and Mr. Mohammad 
Alammar. The Special Rapporteur would like to draw the attention of the Government to 
paragraph 6 of General Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights Committee; article 7 of the 
Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners; rules 22(2) and 25(1) of the Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, and paragraph 8(b) of Human Rights 
Council Resolution 16/23. In light of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the 
contrary, the Special Rapporteur is persuaded that there has been a violation of rights of the 
above mentioned persons under the UN Convention against Torture. The Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government to cease the practice of incommunicado and secret 
detention; calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation of the 
allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; to 
ensure the accountability of those responsible; and to prevent recurrence of these acts.  <b>

</b></p>
<p>154. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Syrian Arab Republic failed 
to respond to the communication dated 10 August 2011, thereby withholding cooperation 
with the mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to 
the alleged secret detention of, and denial of medication for Mr. Mohamed Jamal Al 
Tahhan, a political activist. The Special Rapporteur would like to draw the attention of the 
Government to paragraph 8(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 and principle 24 
of the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or 
Imprisonment. In light of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the contrary, the 
Special Rapporteur concludes that there has been a violation of the rights of Mr. Al Tahhan 
under the UN Convention against Torture. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
cease the practice of secret detention and calls on the Government to undertake a prompt 
and impartial investigation of the allegation of denial of medication; to ensure the 
accountability of those responsible; and to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  <b>

</b></p>
<p>155. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Gvernment of Syrian Arab Republic failed 
to respond to the communication dated 30 August 2011, thereby withholding cooperation 
with the mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to 
the alleged secret detention of Mr. Walid Al-Bunni and his son, the alleged ill-treatment of 
Ms. Handai Zahlout to obtain confession, the alleged physical assault on Mr. Mohamed 
Najati Tayara in prison, and the alleged incommunicado detention of Ahmad Tomeh before 
being released. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to draw the attention of the 
Government to articles 7 and 12 of the UN Convention against Torture, to paragraph 1 and 
paraghraph 8(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, and to principle 15 of the UN </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>69 
</b></p>
<p>Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Officials. In light of the fact that 
no evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur is convinced that 
there have been several violations of rights of the victims under the UN Convention against 
Torture. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to cease the practice of secret 
detention and calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation of 
the allegations of torture and ill-treatment; to ensure the accountability of those responsible; 
and to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  <b>

</p>
<p>156. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Tajikistan has not responded 
to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to allegations of torture and lack of medical 
attention against Mr. Ilhom Ismanov. As stated in the communication, Mr. Ismanov had 
been the subject of a joint urgent appeal sent by the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention; the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers; and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment on 19 November 2010. In view of the allegations of torture and 
lack of medical attention, concern was expressed about the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Ismanov. Further concern was expressed about the lack of investigation 
into the allegations of torture. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that article 12 of the 
Convention against Torture requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and 
impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has 
been committed, and article 7 requires State parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of 
torture. Based on the information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that the 
rights of Mr. Ismanov under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated. The 
Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to immediately conduct a full investigation 
and prosecution of those responsible, and ensure that Mr. Ismanov obtains redress, 
including fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible.

</b></p>
<p>157. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Thailand for its response to this 
communication regarding the alleged arrest and detention of 60 Ahmadis of Pakistani 
origin seeking asylum in Thailand. According to the information received, there are 
substantial grounds to believe that if forcibly returned to Pakistan, these individuals would 
face ill-treatment. Article 3 of the UN Convention against Torture holds that no State party 
shall expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), or extradite a person to another State where there are 
substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to 
torture. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its explanation of the 
administrative proceedings undertaken to determine the grant or denial of asylum for each 
individual in this group of refugees, and appreciates that the Government does not endorse 
a policy of forced return. The Special Rapporteur believes, in any case, that prior history of 
persecution is highly relevant to the determination of risk and cautions that diplomatic 
assurances of favorable treatment from the receiving country does not mitigate the State&#8223;s 
</p>

Messrs. Stephen Otage, Sulaiman Mutebi, Ivan Mukasa and Umar Kyeyune by the police

</p>
<p>161. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Ukraine has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication concerned the alleged detention and ill-treatment of 
fourteen Afghan individuals, including an unaccompanied minor, by Ukrainian authorities. 
Six of them were reportedly deported to Afghanistan and the remaining eight were held at 
Boryspil airport in Kyiv. The individuals had claimed they would be in danger upon return 
to Afghanistan. Additionally, they were allegedly ill-treated and beaten by border guards 
during their transportation to Kyiv. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special 
Rapporteur concludes that the rights of the aforementioned individuals under the UN 
Convention against Torture have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government to investigate, prosecute and punish the perpetrators of torture or other ill-
treatment as well as the responsibilities of the author or authors of the decision to violate 
the customary international law provision of non-refoulement and to provide full redress to

<p>162. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Ukraine has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged incommunicado detention and 
secret transfer of Mr. Dirar Abu Sisi to Israel, where he was detained and allegedly 
tortured. (See JUA Communication ISR 3/2011 of 31 March 2011). Based on the 
information received and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur 
determines that Mr. Abu Sisi was extradited to Israel in violation of the UN Convention 
against Torture. The Special Rapporteur draws the Government's attention to article 3 of the 
Convention against Torture, which provides that no State party shall expel, return 
(&#8220;refouler&#8221;), or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for 
</p>
<p>believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture. In this regard, 
paragraph 9 of General Comment No. 20 on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in which the Human Rights Committee 
states that State parties &#8220;must not expose individuals to the danger of torture or cruel, 
</p>

</p>
<p>State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger

<p>165. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United Arab Emirates 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged secret 
detention, risk of torture, and forthcoming extradition to Uzbekistan of Mr. Jamshid 
Abdurasulov. According to the information received, Mr. Abdurasulov was arrested by 
Dubai police officers on 24 February 2011 following an extradition request from 
Uzbekistan, on 15 March he received a call from Dubai police asking him to appear at 
headquarters for further questioning, and on 16 March he reportedly met with Interpol 
representatives who informed him that he had to travel to Abu Dhabi for further 
questioning. The whereabouts of Mr. Abdurasulov remain unknown. In this respect, the 
Special Rapporteur recalls paragraph 8(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 
April 2011, which reminds States that &#8220;[p]rolonged incommunicado detention or detention </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.4

urges all States to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of 
the person and to ensure that secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur also calls attention to the Government's obligation under article 3 
of the Convention of Torture, which provides that no State party shall expel, return 
(&#8220;refouler&#8221;), or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for 
</p>
<p>believing that the person would be in danger of being subjcted to torture. The Special 
Rapporteur additionally notes that while the United Arab Emirates has not ratified the 
Convention against Torture or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
rights cited therein are reflective of customary international law and, indeed peremptory 
norms binding on all states (<i>jus cogens</i>). He calls on the Government of the United Arab 
Emirates to take all necessary measures to guarantee the rights and freedoms of Mr. 
Abdurasulov, to undertake a prompt and independent investigation regarding the 
circumstances of his detention and to provide redress. He also urges the Government of the 
United Arab Emirates to abolish the practice of incommunicado detention.

<p>166. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United Arab Emirates 
has not responded to this communication, thus failing to cooperate with the mandate issued 
by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged arbitrary 
detention of Mr. Abdullah Khowar, without notification of the charges against him. Mr. 
Khowar reportedly was able to contact his wife to inform her that he was in the Damman 
prison and allegedly noted that he feared for his safety.  The Special Rapporteur reiterates 
the call for the Government to provide information concerning the arrest and detention of 
Mr. Khowar, provide results of any investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or 
other inquiries carried out, and report on the measures taken to ensure the safety and 
physical integrity of Mr. Khowar. The Special Rapporteur additionally notes that while the

to respond to the communication dated 27 September 2011, thereby withholding 
cooperation with the Mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The 
communication referred to the alleged arrest, solitary confinement, secret detention and ill-
treatment of Messrs. Ahmed Mansoor, Nasser bin Ghaith, Fahad Salim Dalk, Hassan Ali 
Khamis, and Ahmed Abdul Khaleq, human rights activists. In light of the fact that no 
evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur expresses his conviction 
that the practice of the Government has been in breach of the international standards 
prohibiting torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government to cease the practice of solitary confinement and 
incommunicado detention and calls on the Government to ensure the accountability of 
those responsible and to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  </p>

<p>168. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland has not responded to this communication, thereby 
failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The 
communication referred to allegations of risk of torture for Mr. X, a homosexual man, if

against Torture holds that no State party shall expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), or extradite a 
person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person 
would be in danger of being subjected to torture. Based on the information received, the 
Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of Mr. X under the UN Convention against 
Torture are at risk of being violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government not to 
extradite Mr. X until a fair assessment of his risk of torture is conducted.  In this context, 
diplomatic assurances do not mitigate the Government&#8223;s obligation to refrain from violating

</b></p>
<p><b>of classified information. </b> 
</p>
<p>170. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the United States of America for 
its response to this communication regarding the alleged prolonged solitary confinement of 
Mr. Bradley E. Manning, a US soldier charged with the unauthorized disclosure of 
classified information. According to the information received, Mr. Manning was held in 
solitary confinement for twenty-three hours a day following his arrest in May 2010 in Iraq, 
and continuing through his transfer to the brig at Marine Corps Base Quantico.  His solitary 
confinement - lasting about eleven months - was terminated upon his transfer from 
Quantico to the Joint Regional Correctional Facility at Fort Leavenworth on 20 April 2011. 
In his report, the Special Rapporteur stressed that &#8220;solitary confinement is a harsh measure 
which may cause serious psychological and physiological adverse effects on individuals 
regardless of their specific conditions.&#8221; Moreover, &#8220;[d]epending on the specific reason for 
</p>
<p>its application, conditions, length, effects and other circumstances, solitary confinement can 
amount to a breach of article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
and to an act defined in article 1 or article 16 of the Convention against Torture.&#8221; (A/66/268 
paras. 79 and 80)  Before the transfer of Pfc Manning to Fort Leavenworth, the Special 
Rapporteur requested an opportunity to interview him in order to ascertain the precise 
conditions of his detention.  The US Government authorized the visit but ascertained that it 
could not ensure that the conversation would not be monitored.  Since a non-private 
conversation with an inmate would violate the terms of reference applied universally in 
fact-finding by Special Procedures, the Special Rapporteur had to decline the invitation.  In </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>75 
</b></p>
<p>response to the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s request for the reason to hold an unindicted detainee 
in solitary confinement, the government responded that his regimen was not &#8220;solitary 
</p>
<p>confinement&#8221; but &#8220;prevention of harm watch&#8221; but did not offer details about what harm was 
</p>
<p>being prevented.  To the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s request for information on the authority to 
impose and the purpose of the isolation regime, the government responded that the prison 
rules authorized the brig commander to impose it on account of the seriousness of the 
offense for which he would eventually be charged.  The Special Rapporteur concludes that 
imposing seriously punitive conditions of detention on someone who has not been found 
guilty of any crime is a violation of his right to physical and psychological integrity as well 
as of his presumption of innocence. The Special Rapporteur again renews his request for a 
private and unmonitored meeting with Mr. Manning to assess his conditions of detention.

<p>171. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the United States of America for 
its response to the communication dated 13 May 2011 requesting a private unmonitored 
meeting with Private Bradley Manning. Regrettably, to date the Government continues to

</p>
<p>172. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United States of America 
to date has not responded to the communication dated 19 August 2011, regarding the 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment in immigration facilities. According to the 
information received, 16 gay and transgender individuals have allegedly been subjected to 
solitary confinement, torture and ill-treatment while in detention in U.S. immigration 
facilities. Furthermore, there was reportedly a lack of protection from persecution and 
respect for the principle of non-refoulement for those who risk torture if returned to their 
home countries on account of their sexual orientation, gender identity or HIV status. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to draw the attention of the Government to 
paragraph 6 of General Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights Committee, to article 7 of 
the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, to the Body of Principles for the 
Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment and the Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, particularly rule 22 (2). Given the lack of 
any evidences to the contrary, the Special rapporteur believes that the fact reveal that there 
have been various violations of the provisions under the Convention against Torture, in 
particular breach of articles 7 and 12. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to 
undertake a prompt and impartial investigation on the conditions of detention, solitary 
confinement and ill-treatment of the immigrants, prosecute and punish those responsible, 
and ensure that the victims obtain redress, including fair and adequate compensation, ands 
as full rehabilitation as possible.

<p>175. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Uzbekistan for its response to the

Gulshan Karaeva and Mr. Nodir Akhatov, two human rights defenders. In particular, the 
Special Rapporteur is concerned about allegations indicating that police officers attempted 
to force Ms. Karaeva and Mr. Akhatov to admit involvement in organizing the protest. The 
Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that article 15 of the Convention against Torture 
provides that, &#8220;[e]ach State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to 
have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, 
except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221; Based 
on the information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of Ms.

violated, and calls on the Government to conduct a complete and impartial investigation

<p>176. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Uzbekistan for the response to

of freedom of religion. Regrettably, the Government&#8223;s response failed to address the 
allegation that Mr. Djalilov&#8223;s whereabouts remained unknown between his arrest on 5 
</p>
<p>September 2009 and 22 October 2010 when his detention was finally acknowledged. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur notes that paragraph 8(b) of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23 asserts that &#8220;[p]rolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret 
places can facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all 
States to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the 
person and to ensure that secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221; 
Furthermore, the Government&#8223;s response neglected to indicate whether an investigation into 
the allegation that Mr. Djalilov&#8223;s hearing impairment was a result of being subjected to a 
heavy blow to the ear while in prison. Based on the information received, the Special 
Rapporteur determines that Mr. Djalilov&#8223;s rights under the UN Convention against Torture 
have been violated, and calls on the Government to investigate, prosecute and punish those 
responsible and ensure that Mr. Djalilov obtains redress, including fair and adequate 
compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible.

<p>Mr. Erkin Musaev. In its reply, the Government provided information regarding medical 
treatment given to Mr. Musaev and denied that he was subjected to torture or ill-treatment. 
However, the Government's reply did not address reports that Mr. Musaev was placed in 
solitary confinement in an isolation cell where he was allegedly beaten, nor did it mention 
any measures undertaken in observance of Opinion No. 14/2008 of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention. The Special Rapporteur notes that the practice of solitary confinement 
can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or torture, due to the punitive nature 
of solitary confinement and the pain and suffering it may inflict on the accused. The Special 
Rapporteur draws the Government's attention to article 7 of the Basic Principles for the 
Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that &#8220;efforts addressed to the abolition of solitary 
confinement as a punishment, or to the restriction of its use, should be undertaken and 
encouraged.&#8221; (Adopted by the General Assembly by Resolution 45/111 of 14 December 
1990.) In the absence of contrary evidence, the Special Rapporteur determines that Mr. 
Musaev's rights under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated, and calls on 
the Government of Uzbekistan to undertake a prompt, independent and effective 
investigation of these facts, leading to prosecution and punishment of the responsible 
parties, and to provide redress to the victim.

September 2011, in response to the communication dated 29 July 2011. The

According to the information received, Messrs. Duong Kim Khai, Nguyen Thanh Tam, 
Pham Van Thong, Nguyen Chi Thanh, Pham Ngoc Hoa and Cao Van Tin, Ms. Tran Thi 
Thuy and Ms. Pham Ngoc Hoa had reportedly been held in incommunicado detention and

<p>alleged incommunicado detention and deterioration of health condition of Mr. Al-Sharafy, a

<p>186. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Zimbabwe has not responded 
to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to allegations of arrest, torture, and ill-
treatment of 45 human rights activists attending a meeting on 19 February 2011. The 
Special Rapporteur notes that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 
&#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States 
to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Moreover, article 15 of the Convention 
against Torture provides that &#8220;[e]ach State Party shall ensure that any statement which is 
established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made.&#8221; Although Zimbabw is not a party to the Convention, the standard in article 15 
articulates a customary international law norm binding on all States. Based on the 
information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of the 45 arrested 
human rights activists under international standards prohibiting torture and cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on 
the Government to immediately release all aforementioned activists from detention, ensure 
that they obtain redress, including fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation 
as possible.
