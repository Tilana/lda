NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1.Organization and basis of presentation
Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to “EXCO,”
“EXCO Resources,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are to EXCO Resources, Inc. and its consolidated
subsidiaries.
We are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration, exploitation,
acquisition, development and production of onshore U.S. oil and natural gas properties with a focus on
shale resource plays. Our principal operations are conducted in certain key U.S. oil and natural gas
areas including Texas, Louisiana and the Appalachia region. The following is a brief discussion of our
producing regions.
•East Texas and North Louisiana
The East Texas and North Louisiana regions are primarily comprised of our Haynesville and Bossier
shale assets. We have a joint venture with BG Group, plc ("BG Group"), a wholly owned subsidiary of
Royal Dutch Shell, plc, covering an undivided 50% interest in the majority of our Haynesville and
Bossier shale assets in East Texas and North Louisiana. The East Texas and North Louisiana regions
also include certain assets outside of the joint venture in the Haynesville and Bossier shales. We serve
as the operator for most of our properties in the East Texas and North Louisiana regions.
•South Texas
The South Texas region is primarily comprised of our Eagle Ford shale assets. We serve as the
operator for most of our properties in the South Texas region.
•Appalachia
The Appalachia region is primarily comprised of Marcellus shale assets as well as shallow
conventional assets in other formations. We have a joint venture with BG Group covering our shallow
conventional assets and Marcellus shale assets in the Appalachia region ("Appalachia JV"). EXCO and
BG Group each own an undivided 50% interest in the Appalachia JV and a 49.75% working interest in
the Appalachia JV's properties. The remaining 0.5% working interest is held by a jointly owned
operating entity ("OPCO") that operates the Appalachia JV's properties. We own a 50% interest in
OPCO. On July 1, 2016, we closed the sale of our interests in shallow conventional assets located in
Pennsylvania and retained an overriding royalty interest in each well. See "Note 13. Subsequent
events" for additional discussion.
The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are
for EXCO and its subsidiaries. The condensed consolidated financial statements and related footnotes
are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
("GAAP"). Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period information to conform to current
period presentation.
We have prepared the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in the opinion of management,
such financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary to fairly present the consolidated financial
position of EXCO at June 30, 2016 and its results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented. We have omitted certain information and disclosures normally included in annual financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP pursuant to those rules and regulations, although we
believe that the disclosures we have made are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our
audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included in EXCO's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 2, 2016 ("2015 Form
10-K").
In preparing the accompanying financial statements, management has made certain estimates and
assumptions that affect reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures. The results of
operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results we expect for the full year.

Table of Contents
Going Concern Presumption and Management’s Plans
These unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and other
commitments in the normal course of business. Our liquidity and ability to maintain compliance with
debt covenants have been negatively impacted by the prolonged depressed oil and natural gas price
environment, levels of indebtedness, and gathering, transportation and certain other commercial
contracts. As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit
agreement (“EXCO Resources Credit Agreement”). However, based on our current estimates and
expectations, we do not believe we will be able to comply with all of the covenants under the EXCO
Resources Credit Agreement during the next twelve months.
As part of our comprehensive restructuring program, on July 27, 2016, we announced a commencement
of a cash tender offer for our outstanding senior unsecured notes up to a maximum combined aggregate
price paid of $40.0 million ("Tender Offer"). See “Note 13. Subsequent events” for additional
information. If we are successful in the Tender Offer, the purchases are expected to be funded primarily
with the borrowings under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. There can be no assurances
regarding the success or extent of the purchases of the senior unsecured notes as part of the Tender
Offer process. Furthermore, the next borrowing base redetermination under the EXCO Resources
Credit Agreement is scheduled to occur on or about September 1, 2016. The lenders party to the EXCO
Resources Credit Agreement have considerable discretion in setting our borrowing base, and we are
unable to predict the outcome of any future redeterminations.
We are required to maintain a consolidated current ratio (as defined in the EXCO Resources Credit
Agreement) of at least 1.0 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter, which includes unused commitments
in the definition of consolidated current assets. The inclusion of the unused commitments has
historically allowed us to maintain compliance with the consolidated current ratio covenant under the
EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. Therefore, the reduction in unused commitments as a result of
borrowings to fund the Tender Offer or further reductions to our borrowing base as part of the upcoming
redetermination process would negatively impact our consolidated current ratio and liquidity.
As a result of the impact of the aforementioned factors on our financial results and condition, we
anticipate that we will not meet the minimum requirement under the current ratio for the twelve-month
period following the date of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to
maintain compliance with the minimum requirements for the financial covenants in the EXCO
Resources Credit Agreement related to the ratio of consolidated EBITDAX to consolidated interest
expense (“Interest Coverage Ratio”) and the ratio of senior secured indebtedness to consolidated
EBITDAX (“Senior Secured Indebtedness Ratio”) for the twelve-month period following the date of
these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. If we are not able to meet our debt covenants in
future periods, we may be required, but unable, to refinance all or part of our existing debt, seek
covenant relief from our lenders, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, or issue equity on terms
acceptable to us, if at all, and may be required to surrender assets pursuant to the security provisions of
the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. Therefore, our ability to continue our planned principal
business operations would be dependent on the actions of our lenders or obtaining additional debt
and/or equity financing to repay outstanding indebtedness under the EXCO Resources Credit
Agreement. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and the term loan credit agreements governing our senior
secured second lien term loans due October 26, 2020 (“Second Lien Term Loans”) require our annual
financial statements to include a report from our independent registered public accounting firm without
an explanatory paragraph related to our ability to continue as a going concern. If the substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern still exists at December 31, 2016 or if we fail to comply
with the financial and other covenants in the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement or the Second Lien
Term Loans, we would be in default under such agreement. Any event of default may cause a default or
accelerate our obligations with respect to our other outstanding indebtedness, including our senior
unsecured notes due September 15, 2018 (“2018 Notes”) and senior unsecured notes due April 15,
2022 (“2022 Notes”), which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Our decision to commence the Tender Offer process is part of EXCO’s comprehensive restructuring
process focused on improving its capital structure and providing structural liquidity. We are evaluating
transactions that could further enhance our liquidity and capital structure including the exchanges of
existing indebtedness for common shares, issuance of additional indebtedness, the restructuring or
repurchase of existing indebtedness, issuance of equity, restructuring of gathering, transportation and
certain other commercial contracts, cost reductions, divestitures of assets or similar transactions. There
is no assurance any such transactions will occur.
The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any
adjustments to reflect the possible future effects of this uncertainty on the recoverability or classification
of recorded asset amounts or the amounts or classification of liabilities.

2.Significant accounting policies
We consider significant accounting policies to be those related to our estimates of proved reserves, oil
and natural gas properties, derivatives, business combinations, equity-based compensation, goodwill,
revenue recognition, asset retirement obligations and income taxes. The policies include significant
estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates were made.
However, these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used.
These policies and others are summarized in our 2015 Form 10-K.
Concentration of credit risk
We sell oil and natural gas to various customers and certain customers account for a significant amount
of our total consolidated revenues. The majority of our accounts receivable are due from either
purchasers of oil or natural gas or participants in oil and natural gas wells for which we serve as the
operator. We have the right to offset future revenues against unpaid charges related to wells that we
operate. We are managing our credit risk as a result of the current commodity price environment through
the attainment of financial assurances from certain customers. In 2016, we entered into an agreement
with a significant customer to prepay us for estimated future oil and natural gas production. At June 30,
2016, we recorded $26.0 million of prepayments from the customer, which are included in "Accounts
payable and accrued liabilities" or in "Revenues and royalties payable" in the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Recent accounting pronouncements
In May 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards
Update ("ASU") No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope
Improvements and Practical Expedients ("ASU 2016-12"). ASU 2016-12 does not change the core
principle of Topic 606 but improves the following aspects of Topic 606: assessing collectability,
presentation of sales taxes, noncash considerations, completed contracts and contract modifications at
transaction. ASU 2016-12 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2017. We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-12 on our consolidated financial
condition and results of operations.
In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives
and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates
2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting ("ASU
2016-11"). The SEC Staff is rescinding the following SEC Staff Observer comments that are codified in
Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and Topic 932, Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas, effective upon
adoption of Topic 606. Specifically, registrants should not rely on the following SEC Staff Observer
comments upon adoption of Topic 606: a) Revenue and Expense Recognition for Freight Services in
Process which is codified in 605-20-S99-2; b) Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs,
which is codified in paragraph 605-45-S99-1; c) Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
Customer, which is codified in paragraph 605-50-S99-1 and d) Accounting for Gas-Balancing
Arrangements (that is, use of the “entitlements method”), which is codified in paragraph 932-10-S99-5.
We do not use the entitlements method of accounting and are not impacted by this specific SEC Staff
Observer comment; however, we are assessing the potential impact of other SEC Staff Observer
comments included in ASU 2016-11 on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ("ASU 2016-10"). ASU 2016-10 does not
change the core principle of Topic 606 but clarifies the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying
performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related
principles for those areas. ASU 2016-10 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2017. We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-10 on our
consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09
simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including
the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as
classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-07 is effective for annual and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the
potential impact of ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) ("ASU 2016-08").
ASU 2016-08 does not change the core principle of Topic 606 but clarifies the implementation
guidance on principal versus agent considerations. ASU 2016-08 is effective for annual and interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU
2016-08 on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures
(Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting ("ASU 2016-07"). ASU 2016-
07 eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result
of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the
investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the
equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held.
Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the
investment is required. ASU 2016-07 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. We do not currently have significant investments
that are accounted for by a method other than the equity method and do not expect ASU 2016-07 to
have a significant impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

South Texas transaction
On May 6, 2016, we closed a sale of certain non-core undeveloped acreage in South Texas and our
interests in four producing wells for $11.5 million, subject to customary post-closing purchase price
adjustments. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce indebtedness under the EXCO Resources
Credit Agreement.

5.Oil and natural gas properties
We use the full cost method of accounting, which involves capitalizing all acquisition, exploration,
exploitation and development costs of oil and natural gas properties. Once we incur costs, they are
recorded in the depletable pool of proved properties or in unproved properties, collectively, the full cost
pool. We review our unproved oil and natural gas property costs on a quarterly basis to assess for
impairment or the need to transfer unproved costs to proved properties as a result of extensions or
discoveries from drilling operations or determination that no proved reserves are attributable to such
costs. The majority of our undeveloped properties are held-by-production, which reduces the risk of
impairment as a result of lease expirations. There were no impairments of unproved properties during
the six months ended June 30, 2016 or 2015.
At the end of each quarterly period, companies that use the full cost method of accounting for their oil
and natural gas properties must compute a limitation on capitalized costs ("ceiling test"). The ceiling
test involves comparing the net book value of the full cost pool, after taxes, to the full cost ceiling
limitation defined below. In the event the full cost ceiling limitation is less than the full cost pool, we are
required to record an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties. The full cost ceiling limitation is
computed as the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues from our proved reserves by
applying the average price as prescribed by the SEC, less estimated future expenditures (based on
current costs) to develop and produce the proved reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the cost of
properties not being amortized and the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties
included in the costs being amortized, net of income tax effects.

Table of Contents
The ceiling test for each period presented was based on the following average spot prices, in each
case adjusted for quality factors and regional differentials to derive estimated future net revenues.
Prices presented in the table below are the trailing twelve-month simple average spot prices at the first
of the month for natural gas at Henry Hub ("HH") and West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil at
Cushing, Oklahoma. The fluctuations demonstrate the volatility in oil and natural gas prices between

We recognized impairments to our proved oil and natural gas properties of $26.2 million and $160.8
million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, and $394.3 million and $670.7
million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. The impairments were primarily
due to the decline in oil and natural gas prices.  Furthermore, the fixed costs associated with certain
gathering and transportation contracts continue to have a significant impact on the present value of our
proved reserves. The spot prices on the first day of July 2016 exceeded the trailing twelve-month
reference prices at June 30, 2016.  However, oil and natural gas prices are volatile and we may incur
additional impairments during 2016 if future oil and natural gas prices result in a decrease in the trailing
twelve-month reference prices compared to June 30, 2016. The possibility and amount of any future
impairments is difficult to predict, and will depend, in part, upon future oil and natural gas prices to be
utilized in the ceiling test, estimates of proved reserves, future capital expenditures and operating costs.
During 2016, all of our proved undeveloped reserves, other than the proved undeveloped reserves
associated with certain wells drilled in 2016, were reclassified to unproved primarily due to the
uncertainty regarding the financing required to develop these reserves.  Our liquidity and capital
resources continue to be impacted by the current commodity price environment as evidenced by factors
such as the reduction to the borrowing base under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement in March
2016 and other circumstances.  As such, these factors resulted in uncertainty regarding the extent and
types of financing available for our future development activities. A significant amount of our proved
undeveloped reserves that were reclassified to unproved remain economic at current prices, and we
may report proved undeveloped reserves in future filings if we determine we have the financial
capability to execute a development plan.  
The evaluation of impairment of our oil and natural gas properties includes estimates of proved
reserves. There are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves including
projecting the future rates of production and the timing of development activities. The accuracy of any
reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, and engineering and geological
interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of the
estimate may justify revisions of such estimate. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the
quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.

7.Derivative financial instruments
Our primary objective in entering into derivative financial instruments is to manage our exposure to
commodity price fluctuations, protect our returns on investments and achieve a more predictable cash
flow from operations. These transactions limit exposure to declines in commodity prices, but also limit
the benefits we would realize if commodity prices increase. When prices for oil and natural gas are
volatile, a significant portion of the effect of our derivative financial instruments consists of non-cash
income or expense due to changes in the fair value. Cash losses or gains only arise from payments
made or received on monthly settlements of contracts or if we terminate a contract prior to its expiration.
We do not designate our derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments for financial
accounting purposes and, as a result, we recognize the change in the respective instruments’ fair value
in earnings.
The table below outlines the classification of our derivative financial instruments on our Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets and their financial impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Settlements in the normal course of maturities of our derivative financial instrument contracts result in
cash receipts from, or cash disbursements to, our derivative contract counterparties. Changes in the fair
value of our derivative financial instrument contracts, which includes both cash settlements and non-
cash changes in fair value, are included in earnings with a corresponding increase or decrease in the
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets fair value amounts.
Our oil and natural gas derivative instruments are comprised of the following instruments:
Swaps: These contracts allow us to receive a fixed price and pay a floating market price to the
counterparty for the hedged commodity.
Swaptions: These contracts give our trading counterparties the right, but not the obligation, to enter into
a swap contract for an agreed quantity of oil or natural gas from us at a certain time and fixed price in
the future. The counterparty to our swaption contracts can choose to exercise its option in December
2016 to enter into 2017 swap contracts.
Collars: A collar is a combination of options including a sold call and a purchased put. These contracts
allow us to participate in the upside of commodity prices to the ceiling of the call option and provide us
with downside protection through the put option. If the market price is below the strike price of the
purchased put at the time of settlement then the counterparty pays us the excess. If the market price is
above the strike price of the sold call at the time of settlement, we pay the counterparty the excess.
These transactions were conducted contemporaneously with a single counterparty and resulted in a net
cashless transaction.
We place our derivative financial instruments with the financial institutions that are lenders under our
credit agreement that we believe have high quality credit ratings. To mitigate our risk of loss due to
default, we have entered into master netting agreements with counterparties to our derivative financial
instruments that allow us to offset our asset position with our liability position in the event of a default by
the counterparty. Our credit rating and financial condition may restrict our ability to enter into certain
types of derivative financial instruments and limit the maturity of the contracts with counterparties.

On July 27, 2016, we announced the commencement of a Tender Offer for the 2018 Notes and 2022
Notes up to a maximum combined amount of $40.0 million on the aggregate price paid. We expect to
fund these purchases primarily with borrowings under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. See
“Note 13. Subsequent events” for a more detailed discussion and the terms of the Tender Offer.
EXCO Resources Credit Agreement
As of June 30, 2016, we had $121.6 million of outstanding indebtedness, $325.0 million of available
borrowing base and $193.2 million of unused borrowing base, net of letters of credit under the EXCO
Resources Credit Agreement. The maturity date of the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement is July 31,
2018. The interest rate grid for the revolving commitment under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement
ranged from London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 225 bps to 325 bps (or alternate base rate
("ABR") plus 125 bps to 225 bps), depending on our borrowing base usage. On June 30, 2016, our
interest rate was approximately 3.0%.
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the financial covenants (defined in the EXCO
Resources Credit Agreement), which required that we:
14
Table of Contents
•
•
•
maintain a consolidated current ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. The
consolidated current assets utilized in this ratio include unused commitments under the EXCO
Resources Credit Agreement;
maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio of at least 1.25 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. The
consolidated interest expense utilized in the Interest Coverage Ratio is calculated in accordance with
GAAP; therefore, this excludes cash payments under the terms of the Exchange Term Loan (as
defined below), whether designated as interest or as principal amount, that reduce the carrying amount
and are not recognized as interest expense; and
not permit a Senior Secured Indebtedness Ratio to be greater than 2.5 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal
quarter. Senior secured indebtedness utilized in the Senior Secured Indebtedness Ratio excludes the
Second Lien Term Loans (as defined below) and any other secured indebtedness subordinated to the
EXCO Resources Credit Agreement.
Our liquidity and ability to maintain compliance with debt covenants have been negatively impacted by
the prolonged depressed oil and natural gas price environment, levels of indebtedness, and gathering,
transportation and certain other commercial contracts. Based on our current estimates and
expectations, we do not believe we will be able to comply with all of the covenants under the EXCO
Resources Credit Agreement for the twelve-month period following the date of these Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements. See "Note 1. Organization and basis of presentation" for further
discussion on this matter.
On March 29, 2016, the lenders under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement completed their regular
semi-annual borrowing base redetermination, which resulted in a reduction in our borrowing base from
$375.0 million to $325.0 million primarily due to depressed oil and natural gas prices. The borrowing
base under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement remains subject to semi-annual review and
redetermination by the lenders pursuant to the terms of the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, and
the next scheduled redetermination of the borrowing base is set to occur on or about September 1,
2016.
Second Lien Term Loans
On October 26, 2015, we closed a 12.5% senior secured second lien term loan with certain affiliates of
Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited ("Fairfax") in the aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million
("Fairfax Term Loan"). We also closed a 12.5% senior secured second lien term loan with certain
unsecured noteholders in the aggregate principal amount of $291.3 million on October 26, 2015 and
$108.7 million on November 4, 2015 (“Exchange Term Loan,” and together with the Fairfax Term Loan,
“Second Lien Term Loans”). The proceeds from the Exchange Term Loan were used to repurchase a
portion of the outstanding 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes in exchange for the holders of such notes
agreeing to act as lenders in connection with the Exchange Term Loan. The exchange was accounted
for as a troubled debt restructuring pursuant to FASB ASC 470-60, Troubled Debt Restructuring by
Debtors. The future undiscounted cash flows from the Exchange Term Loan through its maturity were
less than the carrying amounts of the retired 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes. As a result, the carrying
amount of the Exchange Term Loan is equal to the total undiscounted future cash payments, including
interest and principal.  All cash payments under the terms of the Exchange Term Loan, whether
designated as interest or as principal amount, will reduce the carrying amount and no interest expense
will be recognized. As such, our reported interest expense will be less than the contractual payments
throughout the term of the Exchange Term Loan. 
The Second Lien Term Loans mature on October 26, 2020 with interest payable on the last day in each
calendar quarter. The Second Lien Term Loans are guaranteed by substantially all of EXCO’s
subsidiaries, with the exception of certain non-guarantor subsidiaries and our jointly held equity
investments with BG Group, and are secured by second-priority liens on substantially all of EXCO’s
assets securing the indebtedness under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. The Second Lien
Term Loans rank (i) junior to the debt under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and any other
priority lien obligations, (ii) pari passu to one another and (iii) effectively senior to all of our existing and
future unsecured senior indebtedness, including the 2018 Notes and the 2022 Notes, to the extent of
the value of collateral.
The agreements governing the Second Lien Term Loans contain covenants that, subject to certain
exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:
•pay dividends or make other distributions or redeem or repurchase our common shares;
•prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;
enter into agreements restricting the subsidiary guarantors’ ability to pay dividends to us or another
subsidiary guarantor, make loans or advances to us or transfer assets to us;
•engage in asset sales or substantially alter the business that the we conduct;
•enter into transactions with affiliates;
•consolidate, merge or dispose of assets;
•incur liens; and
•enter into sale/leaseback transactions.

•unsecured debt, unless we obtain consent from the administrative agent.
In addition, under the term loan credit agreement governing the Fairfax Term Loan, a change of control
constitutes an event of default, which, subject to certain limitations, may allow the Fairfax Term Loan
lenders to declare the Fairfax Term Loan to be due and payable, in whole or in part, including accrued
but unpaid interest thereon, plus an amount equal to all interest payments that would have accrued
through the Fairfax Term Loan maturity date. Under the term loan credit agreement governing the
Exchange Term Loan, in the event of a change of control EXCO is required to offer to repurchase the
Exchange Term Loan at 101% of the face value of the Exchange Term Loan.
In connection with the Second Lien Term Loans, on October 26, 2015, EXCO entered into an
intercreditor agreement governing the relationship between EXCO’s lenders and the holders of any
other lien obligations that EXCO may issue in the future and a collateral trust agreement governing the
administration and maintenance of the collateral securing the Second Lien Term Loans.
2018 Notes
The 2018 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by a majority of EXCO’s subsidiaries, with
the exception of certain non-guarantor subsidiaries and our jointly held equity investments with BG
Group. Our equity investments, other than OPCO, have been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries
under the indenture governing the 2018 Notes.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, EXCO repurchased an aggregate $551.2 million of the 2018 Notes in
exchange for certain holders of the 2018 Notes becoming lenders under the Exchange Term Loan.
Additionally, as of June 30, 2016, we repurchased a total of $67.2 million in principal amount of the
2018 Notes for an aggregate of $18.8 million in a series of open market repurchases. As a result of the
repurchases, the aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2018 Notes was reduced to $131.6 million
as of June 30, 2016. Interest accrues at 7.5% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on
March 15 and September 15 of each year.
The indenture governing the 2018 Notes contains covenants, which may limit our ability and the ability
of our restricted subsidiaries to:
•incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain types of preferred stock;
pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated
debt;
•make certain investments;
•create liens on our assets;
•enter into sale/leaseback transactions;
create restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments
to us;
•engage in transactions with our affiliates;
•transfer or issue shares of stock of subsidiaries;
•
•
16
Table of Contents
•transfer or sell assets; and
•consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries.
2022 Notes
The 2022 Notes were issued at 100.0% of the principal amount and bear interest at a rate of 8.5% per
annum, payable in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, EXCO
repurchased an aggregate $277.2 million in principal amount of the 2022 Notes in exchange for certain
holders of the 2022 Notes becoming lenders under the Exchange Term Loan. Additionally, as of
June 30, 2016, we repurchased a total of $51.4 million in principal amount of the 2022 Notes for an
aggregate of $6.5 million in a series of open market repurchases. As a result of the repurchases, the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2022 Notes was reduced to $171.4 million as of June 30,
2016.
The 2022 Notes rank equally in right of payment to any existing and future senior unsecured
indebtedness of the Company (including the 2018 Notes) and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured
basis by EXCO’s consolidated subsidiaries that are guarantors of the indebtedness under the EXCO
Resources Credit Agreement. The 2022 Notes were issued under the same base indenture governing
the 2018 Notes and the supplemental indenture governing the 2022 Notes contains similar covenants
to those in the supplemental indenture governing the 2018 Notes.
    
9.Fair value measurements
We value our derivatives and other financial instruments according to FASB ASC 820, Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received
for an asset or paid to transfer a liability ("exit price") in the principal or most advantageous market for
the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
We categorize the inputs used in measuring fair value into a three-tier fair value hierarchy. These tiers
include:
Level 1 – Observable inputs, such as quoted market prices in active markets, for substantially identical
assets and liabilities.
Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 for similar assets and liabilities.
These include quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data. If the asset or liability has a specified or contractual term, the
input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, generally requiring
development of fair value assumptions by management.
Fair value of derivative financial instruments
The fair value of our derivative financial instruments may be different from the settlement value based
on company-specific inputs, such as credit ratings, futures markets and forward curves, and readily
available buyers or sellers. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 there were no
changes in the fair value level classifications. The following table presents a summary of the estimated
fair value of our derivative financial instruments as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

We evaluate derivative assets and liabilities in accordance with master netting agreements with the
derivative counterparties, but report them on a gross basis in our Condensed Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Net derivative asset values are determined primarily by quoted futures prices and utilization of
the counterparties’ credit-adjusted risk-free rate curves and net derivative liabilities are determined by
utilization of our credit-adjusted risk-free rate curve. The credit-adjusted risk-free rates of our
counterparties are based on an independent market-quoted credit default swap rate curve for the
counterparties’ debt plus the LIBOR curve as of the end of the reporting period. Our credit-adjusted risk-
free rate is based on the blended rate of
17
Table of Contents
independent market-quoted credit default swap rate curves for companies that have the same credit
rating as us plus the LIBOR curve as of the end of the reporting period.
The valuation of our commodity price derivatives, represented by oil and natural gas swap and
swaption contracts, is discussed below.
Oil derivatives. Our oil derivatives are swap contracts for notional Bbls of oil at fixed NYMEX oil index
prices. The asset and liability values attributable to our oil derivatives as of the end of the reporting
period are based on (i) the contracted notional volumes, (ii) independent active NYMEX futures price
quotes for oil index prices, and (iii) the applicable credit-adjusted risk-free rate curve, as described
above.
Natural gas derivatives. Our natural gas derivatives are swap, collar and swaption contracts for notional
Mmbtus of natural gas at posted price indexes, including NYMEX HH swap, option and swaption
contracts. The asset and liability values attributable to our natural gas derivatives as of the end of the
reporting period are based on (i) the contracted notional volumes, (ii) independent active NYMEX
futures price quotes for natural gas swaps, (iii) the applicable credit-adjusted risk-free rate curve, as
described above, and (iv) the implied rates of volatility inherent in the option and swaption contracts.
The implied rates of volatility were determined based on the average of historical HH natural gas prices.
See further details on the fair value of our derivative financial instruments in “Note 7. Derivative financial
instruments”.
Fair value of other financial instruments
Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and payable and
accrued liabilities.  The carrying amount of these instruments approximates fair value because of their
short-term nature.
The carrying values of our borrowings under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement approximate fair
value, as these are subject to short-term floating interest rates that approximate the rates available to us
for those periods.
The estimated fair values of our 2018 Notes, 2022 Notes, Exchange Term Loan and Fairfax Term Loan
are presented below. The estimated fair values of the 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes have been
calculated based on quoted prices in active markets. The estimated fair values of the Exchange Term
Loan and the Fairfax Term Loan have been calculated based on quoted prices obtained from third-party
pricing sources and are classified as Level 2.

Other fair value measurements
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we impaired $4.9 million of our investment in a midstream
company in the East Texas and North Louisiana regions that we account for under the cost method of
accounting. The impairment was recorded to reduce the carrying value to the fair value and is
considered to be Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The estimated fair value of our cost method
investment was determined based on trading metrics of comparable transactions.
As discussed in "Note 13. Subsequent events", we recorded a $24.3 million liability in "Accounts
payable and accrued liabilities" in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding

loss in "Other operating items" in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as of June 30,
2016 related to the settlement of litigation with a joint venture partner in the Eagle Ford shale. The
liability was based on our estimated exposure from a potential adverse ruling in the litigation. The fair
market value of the properties transferred pursuant to the settlement was determined using a discounted
cash

Table of Contents
flow model of the estimated reserves. The estimated quantities of reserves utilized assumptions based
on our internal geological, engineering and financial data. We utilized NYMEX forward strip prices to
value the reserves, then applied various discount rates depending on the classification of reserves and
other risk characteristics. The fair value measurements utilized included significant unobservable inputs
that are considered to be Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. These unobservable inputs include
management's estimates of reserve quantities, commodity prices, operating costs, development costs,
discount factors and other risk factors applied to the future cash flows. Upon the finalization of the
settlement and transfer of interests on July 25, 2016, the extinguishment of the liability was treated as
an adjustment to the capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties.
10.Income taxes
We evaluate our estimated annual effective income tax rate based on current and forecasted business
results and enacted tax laws on a quarterly basis and apply this tax rate to our ordinary income or loss
to calculate our estimated tax liability or benefit. We have accumulated financial deferred tax assets
primarily due to losses arising from impairments to the carrying value of our oil and natural gas
properties that are subject to valuation allowances. Our valuation allowances increased $88.5 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2016. As a result of cumulative financial operating losses, we have
recognized net valuation allowances of approximately $1.4 billion which have fully offset our net
deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2016. The valuation allowances will continue to be recognized until
the realization of future deferred tax benefits are more likely than not to become utilized. The valuation
allowances do not impact future utilization of the underlying tax attributes.
11.Related party transactions
OPCO
OPCO serves as the operator of our wells in the Appalachia JV and we advance funds to OPCO on an
as needed basis. We did not advance any funds to OPCO during three and six months ended June 30,
2016 or 2015. OPCO may distribute any excess cash equally between us and BG Group when its
operating cash flows are sufficient to meet its capital requirements. There are service agreements
between us and OPCO whereby we provide administrative and technical services for which we are
reimbursed. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, these transactions included
the following:

accrued liabilities" in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
ESAS
On September 8, 2015, we closed the services and investment agreement with ESAS, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Bluescape Resources Company LLC ("Bluescape"). At the closing, C. John Wilder,
Executive Chairman of Bluescape, was appointed as a member of our Board of Directors and as
Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. As part of the agreement, ESAS completed its required
purchase of EXCO's common shares as of December 31, 2015 and is currently the beneficial owner of
approximately 6.5% of our outstanding common shares.
As consideration for the services provided under the agreement, EXCO will pay ESAS a monthly fee of
$300,000 and an annual incentive payment of up to $2.4 million per year that is based on EXCO’s
common share price achieving certain performance hurdles as compared to a peer group, provided that
payment for the services will be held in escrow and contingent upon completion of the entire first year of
services and required investment in EXCO. We accrued a total of $6.9 million and $4.5 million at June
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, for the services performed under the services
19
Table of Contents
and investment agreement and recorded these amounts in "Accounts payable and accrued liabilities" in
our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total amount accrued at June 30, 2016 includes the
entire first year annual incentive payment as a result of EXCO's performance rank above the 75th
percentile of the peer group, which is expected to be paid to ESAS in the fourth quarter of 2016.
As an additional performance incentive under the services and investment agreement, EXCO issued
warrants to ESAS in four tranches to purchase an aggregate of 80,000,000 common shares. These
warrants may become exercisable in the future if our common shares achieve certain performance
metrics compared to a peer group as of March 31, 2019. The measurement of the warrants is accounted
for in accordance with ASC Topic 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees, which requires
the warrants to be re-measured each interim reporting period until the completion of the services on
March 31, 2019 and an adjustment is recorded in the statement of operations within equity-based
compensation expense. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized equity-
based compensation related to the warrants of $8.9 million and $10.9 million, respectively.
In the first quarter of 2016, ESAS entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated lender under the
Exchange Term Loan, pursuant to which the lender will make periodic payments to ESAS or receive
periodic payments from ESAS based on changes in the market value of the Exchange Term Loan, and
the lender will make periodic payments to ESAS based on the interest rate of the Exchange Term Loan.
As of June 30, 2016, the agreement effectively provided ESAS with the economic consequences of
ownership of approximately $47.9 million in principal amount of the Exchange Term Loan without direct
ownership of, or consent rights with respect to, the Exchange Term Loan.
As described above, ESAS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bluescape, and C. John Wilder, a member
of our Board of Directors, is Bluescape’s Executive Chairman. As Bluescape’s Executive Chairman, Mr.
Wilder has the power to direct the affairs of Bluescape and, indirectly, ESAS, and may be deemed to
share ESAS’ interest in the Exchange Term Loan and our common shares.
See our 2015 Form 10-K for additional disclosures related to the services and investment agreement
and the related warrants.

Hamblin Watsa Investment Counsel Ltd. (“Hamblin Watsa”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Fairfax, is the
administrative agent of the Fairfax Term Loan and certain affiliates of Fairfax are lenders under the
Fairfax Term Loan and a portion of the Exchange Term Loan. As of June 30, 2016, affiliates of Fairfax
were the record holders of approximately $112.1 million in principal amount of the Exchange Term
Loan. Samuel A. Mitchell, a member of our Board of Directors, is a Managing Director of Hamblin Watsa
and a member of Hamblin Watsa’s investment committee, which consists of seven members that

12.Condensed consolidating financial statements
As of June 30, 2016, the majority of EXCO’s subsidiaries were guarantors under the EXCO Resources
Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes and the agreements
governing the Second Lien Term Loans. All of our unrestricted subsidiaries under the Second Lien
Term Loans and the indentures governing the 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes are considered non-
guarantor subsidiaries.
Set forth below are condensed consolidating financial statements of EXCO, the guarantor subsidiaries
and the non-guarantor subsidiaries. The 2018 Notes, 2022 Notes and the Second Lien Term Loans,
which were issued by EXCO Resources, Inc., are jointly and severally guaranteed by substantially all of
our subsidiaries (referred to as Guarantor Subsidiaries). For purposes of this footnote, EXCO
Resources, Inc. is referred to as Resources to distinguish it from the Guarantor Subsidiaries. Each of
the Guarantor Subsidiaries is a 100% owned subsidiary of Resources and the guarantees are
unconditional as they relate to the assets of the Guarantor Subsidiaries.
The following financial information presents consolidating financial statements, which include:
•Resources;
•the Guarantor Subsidiaries;
•the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries;

13.Subsequent events
Conventional asset divestiture
On July 1, 2016, we closed the sale of our interests in shallow conventional assets located in
Pennsylvania for approximately $0.1 million, subject to customary post-closing purchase price
adjustments, and retained an overriding royalty interest in each well. In addition, we retained all rights to
other formations below the conventional depths in this region including the Marcellus and Utica shales.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the divested assets produced approximately 6 Mmcfe per day
and the revenues less direct operating expenses, excluding general and administrative costs,
generated a net loss of less than $0.1 million. The asset retirement obligations related to the divested
wells were $22.6 million as of June 30, 2016. In conjunction with the divestiture, the Company reduced
its field employee count in the Appalachia region by 52%.
Settlement of Participation Agreement litigation
In July 2013, we entered into a participation agreement with a joint venture partner for the development
of certain assets in the Eagle Ford shale ("Participation Agreement"). As described in "Item 3. Legal
Proceedings" in our 2015 Form 10-K, we were in a dispute subject to litigation over the offer and the
acceptance process with our joint venture partner.
On July 25, 2016, we settled the litigation with our joint venture partner, and the litigation was thereafter
dismissed by the court entering a final judgment order in response to the parties’ joint motion to dismiss
the case with prejudice. Among other things, the settlement provided a full release for any claims, rights,
demands, damages and causes of action that either party has asserted or could have asserted for any
breach of the Participation Agreement. As part of the settlement, the parties amended and restated the
Participation Agreement to (i) eliminate our requirement to offer to purchase our joint venture partner's
interests in certain wells each quarter, (ii) eliminate our requirement to convey a portion of our working
interest to our joint venture partner upon commencing development of future locations, (iii) terminate the
area of mutual interest, which required either party acquiring an interest in non-producing acreage
included in certain areas to provide notice of the acquisition to the non-acquiring party and allowed the
non-acquiring party to acquire a proportionate share in such acquired interest, (iv) provide that EXCO
transfer to its joint venture partner a portion of its interests in certain producing wells and certain
undeveloped locations in South Texas (“Transferred Interests”), effective May 1, 2016 and (v) modify or
eliminate certain other provisions.
We recorded a liability in "Accounts payable and accrued liabilities" in our Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheet with a corresponding loss in "Other operating items" in the Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Operations as of June 30, 2016 based on our estimated exposure from a potential
adverse ruling in the litigation. The fair value of the Transferred Interests was $24.3 million as of June
30, 2016 based on a discounted cash flow model of the estimated reserves using NYMEX forward strip
prices. See "Note 9. Fair value measurements" for additional information. The net production from the
Transferred Interests was approximately 350 Bbls of oil per day during June 2016.
Tender Offer
On July 27, 2016, we announced the commencement of a Tender Offer for the 2018 Notes and 2022
Notes up to a maximum combined aggregate price paid of $40.0 million. In conjunction with the Tender
Offer, we are soliciting consents from registered holders of the 2022 Notes to amend certain terms of the
indenture governing the 2022 Notes. The Tender Offer expires on August 23, 2016; however, tendering
on or before August 9, 2016, will result in additional consideration received, as follows:
•
Per $1,000 principal amount of the 2018 Notes that are accepted for purchase, total consideration
includes the tender offer consideration of $455.00 and an early tender payment of $45.00, if applicable,
for a total consideration of up to $500.00.
•
Per $1,000 principal amount of the 2022 Notes that are accepted for purchase, total consideration
includes the tender offer consideration of $350.00, a consent payment of $5.00, if applicable, and an
early tender payment of $45.00, if applicable, for a total consideration of up to $400.00.
Holders of 2018 Notes or 2022 Notes whose notes are accepted for payment in the Tender Offer will
receive accumulated and unpaid interest. The purchases are expected to be funded primarily with the
borrowings under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. For additional information on the Tender
Offer, see the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 28, 2016.

Item 2.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to “EXCO,”
“EXCO Resources,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are to EXCO Resources, Inc. and its consolidated
subsidiaries.
Forward-looking statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, as defined in Section 27A of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). These forward-looking statements relate to, among other
things, the following:
•our future financial and operating performance and results;
•our business strategy;
•market prices;
•our future use of derivative financial instruments; and
•our plans and forecasts.
We have based these forward-looking statements on our current assumptions, expectations and
projections about future events. We use the words “may,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,”
“continue,” “intend,” “plan,” “potential,” “project,” “budget” and other similar words to identify forward-
looking statements. The statements that contain these words should be read carefully because they
discuss future expectations, contain projections of results of operations or our financial condition and/or
state other “forward-looking” information. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable securities laws. These statements also
involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or financial condition to materially
differ from our expectations in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including, but not limited to:
•
•
•
•fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas;
•the availability of oil and natural gas;
future capital requirements and availability of financing, including reductions to our borrowing base
and limitations on our ability to incur certain types of indebtedness under our debt agreements;
our ability to meet our current and future debt service obligations, including our ability to maintain
compliance with our debt covenants;
disruption of credit and capital markets and the ability of financial institutions to honor their
commitments;
estimates of reserves and economic assumptions, including estimates related to acquisitions and
dispositions of oil and natural gas properties;
•geological concentration of our reserves;
•risks associated with drilling and operating wells;
•exploratory risks, including those related to our activities in shale formations;
•discovery, acquisition, development and replacement of oil and natural gas reserves;
•cash flow and liquidity;
•timing and amount of future production of oil and natural gas;
•
•availability of drilling and production equipment;
•availability of water and other materials for drilling and completion activities;
•marketing of oil and natural gas;
•political and economic conditions and events in oil-producing and natural gas-producing countries;
•title to our properties;
•litigation;

•general economic conditions, including costs associated with drilling and operations of our properties;
our ability to comply with the listing requirements of, and maintain the listing of our common shares on,
the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE");
environmental or other governmental regulations, including legislation to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases, legislation of derivative financial instruments, regulation of hydraulic fracture
stimulation and elimination of income tax incentives available to our industry;
receipt and collectability of amounts owed to us by purchasers of our production and counterparties to
our derivative financial instruments;
•decisions whether or not to enter into derivative financial instruments;
•potential acts of terrorism;
•

•
•
our ability to manage joint ventures with third parties, including the resolution of any material
disagreements and our partners’ ability to satisfy obligations under these arrangements;
•actions of third party co-owners of interests in properties in which we also own an interest;
•fluctuations in interest rates;
•our ability to effectively integrate companies and properties that we acquire; and
our ability to execute our business strategies and other corporate actions, including restructuring our
balance sheet and gathering and transportation contracts.
We believe that it is important to communicate our expectations of future performance to our investors.
However, events may occur in the future that we are unable to accurately predict, or over which we
have no control. We caution users of the financial statements not to place undue reliance on any
forward-looking statements. When considering our forward-looking statements, keep in mind the
cautionary statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the risk factors included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") on March 2, 2016 ("2015 Form 10-K").
Our revenues, operating results and financial condition depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil
and natural gas and the availability of capital. Declines in oil or natural gas prices may have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, the amount of oil or natural gas
that we can produce economically and the ability to fund our operations. Historically, oil and natural gas
prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to
be volatile.
Overview and history
We are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration, exploitation,
acquisition, development and production of onshore U.S. oil and natural gas properties with a focus on
shale resource plays. Our principal operations are conducted in certain key U.S. oil and natural gas
areas including Texas, Louisiana and the Appalachia region. Our primary strategy focuses on the
exploitation and development of our shale resource plays and the pursuit of leasing and acquisition
opportunities. We plan to carry out this strategy by executing on a strategic plan that incorporates the
following three core objectives: (i) restructuring the balance sheet to enhance our capital structure and
extend structural liquidity; (ii) transforming EXCO into the lowest cost producer; and (iii) optimizing and
repositioning the portfolio. We believe this strategy will allow us to create long-term value for our
shareholders.
Like all oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, we face the challenge of natural
production declines. We attempt to offset the impact of this natural decline by implementing drilling and
exploitation projects to identify and develop additional reserves and by adding reserves through leasing
and undeveloped acreage acquisition opportunities.
Recent developments
Tender Offer
On July 27, 2016, we announced the commencement of cash tender offer for our outstanding 7.5%
senior unsecured notes due September 15, 2018 ("2018 Notes") and 8.5% senior unsecured notes due
April 15, 2022 ("2022 Notes") up to a maximum combined aggregate price paid of $40.0 million
("Tender Offer"). See "Note 13. Subsequent events" in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion and the terms of the Tender Offer.
Note repurchases
We completed transactions focused on reducing our indebtedness, including open market repurchases
of an aggregate of $12.0 million and $11.5 million in principal amount of our 2018 Notes and 2022
Notes, respectively, with an aggregate of $5.4 million in cash during the three months ended June 30,
2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased an aggregate of $26.4 million and
$51.4 million in principal amount of the 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes, respectively, with an aggregate of
$13.3 million in cash. The open market repurchases resulted in net gains on extinguishment of debt of
$16.8 million and $62.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.
Settlement of Participation Agreement litigation
In July 2013, we entered into a participation agreement with a joint venture partner for the development
of certain assets in the Eagle Ford shale ("Participation Agreement"). As described in "Item 3. Legal
Proceedings" in our 2015 Form 10-K, we were in a dispute subject to litigation over the offer and the
acceptance process with our joint venture partner. On July 25, 2016, we settled the litigation with our
joint venture partner, and the litigation was thereafter dismissed by the court entering a
32

final judgment order in response to the parties’ joint motion to dismiss the case with prejudice. Among
other things, the settlement provided a full release for any claims, rights, demands, damages and
causes of action that either party has asserted or could have asserted for any breach of the Participation
Agreement. As part of the settlement, the parties amended and restated the Participation Agreement to
(i) eliminate our requirement to offer to purchase our joint venture partner's interests in certain wells
each quarter, (ii) eliminate our requirement to convey a portion of our working interest to our joint
venture partner upon commencing development of future locations, (iii) terminate the area of mutual
interest, which required either party acquiring an interest in non-producing acreage included in certain
areas to provide notice of the acquisition to the non-acquiring party and allowed the non-acquiring party
to acquire a proportionate share in such acquired interest, (iv) provide that EXCO transfer to its joint
venture partner a portion of its interests in certain producing wells and certain undeveloped locations in
South Texas, effective May 1, 2016 and (v) modify or eliminate certain other provisions. See "Note 13.
Subsequent events" in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.
Divestitures
We executed a series of non-core asset divestitures as part of our objective to optimize and reposition
our portfolio. On July 1, 2016, we closed the sale of our interests in shallow conventional assets located
in Pennsylvania for approximately $0.1 million, subject to customary post-closing purchase price
adjustments and retained an overriding royalty interest in each well. See "Note 13. Subsequent events"
in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
On May 6, 2016, we closed a sale of certain non-core undeveloped acreage in South Texas and our
interests in four producing wells for $11.5 million, subject to customary post-closing purchase price
adjustments. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce indebtedness under our credit agreement
("EXCO Resources Credit Agreement").
EXCO Resources Credit Agreement
On March 29, 2016, the lenders under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement completed their regular
semi-annual borrowing base redetermination, which resulted in a reduction in our borrowing base from
$375.0 million to $325.0 million primarily due to depressed oil and natural gas prices. There were no
other changes or amendments to the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement as a result of the
redetermination. The next scheduled borrowing base redetermination for the EXCO Resources Credit
Agreement is set to occur on or about September 1, 2016.
Critical accounting policies
We consider accounting policies related to our estimates of proved reserves, oil and natural gas
properties, derivatives, business combinations, equity-based compensation, goodwill, revenue
recognition, asset retirement obligations and income taxes as critical accounting policies. The policies
include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the
estimates were made. However, these estimates could change materially if different information or
assumptions were used. These policies and others are summarized in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in EXCO's 2015 Form 10-K.

Equity-based compensation expense included in general and administrative expense was $9.3
million and $1.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $13.1
million and $3.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Net losses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 included $26.2 million and $394.3
million of impairments of oil and natural gas properties, respectively. Net losses for the six month
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 included $160.8 million and $670.7 million of impairments of oil and
natural gas properties, respectively. See "Note 5. Oil and natural gas properties" in the Notes to our
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
The following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The comparability of our results of operations for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was affected by:
•
fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, which impact our oil and natural gas reserves, revenues, cash
flows and net income or loss;
•impairments of our oil and natural gas properties during 2016 and 2015;
asset impairments and other non-recurring costs, including the settlement of the litigation with our
Eagle Ford shale joint venture partner during 2016;
•mark-to-market gains and losses from our derivative financial instruments;
•

Table of Contents
•
•changes in proved reserves and production volumes and their impact on depletion;
the impact of declining natural gas production volumes from our reduced horizontal drilling activities in
certain shale formations;
•significant changes in our capital structure as a result of transactions in 2016 and 2015;
changes in general and administrative expenses as a result of the services and investment agreement
with Energy Strategic Advisory Services LLC ("ESAS"); and
•the reductions in our workforce that occurred during 2016 and 2015.
The availability of a ready market and the prices for oil and natural gas are dependent upon a number of
factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things:
•
•supply and demand for oil and natural gas and expectations regarding supply and demand;
•the level of domestic and international production;
•the availability of imported oil and natural gas;
•federal regulations applicable to the export of, and construction of export facilities for natural gas;
political and economic conditions and events in foreign oil and natural gas producing nations,
including embargoes, continued hostilities in the Middle East and other sustained military campaigns,
and acts of terrorism or sabotage;
the ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain
oil price and production controls;
•the cost and availability of transportation and pipeline systems with adequate capacity;
•the cost and availability of other competitive fuels;
•
•
•
•fluctuating and seasonal demand for oil, natural gas and refined products;
concerns about global warming or other conservation initiatives and the extent of governmental price
controls and regulation of production;
•regional price differentials and quality differentials of oil and natural gas;
•the availability of refining capacity;
•technological advances affecting oil and natural gas production and consumption;
•weather conditions and natural disasters;
•foreign and domestic government relations; and
•overall domestic and global economic conditions.
Accordingly, in light of the many uncertainties affecting the supply and demand for oil, natural gas and
refined petroleum products, we cannot accurately predict the prices or marketability of oil and natural
gas from any producing well in which we have or may acquire an interest.

changes in production were a result of:
•
decreased production of 7.8 Bcfe and 12.7 Bcfe for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
respectively, in the North Louisiana region primarily due to production declines partially offset by
additional volumes from the wells turned-to-sales in the second quarter of 2016.
•
increased production of 3.2 Bcfe and 4.9 Bcfe for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
respectively, in the East Texas region primarily due to additional volumes from wells turned-to-sales.
•
decreased production in the South Texas region of 0.9 Bcfe and 0.6 Bcfe for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016, respectively, primarily due to production declines.
•
decreased production of 0.4 Bcfe and 1.2 Bcfe for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
respectively, in the Appalachia region primarily due to production declines. In addition, we shut-in
approximately 0.7 Bcfe of production due to low regional natural gas prices during the six months
ended June 30, 2016. As discussed in "Note 13. Subsequent events" in the Notes to our Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements, on July 1, 2016, we closed a sale of our interests in shallow
conventional assets located in Pennsylvania. As such, our production in the Appalachia region for the
remainder of 2016 is expected to decline.
Oil and natural gas revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $39.5 million, or
42%, as compared with the same period in 2015. The decrease in revenues was primarily the result of a
decrease in oil and natural gas prices as well as decreased natural gas production. The reduction in
our development activities and suspension of drilling in certain regions will cause our production to
decline in the future unless we increase our development program. Our average natural gas sales price
decreased 30% to $1.49 per Mcf for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $2.12 per Mcf for the
three months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to lower market prices. Our average sales price of oil
per Bbl decreased 24% to $40.25 per Bbl for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $53.11 per
Bbl for the three months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to lower market prices. In July 2016, we
renegotiated a sales contract that is expected to improve our realized oil price in future periods.
Oil and natural gas revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $74.2 million, or
41%, as compared with the same period in 2015. The decrease in revenues was primarily the result of a
decrease in oil and natural gas prices as well as decreased natural gas production. Our average natural
gas sales price decreased 33% to $1.51 per Mcf for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $2.25 per
Mcf for the six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to lower market prices. Our average sales
price of oil per Bbl decreased 30% to $33.57 per Bbl for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from
$47.75 per Bbl for the six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to lower market prices.

Oil and natural gas operating costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by
$6.6 million, or 47%, and $12.0 million, or 41%, respectively, as compared with the same periods in
2015. The decreases were primarily due to cost reduction efforts, including significant reductions in
labor costs, repairs and maintenance costs, chemical treatment costs, workover activity and saltwater
disposal costs. Reduced labor costs were primarily due to significant reductions in our

workforce in 2015. We expect our lease operating expenses in the Appalachia region to continue to
decline during the remainder of 2016 due to the sale of our conventional assets in Pennsylvania and
associated reduction in workforce. The reduction in saltwater disposal costs is primarily due to the
renegotiation of contracts and more cost-efficient disposal methods.
Gathering and transportation
Gathering and transportation expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased by $2.1
million, or 9%, as compared with the same period in 2015. Gathering and transportation expenses for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased by $3.0 million, or 6%, as compared with the same
period in 2015. The increases were primarily due to gathering expenses in connection with taking our
gas in-kind from certain third-party operated wells in the North Louisiana region, which also resulted in
improved realized natural gas prices. Gathering and transportation expenses were $1.00 per Mcfe for
the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $0.75 per Mcfe for the same period in 2015.
Gathering and transportation expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $0.99 per Mcfe as
compared to $0.80 per Mcfe for the same period 2015. The increases were primarily due to lower
volumes in relation to fixed costs under gathering and firm transportation contracts in the East Texas
and North Louisiana regions.
As a result of our planned reduction in development and related lower production volumes for 2016, our
gathering and transportation cost per Mcfe is expected to increase due to the nature of the fixed costs
associated with our gathering and firm transportation contracts. We continue to evaluate plans to
restructure our gathering and transportation contracts; however, no assurance can be given as to
outcome or timing of this process.

Production and ad valorem taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $0.7 million,
or 13%, as compared with the same period in 2015. Production and ad valorem taxes for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $1.0 million, or 9%, as compared to the same period in 2015. The
decreases were primarily due to lower production volumes and lower commodity prices. The lower
commodity prices primarily impacted properties located in Texas because production taxes are based
on a fixed percentage of gross value of production sold. The decrease was partially offset by higher ad
valorem taxes resulting from additional wells drilled and increased ad valorem tax rates in certain
counties in Texas.
In our North Louisiana region, we currently receive severance tax holidays on certain horizontal wells
that reduce the effective rate of these taxes. Our horizontal wells in the state of Louisiana are eligible for
an exemption from severance taxes for the earlier of two years from the date of first production or until
payout of qualified costs. In July 2015, the state of
38
Table of Contents
Louisiana decreased its severance tax rate for wells that do not receive exemptions from $0.163 to
$0.158 per Mcf. In July 2016, the effective severance tax rate decreased to $0.098 per Mcf.
Depletion, depreciation and amortization
Depletion, depreciation and amortization for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased from the
same period in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in depletion expense of $42.4 million, or 69%. On a
per Mcfe basis, the depletion rate for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.69 per Mcfe,
compared with $1.86 per Mcfe in the same period in 2015. Depletion, depreciation and amortization for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased from the same period in 2015 primarily due to a
decrease in depletion expense of $75.7 million, or 62%. On a per Mcfe basis, the depletion rate for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.88 per Mcfe, compared with $1.94 per Mcfe in the same period
in 2015. The decrease in depletion expense was primarily due to a decrease in production and the
depletion rate. The decrease in the depletion rate was primarily due to the impairments of our oil and
natural gas properties during 2015 and 2016, which lowered our depletable base.
Impairment of oil and natural gas properties
We recorded impairments to our oil and natural gas properties of $26.2 million and $160.8 million for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. The impairments in both periods were
primarily due to the significant decline in oil and natural gas prices. The trailing twelve-month reference
prices at June 30, 2016 were $2.24 per Mmbtu of natural gas and $43.12 per Bbl of oil. The spot prices
on the first day of July 2016 were $2.92 per Mmbtu of natural gas and $48.85 per Bbl of oil, which
exceeded the trailing twelve-month reference prices at June 30, 2016.  However, oil and natural gas
prices are volatile and we may incur additional impairments during 2016 if future oil and natural gas
prices result in a decrease in the trailing twelve-month reference prices compared to June 30, 2016.
The possibility and amount of any future impairment is difficult to predict, and will depend, in part, upon
future oil and natural gas prices to be utilized in the ceiling test, estimates of proved reserves and future
capital expenditures and operating costs.

decreased personnel costs of $5.3 million and $15.3 million for the three and six months ended

•
increased consulting and contract labor costs of $1.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
primarily related to the service fees and annual incentive payment with ESAS that began on March 31,
2015.
39
Table of Contents
•
decreased various other gross general and administrative expenses of $1.1 million and $2.3 million for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. These decreases reflect our efforts to
reduce our general and administrative costs such as office expenses and professional fees. However,
we expect our professional fees to increase during the remainder of 2016 in connection with the
execution of our strategic plan that is focused on restructuring our balance sheet and gathering and
transportation contracts.
•
decreased technical services and service agreement recoveries of $1.9 million and $4.4 million for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. These decreases were primarily a result of
reduced headcount and lower recoveries in connection with the transition service agreement with
Compass Productions Partners, LP ("Compass") that terminated in April 2015.
•
decreased capitalized salaries of $1.0 million and $2.1 million for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, respectively, primarily as a result of reduced employee headcount.
•
increased equity-based compensation of $7.9 million and $10.0 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016, respectively. These increases were primarily due to $8.9 million and $10.9
million of additional compensation expense related to the warrants issued to ESAS in 2015 for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior
year. The fair value of the warrants is dependent on factors such as our share price, historical volatility,
risk-free rate and performance relative to our peer group. These factors, in aggregate, contributed to a
significant increase in the fair value of the warrants and the related equity-based compensation
expense at June 30, 2016. The expense related to warrants is re-measured and adjusted each interim
reporting period; therefore, our general and administrative expenses in future periods could be volatile
based on the aforementioned factors. The increase in our equity-based compensation expense was
partially offset by lower equity-based compensation to employees as a result of reductions in our
workforce.
Other operating items
Other operating items were net losses of $24.9 million and $25.0 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016. The net losses for both periods were primarily due to a loss of $24.3 million
recorded during the second quarter of 2016 in connection with the settlement of the litigation with our
joint venture partner. See "Note 13. Subsequent events" in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

Interest expense, net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $7.6 million and
$15.9 million, respectively, from the same periods in 2015. These decreases were primarily due to
lower outstanding balances on the 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes from debt restructuring activities and
note repurchases in 2015 and 2016. This was partially offset by additional interest from the 12.5%
senior secured second lien term loan with certain affiliates of Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited in the
aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million ("Fairfax Term Loan"), which closed in the fourth quarter of
2015. The decreases were also partially offset by lower capitalized interest primarily related to lower
balances of unproved oil and natural gas properties and suspension of our drilling and development
program in certain areas.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we closed a 12.5% senior secured second lien term loan with certain
unsecured noteholders in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million (“Exchange Term Loan,"
and together with the Fairfax Term Loan, the "Second Lien Term Loans") and used the proceeds to
repurchase a portion of the outstanding 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes in exchange for the holders of such
notes agreeing to act as lenders in connection with the Exchange Term Loan. The exchange was
accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring pursuant to FASB ASC 470-60, Troubled Debt
Restructuring by Debtors. As such, all cash payments under the terms of the Exchange Term Loan,
whether designated as interest or as principal amount, reduce the carrying amount and no interest
expense, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), is
recognized. This will result in a significantly lower interest expense than the contractual interest
payments throughout the term of the Exchange Term Loan. 
Derivative financial instruments
Our oil and natural gas derivative financial instruments resulted in net losses of $36.4 million and $6.6
million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our oil and natural gas
derivative financial instruments resulted in a net loss of $19.8 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and a net gain of $17.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. Based on the
nature of our derivative contracts, increases in the related commodity price typically result in a decrease
to the value of our derivatives contracts. The significant fluctuations demonstrate the high volatility in oil
and natural gas prices between each of the periods. The ultimate settlement amount of the unrealized
portion of the derivative financial instruments is dependent on future commodity prices.

Gain on extinguishment of debt
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a net gain on extinguishment of debt of
$16.8 million and $62.0 million, respectively. The net gain for the three months ended June 30, 2016
was primarily due to the repurchases of an aggregate of $23.5 million in principal amount of the 2018
Notes and 2022 Notes with an aggregate of $5.4 million in cash. The net gain for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 was primarily due to the repurchase of an aggregate of $77.8 million in principal amount
of the 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes with an aggregate of $13.3 million in cash. The net gains included
an acceleration of the related deferred financings costs and notes discount, as well as direct costs
associated with the transactions.
Equity loss
Our equity loss was $0.1 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Our equity loss was $8.0 million and $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. The increase in our equity loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from the
same period in 2015 was primarily due to a $4.9 million other than temporary impairment of our
midstream investment in the East Texas and North Louisiana regions that we account for under the cost
method of accounting. The impairment was primarily the result of reduced drilling activity in the region
that is expected to reduce future cash flows of our investment. In addition, we recorded a net loss of
$2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from our equity method investment that owns and
manages certain surface acreage in the North Louisiana region primarily due to its impairment of certain
assets.
Income taxes
Our effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was zero,
primarily due to prior losses arising from impairments of oil and natural gas properties which created
deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets have been fully reserved with valuation allowances. Our
accumulated valuation allowance as of June 30, 2016 was approximately $1.4 billion and can be used
to offset future taxable income. We will continue to recognize deferred tax valuation allowances until the
realization of deferred benefits becomes more likely than not. As a result of the repurchase of a portion
of our senior unsecured notes during the six months ended June 30, 2016, we had cancellation of debt
income for tax purposes which reduced our net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") by $64.5 million.
The effective income tax rates, excluding the impact of the valuation allowances, would have been
39.0% and 38.5% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, and 38.5% and
38.8% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. The effective tax rates,
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance, differ from the statutory tax rates primarily due to
permanent differences between the amounts recorded for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized deferred
income tax expense of $0.7 million related to a deferred tax liability for tax deductible goodwill. During
the three months ended June 30, 2016, the book basis of goodwill exceeded the tax basis which
caused the previous book and tax basis differences to change from a deferred tax asset to a deferred
tax liability. The deferred tax liability related to goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life based on
the nature of the underlying asset and cannot be offset under GAAP with a deferred tax asset with a
definite life, such as net operating loss carryforwards. However, the deferred income tax expense is not
expected to result in cash payments of income taxes in the foreseeable future.
Our liquidity, capital resources and capital commitments
Overview
Our primary sources of capital resources and liquidity are internally generated cash flows from
operations, borrowing capacity under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, dispositions of non-
strategic assets, joint ventures and capital markets when conditions are favorable. Factors that could
impact our liquidity, capital resources and capital commitments include the following:
•
•the level of planned drilling activities;
•the results of our ongoing drilling programs;
our ability to fund, finance or repay financing incurred in connection with acquisitions of oil and natural
gas properties;
•the integration of acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties or other assets;
our ability to effectively manage operating, general and administrative expenses and capital
expenditure programs;
reduced oil and natural gas revenues resulting from, among other things, depressed oil and natural
gas prices and lower production from reductions to our drilling and development activities;
•our ability to mitigate commodity price volatility with derivative financial instruments;
•
•

•
our ability to meet minimum volume commitments under firm transportation agreements and other fixed
commitments, as well as our ability to restructure these contracts;
•potential acquisitions and/or dispositions of oil and natural gas properties or other assets;
limitations on our ability to incur certain types of indebtedness in accordance with our debt
agreements;
our ability to pay interest on our outstanding indebtedness, including the quarterly payments related to
the Second Lien Term Loans;
•reductions to our borrowing base;
requirements to provide certain vendors and other parties with letters of credit as a result of our credit
quality, which reduce the amount of available borrowings under the EXCO Resources Credit
Agreement;
additional debt restructuring activities including the repurchase of indebtedness, issuance of additional
indebtedness or issuance of equity in exchange for indebtedness; and
•our ability to maintain compliance with debt covenants.

Recent events affecting liquidity
In response to the low commodity price environment, we have limited our development activities to
preserve our capital resources and liquidity. The curtailment of the development of our properties will
lead to a decline in our production and reserves unless we increase our levels of development in the
future. Our 2016 capital budget is expected to exceed our cash flows from operations and we expect
that the deficit will be funded with borrowings under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. We
continue to evaluate and implement further cost reduction initiatives to mitigate the impact of low
commodity prices on our cash flows and liquidity. Since December 31, 2015, we reduced the number of
our general and administrative employees by approximately 20%, and reduced our field employees in
the Appalachia region by 52% in conjunction with the sale of our conventional assets in Pennsylvania.
On March 29, 2016, the lenders under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement completed their regular
semi-annual borrowing base redetermination, which resulted in a reduction in our borrowing base from
$375.0 million to $325.0 million primarily due to depressed oil and natural gas prices. There were no
other changes or amendments to the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement as a result of the
redetermination. The borrowing base under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement remains subject to
semi-annual review and redetermination by the lenders pursuant to the terms of the EXCO Resources
Credit Agreement, and the next scheduled redetermination of the borrowing base is set to occur on or
about September 1, 2016.
We completed transactions focused on reducing our indebtedness, including open market repurchases
of an aggregate of $26.4 million and $51.4 million in principal amount of the 2018 Notes and 2022
Notes, respectively, with an aggregate of $13.3 million in cash during the six months ended June 30,
2016. As a result, we reduced the principal amounts outstanding under our 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes
to $131.6 million and $171.4 million, respectively. During the second quarter of 2016, our cash flows
from operations, reduced capital program and proceeds received from the sale of certain assets in
South Texas allowed us to reduce our indebtedness under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement by
$11.4 million. These transactions resulted in a reduction in the principal amount of outstanding
indebtedness by $23.7 million, net of borrowings under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, for the
six months ended June 30, 2016.
On July 27, 2016, we announced the commencement of a Tender Offer for our outstanding 2018 Notes
and 2022 Notes up to a maximum combined amount of $40.0 million on the aggregate price paid. Our
decision to commence the Tender Offer process is part of EXCO’s comprehensive restructuring process
focused on reducing indebtedness. We are also evaluating transactions that could further enhance our
liquidity and capital structure including the exchanges of existing indebtedness for common shares,
issuance of additional indebtedness, restructuring or repurchase of existing indebtedness, issuance of
equity, restructuring of gathering, transportation and certain other commercial contracts, cost reductions,
divestitures of assets or similar transactions. There is no assurance any such transactions will occur.

Credit agreements and long-term debt
As of June 30, 2016, our consolidated debt consisted of the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, 2018
Notes, 2022 Notes and the Second Lien Term Loans (see "Note 8. Debt" in the Notes to our
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed description of each agreement).
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the following financial covenants (each as defined in
the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement):
•
•
•
our consolidated current ratio of 1.2 to 1.0 exceeded the minimum of at least 1.0 to 1.0 as of the end of
any fiscal quarter. The consolidated current assets utilized in this ratio includes unused commitments
under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement;
our ratio of consolidated EBITDAX to consolidated interest expense ("Interest Coverage Ratio"), of 1.9
to 1.0 exceeded the minimum of at least 1.25 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. The
consolidated interest expense utilized in the Interest Coverage Ratio is calculated in accordance with
GAAP; therefore, this excludes cash payments under the terms of the Exchange Term Loan, whether
designated as interest or as principal amount, that reduce the carrying amount and are not recognized
as interest expense. See further details on the accounting for the Exchange Term Loan in "Note 8.
Debt" in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements; and
our ratio of senior secured indebtedness to consolidated EBITDAX ("Senior Secured Indebtedness
Ratio") of 0.8 to 1.0 did not exceed the maximum of 2.5 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. Senior
secured indebtedness utilized in the Senior Secured Indebtedness Ratio excludes the Second Lien
Term Loans and any other indebtedness subordinated to the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement.
Our liquidity and ability to maintain compliance with debt covenants have been negatively impacted by
the prolonged depressed oil and natural gas price environment, levels of indebtedness, and gathering,
transportation and certain other commercial contracts. Based on our current estimates and
expectations, we do not believe we will be able to comply with all of the covenants under the EXCO
Resources Credit Agreement for the twelve-month period following the date of these Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements.
If we are successful in the Tender Offer, the purchases are expected to be funded primarily with the
borrowings under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. There can be no assurances regarding the
success or extent of the purchases of the senior unsecured notes as part of the Tender Offer process.
Furthermore, the next borrowing base redetermination under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement is
scheduled to occur on or about September 1, 2016. The lenders party to the EXCO Resources Credit
Agreement have considerable discretion in setting our borrowing base, and we are unable to predict the
outcome of any future redeterminations.
44
Table of Contents
We are required to maintain a consolidated current ratio (as defined in the EXCO Resources Credit
Agreement) of at least 1.0 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter, which includes unused commitments
under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement in the definition of consolidated current assets. The
inclusion of the unused commitments under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement has historically
allowed us to maintain compliance with the consolidated current ratio covenant. Therefore, the
reduction in unused commitments as a result of borrowings to fund the Tender Offer or further
reductions to our borrowing base as part of the upcoming redetermination process would negatively
impact our consolidated current ratio and liquidity.
As a result of the impact of the aforementioned factors on our financial results and condition, we
anticipate that we will not meet the minimum requirement under the current ratio for the twelve-month
period following the date of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to
maintain compliance with the minimum requirements for the financial covenants in the EXCO
Resources Credit Agreement related to the Interest Coverage Ratio and the Senior Secured
Indebtedness Ratio for the twelve-month period following the date of these Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements. If we are not able to meet our debt covenants in future periods, we may be
required, but unable, to refinance all or part of our existing debt, seek covenant relief from our lenders,
sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, or issue equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and may
be required to surrender assets pursuant to the security provisions of the EXCO Resources Credit
Agreement. Therefore, our ability to continue our planned principal business operations would be
dependent on the actions of our lenders or obtaining additional debt and/or equity financing to repay
outstanding indebtedness under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. These factors raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and Second Lien Term Loans require our annual financial
statements to include a report from our independent registered public accounting firm without an
explanatory paragraph related to our ability to continue as a going concern. If the substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern still exists at December 31, 2016 or if we fail to comply
with the financial and other covenants in the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement or the Second Lien
Term Loans, we would be in default under such agreement. Any event of default may cause a default or
accelerate our obligations with respect to our other outstanding indebtedness, including the 2018 Notes
and 2022 Notes, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
The Second Lien Term Loans and the indentures governing the 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes contain
incurrence covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur liens to secure any
such additional indebtedness or pledge assets. These incurrence covenants include limitations on our
indebtedness that are based, in part, on the greater of a monetary threshold or the value of our assets.
Our ability to incur additional indebtedness could be limited to the extent that low oil and natural gas
prices negatively impact the value of our assets. See further details on the limitations on our ability to
incur additional indebtedness as described in "Note 8. Debt" in the Notes to our Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Capital expenditures
Our 2016 capital budget of $85.0 million is focused on development activities in the Haynesville and
Bossier shales in North Louisiana and East Texas. The development activities include drilling 7 gross
(5.4 net) wells and completing 15 gross (9.0 net) wells. We have flexibility in the timing of development
because our acreage is predominantly held-by-production.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our capital expenditures totaled $56.3 million, of which $52.6
million was related to drilling and development activities. Our development program during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 included an average of one operated drilling rig focused on the
Haynesville shale in North Louisiana. We concluded our 2016 drilling program in North Louisiana and
turned-to-sales three additional wells in this region in the third quarter of 2016. Our two drilling rig
contracts expire in 2017 and are currently being sub-leased to another operator. Our development
activities in East Texas included completion activities in the Haynesville and Bossier shales.
The following table presents our capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and our
forecasted capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016.

Historical sources and uses of funds
Our primary sources of cash for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were cash flows from operations
and borrowings under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement.

Net increase in cash
Operating activities
The primary factors impacting our cash flows from operating activities include: (i) levels of production
from our oil and natural gas properties, (ii) prices we receive from sales of oil and natural gas
production, including settlement proceeds or payments related to our oil and natural gas derivatives,
(iii) operating costs of our oil and natural gas properties, (iv) costs of our general and administrative
activities and (v) interest expense. Our cash flows from operating activities have historically been
impacted by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and our production volumes.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our net cash provided by operating activities was $45.9
million as compared to $108.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was
primarily attributable to lower revenues from lower production and decreased oil and natural gas prices.
In addition, the decrease was due to lower cash receipts on derivative contracts of $33.4 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $57.0 million for the same period in 2015.
Investing activities
Our investing activities consist primarily of drilling and development expenditures, acquisitions and
divestitures. Future acquisitions are dependent on oil and natural gas prices, availability of attractive
acreage and other oil and natural gas properties, acceptable rates of return, availability of borrowing
capacity under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and availability of other sources of capital.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our net cash used in investing activities was $43.2 million
which primarily consisted of $55.0 million of completion activities in the East Texas region and
development activities in the North Louisiana region. This was partially offset by $11.5 million of
proceeds received from a sale of certain non-core undeveloped acreage in South Texas and our
interests in four producing wells. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, our net cash used in
investing activities was $192.6 million primarily due to drilling and development activities in the East
Texas, North Louisiana and South Texas regions. The cash used in investing activities for the six
months ended June 30, 2015 included a significant amount of expenditures related to the wells drilled
in 2014.
Financing activities
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our net cash provided by financing activities was $12.6 million
primarily due to $54.1 million in net borrowings under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement partially
offset by payments of $25.3 million on the Exchange Term Loan, which reduced its carrying value, and
an aggregate of $13.3 million of cash payments used to repurchase a portion of our 2018 Notes and
2022 Notes. The borrowings under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement were primarily utilized to
fund our investing activities. On March 29, 2016, we borrowed our remaining unused commitments of
$232.4 million under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement to secure our liquidity. Prior to the
completion of the borrowing base redetermination process on March 29, 2016, we repaid the entire
$232.4 million. The borrowing and subsequent repayment both occurred on the same day. For the six
months ended June 30, 2015, our net cash provided by financing activities was $88.0 million primarily
due to $90.0 million in borrowings under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement.

Derivative financial instruments
Our production is generally sold at prevailing market prices. However, we periodically enter into oil and
natural gas derivative contracts for a portion of our production to mitigate the impact of commodity price
fluctuations and achieve a more predictable cash flow associated with our operations. These
transactions limit our exposure to declines in prices, but also limit the benefits we would realize if oil
and natural gas prices increase.                     
Our derivative financial instruments are comprised of oil and natural gas swaps, collars and swaption
contracts. As of June 30, 2016, we had derivative financial instruments in place for the volumes and
prices shown below:

and "Note 9. Fair value measurements" in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
As of June 30, 2016, we had no arrangements or any guarantees of off-balance sheet debt to third
parties.
Contractual obligations and commercial commitments
On July 25, 2016, we amended and restated the Participation Agreement to eliminate our requirement
to offer to purchase our joint venture partner's interests, eliminate our requirement to convey a portion of
our working interest to our joint venture partner upon commencing development of future locations,
terminate the area of mutual interest, provide that we transfer to our joint venture partner a portion of our
interests in certain producing wells and modify or eliminate other provisions. See "Note 13. Subsequent
events" for further discussion. There have been no other material changes outside the ordinary course
of business to our contractual obligations and commercial commitments since December 31, 2015.

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
    
Some of the information below contains forward-looking statements. The primary objective of the
following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our
potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse
changes in oil and natural gas prices, interest rates charged on borrowings and earned on cash
equivalent investments, and adverse changes in the market value of marketable securities. The
disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses, but rather an indicator of
reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides an indicator of how we view and
manage our ongoing market risk exposures. Our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for
hedging and investment purposes, not for trading purposes.
Commodity price risk
    
Our objective in entering into derivative financial instruments is to manage our exposure to commodity
price fluctuations, protect our returns on investments, and achieve a more predictable cash flow in
connection with our financing activities and borrowings related to these activities. These transactions
limit exposure to declines in prices, but also limit the benefits we would realize if oil and natural gas
prices increase. When prices for oil and natural gas are volatile, a significant portion of the effect of our
derivative financial instrument management activities consists of non-cash income or expense due to
changes in the fair value of our derivative financial instrument contracts. Cash losses or gains only arise
from payments made or received on monthly settlements of contracts or if we terminate a contract prior
to its expiration.
Our most significant market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas
production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot
market prices for natural gas as well as local and regional differentials. Pricing for oil and natural gas
production is volatile.
Our use of derivative financial instruments could have the effect of reducing our revenues and the value
of our securities. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, a $1.00 increase in the average commodity
price per Mcfe would have resulted in an increase in cash settlement payments (or a decrease in
settlements received) of approximately $28.2 million for our oil and natural gas swap contracts. The
ultimate settlement amount of our outstanding derivative financial instrument contracts is dependent on
future commodity prices. We may incur significant unrealized losses in the future from our use of
derivative financial instruments to the extent market prices increase and our derivatives contracts
remain in place.
Interest rate risk
    
At June 30, 2016, our exposure to interest rate changes related primarily to borrowings under the EXCO
Resources Credit Agreement. The interest rates per annum on the 2018 Notes, 2022 Notes and
Second Lien Term Loans are fixed at 7.5%, 8.5% and 12.5%, respectively. Interest is payable on
borrowings under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement based on a floating rate as more fully
described in "Note 8. Debt" in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. At
June 30, 2016, we had approximately $121.6 million in outstanding borrowings under the EXCO
Resources Credit Agreement. A 1% increase in interest rates (100 bps) based on the variable
borrowings as of June 30, 2016 would result in an increase in our interest expense of approximately
$1.2 million per year. The interest we pay on these borrowings is set periodically based upon market
rates.
Item 4.     Controls and Procedures
    
Disclosure controls and procedures. Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, EXCO's
management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as of the
end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer have concluded that EXCO's disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of June 30, 2016 to ensure that information that is required to be disclosed by EXCO in the
reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated
to EXCO's management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in EXCO's internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, EXCO's internal control over financial reporting.
