<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This document contains information supplied by States, as well as other 
stakeholders, including National Human Rights Institutions and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), relating to the follow-up measures to the recommendations of the 
Special Rapporteur and his predecessors made following country visits. In paragraph 5 c) of 
its resolution 8/8 on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
of June 2008, the Human Rights Council urged States &#8220;To ensure appropriate follow-up to 
the recommendations and conclusions of the Special Rapporteur.&#8221; The report submitted to 
the fifty-ninth session of the Commission (E/CN.4/2003/68, para. 18), indicated that 
Governments of States to which visits have been carried out would regularly be reminded 
of the observations and recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur after such visits. 
Information would be requested on the consideration given to the recommendations, the 
steps taken to implement them, and any constraints that may prevent their implementation. 
Information from NGOs and other interested parties regarding measures taken in follow up 
to his recommendations would be welcome as well.  
</p>
<p>2. The format of the follow-up report was modified in 2008 with the aim of rendering it 
more reader-friendly and of facilitating the identification of concrete steps taken in 
response to the specific recommendations and their results. For this reason, follow-up tables 
have been created for each State visited by the mandate holders in the past ten years. The 
tables contain the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur and his predecessors, a brief 
description of the situation when the country visit was undertaken, an overview of steps 
taken in previous years and included in previous follow-up reports and measures taken in 
the current year on the basis of information gathered by the Special Rapporteur, from 
governmental and non-governmental sources.  
</p>
<p>3. By letters dated 23 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur submitted to the respective 
Governments for their consideration and comments the information on follow-up measures 
he had gathered. Letters were sent to the following States: Azerbaijan, Brazil, Cameroon, 
People&#8217;s Republic of China, Denmark, Georgia, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Mongolia, 
Nepal, Nigeria, Paraguay, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, Spain, Sri Lanka, 
Uzbekistan and Togo. Information was received from the Governments of Denmark, 
Georgia, Mongolia, Paraguay, Republic of Moldova, Spain, Togo and Uzbekistan. The 
Special Rapporteur is grateful for the information received. 
</p>
<p>4. Owing to restrictions, the Special Rapporteur has been obliged to reduce the details 
of responses; attention has been given to reflect information that specifically addresses the 
recommendations, and which has not been previously reported. 
</p>
<p><b>  Azerbaijan 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in the report of 
his visit to Azerbaijan from 7 to 15 May 2000 (E/CN.4/2001/66/Add.1, para.120) 
</b></p>
<p>5. On 23 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government 
of Azerbaijan requesting information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with 
regard to the implementation of the recommendations of his predecessor&#8217;s visit in 2000. 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not provided any input. He looks 
forward to receiving information on Azerbaijan&#8217;s efforts to follow-up to his 
recommendations and he reaffirms that he stands ready to assist in efforts to prevent and 
combat torture and ill-treatment. </p>

</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur commends Azerbaijan for its ratification of the Optional 
Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture (OPCAT). He notes the designation of the 
Commissioner for Human Rights (Ombudsman) as the National Preventive Mechanism and 
appeals to the Government to facilitate its effective and independent functioning, inter alia 
by ensuring the availability of sufficient resources and the unfettered and unannounced 
access to all places of detention. 
</p>
<p>7. He further notes the information received regarding the existing complaints 
procedure and the steps taken to hold perpetrators accountable and encourages the 
Government to ensure to that all allegations of torture and ill-treatment are followed up by a 
prompt and impartial investigation in accordance with article 12 CAT. He further wishes to 
reiterate that the crime of torture requires criminal sanctions which are commensurate to the 
gravity of the crime, and can never be covered only by administrative measures.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the allegations received regarding cases 
in which confessions obtained in violation of the rights of the accused, including coerced 
incriminating statements, have been admitted to court proceedings. In this regard, he wishes 
to reiterate that the admissibility of evidence and confessions obtained under torture is one 
of the main incentives for the infliction of torture. Any efforts to prevent torture have to 
therefore include a rigorous implementation of the non-admissibility of evidence obtained 
under torture, as stipulated in article 15 CAT. </p>

taken since January 2008 
</b></p>
<p>(a) Ensure that all allegations of 
torture and similar ill-treatment 
are promptly, independently and 
thoroughly investigated by a 
body capable of 
</p>
<p>prosecuting perpetrators; 
</p>
<p>The legal framework 
guaranteed the right to 
appeal the decisions and 
actions by officials; 
Detainees often afraid of 
filing complaints for fear of 
reprisals;  
</p>
<p>Plans to create an internal 
investigation department 
within the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs (MoI) and 
of a complaints unit within 
the General Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office; 
</p>
<p>A special committee within 
the Ministry of Justice was 
created by the then new 
Corrections Code, tasked to 
deal with prisoners&#8217; 
complaints. 
</p>
<p>Government: reforms improving the penitentiary system 
are underway, including the reform of the legislative 
basis;  
</p>
<p>A hotline aimed at identifying unlawful activities of 
employees of law enforcement agencies started 
functioning in September 2005; 
</p>
<p>Allegations of torture and ill-treatment by internal affairs 
officials are investigated by prosecutorial agencies;  
</p>
<p>The Commission on Human Rights (Ombudsman) has 
the right to request relevant bodies to open criminal 
investigations. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Non-governmental sources: allegations of torture and 
ill-treatment are not being investigated in an 
independent and thorough manner and alleged 
perpetrators are not being prosecuted; 
</i></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental 
sources</i></b><i>: All complaints 
presented to the 
Ombudsman are accepted 
for consideration and 
investigated. Appeals have 
been sent to the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs, the 
Ministry of Justice, the 
ministry of Defence, 
prosecutors&#8217; offices and the 
Prosecutor General for 
further criminal, 
administrative or 
disciplinary action. In the 
first months of 2009, the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
73 staff members were 
subjected to additional 
measures (four criminal 
and the rest administrative) 
for rough treatment towards 
citizens, unjustified 
detention and unjustified 
detention at police stations. 
</i></p>
<p>(b) Prosecutors should regularly 
carry out inspections, including 
unannounced visits, of all places 
of detention. Similarly, the 
Ministries of Internal Affairs and 
of National Security should 
establish effective procedures for 
internal monitoring of the

the police, which was

agents, in particular with a view 
to eliminating practices of torture 
and ill-treatment; the activities of 
such procedures should not be 
dependent on the existence of a 
formal complaint. In addition, 
non-governmental organizations 
and other parts of civil society 
should be allowed to visit places 
of detention and to have 
confidential interviews with all 
persons deprived of their liberty; 
</p>
<p>attributed to their mentality 
inherited from the Soviet 
regime.  
</p>
<p>A number of investigators 
of the prosecutor&#8217;s office 
had been dismissed for not 
having prevented these 
violations; 
</p>
<p>MoI &#8220;Order on Additional 
Measures to Ensure 
Legality among the 
Personnel&#8221; created a 
personnel department in 
charge of training and other 
educational activities; 
</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice 
recognized the need for an 
independent monitoring 
mechanism; 
</p>
<p>ICRC had access to all 
places of detention;  
</p>
<p>Prisons had opened up to 
public scrutiny, including 
access for NGOs, but no 
confidential interviews with 
detainees; 
</p>
<p>right to confidential conversations with any of the 
detainees; 
</p>
<p>A &#8220;Code of ethics of the employees of the bodies of 
internal affairs&#8221; was approved in April 2005; 
</p>
<p>Temporary detention centres at the district police centres 
were modernized and new temporary detention centres 
constructed;  
</p>
<p>The conditions in which detainees are held at territorial 
police units are regularly studied, and measures are 
taken to remove shortcomings; 
</p>
<p><i>Non-governmental sources: civil society organizations 
have access to places of detention in some instances. 
However, their access is limited and at the discretion of 
the authorities; 
</i></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(c) Magistrates and judges, like 
prosecutors, should always ask a 
person brought from police 
custody how they have been 
treated and be particularly 
attentive to their condition; 
</p>
<p>Suspects were afraid to 
voice complaints. Members 
of the judiciary were 
therefore in a particularly 
important safeguarding 
role; The General 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office was 
said to rarely investigate 
allegations of torture, and 
even less frequently to 
</p>
<p>Government: during a judicial investigation all claims of 
the use of torture against persons being investigated are 
considered, evidence is gathered, and the court verifies 
the full observance of such persons' right to protection; 
in the event of a complaint of torture or maltreatment, 
the courts immediately call for a forensic examination; 
</p>
<p>The Supreme Court adopted a decision that evidence 
obtained by unlawful means cannot form the basis of a 
judgment; this Supreme Court decision was transmitted 
to all courts and pre-trial investigation agencies for

the violations;  
</p>
<p>Magistrates had been asked 
to pay particular attention 
to the way evidence was 
obtained; 
</p>
<p>The judiciary had been 
tasked to play a proactive 
role when it comes to 
verifying information since 
victims might be too afraid 
to complain;  
</p>
<p>practical use in their work. 
</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice carries out measures aimed at 
increasing the professionalism of judges through training 
on human rights issues, including the prohibition of 
torture; 
</p>
<p>The Decree on &quot;Modernization of the court system&quot;, 
dated 19 January 2006, was crucial in this sphere; 
</p>
<p><i>Non-governmental sources: even when detainees 
complain, no investigation is conducted; as a result of 
trial monitoring the pattern whereby judges fail to take 
the allegations seriously and do not initiate detailed 
investigations into the allegations. 
</i></p>
<p>(d) Where there is credible 
evidence that a person has been 
subjected to torture or similar ill-
treatment, adequate 
compensation should be paid 
promptly; a system should be put 
in place to this end; 
</p>
<p>The Plenary of the Supreme 
Court had asked 
magistrates to provide 
explanations to the persons 
who have suffered torture 
and other unlawful acts 
regarding their right to 
claim compensation for 
moral and physical 
suffering and to create the 
necessary conditions for 
them actually to benefit 
from this right. 
</p>
<p>Government: the law provides for several means for 
compensating victims of acts of violence, however 
covering solely injuries resulting from unlawful actions; 
</p>
<p>Law No. 610 of 1998 which provides that if a person 
was held in preliminary detention or in prison as a result 
of a mistake or abuse by prosecutorial or judicial 
agencies, they have to ask for forgiveness from this 
person in writing;  
</p>
<p>Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) article 189 holds that 
the person who suffered losses as a result of crimes, as 
defined in the Criminal Code (CC) has the right to get 
compensation when the act has been tried before a court. 
The victim has the right to receive from 10 to 300 
amounts of minimum wage in compensation depending 
on the gravity of the crime committed against him; 
</p>
<p>According to CPC article 191, the court, on the basis of 
a petition by the victim, assigns compensation from the 
State budget. While reflecting the decision relating to the 
payment of compensation in the verdict against the 
perpetrator, the court also indicates that the amount 
allocated as compensation must be returned to the state 
budget;

</p>
<p>(e) Confessions made by a 
person under police detention 
without the presence of a lawyer 
should not be admissible as 
evidence against the person; 
</p>
<p>Coerced confessions were 
said to be used by the 
Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office 
as evidence to secure 
convictions; 
</p>
<p>The Plenary of the Supreme 
Court had issued a 
resolution, inter alia, 
reiterating that testimonies 
obtained under duress shall 
not be admitted as evidence 
to court. 
</p>
<p>Government: the CPC provides that the defence counsel 
has the right to be present when a suspect or an accused 
person is searched or arrested and grants the right of a 
suspect or accused person to refuse a lawyer (article 
153);  
</p>
<p>The right of self-defence, along with the right to legal 
assistance, are also contained in article 90 CC; 
</p>
<p>The testimony given by a person who has refused a 
lawyer at the temporary detention centre may be 
accepted as evidence even if no lawyer was present;  
</p>
<p>CCP article 92(12) CCP holds that the investigator, the 
prosecutor or the court may accept the refusal from the 
lawyer in a case where the suspect or accused person 
makes this request on his own initiative, voluntarily and 
in presence of a lawyer or trusted person; 
</p>
<p>The refusal of the suspect or the accused of a lawyer 
because of the lack of means to pay for legal assistance 
is not accepted, and a lawyer is provided for him;  
</p>
<p>CCP article 125(2) provides that evidence obtained in 
violation of a defendant&#8217;s rights is not permitted; such 
information is considered as having no legal force 
(article 125(3)).  
</p>
<p><i>Non-governmental sources: trial monitoring conducted 
by NGOs showed that the courts continue to rely on 
confessions that may have been obtained by torture or 
ill-treatment; It was possible to identify a pattern 
whereby judges fail to take allegations seriously and do 
not initiate detailed investigations.</i> 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental 
sources</i></b><i>: There are reports 
of confessions being 
obtained in violation of the 
rights of the accused to the 
assistance of an interpreter 
and defence lawyer, as well 
as detainees being coerced 
into signing statements 
incriminating themselves. 
There are also reports of 
the fabrication of 
documents including 
transcripts of 
interrogations. 
</i></p>
<p>(f) Given the numerous reports 
of inadequate legal counsel 
provided by State-appointed 
lawyers, measures should be 
taken to improve legal aid 
</p>
<p>Detainees&#8217; access to 
lawyers often restricted; 
Police pressured detainees 
not to seek counsel or to 
accept State-appointed 
</p>
<p>Government: a new law, elaborated in cooperation with 
the Council of Europe and the OSCE with the aim of 
enhancing the effectiveness of the provision of legal aid, 
entered into force in August 2004.

interest;  
</p>
<p>State-appointed lawyers 
were not very active; they 
were only available to 
juveniles and persons 
suspected of having 
committed a serious 
offense;  
</p>
<p>The new Criminal Code 
envisioned providing all 
suspects with access to 
State-appointed lawyers, 
but it was unclear starting 
from which moment. 
</p>
<p>Rights and the Police&quot; was published. 
</p>
<p>The legal basis for establishing the new bar, separate 
from governmental bodies, is found in the Law on 
&#8220;Barristers and barrister activity,&#8221; adopted in 1999. It 
equalizes the rights of the lawyer representing the 
defending side with the accusing side. 
</p>
<p><i>Non-governmental sources: the ratio of criminal defence 
lawyers to population is amongst the lowest in the 
world. This has a serious impact on the provision of 
legal aid services. Only about 350 lawyers are entitled 
to act as criminal defence lawyers, with the vast 
majority based in the capital. 
</i></p>
<p><i>The new &#8220;Law on Advocates&#8221; of August 2004, which 
was designed to increase the number of defence lawyers, 
has been interpreted in a narrow manner and very few 
new members have actually been admitted; 
</i></p>
<p><i>Remuneration for legal aid services is extremely low 
and, in many cases, the Government fails to pay legal 
aid fees.</i> 
</p>
<p>(g) Video and audio taping of 
proceedings in police 
interrogation rooms should be 
considered; 
</p>
<p>Video recording of 
investigations was done at 
the exclusive discretion of 
the investigator;  
</p>
<p>The purpose of taping was 
to record evidence which 
would then be produced in 
court proceedings, and not 
as a safeguard against 
unlawful interrogation 
methods. 
</p>
<p>Government: CCP provides for the possibility of making 
audio recordings, taking photographs, making video 
recordings or films, or using other kinds of photography 
during proceedings;  
</p>
<p>Investigators widely use technical devices during 
interrogations; in the majority of the temporary detention 
centres located in district police stations of towns, 
including in Baku new systems have been installed to 
prevent illegal acts and rude behaviour against detainees; 
</p>
<p>During the last several years, 26 investigative rooms of 
64 temporary detention centres were equipped with 
video installations; by the end of 2008.all stations should 
be equipped.

<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur (Nigel Rodley) in 
the report of his visit to Brazil from 20 August to 12 September 2000 
(E/CN.4/2001/66/Add.2, para. 169) 
</b></p>
<p>9. On 23 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government 
of Brazil requesting information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with 
regard to the implementation of the recommendations of his predecessor&#8217;s visit in 2000. 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not provided any input. He looks 
forward to receiving information on Brazil&#8217;s efforts to follow-up to his recommendations 
and he reaffirms that he stands ready to assist in efforts to prevent and combat torture and 
ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur echoes the observations of the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions following his mission to Brazil in 2007 
(A/HRC/11/2/Add.2), particularly with regard to: problems of physical abuse and 
corruption by prison guards, including the threat of reprisals for presenting complaints; the 
sharp rise in prison population over the past decade; and the inadequate external oversight 
of prison conditions, leading to poor prison conditions and abuses of power. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur commends the efforts by the Government in some states to 
reduce the number of pre-trial detainees being held in police stations for longer than 24 
hours, and encourages the Government to further these efforts, as thousands remain in 
detention for long periods of time, in many cases in deplorable conditions. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the reports of a small number of prosecutions of 
suspected perpetrators of torture. However, he regrets that the mechanisms for presenting 
complaints and carrying out investigations are still weak. He encourages the Government to 
provide him with statistics of the number of prosecutions. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (OPCAT) and encourages the Government to ensure that the NPM becomes 
functional as soon as possible and that civil society is fully included in the process of its 
creation and in its work. </p>

<p>The top federal and state 
political leaders declare 
unambiguously that torture 
and other ill-treatment by 
public officials will not be 
tolerated and that the 
culture of impunity must 
end. 
</p>
<p>Unannounced visits to 
police stations, pre-trial 
detention facilities and 
penitentiaries should be 
carried out. The occurrence 
of abuse should result in 
the removal from office. (a) 
</p>
<p> <b>Non-governmental sources: </b>Public 
declarations condemning torture made by 
high profile political leaders, other than 
human rights secretaries, are extremely 
rare.  
</p>
<p>The Federal Government launched a 
national campaign against torture after the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. However, the 
campaign failed to address the fundamental 
causes of the crime and did not seek to 
improve mechanisms for safe and effective 
reporting and prosecution of cases. 
</p>
<p>The Government focused on the creation of 
a very short and limited publicity campaign 
and the creation of a telephone hotline, to 
encourage anonymous denunciations, and 
with a view to collecting data. The 
administration and running of the &#8220;SOS 
Torture&#8221; line has been carried out by 
NGOs, who receive government funding 
for doing so. It was reported that the data 
collected by the hotline is not a reliable 
indicator of levels of torture in a given 
place, as higher numbers of calls may 
result from a variety of factors, such as 
higher awareness of the existence of the 
hotline or better access to telephones. 
Given the anonymous nature of the hotline 
it did not contribute to the effective 
reporting or investigation of alleged cases 
of torture. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> In 
international fora, the federal government 
has officially recognized the persistence of 
the practice of torture. Similarly, 
individual state and federal government 
representatives have at times recognized 
that the problem persists. However, there is 
still a need for a consistent, clear and 
unambiguous condemnation, with the aim 
of sending an unequivocal message to 
perpetrators and public at large.

</p>
<p>Those arrested in flagrante 
delicto should not be held 
in police stations beyond 
24 hours. Overcrowding in 
remand prisons cannot be a 
justification for prolonged 
detention by the police. (c) 
</p>
<p>Recent and long-term detainees 
were mixed together in police 
stations. A large number had 
already been sentenced, but 
could not be transferred to 
prisons because of lack of space. 
</p>
<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources: </i></b><i>While there 
have been some efforts in some states to 
reduce pre-trial detainees being held in 
police stations for longer than 24 hours, 
tens of thousands continue to be held for 
long periods, often in overcrowded 
conditions. In some cases, convicted 
detainees are still being held in police 
stations. Reports of juveniles and women 
being held in cells with adult males have 
also been received. In one case a 15-year-
old girl was repeatedly sexually abused for 
a period of a month while held in a cell 
with over 20 men.

<p>Most of the suspects in police

families had not been informed 
of their arrest and whereabouts. 
</p>
<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources: </i></b><i>There are 
reports of detainees who are not given 
access to family members or regular visits 
by human rights groups. Degrading and 
invasive searches of family members 
persist throughout the prison system and 
the juvenile detention system. 
</i></p>
<p>Those arrested should be 
informed of their right to 
consult with a lawyer and 
to obtain free legal advice. 
A statement of detainees&#8217; 
rights should be readily 
available for consultation 
in all places of detention.

<p>Although the Constitution 
provides that those arrested are

specific legal provision 
regarding the period of time after 
which a person has access to a 
lawyer.

<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources: </i></b><i>The decision 
in 2006 by Sao Paulo state to create a 
public defenders system was an important 
victory for those campaigning for the 
provision of free legal access in Brazil&#8217;s

should be given to

rooms. (h) 
</p>
<p>  <b><i>Non-governmental sources: </i></b><i>There is no

are being used. However, the use of 
confessions given to the police without the

<p>When allegations of torture

<p>penitentiaries and institutions for 
juvenile offenders. The purposes 
ranged from obtaining of 
information and confessions to 
the lubrication of systems of 
financial extortion. 
</p>
<p>It is still largely the case that the bodies 
responsible for investigating and reporting 
acts of torture, including internal police 
investigation units [corregedorias], forensic 
medical units [institutos m&#233;dicos legais], 
the public prosecutors office [ministerio 
p&#250;blico], and the judiciary have largely 
failed to carry out investigations either due 
to lack of resources, negligence or 
complicity.  
</p>
<p>Certain dedicated public prosecutors have 
proven to be notable exceptions to this 
rule, as are those working in the human 
rights department in the state of Minas 
Gerais, and those prosecutors responsible 
for monitoring S&#227;o Paulo&#8217;s juvenile 
detention system, the Foundation for the 
Well-Being of Minors, or Funda&#231;&#227;o 
Estadual do Bem Estar do Menor 
(FEBEM), where systematic work has 
contributed to increased prosecutions, 
though often in the face of institutional 
pressures.  
</p>
<p>States which have police ombudsmen&#8217;s 
offices have to some extent managed to 
document the extent of torture. Given the 
limited powers bestowed to the offices, 
especially the lack of investigative powers 
and the lack of any real independence both 
financial and institutional, they have also 
failed to reduce incidences of torture. 
Consequently, visits to places where 
torture is thought to occur and the reporting 
of cases is often limited to those civil 
society groups able to obtain access. 
</p>
<p>monitors consider any such complaints 
likely to be true (A/HRC/11/2/Add.2, para. 
43). 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources: </i></b><i>While there 
have been some important prosecutions of

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources: </i></b><i>The 
PROVITA protection system is specifically 
designed to protect witnesses in criminal 
investigations, including those in which 
police officers may be suspected of

PROVITA system is not designed to 
provide protection to victims of torture, 
especially those held in detention. The 
PROVITA system suffers from inconsistent 
funding a limited number of spaces, thus 
only ensuring positions for those cases 
which are deemed a priority for police and 
prosecutors.  
</i></p>
<p>Prosecutors should bring 
charges under the 1997 law 
against torture and request 
that judges enforce the 
prohibition of bail for those 
charged. Sufficient 
prosecutorial resources 
should be assigned by 
Attorney-Generals for 
criminal investigations of 
torture and ill-treatment. (l) 
</p>
<p>The Torture Law was virtually 
ignored, and prosecutors and 
judges preferred using the 
traditional, inadequate notions of 
abuse of authority and causing 
bodily harm. 
</p>
<p><b>Non-governmental sources: </b>despite the 
introduction of the 1997 law against 
torture, only a few prosecutions have been 
brought in comparison to the number of 
allegations, and with only a handful 
resulting in convictions.  
</p>
<p>A recent report (An&#225;lise do Cumprimento 
pelo Brasil das Recomenda&#231;&#245;es do Comit&#234; 
da ONU contra a Tortura, Programa dh 
Internacional, MNDH-NE &amp; GAJOP, July 
2005) cited figures showing that in the 
state of S&#227;o Paulo, which has the highest 
prison population in the country, there had 
only been 12 convictions under the torture 
law between 1997 and 2004, and most of 
these of private individuals.  
</p>
<p>Information about prosecutions of state 
agents for torture, as well as other human 
rights violations, is difficult to obtain, as 
much of the information about such cases 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources: </i></b><i>While there is 
greater recognition of the 1997 law against 
torture, there continues to be reluctance on 
the part of the prosecution service to 
prosecute law enforcement agents under it. 
However, the lack of regular statistical 
data relating to the use of 1997 law against 
torture and the fact that it is also used in 
cases involving non-state agents makes an 
accurate assessment of its implementation 
impossible.  </i></p>

</p>
<p>This is a serious impediment to the right of 
victims to a fair trial. Since the torture law 
also applies to private persons, 
prosecutions are more likely to be brought 
against private individuals than state 
employees. Consequently, there is no 
differentiation in the data between 
prosecutions against state actors and 
private individuals, limiting its value.  
</p>
<p>Impunity continues to be the norm. In an 
opinion poll conducted in Datafolha, 24% 
of those interviewed in S&#227;o Paulo thought 
that torture was an acceptable means of 
criminal investigation, a rise of 4% over a 
similar poll conducted in 1997.

<p>Investigations of police

<p><i>councils on human rights continue to vary 
dramatically around the country. In those

working effectively, there are extremely 
worrying reports of politically motivated 
attempts to hinder or undermine their 
work. For example, in Rio de Janeiro, state 
government with judicial collaboration, 
managed to oust the president of the 
community council after he made persistent 
denunciations of violations. In the state of 
Esp&#237;rito Santo, where the prison system is 
riddled with corruption and human rights 
violations, the state authorities have 
managed to bar all access to prisons by the 
officially mandated human rights council 
and all other human rights or religious 
groups.

resulted in severely overcrowded prisons 
(A/HRC/11/2/Add.2, para. 42). 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources: </i></b><i>At present the 
prison population is around 460,000, 
leaving a shortfall of 160,000 places in the

been expressed about the interference with 
human rights groups or officially 
authorised prison visiting bodies, such as 
the community council of Rio de Janeiro, 
or conselho da comunidade, a prison 
inspection body made up of the authorities 
and civil society. The authorities reportedly 
placed pressure on the judge of the penal 
executions court, or juiz da vara de 
execu&#231;&#245;es penais, to replace the president 
of the conselho da comunidade, who was 
widely critical of the state&#8217;s prison system.  
</p>
<p>In S&#227;o Paulo, human rights groups were 
blocked from visiting the FEBEM juvenile 
detention system, visited by the Special 
Rapporteur in 2000, where it is reported 
that torture and ill-treatment remains 
widespread and systematic. Although the 
state authorities of S&#227;o Paulo have granted

<p>There are many bodies with the legal 
authority to investigate prison conditions, 
but they have not provided adequate 
oversight in practice. This lack of external 
oversight has permitted poor prison 
conditions and abuses of power to 
continue. The law provides for a number of 
organs to inspect and monitor prisons. 
However, inmates interviewed had rarely 
seen or even heard of a visit by an external 
prison monitor. They were aware of rare 
visits by prison internal affairs, but no 
visits by a judge, prison council, or other 
prison oversight body (A/HRC/11/2/Add.2, 
paras. 47-48).

expose torture in FEBEM units. Overall, 
attempts to tackle human rights violations 
in the FEBEM have failed, and in the first

attempt by the then FEBEM president to 
root out and punish corrupt employees, 
there were large scale disturbances,

which saw the destruction of several 
FEBEM units, deaths of detainees and the 
transfer of juveniles into the adult prison 
system. The president of the FEBEM who 
lead the crackdown subsequently resigned, 
and human rights groups reported a recent 
increase in repressive treatment of 
adolescents, through the use of collective 
punishment, torture and beatings.  
</p>
<p>Between January 2001 and July 2005, 269 
investigations into incidents of torture were 
passed onto the police by the state public

</p>
<p>15. Le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial remarque avec pr&#233;occupation que le nouveau Code de 
proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale permet la pratique de traitements inhumains et d&#233;gradants en ne les 
qualifiant pas de torture. Il est &#233;galement concern&#233; par le fait que les dispositions relatives

d&#8217;autres &#233;l&#233;ments de la proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale. La surpopulation carc&#233;rale existe toujours et les 
mesures prises par le Gouvernement pour y rem&#233;dier ne semblent pas suffisantes. Le

<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur (Manfred 
Nowak) in the report of his visit to China in November 2005 (E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.6, 
para. 82) 
</b></p>
<p>18. On 23 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government 
of China requesting information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with 
regard to the implementation of his recommendations. The Special Rapporteur regrets that 
the Government has not provided any input. He looks forward to receiving information on 
China&#8217;s efforts to follow-up to his recommendations and he reaffirms that he stands ready 
to assist in efforts to prevent and combat torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur welcomes China&#8217;s efforts to improve the situation of human 
rights in the country and to combat torture as proclaimed in its National Human Rights 
Action Plan 2009-2010 (NHRA). He positively notes that the NHRA unambiguously 
prohibits torture as well as the use of evidence obtained through torture and declares to 
prevent torture by inter alia establishing and improving supervisory mechanisms for law 
enforcement and for the administration of justice, conducting physical examinations of 
detainees before and after any interrogation and improving the treatment of detainees. 
However, the Special Rapporteur regrets that China fails to take concrete steps in this 
regard, rejects to release concrete data about enforcement efforts and to increase 
transparency in the criminal justice system. Despite some efforts to improve the regulations 
criminalizing torture, the Special Rapporteur regrets that no further steps have been taken to 
bring the Chinese criminal law in line with the requirements of articles 1 and 4 of the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (CAT). The Special Rapporteur expresses concern about allegations of 
continuing use of confessions obtained through torture in judicial proceedings. Although 
welcoming the increased use of video and audio taping at interrogations, he regrets that 
such material is fully controlled by the police authorities making an effective and 
independent monitoring impossible. He is further concerned about the lack of 
investigations, prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators of torture. He reiterates that 
no independent mechanism mandated to monitor all places of detention has been created 
and thus strongly encourages the Government to ratify and implement the Optional 
Protocol to the CAT. 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the use of &#8220;Re-education through 
Labour&#8221; and similar forms of administrative detention, particularly the &#8220;coercive quarantine 
for drug rehabilitation&#8221; and the treatment of such detainees. He is particularly concerned 
about increasing reports of arbitrary administrative detention in so called &#8216;black jails&#8217; 
preventing petitioners to file complaints. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern reports 
about the excessive use and length of pre-trial detention putting the concerned persons at 
risk of torture and ill-treatment. He reiterates his recommendations concerning the 
guarantee of habeas corpus or equivalent means to challenge the lawfulness of detention 
and the full guarantee of the right to fair trial. 
</p>
<p>21. Although he welcomes the revision and abolition of regulations inconsistent with the 
reformed Lawyers Law, the Special Rapporteur regrets that China has so far failed to take 
concrete steps to guarantee the right to legal counsel, the presumption of innocence and the 
right to remain silent. He notes with great concern that the intimidation, repression and 
harassment of lawyers who take on &#8216;sensitive&#8217; cases continue and that several lawyers have 
been detained and convicted on arbitrary grounds. The Special Rapporteur is worried about 
the continuing prosecution of &#8216;political crimes&#8217; such as &#8220;endangering state security&#8221; and the 
discrimination of such political prisoners in the sentence reduction and parole process. </p>

<p>a) The <b>crime of torture 
should be defined </b>as a 
matter of priority in 
accordance with article 1 of 
the Convention against 
Torture, with <b>penalties 
commensurate with the 
gravity</b> of torture.  
</p>
<p>No explicit definition of torture 
in domestic legislation; the 
existing legislation relevant to 
the prohibition and 
criminalization of torture did not 
satisfy the requirements of 
articles 1 and 4 of CAT; in 
particular, it lacked the 
following elements:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; mental torture;  
&#8226; the direct or indirect 
involvement of a public official 
or another person acting in an 
official capacity; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Infliction of the act for a 
specific purpose. 
</p>
<p>The penalization of acts of 
torture was stipulated in articles 
247 and 248 of the Criminal 
Law (CL), however a number of 
other regulations permit 
exceptions (see infra Rec c)). 
</p>
<p>In 2006,<b> </b>the Ministry of Justice issued 
regulations prohibiting torture and ill-
treatment by specific categories of public 
officials, such as &#8220;Six prohibitions for 
prison guards&#8221;, &#8220;Six prohibitions for Re-
education Through Labour&#8221; (RTL) etc.  
</p>
<p>In the Regulations on Case-Filing 
Standards in Cases of Rights Infringement 
through Dereliction of Duty, the Supreme 
People&#8217;s Procuratorate (SPP) lists several 
acts amounting to the crime of coercing a 
confession, such as beatings, binding, 
prolonged use of cold, hunger, exposure or 
scorching to abuse detainees, severely 
injuring suspects or leading a suspect to 
commit serious self-injury or directly or 
indirectly ordering others to use torture for 
the purpose of extracting a confession.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Despite the 
introduction of new categories of offences 
relating to torture by the Supreme 
People&#8217;s Procuratorate (SPP), the 
definition of torture and the prohibition 
and criminalization of torture in Chinese 
law do not satisfy the requirements of 
Articles 1 and 4 of CAT. By including only 
a list of situations amounting to torture 
and ill-treatment, other torture methods 
risk to fall outside the law. In practice, the 
punishment against perpetrators of torture 
is very light in comparison to the gravity 
of the crime. It is still common that 
perpetrators of torture escape criminal 
punishment or any punishment at all. 
</i></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>b) All allegations of torture 
and ill-treatment should be 
<b>promptly investigated by 
an independent authority</b> 
with no connection to the 
authority investigating or 
prosecuting the case against 
the alleged victim. 
</p>
<p>According to Article 18 of the 
Criminal Procedure Law (CPL), 
the Supreme People&#8217;s 
Procuratorate (SPP) is the 
mechanism responsible for 
investigating and prosecuting 
crimes committed by State 
functionaries. The Procurators 
are also mandated to monitor

<p>The Public Security Organs' 
Regulations on Pursuing

Errors in Implementing the Law 
and other regulations stipulated 
that &#8220;responsibility for &#8216;errors&#8217;, 
including forcing confessions or

where the law is unclear or

</b></p>
<p>The CPL gave public security 
organs broad discretion to detain 
suspects for long periods in 
custody without judicial review. 
Coercive summoning (<i>Juchuan) 
</i>could be extended for up to 48 
hours and the period of 
examination following formal 
arrest (<i>Daibu) </i>and prior to 
submitting the case to the Public 
Procuratorate for approval could 
take up to 7 days, and up to 30 
days for suspects of organised 
crimes (Art. 69). Detention for 
the purpose of criminal 
investigation (<i>Juliu) </i>was 
generally possible for up to 14 
days and could be prolonged for 
up to 37 days (Art. 61).  
</p>
<p>Criminal detainees are held in 
detention centres (<i>Juliusuo</i>) 
under the jurisdiction of the 
Public Security Bureau (PSB). 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>Extensive time periods specified for 
summons, formal arrest by the police, 
approval of the arrest by the procuratorate 
and special arrangements for some 
categories of suspects remained in force. 
Suspects could still be held legally in 
police custody for up to 37 days prior to 
approval by the procuratorate.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  <i>No steps 
have been taken to change the CPL and

<p>f) Recourse to <b>pre-trial 
detention</b> in the Criminal 
Procedures Law should be 
<b>restricted</b>, particularly for 
non-violent, minor or less 
serious offences, and the 
application of <b>non-custodial 
measures such as bail and 
recognizance be increased</b>. 
</p>
<p>Upon approval by the 
procuratorate, suspects could be 
held for up to a total of seven 
months in investigative 
detention by the police (<i>Daibu)</i>, 
which could be extended by the 
procuratorate for up to six and a 
half months or, in the case of the 
discovery of new crimes, 
indefinitely. </p>
<p>The SPP placed extended detention in 
criminal cases within the sphere of 
oversight of the people&#8217;s supervisors, 
which led to a reduction of the use of 
extended pre-trial detention. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Pre-trial 
detention continued to be applied 
excessively and for prolonged periods; in

<p>&#8226; Article 43 of the CPL 
prohibited the extortion of 
confessions by torture or the 
threat of torture, but not the <i>use 
</i>of confessions extracted through 
torture as evidence before 
courts.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Supreme People&#8217;s Court 
held in 1999 that evidence and 
confessions obtained through 
torture could not form the basis 
of a criminal charge, however it 
did not exclude their 
admissibility in judicial 
proceedings.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Government has 
acknowledged the pervasiveness 
of torture for the purpose of 
extracting confession and the 
SPP announced in 2005 that 
</p>
<p>Article 96 of the CPL provided for access 
to a lawyer after initial interrogations. In 
2006, the Public Order Administration 
Punishment Law of the National People&#8217;s 
Congress Standing Committee Article 
entered into force, which prohibited the 
use of evidence obtained by torture as the 
basis of a criminal charge (article 75). The 
same year the SPP announced the 
nationwide implementation of audio-video 
recording of interrogations of criminal 
suspects in the procuratorates by the end 
of 2007.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> There is no 
right to access a lawyer before the initial

Supreme People&#8217;s Court 
(SPC) review for all death 
sentences should be utilized 
as an opportunity to publish 
national statistics on the 
application of the death 
penalty 
</p>
<p>The SPC restored its power of 
review in October 2005. 
</p>
<p>Plans to implement the full audio-visual 
recording of appellate court proceedings in 
death penalty cases were announced. In 
2007, the SPC resumed review of death 
penalty sentences as of Jan 2007. Semi-
official accounts estimated a drop in the 
number of executions by 30% in 2007 
compared to 2006 as a result of a 
reduction in death sentences passed by 
lower courts and an average of approx. 
15% of overturned death sentences by the 
SPC. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> China 
continues to refuse to release national 
statistics on the application of the death 
penalty classifying such information as 
&#8220;state secrets&#8221;. It is estimated that there 
have been more than 5,000 executions in 
2008. Other observers estimate that death 
sentences were reduced by half since the 
review was returned to the SPC. In the 
lack of public statistics, it is impossible to 
verify the accuracy of such numbers. The 
appeal process in death penalty cases 
remains closed to outside observers.  
</i></p>
<p>r) The scope of the death 
penalty should be reduced, 
e.g. by abolishing it for 
economic and non-violent 
crimes. 
</p>
<p>Chinese law provided for the 
death penalty in relation to a 
wide range of offences that did 
not reach the international 
standard of &#8220;most serious 
crimes&#8221;; among the more than 
60 capital offences, there were 
many economic and other non-
violent crimes. 
</p>
<p>The SPC was reportedly working on a 
judicial interpretation of &#8220;the most serious 
and vile&#8221; crimes, for which the death 
penalty should be applied exclusively. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> The number

human rights lawyers has increased (see

political prisoners face discrimination in 
the sentence reduction and parole process. 
While a 1997 notice by the SPC prescribes 
to handle their cases &#8220;strictly&#8221;, notices 
issued by municipal and provincial high 
courts have shown to prohibit parole for 
ESS prisoners. According to an analysis of 
Government information released in its 
human rights dialogues, the rate of 
sentence reduction for ESS prisoners is 
roughly 50 percent lower than for other 
prisoners.

the CL, should be released.

<p>Despite the revision of the CL in 
1997, political dissidents 
sentenced before 1997 
continued to serve long prison 
sentences for &#8220;hooliganism&#8221; and 
other non-violent offences After 
the 1997 changes, political 
dissidents, journalists, writers, 
lawyers, human rights 
defenders, Falun gong 
practitioners and members of 
the Tibetan and Uighur ethnic, 
linguistic and religious 
minorities continued to be 
prosecuted for peacefully 
exercising their human rights on

rights defenders, accused of 
politically deviant and dissident

</p>
<p><i>discussions on RTL in the National 
People&#8217;s Congress have not yielded 
official results. However, the available 
statistical data suggest that the use of RTL

drug-related offenders to &#8220;coercive 
quarantine for drug rehabilitation 
(CQDR)&#8221;, a new form of administrative 
detention for drug addicts initiated under 
the new Drug Prohibition Law (effective 1

raised.

administrative regulations and 
decisions without judicial 
control over the deprivation of

<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Punitive 
administrative detention and RTL continue

taken with regard to the implementation of his recommendation. On 18 November 2009, 
the Government responded with a detailed report to his request. The Special Rapporteur 
thanks the Danish Government for providing him with very relevant information for this 
report.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that several positive projects were 
undertaken by Denmark during the reporting period, showing the concern of the State on 
issues such as trafficking and domestic violence. Although no new legislation concerning 
solitary confinement was drafted, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the 
practice has been decreasing in the recent year and encourages Denmark to continue 
pursuing its efforts. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur takes note that the Danish Government will develop changes 
to the Danish Aliens Act in 2010 and looks forward to receiving an update on this. On the 
issue of diplomatic assurances, the Special Rapporteur expresses some concern and 
requests Denmark to treat the issue with the greatest caution. 
</p>
<p>25. Despite the difficulty in establishing a responsibility of the Danish Government 
regarding the rendition flights of the CIA, the Special Rapporteur appreciates the efforts of 
the State to clarify the situation, actively condemn such illegal practices and seek further 
guarantees from the United States in this regard. </p>

crime of torture in the 
criminal law; 
</p>
<p>Section 157 (a) of the Criminal 
Code referred to torture as 
aggravating circumstance in 
relation to existing crimes and 
increased the maximum 
penalties for such acts. 
</p>
<p> <b>Government:</b> the Committee on Criminal 
Law (<i>Straffelovr&#229;det</i>) has thoroughly 
assessed the need for the adoption of a 
specific provision on the crime of torture 
in Danish criminal law. The committee did 
not recommend this mainly due to the fact 
that all acts considered to be covered by 
the definition of torture in Art. 1 CAT is 
already covered by existing provisions of 
Danish criminal law.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>The Danish Government is still of the 
opinion that the current legislation &#8211; 
including the specific provision in Section 
157 (a) of the Danish Criminal Code to 
make torture an aggravating circumstance 
in the determination of a penalty for a 
violation of the Criminal Code &#8211; is a 
sufficient and adequate response to the 
need to criminalize the crime of torture.

</p>
<p>Rehabilitation of other victims of human 
trafficking 
</p>
<p>The national action plan to combat 
trafficking includes all victims of 
trafficking. Trafficking in areas other than 
for sexual exploitation is being monitored 
by the Danish Centre for Human 
Trafficking and discussed on a regular 
basis in various coordination meetings 
both at ministerial level and at practical 
level with NGOs and law enforcement. So 
far there have not been any cases of 
victims of trafficking other than for sexual 
exploitation.  
</p>
<p>Special attention is given to children who 
are potentially trafficked for different 
kinds of exploitation. A screening is being 
carried out among unaccompanied minors 
and mechanisms are put in place if a child 
is found to be victim of trafficking.  
</p>
<p>Trafficking for labour exploitation is an 
area of special attention for the Centre for 
Human Trafficking in 2009 and 2010. 
Different research projects are carried out 
or are planned to be carried out in this 
area. Current findings show that in relation 
to the Danish Au Pair-agreement it cannot 
be concluded that trafficking of human 
beings is taking place5. There are </p>

<p> <b>Government: </b>Special attention will be 
paid to the placement of female inmates in 
connection with the establishment of the 
new institution in Nuuk, which is planned 
to open in 2013.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>According to the Chief Governor of 
Institutions in Greenland, no cases of 
violence or sexual abuse of women have 
been registered in the existing institution 
in Nuuk even though close relationships 
are sometimes formed between female and 
male inmates. In addition, nothing 
indicates that the women form 
relationships with male inmates for 
protection purposes. 
</p>
<p>With reference to the renewed request for 
information from the Rapporteur, the Chief 
Governor confirmed that the staff will 
continue their awareness of the female 
inmates and of the need to intervene if 
there are any signs of imbalance in the 
relationship or problems between male and 
female inmates.

<p>(g) Ensure that investigations 
into alleged CIA rendition 
flights using Danish and 
Greenlandic airports are 
carried out in an inclusive 
and transparent manner; 
</p>
<p>A Danish documentary 
broadcast on 30 January 2008 
alleged that Danish and

United States of America

these allegations.

by the Inter-ministerial Working Group, 
was released the 23 October 2008:

<p>Neither the existing information on 
extraordinary rendition flights, nor the

America to questions from Denmark have 
made it possible for the Working Group or

authoritatively determine whether or not 
CIA flights have occurred in Danish, 
Greenlandic or Faroese airspace or not. 
Further it can&#8217;t be verified or substantiated 
if the claim that Danish, Greenlandic and 
Faroese authorities should have had or 
actually did have knowledge of alleged 
extra-judicial CIA activities. 
Consequently, there is no basis to conclude

<p>In connection with the publication of the 
report on Secret CIA-flights in Denmark,

endorsed the recommendations made by

<p>In accordance with the recommendations, 
the Danish Government informed the US 
Government of the Danish position and 
law in relation to renditions, through a note 
verbale dated 27 October 2008. In the 
note, the Danish Government strongly 
condemned the use of extraordinary 
renditions defined as transport of 
individuals which takes place outside the 
scope of national and international law.

that such renditions constitute a violation 
of the fundamental human rights of the 
detained individuals and cannot be

October a future guarantee from the US 
Government underlining that no rendition 
will take place through the airspace or 
territory of the Kingdom of Denmark by or 
on behalf of any US authorities without the 
prior explicit permission of Danish 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>In relation to the implementation of the 
recommendations regarding the use of all 
possible control measures in relation to 
flights under specific suspicion and 
notification of the relevant authorities to 
ensure that the situation is immediately 
addressed, the Danish, Greenlandic and 
Faroese authorities continue to be alert. 
</p>
<p>The Danish Government will actively 
engage in discussions at regional level and, 
where necessary, at international level on 
the question of a common definition of 
civilian state aircrafts and the question 
whether the existing rules on supervision 
with foreign intelligences, supervision of 
flights and immunity provide an adequate 
protection against violation of the human 
rights.

<p>All rejected Iraqi asylum seekers in 
Denmark have had their cases thoroughly 
reviewed by the refugee authorities based 
on a factual and individual assessment of 
all relevant information pertaining to the 
case. The Refugee Appeals Board shall 
stay updated and informed about the 
general situation in the countries from 
which Denmark receives asylum-seekers, 
and the board has an extensive collection 
of background information which includes 
&#8211; but is not limited to &#8211; recommendations 
and guidelines from the UNHCR. 
</p>
<p>Iraqi asylum-seekers who have had their 
cases reviewed by the refugee authorities 
also have the opportunity to apply for a 
residence permit on humanitarian grounds. 
According to the Danish Aliens Act, 
Section 9 b, subsection 1, a residence 
permit on humanitarian grounds can be 
granted to a foreign national who is 
registered by the Immigration Service as 
an asylum seeker in Denmark. The 
applicant must be in such a situation that 
significant humanitarian considerations 
warrant a residence permit. The Danish 
Parliament has decided that humanitarian 
residence permits should be the exception, 
not the rule. 
</p>
<p>Applications for a residence permit on 
humanitarian grounds are considered by 
the Ministry of Refugee, Immigration and 
Integration Affairs. The Ministry conducts 
a factual assessment of each individual 
application. In making this individual 
assessment, the Ministry places </p>

<p>importance on the applicant&#8217;s personal 
situation. According to the Ministry&#8217;s 
practice, a humanitarian residence permit 
may be granted to persons who suffer from 
a physical or a mental illness of a very 
serious nature, for example life-threatening 
diseases and incurable mental disorders, 
who cannot receive the necessary medical 
treatment in their home country, as well as 
persons who, upon return to a home 
country with difficult living conditions, 
will be at risk of developing or 
experiencing a worsening of a severe 
disability.  
</p>
<p>According to the practice of the Ministry, 
there is a possibility of granting a 
residence permit on humanitarian grounds 
based on the applicant&#8217;s long stay in 
Denmark.  
</p>
<p>Section 9 b, subsection 1, of the Danish 
Aliens Act does not allow for granting 
humanitarian residence permits to groups 
of persons, since it is prescribed in the 
preparatory works that a humanitarian 
residence permit can only be granted on 
the basis of a concrete assessment of a 
case. 
</p>
<p>The Ministry&#8217;s ruling regarding a 
humanitarian residence permit is final and 
cannot be appealed. If an asylum seeker 
receives a final rejection, he/she must 
leave Denmark immediately, but will be 
granted adequate time to prepare for 
departure. In this connection, authorities 
will show due consideration to a rejected 
asylum seeker who is suffering from acute 
illness, is in an advanced stage of 
pregnancy, or has given birth shortly </p>

seeker refuses to leave Denmark 
voluntarily, it is the responsibility of the 
police to ensure his/her departure. 
</p>
<p>In general asylum seekers are at any time 
during the asylum procedure offered 
treatment for acute illness and &#8220;necessary, 
urgent and pain-relieving&#8221; medical 
treatment. Newly arrived asylum seekers 
are offered an appointment with a Danish 
Red Cross nurse at the reception centre or 
may be taken to see a doctor, particularly 
if there is reason to believe that the asylum 
seeker has been tortured. Asylum seekers 
who have been subjected to torture receive 
consultations with a psychologist or 
psychiatrist and receive physiotherapy. 
Treatment is initiated in the health clinics 
at the asylum centres, and carried out by 
nurses and medical specialists in general 
medicine. Asylum seekers can also be 
referred to other medical specialists and 
hospitals, if the doctor thinks it is 
necessary. In some cases the Danish 
Immigration Service has to approve the 
treatment.

the Greenland Home Rule 
Government, that it develop

measures taken with regard to the implementation of his recommendations. He expresses 
his gratitude to the Government for providing comprehensive information by letter dated 4

<p>27. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the continuing work on the implementation of the 
Anti-torture Plan and the revised Criminal Justice Reform Strategy, which has been 
expanded to cover important additional areas such as juvenile justice. The Special 
Rapporteur is looking forward to receiving the implementation report prepared by the

elaboration of the draft Code on Imprisonment which incorporates important new 
developments in the fight against torture and other ill-treatment.

treatment.

Strategy and a corresponding Action Plan, which cover an improved food supply and health 
care as well as education programmes. However, more concentrated efforts need to be 
made to effectively tackle the persistent overcrowding in a number of penitentiary facilities.

Georgia signed Decree No. 591 creating 
the Criminal Justice Reform Inter-Agency 
Coordinating Council. Its main objectives 
are: 
</p>
<p>To elaborate relevant recommendations 
regarding the Criminal Justice Reform in 
line with the principles of the rule of law 
and the protection of human rights; 
</p>
<p>To review and periodically revise the 
existing Criminal Justice Reform Strategy; 
</p>
<p>To coordinate intergovernmental activities 
in the elaboration of the Criminal Justice 
Reform Strategy; and 
</p>
<p>To elaborate proposals and 
recommendations regarding issues related 
to penal reform, probation, juvenile justice 
and legal aid. 
</p>
<p>The members of the Council are high level 
governmental representatives (deputy 
ministers and heads of relevant services); 
members of the Judiciary, and the Public 
Defender of Georgia. Membership is open 
to representatives of international 
organizations and non-governmental 
organizations, as well as to criminal justice 
system experts.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> The Strategy 
of Criminal Justice System Reform was 
approved by the Parliament and the 
Government. The Government elaborated 
and approved the Action Plan for the 
Implementation of the Criminal Justice 
Reforms but most goals set by the strategy 
paper have not been achieved.

<p><b>Government:</b> Regarding the Anti-torture 
Action Plan, two Working Groups have 
been established: one related to public 
awareness measures and a second one for 
the preparation of the new Action Plan 
envisaged for the next 2-3 years.  
</p>
<p>The revised Criminal Justice Reform 
Strategy incorporates a specific chapter on 
juvenile justice and on probation. The 
Criminal Justice Reform Inter-Agency 
Council (&#8216;the Council&#8217;) has created four 
Working Groups (juvenile justice, penal 
system reform, probation and legal aid) 
which are to elaborate recommendations 
and conduct field studies in order to adapt 
the Strategy and the Action Plan of the 
Criminal Justice Reform.  
</p>
<p>The Council has entrusted its secretariat to 
monitor the implementation of the Strategy 
and the related Action Plans on a 
permanent basis. The respective reports 
prepared by the Secretariat will be publicly 
available.

<p><b>  Follow-up of the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on Torture (Manfred 
Nowak) pursuant his visit to Indonesia from 10 to 23 November 2007 
(A/HRC/7/3/Add.7) 
</b></p>
<p>32. On 23 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government 
of Indonesia requesting information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with 
regard to the implementation of his recommendations. The Special Rapporteur regrets that 
the Government has not provided any input. He looks forward to receiving information on 
Indonesia&#8217;s efforts to follow up to his recommendations and he reaffirms that he stands 
ready to assist in efforts to prevent and combat torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>33. While recognizing the overall commitment by the Government of Indonesia to 
uphold and promote human rights, the Special Rapporteur regrets that, according to non-
governmental sources the Indonesian legal framework still lacks an adequate definition, 
prohibition, and punishment of torture. The Special Rapporteur positively notes the 
existence of several internal and external mechanisms to monitor police work and is 
encouraged by the Memorandum of Understanding between the police and Komnas HAM 
(National Human Rights Commission). Unfortunately, these mechanisms fall short of the 
required independence and authority to initiate processes which effectively lead to the 
establishment of accountability. The lack of independent and effective monitoring 
mechanisms, including the possibility to conduct unannounced visits and confidential 
interviews with detainees, as well as accessible complaints mechanisms continues to 
contribute to impunity and an environment conducive to the perpetration of torture. The 
Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned by numerous allegations of excessive use of 
force applied as part of indiscriminate village &#8220;sweeping&#8221; operations in Papua.  
</p>
<p>34. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the recent 
adoption of the new Islamic Criminal Legal Code in Aceh which provides for punishments 
such as stoning and caning, and is in clear contravention of the prohibition of torture and 
cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and the obligation to prevent and prohibit corporal 
punishment.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue its efforts to 
improve the conditions of detention, in particular to tackle overcrowding, and to ensure the 
separation of minors and adults, men and women, and pre-trial detainees and convicts. 
Measures to fight corruption - which is deeply ingrained in the criminal justice system - 
shall be rigorously implemented and enforced as a matter of priority. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned by information received indicating that 
pending legislation may undermine the effectiveness of the Anti-Corruption Commission. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur recalls his appeal to the Government to bring the maximum 
time limit for police custody (61 days) in line with international standards (48 hours), to 
ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty can effectively challenge the lawfulness of 
their detention before courts, to guarantee the inadmissibility of evidence obtained under 
torture, and to raise the criminal responsibility of minors (currently 8 years). The Special 
Rapporteur further urges the Government to abolish the death penalty and end all secrecy 
surrounding its execution. 
</p>
<p>37. Finally, the Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate his appeal to the Government to 
make a declaration under article 22 CAT providing the UN Committee against Torture with 
the competence to receive and consider individual complaints, and furthermore to become 
party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT) providing for a 
national preventive mechanism. </p>

</b></p>
<p>73. Torture should be defined and criminalized 
as a matter of priority and as a concrete 
demonstration of Indonesia&#8217;s commitment to 
combat the problem, in accordance with 
articles 1 and 4 of the Convention against 
Torture, with penalties commensurate with the 
gravity of torture. 
</p>
<p>Indonesia&#8217;s domestic legal norms did not 
contain a definition of torture which was in 
line with the Convention of Torture; 
</p>
<p>Indonesia&#8217;s Criminal Code referred only to 
&#8220;maltreatment&#8221;, which lacked several elements 
of the torture definition, such as the elements 
of purpose, mental pain or suffering, and 
agency. Draft bills to rectify these 
shortcomings had been considered for several 
years without being adopted; 
</p>
<p>The Criminal Code outlawing<i> inter alia </i>the 
extraction of a confession stipulated a 
maximum imprisonment of only four years; 
</p>
<p>Law 39/1999 on Human Rights referred to the 
prohibition of torture, however lacks an 
effective mechanism for dealing with 
individual complaints since it was restricted to 
cases perpetrated as part of &#8220;a broad and 
systematic attack against civilians&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> There is no legal provision 
containing a definition and prohibition of torture in line 
with the United Nations Convention against Torture 
(UNCAT). The draft bill to rectify these shortcomings is 
still pending. Similarly, no amendments have been made 
with regard to introducing penalties which would be 
commensurate to the gravity of the crime. Komnas HAM 
(the National Human Rights Commission) can take up 
individual complaints; however, it is only mandated to 
formulate recommendations. </i> 
</p>
<p>74. The declaration should be made with 
respect to article 22 of the Convention 
recognizing the competence of the Committee 
against Torture to receive and consider 
communications from individuals who claim 
to be victims of a violation of the provisions of 
the Convention. 
</p>
<p>Indonesia had not made a declaration under 
article 22 UNCAT. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  <i>No declaration has been 
made under article 22.  
</i></p>
<p>75. The Government should ensure that 
corporal punishment, independently of the 
physical suffering it causes, is explicitly 
</p>
<p>Sharia law, incorporated into the 2005 Aceh 
Criminal Code, provided for flogging and 
affected disproportionally women;

Aceh Legislative Council adopted a new Islamic 
Criminal Legal Code which imposes severe sentences 
for consensual extra-marital sexual relations, rape, </i></p>

<p>criminalized in all parts of the country. Corporal punishment was regularly applied in 
several prisons and openly acknowledged by 
prison officials; 
</p>
<p>Despite a prohibition of corporal punishment 
of children, minors and children were at high 
risk of corporal punishment in their families, 
schools, and in detention.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>homosexuality, alcohol consumption and gambling. 
Among other sanctions, the Code imposes the 
punishment of stoning to death for adultery for those 
who are married; 100 cane lashes for adultery 
committed by those individuals who are unmarried; 
caning for individuals engaging in sexual activities out 
of wedlock; although the law is applicable to the 
population as a whole, in practice women are far more 
likely to become victims of stoning due to patriarchal 
and discriminatory practices and policies, as well as 
biological differences such as pregnancy.  
</i></p>
<p>76. Officials at the highest level should 
condemn torture and announce a zero-
tolerance policy vis-&#224;-vis any ill-treatment by 
State officials. The Government should adopt 
an anti-torture action plan which foresees 
awareness-raising programmes and training 
for all stakeholders, including the National 
Human Rights Commission and civil society 
representatives, in order to lead them to live 
up to their human rights obligations and fulfil 
their specific task in the fight against torture. 
</p>
<p><b> <i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> To raise the awareness of 
human rights, the Chief of the Indonesian Police issued 
regulation nr. 8/ 2009 concerning the principles of 
implementation and standards of human rights for the 
police when on duty. 
</i></p>
<p>77. All allegations of torture and ill-treatment 
should be promptly and thoroughly 
investigated ex-officio by an independent 
authority with no connection to the authority 
investigating or prosecuting the case against 
the alleged victim. 
</p>
<p>There was a lack of adequate mechanisms to 
investigate allegations of torture and quasi-
total impunity for security personnel, 
especially of the police and military, for 
current as well as past violations;  
</p>
<p>Investigating authorities were mostly 
institutionally linked to suspected perpetrators, 
and therefore not independent.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> There is still widespread 
impunity for members of the security forces responsible 
for serious violations of human rights, including torture, 
particularly with regard to atrocities committed in East 
Timor, Papua, Aceh, the Malukus and Kalimantan. A 
number of internal and external mechanisms now exist 
in Indonesia to monitor police work, but none of these 
institutions has the mandate, independence and 
authority to hold police officers accountable for human 
rights violations. An independent public complaints 
board that would guarantee that police officials who 
violate human rights are brought to justice and victims 
receive reparations is still lacking. The National Human 
Rights Commission (Komnas Ham) can investigate 
allegations of torture as an independent institution and 
has the authority to conduct monitoring or inquiries into </i></p>

recommendations. </i> 
</p>
<p>78. As a matter of urgent priority, the period 
of police custody should be reduced to a time 
limit in line with international standards 
(maximum of 48 hours); after this period the 
detainees should be transferred to a pre-trial 
facility under a different authority, where no 
further unsupervised contact with the 
interrogators or investigators should be 
permitted. 
</p>
<p>While the Criminal Procedure Code authorized 
a maximum length of 61 days only in very 
specific circumstances, the imposition of such 
a long period was applied as a standard 
procedure;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>Detainees remained under exclusive police 
authority for a period exceeding many times 
the maximum period permitted under 
international law, making abuses more likely, 
and furthermore rendering the detection of 
torture significantly more difficult since visible 
traces were likely to have disappeared once the 
detainee had been released or transferred.<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>79. All detainees should be effectively 
guaranteed the ability to challenge the 
lawfulness of the detention before an 
independent court, e.g. through habeas corpus 
proceedings. 
</p>
<p>Whereas the Criminal Procedure Code 
contains a provision allowing to challenge the 
validity of detention, the Special Rapporteur 
has received numerous indications that this 
procedure is not used in practice;  
</p>
<p> Women held in Social Welfare Centres have 
no access to judicial review of their detention. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>80. Judges and prosecutors should routinely 
ask persons arriving from police custody how 
they have been treated, and if they suspect that 
they have been subjected to ill-treatment, 
order an independent medical examination in 
accordance with the Istanbul Protocol, even in 
the absence of a formal complaint from the 
defendant. 
</p>
<p>Judges and prosecutors did not routinely 
enquire whether persons had been ill-treated 
during police custody or initiated any ex-
officio investigations; 
</p>
<p>Reports about non-action of judges, 
prosecutors and other members of the judiciary

<p>81. The maintenance of custody registers 
should be scrupulously ensured. 
</p>
<p>Registers were either inexistent or lacked the 
most important information; 
</p>
<p>Not all persons were registered;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>Insufficient registers blurred accountability 
and rendered external scrutiny more difficult. 
Cases of torture were more easily hidden.<b> 
</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>82. Confessions made by persons in custody 
without the presence of a lawyer and which 
are not confirmed before a judge shall not be 
admissible as evidence against the persons 
who made the confession. Serious 
consideration should be given to video and 
audio taping of interrogations, including of all 
persons present. 
</p>
<p>Many allegations of confessions under torture, 
which were admissible during court 
proceedings, were received. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>83. Accessible and effective complaints 
mechanisms should be established. These 
should be accessible from all over the country 
and from all places of detention; complaints 
by detainees should be followed up by 
independent and thorough investigations, and 
complainants must be protected against any 
reprisals. The agencies in charge of 
conducting investigations, inter alia Probam, 
should receive targeted training. 
</p>
<p>No effective and independent complaints 
mechanism; 
</p>
<p>Torture survivors had no possibility to address 
their complaints anywhere.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Although there are a 
number of internal and external mechanisms monitoring 
police work, none of these institutions has the mandate, 
independence and authority to hold police officers 
accountable for human rights violations. There is no 
independent public complaints board that would 
guarantee that police officials who violate human rights 
are brought to justice and victims receive reparations. 
However, torture survivors have the possibility to 
address their complaints to Komnas HAM and its 
regional representatives, which may open inquiries and 
make recommendations. The Indonesian Police follow 
up on Komnas HAM&#8217;s recommendations.  
</i></p>
<p>84. The Government of Indonesia should 
expediently accede to the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention against Torture, and establish 
a truly independent National Preventive 
</p>
<p>Mechanism (NPM) to carry out unannounced 
visits to all places of detention.

strengthening the implementation of its tasks, Komnas 
HAM has been developing amendments to the Laws on 
Human Rights (39/1999) and Human Rights Courts (No. 
26/2000).  
</i></p>
<p><b>Excessive violence</b> <b>  
</b></p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur recalls that 
excessive violence during military and police 
actions can amount to cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment. The Government of 
Indonesia should take all steps necessary to 
stop the use of excessive violence during 
police and military operations, above all in 
conflict areas such as Papua and Central 
Sulawesi. 
</p>
<p>There were consistent allegations about the use 
of excessive force by security forces, who 
routinely engaged in largely indiscriminate 
village &#8220;sweeping&#8221; operations in search of 
alleged independence activists and their 
supporters, or raids on university boarding 
houses, using excessive force.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Army, police and 
particularly mobile paramilitary units (Brimob) conduct 
largely indiscriminate village &#8220;sweeping&#8221; operations in 
the Central Highlands of Papua, often using excessive, 
sometimes lethal force against civilians. Soldiers 
routinely arrest Papuans without legal authority, 
transfer them to military barracks and ill-treat them. 
Prison guards continue to torture inmates inside 
Abepura prison. 
</i></p>
<p><b>Conditions of detention   
</b></p>
<p>87. The Government of Indonesia should 
continue efforts to improve detention 
conditions, in particular with a view to 
providing health care, treat rather than punish 
persons with mental disabilities, and improve 
the quantity and quality of food. The 
Government, in all detention contexts, should 
ensure the separation of minors from adults 
and of pre-trial prisoners from convicts and 
train and deploy female personnel to women&#8217;s 
sections of prisons and custody facilities. 
</p>
<p>Conditions of detention varied considerably 
throughout the country, facilities in urban areas 
were overcrowded, while prisons outside of 
Java offered enough space; 
</p>
<p>Overcrowded facilities, e.g. Chipinang prison, 
were confronted with sanitary and health 
difficulties, corruption, and inter-prisoner 
violence; 
</p>
<p>Numerous complaints about the quality of food 
were voiced;  
</p>
<p>Punishment cells as well as new arrival areas 
were not in line with international standards;  
</p>
<p>Persons with mental disabilities were often

<p>held in punishment cells; 
</p>
<p>Convicted and pre-trial detainees were not 
separated in many facilities. 
</p>
<p>88. The Government of Indonesia should 
ensure that the criminal justice system is non-
discriminatory at every stage, combat 
corruption, which disproportionately affects 
the poor, the vulnerable and minorities, and 
take effective measures against corruption by 
public officials responsible for the 
administration of justice, including judges, 
prosecutors, police and prison personnel. 
</p>
<p>Corruption was deeply ingrained in the 
criminal justice system, leading to 
discrimination in terms of conditions, notably 
access to food, sanitary facilities, health care 
and the possibility to receive visitors; 
</p>
<p>Corruption also impacted the treatment of 
prisoners, some having alleged to have paid in 
order not to be subjected to beatings. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Efforts to combat 
corruption run the risk of being without actual impact. 
Current pending legislation undermines the 
effectiveness and even very existence of the Anti-
Corruption Commission, e.g. by limiting its mandate to 
investigative functions and reducing the number of ad-
hoc judges to sit on trial panels. 
</i></p>
<p><b>Death penalty</b>   
</p>
<p>89. The death penalty should be abolished. 
While it is still applied, the secrecy 
surrounding the death penalty and executions 
should stop immediately. 
</p>
<p>The death sentences were executed. <b><i>Non-governmental sources: </i></b><i>The death penalty 
continues to be imposed and executed. According to 
available information, ten persons have been executed 
in 2008. 
</i></p>
<p><i>The October 2009 Islamic Criminal Legal Code in Aceh 
stipulates stoning to death for adultery for those who 
are married.  
</i></p>
<p><i>In September 2009, the Government agreed to adopt a 
bill providing the death penalty as possible punishment 
for leaking state secrets. 
</i></p>
<p><b>Children</b>   
</p>
<p>90. The age of criminal responsibility should 
be raised as a matter of priority. Through 
further reform of the juvenile justice system, 
Indonesia should take immediate measures to 
ensure that deprivation of liberty of minors is 
used only as a last resort and for the shortest 
possible period of time and in appropriate 
conditions. Children in detention should be 
strictly separated from adults. 
</p>
<p>Criminal responsibility started in Indonesia at 
the age of 8;  
</p>
<p>Small children were put in detention facilities 
and prisons, very often mixed with much older 
children and adults.

Violence against Women, the Government 
should establish effective mechanisms to 
enforce the prohibition of violence against 
women, including in the family and wider 
community, above all through further 
awareness-raising within the law-enforcement 
organs. 
</p>
<p>The 2004 law banning violence in household 
and establishing complaints channels was 
adopted; 
</p>
<p>The lack of awareness among law enforcement 
agencies and the public, and an insufficient 
number of appropriate police units to deal with 
such complaints hamper the implementation of 
the law.

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Recommendation to the international 
community</b> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur requests the 
international community to support the efforts 
of Indonesia in reforming its criminal law 
system. In particular, all measures to establish 
well-resourced and independent national 
preventive mechanisms in compliance with 
international standards that cover the entire 
territory of Indonesia should be treated as a 
priority and supported with generous financial 
assistance.

<p>38. By letter dated 23 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent the following report to 
the Government of Jordan, requesting information and comments on the follow-up 
measures taken with regard to the implementation of his recommendations. The Special 
Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not provided him with a response to his 
request. He looks forward to receiving information on its endeavours to implement his 
recommendations and he reaffirms that he stands ready to assist Jordan in its efforts to 
prevent and combat torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur particularly regrets that he was not provided with official 
statistical data on prosecutions of torture perpetrators under the amended article 208 of the 
Penal Code or on compensation rewarded to victims of torture. According to non-
governmental sources, nobody has been prosecuted under article 208 to date. 
</p>
<p>40. He is equally concerned about indications by non-governmental sources that no 
developments have taken place with regard to his recommendations on the introduction of 
legal safeguards against torture and ill-treatment, such as habeas corpus procedures, routine 
questions by judges to detainees about their treatment, or non-admissibility of confessions 
of persons in custody without the presence of a lawyer. Yet another area of concern is the 
non-governmental information that women and girls are still placed in protective custody. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged that the role of the National Centre for 
Human Rights in receiving complaints is strengthened by a Memorandum of Understanding 
(MoU) with the Public Security Directorate (PSD). He equally welcomes the initial steps 
taken by the PSD to sign a MoU with the Bar Association regarding attendance of lawyers 
during interrogations and appeals to the Government to amend the law in this respect. The 
consideration of amendments to the law, which would introduce alternative sentences, is 
another positive step. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the information provided by non-
governmental sources that pre-trial and convicted prisoners are now separated, after the 
inauguration of two new prisons. 
</p>
<p>42. Regarding the statement of the Government during the UPR process that the Special 
Rapporteur had withdrawn his findings on torture in Jordan,9 he wishes to clarify that he 
never renounced the conclusions of his report. 
</p>
<p>43. Finally, the Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate his recommendation to the 
Government of Jordan to consider the ratification of the OPCAT and the establishment of a 
National Preventive Mechanism.

<p>(b) The highest authorities, particularly 
those responsible for law enforcement 
activities, declare unambiguously that 
the culture of impunity must end and 
that torture and ill-treatment by public 
officials will not be tolerated and will 
be prosecuted. The message should be 
spread that torture is an extremely 
serious crime which will be punished 
with severe (long-term) prison 
sentences 
</p>
<p>There was implicit societal tolerance for 
a degree of violence against alleged 
criminal suspects and convicts.  
</p>
<p>Though unspoken, many were aware 
that abuse of suspects and detainees 
occurs and resigned that little could be 
done about it.  
</p>
<p>There was little public discussion about 
the situation of torture. 
</p>
<p>HE King Abdullah and the 
director of the PSD, Lt. Gen 
Muhammad Mahmud al-&#8216;Aitan 
issued clear instructions that 
there was to be no torture.  
</p>
<p>The General Intelligence 
Directorate (GID) issued written 
and oral instructions addressed 
to all personnel to refrain from 
abusing any detainee physically, 
verbally or emotionally; the 
instructions provided for an 
increase in penalties for 
violations. <b>

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources: </i></b><i>The 
NCHR has urged the PSD to 
issue instructions for the 
prevention of torture. </i> 
</p>
<p>(c) The crime of torture be defined as a 
matter of priority in accordance with 
Article 1 of the Convention against 
Torture (CAT), with penalties 
commensurate with the gravity of 
torture 
</p>
<p>Torture was criminalized in accordance 
with Article 208 of the Penal Code; 
however, the definition was not 
consistent with Article 1 of the 
Convention against Torture.  
</p>
<p>Penal Code Article 208 was 
amended by temporary law No. 
49 of 2007, to incorporate the 
definition of torture and increase 
the minimum prison sentence of 
three months to six months 
while restricting alternative and 
discretionary sentencing. Courts 
were expressly prohibited from 
taking into account mitigating 
circumstances and from 
imposing suspended sentences.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> 
Nobody has been prosecuted 
under the amended article to 
date.

<p><i>The crime of torture is still 
defined as a &#8220;misdemeanour&#8221;

<p>(d) The special court system within the 
security services &#8211; above all, police and 
intelligence courts &#8211; be abolished, and 
their jurisdiction be transferred to the 
ordinary independent public prosecutors 
and criminal courts 
</p>
<p>The special court system did not work 
effectively. The presumption of 
innocence was illusory, primacy was 
placed on obtaining confessions, public 
officials essentially demonstrated no 
sense of duty, and assumed no 
responsibility to investigate human 
rights violations against suspected 
criminals, and the system of internal 
special courts served only to shield 
security officials from justice.

<p>e) An effective and independent 
complaints system for torture and abuse 
leading to criminal investigations be 
established 
</p>
<p>Article 107 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure (CCP), guarantees every 
prisoner the right to complain to prison 
authorities, who have to forward the 
complaint to the Public Prosecutor.  
</p>
<p>When allegations of torture against a 
member of the police were made, the 
Department of Public Prosecutions had 
to register it in an investigation report 
and refer the person to a forensic doctor. 
</p>
<p>Within the PSD a Complaints and 
Human Rights Office received 
complaints against its personnel.  
</p>
<p>A human rights directorate within the 
Ministry of Interior was mandated to 
follow up on general human rights 
issues and complaints.  
</p>
<p>The NCHR was tasked with addressing 
human rights issues through a 
monitoring mechanism and the 
examination of complaints related to 
government institutions. 
</p>
<p>The PSD established a radio 
station through which all 
complaints were directly aired 
and appropriate solutions 
sought; and installed complaints 
boxes in various prisons under 
the direct supervision of the 
PSD&#8217;s Office of Complaints and 
Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice created a 
complaints mechanism and 
allocated qualified personnel to 
handle complaints, which 
enabled the Prosecutor General 
to monitor the situation in 
prisons. The Ministry created a 
registry for complaints in the 
Attorney-General&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> 
Prisoners can complain to the 
Ministry of Interior&#8217;s PSD 
through Legal Affairs prosecutors 
who are present all the time in 
seven prisons: Muwaqqar, 
Qafqafa, Swaqa, Jweideh men, 
Jweideh women, al-&#8216;Aqaba and 
Birain. The prison-based 
prosecutors work closely with 
officials in the Complaints and 
Human Rights Office of the PSD, 
who visit the prisons every two 
weeks and empty the sealed 
complaints boxes.

<p><i>In February 2008, the NCHR was 
allowed to open an office inside 
Swaqa prison to receive 
complaints from prisoners on a

disturbances which occurred in 
the prison in April 2008. The PSD

<p>It appeared that judges and prosecutors 
did not ask detainees how they had been 
treated in police custody.

a few individual exceptions,

held in facilities under the control of 
their interrogators or investigators for 
more than the time required by law to

hours. After this period they should be 
transferred to a pre-trial facility under a 
different authority, where no further 
unsupervised contact with the 
interrogators of investigators should be 
permitted 
</p>
<p>Article 100 CCP stipulates that a police 
officer who was not satisfied with a 
testimony should send the person 
concerned to the Public Prosecutor 
within 24 hours, who in turn had to 
question him or her within 24 hours. An 
individual could bring action for 
deprivation of liberty against an official 
who kept him or her in custody for over 
24 hours without questioning. However, 
in practice persons were at times 
detained longer than 24 hours.

information on compulsory medical 
examinations upon being brought to a 
detention centre and upon transfer

<p>On paper, a file regarding each detainee 
informed about the time of arrival, state 
of health, details, reason for detention, 
authority which issued the arrest 
warrant or verdict, and all details 
relating to the person&#8217;s time at the 
centre. Upon arrival, detainees were to 
undergo a medical check-up and the 
police doctor should prepare a medical 
report, indicating whether there were 
any traces of torture. If that was the

<p>A confession could be accepted as the 
only evidence in a case if the court was 
convinced that it was made voluntarily 
and willingly (article 159 CCP). The 
Court of Cassation has overturned a 
number of convictions on the grounds 
that security officials had obtained 
confessions from defendants under 
torture. 
</p>
<p>The Court of Cassation has 
issued several rulings with 
regard to confessions made as a 
result of violence: e.g. ruling No. 
1513/2003 of 4 May 2006, 
which held that &#8220;statements 
obtained as a result of violence 
and coercion cannot be relied 
upon to convict a defendant&#8221;;

<p>Two new prisons were opened in

of Interior&#8217;s PSD, on 7 April 
2008, authorities began to 
separate pre-trial and

convicted prisoners; Qafqafa,

for convicted prisoners.

<p><b>  Follow-up of the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on Torture (Nigel 
Rodley) pursuant his visit to Kenya from 20 to 29 September 1999 
(E/CN.4/2000/9/Add.4, para. 92) 
</b></p>
<p>44. On 23 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government 
of Kenya requesting information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with 
regard to the implementation of the recommendations of his predecessor&#8217;s visit in 1999. 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not provided any input. He looks 
forward to receiving information on Kenya&#8217;s efforts to follow-up to his recommendations 
and he reaffirms that he stands ready to assist in efforts to prevent and combat torture and 
ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about the lack of accountability in the 
criminal justice sector. While welcoming Kenya&#8217;s plans to establish a Civilian Police 
Oversight Body in 2008, the Special Rapporteur regrets that no concrete steps have been 
taken. He notes with concern the lack of prompt and independent investigations against the 
perpetrators of torture and specialized procedures to lodge torture complaints. He further 
regrets that judges and magistrates continue to ignore torture complaints by defendants and 
the victims&#8217; limited access to medical examinations to document torture. Recognizing the 
important role of the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights in undertaking visits 
to places of detention, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that it lacks the necessary 
resources to fulfil its functions and regrets that it has been denied access to detention 
facilities in some cases. Equally, the judiciary falls short of visiting and inspecting prisons 
due to a lack of capacity or will. The Special Rapporteur strongly encourages the 
Government to ratify and implement the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture (OPCAT) and accept the individual complaints mechanism, in accordance with 
article 22 CAT. 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur is further worried about the unavailability of legal aid to the 
majority of persons in detention and urges the Government to proceed with the adoption of 
a legal aid scheme. He moreover regrets the lack of an enforceable right to adequate 
compensation for torture victims and the difficulties in obtaining it through civil litigation. </p>

</b></p>
<p>A major obstacle to the 
documentation and 
investigation of torture 
allegations was the absence 
of an independent body in 
charge of investigating 
alleged cases of torture by 
law enforcement officials. 
The mechanisms existing to 
investigate police abuse 
operated within the police 
hierarchy and were carried 
out by the Criminal 
Investigation Department 
(CID) under the 
responsibility of the 
officer-in-charge of a 
police station, who would 
decide on the continuation 
of investigations. 
</p>
<p>In 2008, the establishment of a Civilian Police 
Oversight Body was planned to ensure impartial 
and independent investigations against the police, 
including allegations of torture.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> There are no 
specialized procedures for lodging torture 
complaints and no authority conferred 
with the obligation to promptly and 
impartially investigate torture allegations. 
Further, no law providing access to 
immediate medical examination exists. 
Torture accusations against police officers 
are usually investigated by fellow officers. 
The Kenya National Commission on 
Human Rights (KNCHR), obliged to carry 
out investigations, is not considered the 
competent and impartial authority 
contemplated by Article 12 CAT.  
</i></p>
<p><i>Regarding the incidents at the &#8220;Nyayo 
Torture Chambers&#8221;, perpetrators of 
torture are not adequately prosecuted and 
victims not provided redress.  
</i></p>
<p><i>Regarding the military operation against 
the SLDF in the Mount Elgon District, that 
reportedly involved torture and ill-
treatment, the Government has refused to 
independently investigate the allegations 
against members of state forces or to task 
the Attorney General to commence 
proceedings. So far there was only an 
internal police investigation that was 
neither prompt nor impartial.

<p>The High Court upheld the power of the 
KNCHR, established in 2002 to replace the

issued strict instructions to prison officers to 
grant such requests. The KNCHR, carried out 
several visits to penal institutions, but was denied 
access to police stations. While it was mandated 
to carry out investigations into human rights 
violations, the KNCHR had to refer cases to the 
authorities for investigation due to lack of 
resources. </p>

<p>- According to statistics 
for the years 1998-1999 
received from the Attorney-
General in October 1999, 
134 criminal proceedings 
against law enforcement 
officials were pending 
before the courts; 
</p>
<p>- However, torture 
complaints were rarely 
fully investigated. The very 
few cases of torture brought 
to court were reportedly the 
object of civil proceedings 
only and no criminal 
proceedings against law 
enforcement officials 
appeared to be instituted in 
these cases; 
</p>
<p>- The Office of the 
Attorney General would 
respond to all complaints 
from NGOs, informing 
them that their complaint 
had been received and that 
an inquiry had been opened 
without providing follow-
up information;  
</p>
<p>Within the Governance, Justice, Law and Order 
Sector Reform Programme (GJLOS), the 
Department of Public Prosecution, including the

<p>There had only ever been 
three civil claims initiated 
against police officers 
suspected of torture, of 
which two were successful, 
although compensation was 
reportedly outstanding. 
</p>
<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> The legal 
system does not provide for an enforceable 
right to adequate compensation. The lack 
of a specific definition of torture makes it 
difficult to seek legal redress on behalf of 
torture survivors and victims. Further 
there is no legislation making torture a 
criminal offence as stipulated in Article 4 
CAT. Compensation is only recoverable 
through court action. Victims usually seek 
compensation through civil litigation that 
requires court fees and is plagued with 
delays. Very few cases have reported 
successful outcomes for torture victims and 
the compensations have been negligible. 
Furthermore, there is no public health 
scheme offering rehabilitation for torture 
victims.</i>

detention in capital cases 
(14 days) should be 
brought into line with 
the normal 24-hour

<p>- Police custody in

allowed for police 
detention of up to 14 days 
in capital cases, such as 
treason, administration of 
unlawful oaths to commit 
capital offences, murder 
and robbery with violence;

<p>Suspects were often 
convicted following the use 
of confessions extracted 
under torture with little or 
no judicial recourse, despite 
both constitutional and 
legal prohibitions on the 
use of torture and the non-
admissibility of evidence 
obtained under torture; 
</p>
<p>Section 25A of the Evidence Act was amended in 
2003 to the effect that confessions were only 
admissible if made before a court. </p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Section 25A

Association did not provide 
legal aid services.

<p>The right of lawyers to

<p>- The request for the 
issuing of a &quot;Medical 
Examination Report&quot; (P3) 
had to be made to the 
police, who reportedly 
frequently refused to issue 
the patient or even the 
doctor with the P3 form 
and therefore prevented the 
bringing of a case through 
the resulting lack of 
evidence;

a magistrate or judge 
</p>
<p>- Habeas corpus actions 
were open to the few who 
could afford a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>The 1998 Community Service Orders Act had 
been instrumental in addressing the question of 
overcrowding, and ensured that petty offenders 
no longer had to serve prison sentences. Non-

<p><b>  Follow-up of the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on Torture (Manfred 
Nowak) pursuant his visit to Mongolia in June 2005 (E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.4, para. 55) 
</b></p>
<p>47. On 23 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government 
of Mongolia requesting information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with 
regard to the implementation of his recommendations. By letter dated 19 January 2010, the 
Government responded with a detailed report to this request. The Special Rapporteur 
reaffirms that he stands ready to assist in efforts to prevent and combat torture and ill-
treatment.  
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur welcomes Mongolia&#8217;s legislative efforts to criminalize 
torture but regrets that the definition of torture is not in line with the requirements of 
articles 1 and 4 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment (CAT). He further notes with concern that the Criminal Procedure 
Code does not ensure that evidence obtained from torture is not invoked in any proceedings 
and reiterates that confessions not made in the presence of a lawyer should be inadmissible.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur urges Mongolia to undertake all efforts, including the 
amendment of laws, to combat the persisting culture of impunity in the country. 
Commending the important work of the National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia 
(NHRCM) and the Office of the Prosecution in receiving complaints and undertaking 
investigations, he underlines the need for adequate funding of those mechanisms and non-
interference in their work in order to guarantee their functioning.  
</p>
<p>50. Also welcoming the efforts of the NHRCM and NGOs in conducting visits to 
prisons, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes the importance of an independent and effective 
body systematically undertaking visits to all places of detention. For this purpose, he urges 
the Government to ratify the OPCAT and establish a National Preventive Mechanism. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur also positively notes the role of the NHRMC in conducting 
trainings for the prevention of torture among law enforcement personnel and other 
stakeholders in the criminal justice system as well as general awareness-raising campaigns, 
and encourages Mongolia to continue such efforts.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the moratorium on the death penalty and hopes 
for its abolition in law. </p>

</b>(E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.4)<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Situation during visit 
</b>(E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.4)<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Steps taken to implement the recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>(a) Highest authorities declare that 
impunity must end  
</p>
<p>Impunity existed because of a lack of a 
definition of torture as defined in the 
CAT, a lack of awareness of 
international standards, and no 
effective mechanism for receiving and 
investigating allegations.  
</p>
<p>There had not been any effective 
investigations by the procuracy, nor 
had any law enforcement officials 
been convicted for torture related 
offences. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> The culture of impunity persists.  
</i></p>
<p><b>Government</b><i>: </i>Since 2007, of 744 torture related cases, 14 were 
investigated, of which 10 cases were acquitted and 1 suspended by the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s office. Of the 3 cases brought to court, 2 were acquitted 
and one convicted.  
</p>
<p>(b) Criminalisation of torture be in 
accordance with CAT  
</p>
<p>Legislation did not include essential 
elements; torture was not defined in 
accordance with article 1 of the 
Convention.  
</p>
<p>The main provision in the Criminal 
Code referring to torture, article 100.1, 
carried a relatively lenient penalty of 
up to two years' imprisonment. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Article 251 was amended in 2008 to 
include the word &#8220;imposing torture&#8221; and the punishment was 
increased. However, the article only applies to investigators and 
inspectors, not all public officials or persons acting in an official 
capacity, as required by CAT. It also does not include provisions on 
the attempt to commit torture or complicity or participation in torture. 
Moreover, the Criminal Procedure Code does not ensure that any 
statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture 
shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a 
person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made, as 
required by the CAT. 
</i></p>
<p><i>There is concern that the draft Assorted Criminal Code of Mongolia 
currently under consideration does not include safeguards against 
impunity for human rights violations. Torture is not expressly defined 
as a crime in the draft Code in accordance with CAT. The draft code 
would also prohibit investigations and prosecutions of crimes under 
international law including torture which occurred before the 
enactment of the Code.  
</i></p>
<p><b>Government</b>: All actions and activities concerning torture are 
prohibited in the Mongolian constitution and other legislation. Article 
16.13 of the Constitution and 10.4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 
include the prohibition: &#8220;No person shall be subjected to torture or to 
inhumane, cruel or degrading treatment.&#8221; Amendments to the Civil </p>

article whereby a crime resulting in the death of a victim shall be 
punishable by a prison term of 10-15 years. Amendments to the 
Criminal Code at the same time included more detailed provisions on 
the crime of torture.  
</p>
<p>(c) Detention for up to 48 hours under 
the control of interrogators or 
investigators; transfer to a pre -trial 
facility under a different authority  
</p>
<p>Authorities responsible for detention 
and interrogation are under the 
jurisdiction of the same Ministry and 
supervise the same facilities. 
</p>
<p>Detention centres often accommodate 
a police lock-up, a pre-trial facility and 
a prison. 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b><i>: </i>No relevant amendments were made to the Criminal 
Code or Criminal Procedure Code. 
</p>
<p>(d) Custody registers be scrupulously 
maintained 
</p>
<p> <b>Government</b>: In accordance with the revisions of the &#8220;by-law of arrest 
and detention centre&#8221; of April 2007, detained persons shall be 
routinely received at arrest and detention centres in the presence of a 
policeman that took them there, and a medical examination shall be 
carried out. Transfers to other arrest and detention centres shall be 
carried out only with the authorization of a prosecutor.  
</p>
<p>According to Articles 58 and 59 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a 
person detained with an arrest order shall be received at the arrest and 
detention centre in the presence of a policeman and released by the 
order of the chief of the centre by the end of the arrest term, in the 
absence of a judge&#8217;s order regarding continued detention. In 2007, 
3,268 suspects were received in arrest and detention centres and 2,075 
persons were released. In 2008, 3,487 suspects were received in arrest 
and detention centres and 1,478 persons were released in accordance 
with appropriate legislations. A control prosecutor exercises 
supervision of these activities.  
</p>
<p>(e) Inadmissibility of confessions as 
evidence without the presence of a 
lawyer  
</p>
<p>Art. 79.4 CPC, but not implemented in 
practice. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  <i>Some detainees were tortured and told 
that if they signed a written confession and there was no evidence to 
support it, they would be proven innocent. However, these confessions 
were later used as evidence in court to convict them.</i> 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: The Government is working on providing all detained 
persons with a right to advocacy according to the Code of Criminal 
Procedure. If an investigation is conducted without the presence of a 
lawyer, the case will not be considered as evidence in court </p>

persons how they have were treated and 
order independent medical examinations 
</p>
<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  <i>According the guidelines for the 
administration of the CPC, a prosecutor shall visit a detained suspect 
or accused at least once within 10 days, shall receive information on 
his\her health condition, and shall include thee results in his report. 
</i></p>
<p><b>Government</b>: In case of any doubt over the testimony of the suspect, 
witnesses, etc., the prosecutor shall initiate an investigation to discover 
the facts of the case. No cases against public officials regarding torture 
or ill-treatment were initiated ex officio by judges or prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>(g) Prompt and thorough investigations 
by independent authority  
</p>
<p>Investigations could not be carried out 
ex officio. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  <i>A number of complaints addressed to the 
National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia (NHRCM) and the 
Office of the Prosecution were reportedly dismissed for lack of 
evidence, apparently without an investigation being carried out. The 
Special Investigation Unit, which investigates cases involving officials 
such as prosecutors, judges and law enforcement officers still lacks 
capacity and staff with sufficient experience, and has been subject to 
intimidation by police officers. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Through the revision of the CPC adopted on 9 August 2007, articles 
26 and 27 clearly defined the boundaries of investigations, which shall 
be within the competence of the Intelligence Agency, Investigation 
Authority under the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and Anti-Corruption 
Agency. The official statistical information received from the Judiciary 
states that within the last three years, there have been no such cases. 
</i></p>
<p><b>Government</b>: Since 2002, the State General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has 
supervised the investigation of allegations of torture or cruel, inhuman 
and degrading treatment by police and prosecution authority 
employees, according to Article 27.2 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure. Mongolian citizens are entitled to file petitions and claims 
to this authority and to the NHRCM. In 2007, seven criminal cases of 
forced testimony using means such as beatings and pressure were 
initiated and tried by the Criminal investigation service of the State 
General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. In 2008, only four criminal cases were 
initiated and tried.  
</p>
<p>(h) Immediate suspension from duty of 
any public official indicted for abuse or 
</p>
<p>No such cases. <b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Since 2002, only one person has been

<p>(i) Compensation and rehabilitation of 
victims  
</p>
<p>No reference to compensation for 
torture or ill-treatment in the law. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> The CPC does not contain provisions on 
the compensation of persons who have been subjected to torture. 
Therefore, the court bases its verdict on the CAT. 
</i></p>
<p><b><i>Government</i></b><i>:</i> Although there is no specific provision that provides 
compensation for torture, the Government states that it shall be 
responsible for the &#8220;removal of detriments&#8221; caused by illegal treatment 
by investigators, prosecutors and judges during criminal procedures, in 
accordance with the State Supreme Court and Articles 388-397 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure. Payments of around 500 million tugrug 
have been made to over 20 citizens and organizations, and 3.4 billion 
tugrug has been set aside in the 2009 budget for this purpose.  </p>
<p>(j) Recognize the competence of the 
CAT to receive and consider individual 
communications 
</p>
<p>Not done.  
</p>
<p>(k) The Criminal Pre-trial detention in 
custody should not be the general rule, 
particularly for nonviolent, minor or 
less serious offences; increase use of 
non-custodial measures; reduction of 
maximum period of pre-trial detention; 
pre-trial detention as a measure of last 
resort. 
</p>
<p>Pre-trial detention is generally the rule; 
the maximum period is excessive. CPC 
specifies in article 69.1 to 69.4 that the 
term of pre-trial confinement ranges 
from14 days up to 30 months.  
</p>
<p>Suspects under 18 can be detained for 
up to 18 months (art. 366.4). 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: According to an August 2007 amendment to the Code 
of Criminal Procedure, the Government is working on alternatives to 
detention, particularly for less serious cases and juveniles. Articles 
366.1 and 366.2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure limit pre-trial 
detention for juveniles to only those accused of serious and grave 
crimes or in special situations, and limits the amount of time juveniles 
can be detained to a maximum of eight months. 
</p>

</p>
<p>(l) End special isolation regime  Some categories of prisoners (those 
commuted from a death sentence) 
were held in isolation as part of the 
special isolation regime at Prison No. 
</p><p>405. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> In collaboration with the General 
Prosecutors Office prisoners were divided based on their crime and 
reiteration. Surveillance cameras were installed along with the 
possibility to listen to music and watch television. Moreover, a 
religious activity room and a gym, in which prisoners have the right 
practice any sport activity of their preference for 30 minutes, were 
opened. 
</i></p>
<p><b>Government</b>: The training and social work department of the Court 
decision execution authority was extended and organized. A program 
for the socialization of detainees in 2008-2009 was developed, and 
professional training and production centres have been established in 
some prisons. 95 detainees have begun professional qualifications.  </p>

Prisoners  
</p>
<p>Death row prisoners were handcuffed 
and shackled throughout their

adequate food. 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: 50 detainees have been sentenced, six of whom have 
had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. The detainees are 
provided with rights as stated in the Standard Minimum Rules for the

training.  
</p>
<p>(n) Moratorium on the death penalty, 
with a view to its abolition 
</p>
<p>It was estimated that 20 &#8211; 30 persons 
were executed per year; but there was 
total secrecy surrounding the death 
penalty.  
</p>
<p>Article 53 provides for the possibility 
of persons originally sentenced to 
death to have their sentences 
commuted to 30 years&#8217; imprisonment 
upon presidential pardon. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> The Assorted Criminal Code of Mongolia 
currently under consideration retains the death penalty, although 
restricts the number of crimes it can be applied to. Those convicted of 
premeditated murder or assassination of a state or public figure can 
still be sentenced to death by shooting under the draft Code. </i> 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: It is prohibited to apply the death sentence to women, 
juveniles and the elderly (over around sixty). The Great State Hural 
has committed to decrease the types of cases that can receive the death 
sentence, and to abolish it in future. A working group has been created 
to conduct research on the issue. The Government has stated that the 
death penalty is not a permanent measure, but rather a temporary 
response to the criminal situation in Mongolia. No statistical data on 
the number of death sentences carried out is available, pursuant to 
Article 1(55) of the law on Approving State Secret&#8217;s list. </p>
<p>(o) Ratification of the OPCAT and

(MJHA) has established a working group to elaborate a study on the

limited visits to prisons. </i>

<p><b>Government</b>: A working group to study the issues relating to the entry 
of Mongolia to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against

2006, with the assistance of the Canada Foundation, the NHRCM 
elaborated a human rights model program, approved by the Ministry 
of Education, for the curricula of secondary school and universities 
providing legal education. Lessons on the basics of human rights are

Nowak) in the report of his visit to Nepal in September 2005 (E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.5, 
paras. 33-35) 
</b></p>
<p>53. On 23 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent his follow-up chart to the 
Government of Nepal requesting information and comments on the follow-up measures 
taken with regard to the implementation of the recommendations made after his fact-finding 
mission in 2005. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not provided him 
with a response to his request. He looks forward to receiving information on its efforts to 
implement his recommendations and he reaffirms that he stands ready to assist Nepal in its 
efforts to prevent and combat torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the repeated commitment of the Government of 
Nepal to end impunity. However, impunity seems to still prevail for past human rights 
abuses within the police and the Nepal Army, and the Special Rapporteur notes with 
concern that no visible steps have been taken to prosecute those responsible for torture 
during the conflict. He therefore encourages the Nepal Army to cooperate better with 
judicial bodies and hold impartial investigations for past and present torture allegations. 
The Special Rapporteur also urges that the draft bill criminalizing torture be tabled before 
the Parliament. He further encourages Nepal to follow and implement the recommendations 
of the NHRC, undertake impartial investigations and provide victims with adequate 
remedies. 
</p>
<p>55. While noting with satisfaction that judges and court staff are more and more 
cooperative with torture victims, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that despite efforts of 
the Supreme Court, the habeas corpus remedy still does not function correctly. Also, the 
Special Rapporteur is concerned that the judicial process is not very functional or respected, 
since for example some suspects do not have a proper medical examination, or have to 
confess in the absence of their lawyer. In this regard, he also encourages Nepal to 
standardize its prison registers, and requests police to better respect the maximum time of 
24 hours to present a detainee before a judge. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the security forces have made 
commitments to incorporate human rights trainings as part of their normal training 
programmes. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur finally notes that Nepal continues to lack an independent 
external monitoring mechanism supervising all places of detention. In this context, he 
strongly encourages the Government to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture (OPCAT). </p>

that the culture of impunity must 
end and that torture and ill 
treatment by public officials will not 
be tolerated and will be prosecuted;</b> 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was 
repeatedly told by senior police 
and military officials that torture 
was acceptable in some 
situations. 
</p>
<p>In 2007 the Interim Constitution 
prohibiting torture was adopted. 
However, torture was not 
criminalized in domestic laws. 
</p>
<p>In August 2008, the &#8220;Common 
Minimum Programme&#8221; (CMP) was 
agreed. The 50-point programme - 
among other commitments - states 
that the culture of impunity shall end 
through consolidating law and order. 
To render the administration and 
security organs independent and 
accountable, a Code of Conduct 
shall be developed for the peoples&#8217; 
realization of security. On several 
occasions, the Home Minister has 
made statements in which he has 
promised to address the lack of 
public security and absence of the 
rule of law, and encouraged the 
police to restore law and order at the 
earliest opportunity. On 7 
September 2008, he gave 15 
instructions to the Inspector General 
of Police to do so. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Officials 
of the Government of Nepal continue 
to make pubic commitments that 
impunity must end. For instance, in 
his statement to the General Assembly 
on 26 September 2008, then Prime 
Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 
&quot;Prachanda&quot; stated that, as a 
democracy, Nepal is fully committed 
to protect and promote the human 
rights of its people under all 
circumstances with constitutional and 
legal guarantees and implementation 
of the international human rights 
instruments to which Nepal is a party. 
However, despite these commitments, 
the climate of impunity remains firmly 
entrenched, evidenced by actions such 
as the withdrawal of criminal charges 
in 349 cases and the lack of progress 
in police investigations into past 
human rights violations.

a matter of priority</b> in accordance 
with article 1 of the Convention 
against Torture, with penalties 
commensurate with the gravity of 
torture 
</p>
<p>Torture prohibited in Article 
14(4) of Constitution (1990). 
However, torture was not 
criminalized in domestic 
legislation. 
</p>
<p>In 2007 the Inter-ministerial 
consultations on the draft torture bill 
were underway. The Interim

implied that if they did not use force 
they would not be able to obtain a 
confession. It is common for 
defendants to inform courts at the 
time of committal hearings that they 
did not give statements voluntarily, 
at which point such statements are 
often ruled out as evidence. 
However, in many other cases this 
does not happen, or the victim is 
afraid to allege torture or other ill-
treatment.

<p><i>beatings and ill-treatment during 
interrogation are widespread. In 
addition, it is very common in Nepal 
for detainees to be forced to sign 
statements (whether &#8220;confessions&#8221; or 
other documents) without being able 
to read them beforehand. This is 
sometimes due to illiteracy but mainly 
because the police refuse to give 
detainees an opportunity to read their 
statement.

<p><i>Further, although the prosecution 
carries the burden of ultimately 
proving a defendant&#8217;s guilt, each 
defendant has to &#8220;persuade&#8221; the 
court of the &#8220;specific fact&#8221; that a 
statement was not freely given 
(Section 28, State Cases Act). In 
practice, this means that forced 
confessions are routinely accepted 
unless the defendant is able to 
produce some compelling evidence 
demonstrating that coercion or 
torture took place. In other words, 
Nepali law reverses the burden of 
proof and expects detainees to prove 
that they were in fact tortured. In 
addition, the law is not clear as to the 
exact procedure to be used by courts 
in order to establish whether or not a 
confession was extracted under 
torture.

complaints of torture and other ill-

have developed the practice of 
asking male detainees to remove 
their shirts and questioning them 
about their treatment at the hands of 
the police, such practice has not 
become uniform and in any case is 
inadequate to detect whether torture 
or other ill-treatment has been 
committed, particularly with regard 
to methods which do not leave 
physical marks, including 
psychological torture or ill-
treatment. Judges do not 
systematically test the voluntary 
nature of a confession and many 
confessions extracted under duress 
are still admitted as evidence. This 
is exacerbated in cases in which the 
victim fears telling the court about 
torture or ill-treatment in front of

in a few cases under the Torture 
Compensation Act, but was always 
paid to victims or their families, and 
was not usually accompanied by a 
proper investigation to establish 
causes and responsibilities. 
Compensation packages depend on 
what the Government can afford. 
The Government provided Rupees 
(Rs.) 1,625,000 in financial aid to 12 
victims who were recommended by 
the National Human Rights 
Commission.

<p>In 2006, compensation awarded by 
the courts was often not paid out or 
paid out only after prolonged delays. 
In the 12-year history of the Torture 
Compensation Act (TCA), over 200 
victims of torture or their relatives 
have filed compensation cases with 
the courts. However, only 52 cases 
have been decided in favour of the 
victims, and in only seven cases was 
the money actually paid to the 
victim.

<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur (Manfred 
Nowak) in the report of his visit to Nigeria from 4 to 10 March 2007 
(A/HRC/7/3/Add.4, para. 75) 
</b></p>
<p>58. On 23 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government 
of Nigeria requesting information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with 
regard to the implementation of his recommendations. The Special Rapporteur regrets that 
the Government has not provided any input. He looks forward to receiving information on 
Nigeria&#8217;s efforts to follow-up to his recommendations and he reaffirms that he stands ready 
to assist in efforts to prevent and combat torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the continuing allegations of torture 
committed by Nigerian police forces. Welcoming recent public condemnations of torture 
and the Government&#8217;s plans to prohibit such practices, the Special Rapporteur urges 
Nigeria to promptly pass legislation in accordance with Article 1 and 4 of the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). 
He remains concerned about the fact that corporal punishment remains lawful in parts of 
the country. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur is worried about the lack of accountability of the 
perpetrators of torture. He expresses his concern about a lacking effective and independent 
complaints system and the restricted right to legal counsel. He regrets that the bill providing 
for the establishment of an anti-torture commission and the bill to extend the mandate of the 
Legal Aid Council (LAC) have been pending in the Senate for a long time and calls upon 
the members of Parliament to work for its expeditious adoption and effective 
implementation. He emphasizes the need for prompt and thorough investigations of all 
torture allegations by an independent authority and notes with concern that the majority of 
investigations are conducted internally within the Nigerian Police Force, contributing to a 
persisting culture of impunity in police institutions. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern about the prolonged pre-trial detention 
before judicial review and that the ability to challenge the lawfulness of detention is 
dependent on the financial capacity of detainees. He reiterates that the power to order and 
approve arrest should be vested solely with independent courts. The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the reviews of criminal procedure laws in some States to increase the use of non 
custodial measures. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction Nigeria&#8217;s ratification of the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT) and encourages the Government to 
promptly establish an independent and effective national preventive mechanism in full 
accordance with OPCAT. </p>

<p>Police functions to arrest, detain

effectively guaranteed the 
ability to challenge the 
lawfulness of the detention 
before an independent court, 
e.g. through habeas corpus

</p>
<p>De facto, the vast majority of 
detainees did not have the 
ability to challenge the 
lawfulness of their detention 
due to the lack of financial 
means, the overload of the 
entire judicial system as well as 
a climate of fear. 
</p>
<p><b> <i>Non-governmental sources</i></b><i>: A detainee&#8217;s

dependent on their financial capacity, and 
poverty restricts the ability of detainees to

</p>
<p>While in principle empowered 
to do so, judges and prosecutors 
did not ex-officio enquire about 
potential torture and ill-

of ways to redress instances of 
police misconduct, including 
police internal review, these do 
not function in practice.

<p>Capital punishment was still in

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>149 
</b></p>
<p><b>Republic of Moldova 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur (Manfred 
Nowak) in the report of his visit to the Republic of Moldova from 4 to 11 July 2008 
(A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 para. 90) 
</b></p>
<p>67. By letter dated 23 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent the following report to 
the Government of the Republic of Moldova, requesting information and comments on the 
follow-up measures taken with regard to the implementation of his recommendations. He 
expresses his gratitude to the Government for providing comprehensive information in a 
letter dated 26 November 2009. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the 
Government for sharing relevant information during his visit to the country in September 
</p><p>2009. 
</p>
<p>68. The situation with regard to torture and ill-treatment in the Republic of Moldova in 
2009 was marked by the general elections held in April 2009, which were followed by 
violent clashes between security forces and demonstrators. In a communication sent on 17 
April 2009, the Special Rapporteur expressed his concern about reports of alleged beatings 
and other forms of ill-treatment reportedly inflicted to more than one hundred persons 
(including minors) during arrest and in police custody in the context of the demonstrations. 
Two persons died, allegedly of injuries sustained in the course of the demonstrations or 
shortly afterwards.  
</p>
<p>69. In violation of the law establishing the Consultative Council as National Preventive 
Mechanism under OPCAT, the Council was denied access to several police detention 
facilities in Chisinau after the clashes. The members of the Council were granted access to 
penitentiary institution No.13 only after considerable delay. A number of detainees in that 
institution allegedly showed physical marks which corroborated their allegations of torture 
and ill-treatment. Furthermore, some of the detainees reported that they were held in 
inhuman conditions in police stations; they were denied food for two days and had only 
limited access to water and basic sanitary facilities.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for commenting on the above 
allegations. By letter dated 23 September 2009, the Government informed that in the course 
of the demonstrations, 111 persons had been arrested. According to the Government, 
immediately after the transfer of these persons from the police detention facilities to 
Penitentiary No. 13, they were examined by medical staff. 27 detainees bore various 
physical injuries. A group of prosecutors specifically tasked for investigating the April 
events has been created. According to the Government, the group examined 91 cases of 
physical injuries. During the visit of the Special Rapporteur in September 2009, the General 
Prosecutors&#8217; Office (GPO) reported that 101 complaints were submitted, 51 for 
&#8220;application of force while detained&#8221; and 50 for &#8220;ill-treatment in police commissioners&#8217; 
facilities&#8221;. The GPO has initiated 25 cases, and begun inquiry proceedings in 66 cases. 
Most of the cases are still under investigation. 
</p>
<p>71. Regarding conditions of detention, the Deputy Interior Minister acknowledged that 
seven preventive isolator facilities were not in compliance with the respective norms. A 
main recommendation by the Special Rapporteur &#8211; that of transferring isolators to the 
competence of the Ministry of Justice &#8211; has not yet been carried out because of a lack of 
resources. 
</p>
<p>72. With respect to the Transnistrian region, the Special Rapporteur remains highly 
concerned of persistent allegations of human rights violations in places of detention and 
psychiatric hospitals. He urges the de-facto authorities to implement important safeguards 
in criminal procedure to prevent torture and ill-treatment. </p>

<p><b>Situation during the visit 
</b></p>
<p>(A/HRC/10/44/Add.3)<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Steps taken since January 2008 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b>i) Abolish the statute of limitations 
for crimes of torture; 
</b></p>
<p><b>ii) Establish effective and accessible 
complaints mechanisms; and protect 
complainants 
</b></p>
<p><b>against reprisals; 
</b></p>
<p><b>iii) An independent authority with no 
connection to the body investigating 
or prosecuting the case against the 
alleged victim should investigate 
promptly and thoroughly all 
allegations of torture and ill-
treatment ex-officio; an independent 
forensic expert should carry out an 
examination in respect of all 
allegations of torture and ill-
treatment; 
</b></p>
<p><b>iv) The Forensic institute should be 
equipped accordingly. 
</b></p>
<p>A statute of limitation of five years 
was applicable to the crime of torture; 
</p>
<p>The law provided for several 
complaints avenues, but the large 
majority of complaints were rejected 
quasi-automatically;  
</p>
<p>Ex-officio investigations did not 
function in practice;  
</p>
<p>The system of internal remedies was 
dysfunctional due to: 
</p>
<p>a)The routine use of threats and 
reprisals by the police in order to deter 
detainees from filing complaints;  
</p>
<p>b)the non-action of the staff of 
penitentiary institutions in cases of 
allegations of torture;  
</p>
<p>c) the wide discretion and inaction of 
the prosecutor&#8217;s office when he 
receives complaints; d) the lack of 
independent medical examination; e) 
the lack of independence of judges 
who in many cases continue to follow 
the arguments of the prosecutor; 
</p>
<p>The State Forensic Institute was 
underequipped. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:  
</b></p>
<p>i) The statute of limitations is not an impediment to investigations, 
since crimes of torture are investigated vigilantly and in a timely 
manner. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ii) Since 1996 prosecutors are obliged to make daily spot checks at the 
places of temporary detention. This includes personal and direct 
control of the legality of detention, discussions with detainees, as well 
as reporting the results of these actions, including where necessary, 
issuing orders to release the persons detained illegally on remand. 
Thus, there is a mechanism to record, control and monitor the practice 
of coercive procedural measures and the conditions of detention. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>iii) In 2007, 1,258 complaints were submitted, 50 criminal proceedings 
being initiated. In the same year, 87 criminal proceedings were 
initiated for excess of power, 55 cases of which were sent to the court, 
63 persons being convicted, including 14 persons imprisoned. In 2008, 
1,128 complaints were submitted, 51 criminal proceedings being 
initiated. In the same year, 73 criminal proceedings were initiated for 
excess of power, 46 of which were sent to court, as a result of which 
36 persons were convicted and 5 persons were imprisoned. In 2009, 
554 complaints have been submitted, 33 criminal proceedings were 
initiated. The same year, 31 criminal proceedings have been initiated 
for excess of power, 20 of which were sent to court, 16 persons 
convicted and 1 person was imprisoned. Most cases investigated 
concerned the use of force during interrogation for the purpose of 
securing a confession to improve prosecution statistics. 
</p>
<p>The Interior Ministry has internally examined 135 criminal cases, 
including 39 cases regarding excess of power, 17 cases regarding 
torture and 4 cases for coerced declarations, 19 of which had resulted 
in the dismissal of staff. 
</p>
<p>It should be noted that during 2008, no new cases of torture or 
inhuman or degrading treatment were registered in the penitentiary </p>

<p>system. An exception is the case of an employee of Prison No. 1, who 
was sentenced, in accordance with article 328 paragraph 2 (c) of the 
Criminal Code on 9 December 2008, to a fine and the deprivation of 
the right to hold public functions for a period of 3 years, for 
committing actions that humiliated the dignity of a prisoner on 29 
December 2007. In 2009 no cases of torture were registered in the 
penitentiary system. During this year the Penitentiary Institutions 
Department of the Ministry of Justice initiated 2 internal investigations 
regarding the alleged ill-treatment of two detainees, from which one of 
the cases was sent to the Prosecutor Office. The facts alleged in the 
second case have not been confirmed.  
</p>
<p>Of 473 petitions examined in 2008 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
(MIA), 38 concerned cases of ill-treatment and illegal detention of 
citizens. In 18 cases false facts were reported; in 15 cases the facts 
have been confirmed (employees have been sanctioned disciplinarily); 
in 19 cases the files were submitted to the prosecution bodies (for 
criminal procedure), and in 6 cases the petitions were sent to judicial 
courts (for examination of criminal cases filed by the petitioners). 
During the first 10 months of 2009 the MIA examined 334 petitions, of 
which 33 cases concerned mistreatment of persons by police 
employees. In 11 cases the alleged mistreatment was not confirmed; in 
4 cases the court applied an administrative fine to both sides of the 
conflict; in 2 cases the investigation was suspended until the decision 
on the criminal case was issued; in 16 cases the files were sent to the 
prosecutor, of which no criminal procedure was commenced in 2 cases 
(the employees were only warned about the due treatment of citizens).  
</p>
<p>Thus, 204 criminal cases were initiated in 2009, compared with 215 
during the same period of the previous year. 60 of these concerned 
cases of excess of power (59 in 2008), 34 cases of torture (13 in 2008), 
and 5 cases of coercion to make statements (12 in 2008). 
</p>
<p>20 police employees were dismissed following a court decision.  
</p>
<p>The examination of such cases reveal that police officers commit 
actions that clearly exceed the limits of rights and powers granted to 
them by law; they apply force and violence, and torture people for the 
following reasons:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; To obtain evidence by illegal means;  </p>

<p><b>152</b> &#8226; To pursue personal and material interests; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To demonstrate the superiority over the victims and to neglect 
the general rules of conduct;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Because of lack of knowledge of the law and work duties; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Other reasons.  
</p>
<p>Most of the circumstances described in the complaints of citizens are 
not sufficient to start a criminal prosecution. 
</p>
<p>Taking into account the necessity to ensure the impartiality of 
prosecutors in the investigation process of cases of torture and abuse of 
power, by General Prosecutor&#8217;s Order of 19 November 2007 regarding 
the investigation of cases of torture, degrading and inhuman treatment, 
the territorial and specialized prosecutors were required to designate a 
prosecutor responsible for documenting and examining allegations of 
torture and ensuring the security of victims. This person is not 
involved in other activities, in order to exclude partiality in 
investigations of allegations of torture. Following the decision of the 
General Prosecutor or his or her deputies, the military prosecutor 
offices of Chisinau, Balti and Cahul investigate cases of torture, 
inhuman and degrading treatment, respectively, in the centre, North 
and South of the country, while the Department on Criminal 
Investigation of Exceptional Cases of the General Prosecutor's Office 
investigates the most severe cases of torture, inhuman and degrading 
treatment. 
</p>
<p>In accordance with the above-mentioned acts, prosecutors are required, 
whenever a reasonable suspicion exists that the crime of torture has 
been committed, to immediately start criminal investigations. 
Following the initiation of criminal proceedings, prosecutors of 
Chisinau municipality and Gagauzia may withdraw the criminal cases 
from the prosecutors in these territorial units, appointing a special

developed some proposals for several external assistance projects, with 
the purpose of strengthening the existing laboratory capacities and 
establishing a genetic laboratory within the Centre &#8211; these proposals 
were submitted for consideration to UNDP, the Government of Japan,

<p>De-facto, most detainees were kept in 
police custody for several 
weeks/months and regularly returned 
there for &#8220;further investigation&#8221; or for 
their trial or appeal, which made them

national legislation; numerous reports

<p><b><i>Observations of the Special Rapporteur during his visit in September 
2009</i>:</b> The NPM still faces a number of challenges: firstly, the legal 
basis for this mechanism is rather ambiguous, which has led to 
different interpretations regarding which entity constitutes the NPM. 
From the side of the Ministry of Justice, it is argued that the 
Parliamentary Ombudsperson is the NPM. However, even the 
Ombudsman in charge, as well as other relevant actors, including 
international bodies such as the Council of Europe&#8217;s Commissioner on 
Human Rights, have clearly stated that the NPM is comprised of the 
Consultative Council, under the chair of the Parliamentary 
Ombudsperson. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that only the latter 
interpretation is in line with OPCAT and the Paris Principles. Another 
problem is that although the NPM is meant to be comprised of 11 
members, currently only six members serve on this mandate (including 
the Ombudsman). Finally, and closely linked to the above, is the issue 
of financial resources allocated to the NPM. In this respect, the Special 
Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that although international 
organisations have indicated their willingness to support the NPM, 
including adequate pay for its members, the State has the primary 
obligation to provide sufficient resources.

<p><b>Government</b>: In order to develop collaboration between the 
representatives of the healthcare and internal affairs authorities, the 
Order of the Ministry of Health and MIA no. 372/388 of 3 November 
2009 was issued. According to its provisions, the healthcare facility 
managers shall inform immediately the police authorities regarding the 
healthcare assistance granted to persons with injuries acquired as a 
result of an offence, traffic accident or sudden death. In cases when 
injuries derive from illegal actions of law enforcement authorities, the 
health care facility managers shall inform immediately the territorial or 
specialized prosecutor office. 
</p>
<p>Concerning the medical certification of detainees who claim physical 
injuries, all the cases referring to the incidents from the penitentiary 
institutions, including cases of detecting physical injuries, are 
compulsorily to be sent to the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and to the 
Ombudsmen.  
</p>
<p>The Medical Service examines the detainees on their arrival to the 
penitentiary in view of proving the presence of any physical injuries or 
other signs of violence, in accordance with article 251 (3) of the 
Enforcement Code and article 25 of the Statute on the Execution of 
Sentences by Convicts. The administration of the institution is obliged 
to inform, in writing and in the shortest time possible, the Penitentiary 
Institutions Department, the territorial Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the 
Human Rights Centre about the physical injuries of detainees arriving 
in the penitentiary. 
</p>
<p>The notes received by the Penitentiary Institutions Department and 
delivered to the Medical Division are included in a special database. 
From the beginning of 2009, 13 cases of physical injuries have been 
registered, of which 2 cases were reported by the MIA. 
</p>
<p>Police officers are obliged to supervise the work of the paramedics 
during the medical examination of the detainees of the temporary 
detention facilities (isolators), issuing two copies of medical records. 
These activities and organizational practices confirm where the person 
was detained, and that the detained person was not tortured or </p>

police stations, at a rate of 0.5% of their salary. 
</p>
<p>The NPM has carried out approximately 90 visits to places of detention 
in 2009. They met 10 persons who stated that they had been ill-treated 
and 27 persons with visible marks. Some members of the Consultative 
Council have been restricted access to places of detention or have been 
confronted with considerable delays. Regarding the legal basis of the 
NPM, on 26 July 2007, the Moldovan Parliament adopted Law no. 
200, amending and supplementing the Law on the Parliamentary 
Ombudsmen, thus assigning the mandate of the NPM to the 
Parliamentary Ombudsmen. In view of achieving the involvement of 
civil society, a Consultative Council was established, with the purpose 
of providing advice and assistance in exercising the Parliamentary 
Ombudsmen&#8217;s liabilities as NPM. Given the need to supplement the 
Consultative Council with 5 members, the Centre for Human Rights 
announced a call in this respect, but because the number of 
applications was insufficient, it was decided to extend the deadline for 
submission until 13 November 2009. 
</p>
<p>During the first 9 months of the 2009, 117 preventive visits were 
carried out. Out of these, 31 were carried out by the members of the 
Consultative Council and 11 by the Parliamentary Ombudsmen and 
officials from the Centre for Human Rights.

<p><b>(c) Institutional reforms 
</b></p>
<p><b>i) Continue and accelerate reforms of 
the prosecutor&#8217;s office, the police and 
the 
</b></p>
<p><b>penitentiary system with a view to 
transforming them into truly client-
oriented bodies that 
</b></p>
<p><b>operate transparently, including 
through modernized and 
demilitarized training; 
</b></p>
<p><b>ii) Strengthen the independence of the 
judiciary; make judges aware of their 
responsibilities 
</b></p>
<p>Lack of independence of judges who 
in many cases continued to follow the 
arguments of the prosecutor without 
intervening in cases of alleged torture;  
</p>
<p>The legal framework and penitentiary 
policies in Moldova were punitive, 
directed at locking people up, rather 
than aimed at reintegrating prisoners, 
in particular extremely restrictive 
visiting policies and numerous 
constraints on contacts with the 
outside world;  
</p>
<p>Common problems at all pre- and post-
trial prisons were poor hygienic 
conditions, restricted access to health 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> The criminal investigation bodies 
continue to have a punitive attitude. 
</i></p>
<p><b>Government:</b> Although relevant trainings and seminars are taking 
place, there is still need for administrative and institutional measures 
including further trainings in the MIA and involvement of all actors in 
torture prevention.  
</p>
<p>The MIA is in the process of implementing the Institutional 
Development Plan for 2009-2010, which was developed in the context 
of reforms of the entire central public administration. In this view, the 
Ministry aligns to European standards and adjusts the existing legal 
framework to the EU <i>acquis</i> of decentralization, demilitarization and 
de-politicization of its activities, improving the management of service 
to society.

extensive; several of his interviewees 
had spent up to three or four years in 
detention without a final judgment. 
</p>
<p>methodological seminars for leadership and personnel of subdivisions 
of the criminal prosecution. The seminars concerned different topics, 
the main emphasis being on the observance of the law by police 
officers in the criminal investigation work. The Ministry set up a 
committee on fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens. In the same 
context, it issued an ordinance on procedural time limits, according to 
which prosecution officers must provide a report to the Ministry with a 
view to control and coordinate the extension of periods of arrest. 
Furthermore, billboards on rights and obligations of persons suspected, 
detained, arrested and prosecuted were set up. Similarly, all sections of 
the prosecution authorities were provided with models of procedural 
documents, such as minutes/process-verbaux of apprehension and 
explanations of the rights and obligations of the detained persons, 
compiled by the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p>The preliminary report regarding the respect of rights of detained 
persons, elaborated by the Institute for Penal Reform within the project 
&#8220;Strengthening Criminal Justice System Reform in Moldova&#8221;, was sent 
to the heads of criminal prosecution bodies of territorial subdivisions, 
in order to undertake measures to eliminate any violations in the 
future. The MIA participated in the working group set up by the 
General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, where the draft of the &#8216;Instructions on 
how to grant visits and telephone conversations to persons detained in 
preventive arrest&#8217; was elaborated. 
</p>
<p>A law was drafted to amend some legislative acts for the re-
examination of the applicable disciplinary regime for judges, which 
represents a balance between the guarantee of the judges&#8217; 
independence and the necessity of sanctioning a judge in case his or 
her behaviour necessitates such action.  
</p>
<p>In order to ensure the impartiality of judges, an amendment to the law 
is proposed, introducing an obligation of the judge to inform the 
president of the court and the Superior Council of Magistrates about 
any attempt to influence the process of decision making.  
</p>
<p>Regarding conflicts of interest, a draft law is proposed to complete 
article 15 of the Law on the Status of Judges, which would stipulate 
the obligation of the judge to present a declaration regarding his or her 
personal interests.

<p>A reform of the judicial organizational system is proposed, which </p>

<p>includes the abolition of specialized law courts (Chisinau Economical 
District Court, Military Court, Economical Appeals Court).<b> </b> The 
specialized courts&#8217; duties shall be taken over by the courts of common 
jurisdiction.  
</p>
<p>In March 2009, a decision of the Plenum Supreme Court was issued, 
clarifying many aspects of case law concerning Article 3 ECHR. There 
have been 24 ECtHR judgments against Moldova under Article 3. 
Aspects of the Plenum decision include the requirement that detainees 
are registered; the registration of officials present; that the person not 
be interrogated in the absence of an &#8220;escort&#8221;; and an unbiased 
investigation into allegations of ill-treatment. The Superior Council has 
held seminars on Article 3 and the case law against Moldova. 
</p>
<p>One of the objectives of the continuous training of judges is their 
conscious involvement in the eradication of torture. In this context, 
thematic seminars on preventive arrest were organized, especially for 
instruction judges, judges, prosecutors and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>From the beginning of 2008 the Ministry of Justice has undertaken 
numerous activities in the field of promotion of human rights. Within 
the Training on Human Rights the following topics were included: 
&#8220;The minimum standards of maintenance of convicted persons&#8221;, &#8220;The 
European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment&#8221;, &#8220;The Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights&#8221; and &#8220;The national, regional and international 
mechanisms of human rights protection&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>The regimes in the penitentiaries have been established according to 
the Execution Code and are characteristic to each type of penitentiary, 
which represents different stages of the punishment of deprivation of 
liberty. Thus, the practice envisages different stages within the 
respective process. The first one (the initial regime), a reduced period 
compared to the total term of the sentence, represents the stage of 
ensuring the adaptation of the person to the penitentiary environment 
and an evaluation according to rules nos. 16, 51, and 52 of the 
Recommendations of the Committee of Ministries of the Council of 
Europe no. R2006 (2). 
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the appreciation that the penitentiary policy is still 
punitive does not correspond to reality. Thus, the provisions regarding 
the regimes of detention (articles 269 to 273 of the Execution Code) </p>

their behaviour. The enforcement depends on the punishment and the 
behaviour of the detainees, the danger they represent, based on an 
evaluation of the personality and behaviour, as well as on their 
individual plan of serving the sentence.  
</p>
<p>Regarding visits, the law stipulates the right of the detainee to at least 
one visit a month. Nevertheless, depending on the behaviour of the 
convicted person, the penitentiary administration can grant additional 
visits. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, depending on his or her behaviour and his or her 
attitude towards labour (both remunerated and unremunerated), the 
convicted person may benefit from 22 long- and short-term visits 
during a year. The penitentiary program includes also educational 
training, labour and sport activities etc., which, along with social 
assistance granted by the administration, contribute to the reintegration 
of the convicted persons into society. 
</p>
<p>According to articles 227, 228 and 229 of the Execution Code, 
detainees have access to information, files, correspondence and 
telephone calls and can address correspondence to law enforcement 
bodies, central public authorities and international intergovernmental 
organizations. Post boxes were installed in all prisons and letters are 
collected by employees of the Moldova Post. 
</p>
<p>A number of deficiencies of conditions of detention have been asserted 
in 21 temporary detention facilities (isolators) of the territorial police 
commissariats. As a result, relevant letters have been addressed to 
commissariats in Balti, Basarabeasca, Cimislia, Soldanesti, Rezina, 
Vulcanesti, Comrat, Leova, Orhei, Cahul, Causeni, Anenii-Noi, 
Gagauzia and Floresti with deadlines for proper actions to be 
undertaken to redress the situation. 
</p>
<p>Despite the undertaken measures to create decent conditions of 
detention, in some temporary detention isolators the situation remains 
complicated: 
</p>
<p>- lack of natural illumination and ventilation in cells (Balti, Bender, 
Anenii-Noi, Basarabeasca, Cahul, Causeni, Cimislia, Drochia, Floresti,

</p>
<p>The quality of the food has been improved and detainees are now 
given something to eat three times per day. 
</p>
<p>In 2008, 2,878 persons were detained, out of which 2,037 were under 
preventive detention. In 2009, 2,644 persons were detained, out of 
which 1.784 persons were under preventive detention.

They have been provided with psychological counselling, medical

</p>
<p>A priority in the field of combating and preventing domestic violence 
is the creation and consolidation of the services that are currently 
underdeveloped and are provided mainly by NGOs. Three centres are 
highlighted:

<p>- the Maternal Centre &#8220;Pro Femina&#8221; (Hincesti) provides temporary 
placement and counselling services (psychological, social, legal) to 
mothers and children as victims of domestic violence;

<p>In the context of the development of a joint methodology for collecting 
statistical data regarding domestic violence, the project &#8220;Development 
of an integrated information system for management of data on 
violence within the family in the Republic of Moldova&#8221; was launched 
on 1 July 2008. It is funded by the Agency for International Assistance 
of the Romanian Government for Moldova and implemented by 
UNFPA in cooperation with the Ministry of Social Protection, Family 
and Children and civil society. In the framework of this Project, the 
concept of the informational system &#8220;State Register of Cases of 
Violence within the Family&#8221; was approved by Government Decision 
no. 544 on 9 September 2009. This system will significantly contribute 
to the continuous monitoring of domestic violence and statistical 
analyses will provide a consistent basis for developing effective 
policies to prevent and combat domestic violence and will facilitate the 
cooperation between the appropriate institutions. In order to initiate the 
process of statistical data collection, statistical cards were developed 
for recording cases of violence within the family for experts from three 
branches (health, social protection and police). This process was 
launched in two pilot districts: Drochia and Cahul.

conventions on human rights protection and other international treaties 
to which Moldova is party throughout the country. Moldovan 
authorities do not have access and are unable to effectively exercise

that have usurped local power in this part of the country. The state of 
affairs concerning torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and

freedoms by the separatist regime in Tiraspol, aiming at determining it 
to comply with the rigors of international standards in this matter. </p>

<p><b>  Follow-up of the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur (Nigel Rodley) on 
Torture pursuant his visit to Romania from 19 to 29 April 1999 
(E/CN.4/2000/9/Add.3, para. 57) 
</b></p>
<p>73. On 23 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government 
of Romania requesting information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with 
regard to the implementation of the recommendations of his predecessor&#8217;s visit in 1999. 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not provided any input. He looks 
forward to receiving information on Romania&#8217;s efforts to follow-up to his recommendations 
and reaffirms that he stands ready to assist the Government of Romania in its efforts to 
prevent and combat torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur welcomes Romania&#8217;s legislative, regulatory and institutional 
efforts in combating torture and ill-treatment and improving the situation of persons 
deprived of their liberty. However, he is concerned about reports of ill-treatment and police 
brutality against members of the Roma minority and urges Romania to undertake effective 
and impartial investigations of such allegations. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur regrets that he has not been provided with information about 
the implementation of his recommendations. He has not received any statistics on the 
number of pre-trial and convicted prisoners, the application of non-custodial measures and 
the use of video and audio taping in interrogation rooms. He has furthermore obtained no 
information on the availability of ex officio lawyers and a legal aid scheme. 
</p>
<p>76. Welcoming the work of the Ombudsman, the Special Rapporteur reiterates the need 
to grant the Office of the Ombudsman the power to investigate judicial decisions and to 
sanction any official who refuses to cooperate with the investigation of a complaint.  
</p>
<p>77. He furthermore repeats the need for institutional changes to prevent torture and ill-
treatment. Pre-trial detention centres should be placed under the authority of the Ministry of 
Justice and the Forensic Institute under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health. 
Regrettably, no information on legislative steps in that regard has been received. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Situation during visit  
</b></p>
<p>(E/CN.4/2000/9/Add.3)<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Steps taken in previous years 
</b></p>
<p>(see E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.2 and 
A/HRC/4/33/Add.2)<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Information received in the 
reporting period 
</b></p>
<p>(a) As a matter of immediate priority, 
action should be taken to remove from 
confinement in detention centres on 
remand all persons detained in excess 
of the officially proclaimed capacity 
of existing institutions. This 
recommendation could probably be 
substantially achieved by ordering the 
release pending trial of all non-violent 
first-time offenders. 
</p>
<p>Extreme overcrowding existed in all 
prisons and created conditions which may 
be described as inhumane. In some cases 
prisons housed more than double their 
capacity. There were not enough beds for 
the number of persons per cell, requiring 
the inmates to sleep in shifts. In general, 
the most severe overcrowding involved 
males over the age of 21.  
</p>
<p>There has been a significant 
decrease in the number of remand 
prisoners. This reduction is due in 
part to amendments to the 
provisions on remanding a person 
in custody in the Penal Procedure 
Code.  
</p>
<p>At the end of 2004, the overall 
number of persons detained in 
detention facilities had decreased 
to 39.031, compared with 49.790 
in 1999. Temporary police 
detention facilities, which did not 
meet the minimum conditions, 
were definitively or temporarily 
closed down. 
</p>
<p>Law No. 543/2002 provided for 
the release of more than 3,000 
non-recidivist prisoners, who had 
been sentenced to up to five years 
imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>In order to eliminate overcrowding 
at temporary police detention 
facilities, a protocol was 
concluded between the Ministry of 
Administration and Interior and 
the National Administration of 
Penitentiaries, regulating the 
transfer of convicted persons to 
penitentiaries. Following 
amendments to the criminal 
procedural legislation, minor 
offenders, first time offenders and

<p>violent crimes who do not pose a 
concrete threat to public safety 
may be released on bail during the 
investigation. The responsibility to 
order pre-trial arrest was passed 
from the prosecutor to the judge. 
</p>
<p>Act no. 275/2006 establishes 
special sections for preventive 
detention within penitentiaries. It 
also prescribes that preventive 
temporary police detention during 
a criminal investigation must be 
executed in special facilities for 
preventive, temporary detention 
under the authority of the Ministry 
of Interior and Administration. 
Preventive detention during trial 
proceedings is administered in 
special facilities under the 
authority of the National 
Administration of Penitentiaries. 
</p>
<p>(b) Much greater use should be made 
of existing provisions in the law for 
the release of suspects on bail, 
especially suspected first-time, non-
violent offenders. Instructions or 
guidelines to this effect should be 
given by the Minister of the Interior to 
investigators from his Ministry, and by 
the Minister of Justice to all 
prosecutors and judges. 
</p>
<p>The Minister of Justice indicated to the 
Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur that overcrowding could be 
reduced by changing sentencing to allow 
for bail. In this regard, he pointed out that 
both the Senate and the Chamber of 
Deputies had passed a law to have 
misdemeanours punished by community 
service. 
</p>
<p>Romanian legislation has been 
amended in this respect. Currently, 
during criminal investigation and 
the trial period, the suspect is 
detained only exceptionally during 
these periods. Only a judge has the 
right to detain a suspect in 
accordance with the existing legal 
framework. According to article 
1604 of the Criminal Procedure 
Code, release on bail can be 
granted by the court upon request, 
both during criminal investigation 
and during trial. The amendments 
to the Criminal Procedure Code 
have led to a decrease in the 
number of persons detained in

Similarly, the General Police

<p>(e) Legislation should be amended to

</p>
<p>Several government interlocutors 
expressed the view that the pre-trial 
detention centres should be placed under 
the authority of the Ministry of Justice, 
rather than the Ministry of the Interior.  
</p>
<p>A suspect may not feel secure in 
retracting his confession when he knows 
he will be returned to police custody 
following his interrogation by the

<p>The Government informed that 
Act no. 275/2006 establishes 
special sections for preventive 
detention within penitentiaries. It 
also prescribes that preventive 
temporary police detention during 
criminal investigation must be 
executed in special facilities for

<p> Article 64(1) and Article 91 of the

use of video and audio recordings 
as evidence in court proceedings. 
</p>
<p>According to information received 
from NGOs, legislation on the use 
of video and audio taping has not 
been introduced. In practice, video 
and audio taping does not take 
place in police interrogation 
rooms.  
</p>
<p>The Government claims that this is 
due to lack of technical means. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g) Legislation should be amended to 
transfer the power to investigate 
claims of police abuse and torture 
from military to civilian prosecutors. 
The investigation of allegations should 
be conducted by the prosecutor 
himself or herself and the necessary 
staff should be provided for this 
</p>
<p>The investigation of police abuse is under 
the jurisdiction of military prosecutors. 
This system was widely criticized by non-
governmental organizations and lawyers 
because there is a perception that the 
military prosecutors are not independent 
of the police. 
</p>
<p>The adoption of Laws No. 218 and 
No.360 led to the demilitarization 
of police structures in 2002. As a 
result, civilian prosecutors are now 
responsible for investigating 
claims of police abuse. Allegations

period before the demilitarization

prosecutors are assisted by the police in 
these investigations, and that there are 
only 80 military prosecutors in the entire 
country, each of whom on average works 
on over 100 active files. 
</p>
<p>of the police are still investigated 
by military structures. 
</p>
<p>(h) In the interim, civilian prosecutors 
should refer all allegations of police 
abuse to the military prosecutor in an 
expeditious manner; military 
prosecutors should diligently 
investigate all allegations of police 
abuse made by detainees. 
</p>
<p>A number of the detainees spoken to had 
filed allegations against the police, but 
had not had any response.  
</p>
<p>As a result of Law No. 360/2002 
and Law No. 281/2003, the power 
to investigate all offences 
committed by police officers has 
been transferred from the military 
prosecutor to the civilian 
prosecutor. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(i) Prosecutors and the judiciary 
should speed up the trials and appeals 
of public officials indicted for torture 
or ill-treatment; sentences should be 
commensurate with the gravity of the 
crime. 
</p>
<p>While there have been a few cases in 
which police officers have been 
prosecuted and sentenced, in most cases 
the investigations result in decisions not 
to prosecute. 
</p>
<p>The Government informed that the 
new Criminal Code and the new 
Criminal Procedure Code, which 
are to be elaborated by the 
Ministry of Justice, will include 
measures to increase the speed of 
criminal cases, including those 
relating to torture. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  
<i>Several cases of ill-treatment 
and police brutality, 
particularly against members 
of the Roma minority, are not 
effectively and impartially 
investigated. Criminal 
investigations often lead to a 
decision not to prosecute cases 
or are lost in the Romanian 
courts.

disregard any evidence obtained by 
illegal means and judges should be 
diligent in ensuring that all 
incriminating evidence obtained by 
such means is identified and excluded 
from the trial.

<p>Article 68 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure provides that &#8220;it is forbidden to 
use violence, threats, or any other 
constraints, as well as promises or 
encouragement, for the purpose of 
obtaining evidence&#8221;. Evidence obtained 
by torture or ill-treatment is inadmissible 
</p>
<p>Article 68 of the Criminal 
Procedure Code prohibits the use 
of force with the aim of obtaining 
evidence. Therefore, the evidence 
obtained by violating legal 
provisions cannot be taken into 
account while examining cases.

</p>
<p>The Procurator

<p>General indicated that if a suspect 
complains to a prosecutor that he has 
been subjected to violence in order to 
coerce a confession, the prosecutor may 
not use that statement, but he may take 
another statement.

<p>(k) Any public official indicted for 
abuse or torture should be suspended

<p> Article 65 of Law No. 360/2002 
was amended in 2004 to provide 
that the decision as to whether a 
police officer is to be removed 
from his post will not be made 
until after a final judgment has 
been rendered.  
</p>
<p>According to Act no. 293/2004 
&#8220;On the Status of Public Officers 
of the National Administration of 
the Penitentiaries due to the 
reorganization of the General 
Directorate of Penitentiaries and 
its units&#8221; an officer of the

whom charges have been brought 
who is on temporary release on 
bail, can work only with the 
written approval of the head of the 
unit. The officer continues to be 
paid according to his professional 
background but at the basic level 
of salary. When in preventive 
detention, an officer of the 
penitentiary administration is 
suspended from his duties, has to 
hand over his weapons and badge,

</p>
<p>(l) Priority should be given to 
enhancing and strengthening the 
training of all police officials, 
including non-commissioned officers; 
the Government should give 
consideration to requesting assistance 
from the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to 
train police officials. 
</p>
<p>Incidents of torture were most common 
among those non-commissioned officers 
who receive little training. This view 
would seem to be corroborated by the fact 
that there appears to be a more serious 
problem in rural communities, where the 
police have less training. 
</p>
<p>At all territorial structures and 
subordinated educational units, the 
&#8220;Guide on Best Practices in police 
work&#8221; has been distributed. 
Furthermore, various programs 
have been developed at the 
Institute for Crime Prevention and 
Research, aimed at training police 
officers in human rights and 
conflict resolution in multicultural 
communities, conflict management 
and preventing discrimination. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(m) Given the numerous reports of 
inadequate legal counsel provided by 
ex officio lawyers, measures should be 
taken to improve legal aid services. 
</p>
<p>Although suspects have a right to an 
attorney at any time, many claimed they 
were not made aware of that right and 
that the ex officio lawyer was only 
present when the suspect was brought 
before the prosecutor to make a 
statement. In several cases, the suspects 
were not even aware at the time that a 
lawyer was present, because the ex officio 
lawyers did not provide any legal advice 
or guidance. 
</p>
<p>Following the conclusion of a 
Protocol between the Ministry of 
Justice and the National Union of 
the Lawyers of Romania, on 23 
June 2005, financial expenditures 
for ex officio lawyers have 
increased significantly. Moreover, 
judicial assistance has been 
extended to all fields, including 
individual complaints against the 
state. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(n) Legislation should be amended to 
allow for the presence of legal counsel 
in the first 24 hours of detention prior 
to the issue of an arrest warrant; 
moreover, police need to be issued 
guidelines on informing criminal 
suspects of their right to defence 
counsel. 
</p>
<p>Romanian law provides that a lawyer 
must be present throughout the criminal 
procedures. However, the criminal 
procedure does not formally begin until 
an arrest warrant has been issued by the 
prosecutor, and therefore, an individual 
does not have access to a lawyer while 
being held for the first 24 hours under a 
police custody warrant. 
</p>
<p>Suspects have also claimed that they were 
not informed by the police of their right 
to counsel. 
</p>
<p>According to article 6 of the 
Criminal Procedure Code, the 
judicial authorities, including 
police officers, have the obligation 
to inform the suspects or the 
accused immediately, before their 
interrogation, about the charges 
brought against them, the legal 
qualification of the charges and 
their rights, including the right to 
be assisted by a defence lawyer. 
The minutes of the interrogations 
have to expressly record the above

<p>mentioned obligation. 
</p>
<p>According to article 137 (1-1) of 
the Criminal Procedure Code, any 
person who is detained or arrested 
should be immediately informed 
about the reasons of the arrest. 
</p>
<p>The arrestee must be informed 
about the charges brought against 
him/her in the presence of a 
defence counsel, as soon as 
possible.  
</p>
<p>In the case of a preventive arrest of 
a suspect or accused, the judge 
informs a member of his family or 
another person designated by the 
suspect or accused within 24 
hours. The same right applies to a 
person in police detention who can 
ask for a member of his family or 
another person designated by 
him/her to be informed. 
</p>
<p>According to article 143 (1-1) of 
the Criminal Procedure Code, at 
the moment of arrest, the criminal 
investigators have the obligation to 
inform the accused about his/her 
right to hire a defence lawyer, as 
well as about the right not to make 
any declaration and to warn 
him/her that any declaration he/she 
makes could be used against 
him/her. 
</p>
<p>(o) The Forensic Institute should be 
placed under the exclusive jurisdiction 
of the Ministry of Health, independent 
of the Ministry of the Interior and the 
Ministry of Justice. All forensic 
</p>
<p>Very few cases of police ill-treatment are 
submitted to the Forensic Institute, and 
only a medical certificate issued by a 
forensic doctor is admissible in court. A

<p><b>176</b> doctors should be properly trained in 
identifying the sequelae of physical 
torture or ill-treatment. The 
examinations of medical doctors 
selected by the detainees should be 
given weight in any court proceedings 
(relating to the detainees or to officials 
accused of torture or ill-treatment) 
equivalent to that accorded to 
officially employed doctors having 
comparable qualifications. Protocols 
should be established to assist forensic 
doctors to ensure that the medical 
examination of detainees is 
comprehensive. Medical certificates 
should never be handed to the police 
or to the detainee while in the custody 
of the police, but should be made 
available to the detainee once out of 
their hands and to his or her lawyer 
immediately. 
</p>
<p>private physician or a civil hospital 
should, however, be taken into account by 
the forensic doctor when he issues his or 
her own certificate. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur received 
numerous reports alleging that medical 
certificates were frequently falsified to 
cover-up ill- treatment by the police. The 
police may request a new certificate to be 
issued by a higher-ranking forensic doctor 
if they are not satisfied with the initial 
forensic certificate issued. The alleged 
victim may also request the Forensic 
Institute to issue a new certificate, but 
must pay the cost of 8,500 lei. 
</p>
<p>(p) The Ombudsman should be 
granted powers to sanction any official 
who refuses to cooperate with the 
investigation of a complaint. The 
Office of the Ombudsman should be 
provided with the necessary financial 
and human resources to carry out its 
functions. A public awareness 
campaign should be established to 
make the public at large aware of the 
role that the Office can play in 
investigating complaints of police 
abuse. 
</p>
<p>The Ombudsman has the power, inter 
alia, &#8220;to take up and distribute complaints 
filed by persons who have been aggrieved 
by public administration authorities 
through violations of their civic rights and 
freedoms, and to decide on such 
complaints&#8221;. He or she may take up cases 
on his or her own initiative or on the basis 
of complaints lodged by persons. 
However, the Office is forbidden to 
investigate judicial issues and, therefore, 
it may not review a decision of a court or 
prosecutors. The Office may only bring a 
case to the attention of the Prosecutor 
General if this is deemed necessary. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, despite a law mandating 
public authorities to comply with the 
</p>
<p>Some progress was achieved with 
regard to the relationship of the 
People&#8217;s Advocate with the 
executive power, so that it is now 
in steady contact with the Minister 
in charge of the relationship with 
the Parliament, with the Public 
Finances Ministry, as well with the 
police authorities and the 
Penitentiary Administration. 
</p>
<p>Raising the awareness of both

<p><b>  Seguimiento a las recomendaciones del Relator Especial (Theo van Boven) en su 
informe relativo a su visita a Espa&#241;a del 5 al 10 de Octubre de 2003 
(E/CN.4/2004/56/Add.2) 
</b></p>
<p>78. El 23 de octubre de 2009, el Relator Especial envi&#243; la tabla que se encuentra abajo al 
Gobierno de Espa&#241;a solicitando informaci&#243;n y comentarios sobre las medidas adoptadas 
con respecto a la aplicaci&#243;n de sus recomendaciones. El Gobierno proporciono informaci&#243;n 
extensa el 20 de noviembre de 2009. El Relator Especial quisiera agradecerle al Gobierno 
por la informaci&#243;n detallada proporcionada, y le reitera su disposici&#243;n para ayudarle en los 
esfuerzos para prevenir y combatir la tortura y los malos tratos.  
</p>
<p>79. Haciendo eco de las observaciones del Comit&#233; contra la Tortura de 19 de noviembre 
de 2009 (v&#233;ase CAT/C/ESP/CO/5), el Relator Especial toma nota de los esfuerzos positivos 
para reformar la legislaci&#243;n, las pol&#237;ticas y los procedimientos de protecci&#243;n de los 
derechos humanos, en particular aquellos relacionados con la prohibici&#243;n de la tortura y los 
malos tratos, incluyendo las medidas relevantes del Plan de Derechos Humanos y la 
reforma a la definici&#243;n de tortura en el C&#243;digo Penal. Tambi&#233;n toma nota de las 
disposiciones adoptadas para mejorar las garant&#237;as de los detenidos bajo el r&#233;gimen de 
incomunicaci&#243;n. En concordancia con el Comit&#233;, el Relator Especial considera que existen 
dos elementos adicionales deben incluirse en la definici&#243;n para que sea plenamente 
conforme al art&#237;culo 1 de la Convenci&#243;n, incluido que el acto de tortura pueda ser cometido 
por &#8220;otra persona en el ejercicio de funciones p&#250;blicas&#8221; y que la finalidad de la tortura 
puede incluir el fin &#8220;de intimidar o coaccionar a esa persona o a otras&#8221;. Asimismo, con 
relaci&#243;n a la detenci&#243;n incomunicada, coincide en &#8220;que el r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n 
utilizado por el Estado parte en los delitos de terrorismo y banda armada, que puede llegar a 
los 13 d&#237;as, vulnera las salvaguardas propias de un estado de derecho contra los malos 
tratos y actos de tortura&#8221; y reitera su preocupaci&#243;n por la limitaci&#243;n de ciertas garant&#237;as 
durante este periodo.  
</p>
<p>80. El Relator Especial toma nota de las observaciones del Relator Especial sobre la 
promoci&#243;n y la protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales en la 
lucha contra el terrorismo (A/HRC/10/3/Add.2), en particular las relacionadas con: la 
posibilidad de que se inflija un trato prohibido al detenido al mantener el r&#233;gimen de 
incomunicaci&#243;n; los informes de que la tortura y los malos tratos durante la incomunicaci&#243;n 
tiendan a producirse durante los interrogatorios, o en algunos casos durante el traslado a 
Madrid; sentencias recientes del Tribunal Constitucional en las que se recoge la doctrina de 
la obligaci&#243;n de actuar con especial diligencia en las investigaciones judiciales dada la 
gravedad del delito de torturas y su dificultad probatoria; y con la dispersi&#243;n de los 
detenidos del Pa&#237;s Vasco, lo cual presenta un riesgo y una carga econ&#243;mica para la familia 
y en algunos casos presenta un obst&#225;culo para la preparaci&#243;n de la defensa. 
</p>
<p>81. El Relator Especial encomia la inclusi&#243;n de la erradicaci&#243;n de la tortura como uno 
de los objetivos concretos de la pol&#237;tica exterior en el Plan de Derechos Humanos. El 
Relator Especial tambi&#233;n agradece las estad&#237;sticas presentadas por el Gobierno en relaci&#243;n 
con la aplicaci&#243;n de los tipos penales de torturas, sin embargo, agradecer&#237;a informaci&#243;n 
sobre las decisiones del Tribunal Supremo al respecto, debido a que, seg&#250;n los informes 
recibidos, no habr&#237;a habido ninguna denuncia de tortura que hubiera terminado en una 
condena judicial. 
</p>
<p>82. El Relator Especial toma nota con satisfacci&#243;n del Proyecto de Ley del Mecanismo 
Nacional de Prevenci&#243;n contra la tortura que se encuentra en estudio en el Congreso 
Nacional y exhorta a los miembros del Congreso a trabajar para su r&#225;pida aprobaci&#243;n y </p>

</p>
<p>Existe una pr&#225;ctica sistem&#225;tica en el entorno 
de la banda terrorista ETA de denunciar 
torturas, con el objetivo de provocar el 
continuo descr&#233;dito de las Fuerzas y Cuerpos 
de Seguridad.  
</p>
<p><b>2008: Fuentes no gubernamentales:</b> Las 
personas detenidas en relaci&#243;n con el 
terrorismo son incomunicadas de manera 
sistem&#225;tica, a petici&#243;n de las fuerzas 
policiales que los detienen. Al menos una 
tercera parte denunci&#243; tortura y malos tratos 
durante su custodia policial. 
</p>
<p><b>2007:</b> El Gobierno aclara que dicho r&#233;gimen 
se aplica a personas detenidas como medida 
cautelar, decretado por la autoridad judicial y 
siempre bajo tutela de &#233;sta, y no tiene como 
finalidad el aislamiento del detenido, sino la 
desconexi&#243;n del mismo con posibles 
informadores o enlaces, evit&#225;ndose que 
pueda recibir o emitir consignas que 
perjudiquen la investigaci&#243;n judicial. 
</p>
<p>Asentada la base legal de una detenci&#243;n 
incomunicada, esta se lleva a efecto con 
todas las garant&#237;as procesales. El Tribunal 
Constitucional se ha pronunciado sobre la 
adecuaci&#243;n del sistema legal espa&#241;ol de 
detenci&#243;n incomunicada a las exigencias de 
los convenios internacionales. 
</p>
<p>todo caso una autorizaci&#243;n judicial 
mediante resoluci&#243;n motivada y 
razonada que ha de dictarse en las 
primeras 24 horas de la detenci&#243;n, y un 
control permanente y directo por parte 
del Juez de la situaci&#243;n del detenido. 
</p>
<p>El r&#233;gimen es de aplicaci&#243;n 
absolutamente excepcional. En 2008, 
solo se aplic&#243; al 0.049% del total de 
detenidos.  
</p>
<p>La Medida 97 del Plan se&#241;ala las 
siguientes medidas para mejorar las 
garant&#237;as de los detenidos sometidos al 
r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n. Estas 
incluyen: a) prohibir expresamente la 
aplicaci&#243;n del r&#233;gimen de 
incomunicaci&#243;n a los menores de edad; 
b) dar cumplimiento a la recomendaci&#243;n 
de organismos de derechos humanos al 
grabar, en video u otro soporte 
audiovisual, todo el tiempo de 
permanencia en dependencias policiales 
del detenido sometido a r&#233;gimen de 
incomunicaci&#243;n; c) garantizar el derecho 
de ser reconocido por otro m&#233;dico 
adscrito al sistema publico de salud, 
adem&#225;s del m&#233;dico forense libremente 
designado por el titular del futuro MNP.

50 personas detenidas en r&#233;gimen de 
incomunicaci&#243;n denunciaron haber sufrido 
torturas y malos tratos. 
</p>
<p><b>2005:</b> El Gobierno inform&#243; que no considera 
que la detenci&#243;n incomunicada cree per se 
condiciones que faciliten la perpetraci&#243;n de 
la tortura. El r&#233;gimen de detenci&#243;n 
incomunicada vigente en Espa&#241;a est&#225; 
rodeado de las m&#225;ximas cautelas legales que 
aseguran su adecuaci&#243;n a los est&#225;ndares 
internacionales de derechos humanos, e 
impiden la tortura o malos tratos.  
</p>
<p>La detenci&#243;n policial en r&#233;gimen de 
incomunicaci&#243;n no produce que al detenido 
se vea privado de ninguno de sus derechos 
fundamentales, ni la falta de supervisi&#243;n 
judicial que favorezca la posible tortura o 
malos tratos.

<p>La incomunicaci&#243;n tiene por objeto evitar 
que el detenido pueda comunicar a otras 
personas elementos esenciales en la 
investigaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p><i>Los m&#233;todos de tortura incluyen tortura 
f&#237;sica, m&#233;todos de privaci&#243;n, tortura

<p>Pese a que en la legislaci&#243;n espa&#241;ola se

de un abogado designado de oficio, el 
Relator Especial opina que el 
mantenimiento de ese r&#233;gimen resulta 
altamente problem&#225;tico y abre la 
posibilidad de que se inflija un trato 
prohibido al detenido y, al mismo 
tiempo, expone a Espa&#241;a a tener que 
responder a denuncias de malos tratos a 
detenidos (A/HRC/10/3/Add.2).

art&#237;culo 509 de la Ley de Enjuiciamiento 
Criminal, se extiende a un plazo de hasta 
ocho d&#237;as adicionales el r&#233;gimen de

examinadas por un m&#233;dico 
de su elecci&#243;n; y c) el 
derecho a informar a sus 
familiares del hecho y del 
lugar de su detenci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>En la pr&#225;ctica, el abogado 
solamente aparece cuando el 
detenido est&#225; a unto de hacer y 
firmar su declaraci&#243;n formal, y 
no tiene la oportunidad de 
hablar con el detenido. 
Aparentemente se informa a los 
detenidos que hay un abogado 
presente y se les facilita el 
n&#250;mero de identificaci&#243;n, pero 
no lo pueden ver. El abogado 
permanece en silencio mientras 
se hace la declaraci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>Durante el r&#233;gimen de 
incomunicaci&#243;n, el detenido no 
tiene acceso a un abogado y a 
un m&#233;dico de su elecci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p><b>2009: Fuentes no gubernamentales:</b> 
durante el periodo que dura la detenci&#243;n

<p><b>2008: Fuentes no gubernamentales: </b>Se 
observa un avance, si bien d&#233;bil y 
contradictorio. El Juez de la Audiencia 
Nacional, Baltasar Garz&#243;n, habr&#237;a permitido 
en ocasiones concretas que personas 
detenidas bajo r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n, 
tengan derecho a ser visitados por m&#233;dicos 
de su elecci&#243;n y que se informara a las 
familias sobre el paradero y la situaci&#243;n en 
que se encuentra su familiar detenido. Sin 
embargo, estas medidas s&#243;lo han sido 
aplicadas por un juez, no de oficio y en 
pocos casos. Las autoridades son renuentes a 
aplicar estas medidas de forma sistem&#225;tica y 
protocolizada.  
</p>
<p>Ha aumentado el n&#250;mero de abogados que 
han sufrido agresiones o amenazas por parte 
de funcionarios de polic&#237;a cuando realizaban 
su trabajo de asesorar a personas privadas de 
libertad o en el momento de ser detenidas. 
No se presentan quejas formales en la 
</p>
<p>La detenci&#243;n incomunicada solo puede 
durar el tiempo estrictamente necesario 
para la realizaci&#243;n de las averiguaciones 
tendentes al esclarecimiento de los 
hechos y, como m&#225;ximo 120 horas. 
Transcurrido este plazo, el detenido 
deber&#225; ser puesto a disposici&#243;n judicial. 
El Juez puede acordar la prisi&#243;n 
incomunicada por otro plazo no superior 
a 5 d&#237;as. Si hay merito para ello, el Juez 
puede acordar una nueva incomunicaci&#243;n 
de 3 d&#237;as. En la pr&#225;ctica, no existen casos 
en los que la incomunicaci&#243;n dure m&#225;s 
de 5 d&#237;as, y ninguno en 2009. 
</p>
<p>Para lograr un adecuado equilibrio entre 
los intereses de prevenci&#243;n de atentados 
terroristas y la defensa del detenido, la 
legislaci&#243;n prev&#233;: 1) Que la asistencia se 
lleve a cabo por un abogado de oficio 
designado por una corporaci&#243;n 
profesional independiente; y 2) Que el 
abogado de oficio elegido posea unos 
especiales requisitos de cualificaci&#243;n 
profesional.

el abogado de oficio no se identifica ante el

</p>
<p>Existen determinadas irregularidades en la 
prestaci&#243;n de la asistencia letrada. 
</p>
<p><b>2007:</b> El Gobierno se&#241;ala que el sistema 
legal espa&#241;ol garantiza el acceso r&#225;pido y 
eficaz del detenido a un abogado. Desde el 
mismo momento del arresto, se le informa 
sobre su derecho a guardar silencio y a ver a 
un m&#233;dico. 
</p>
<p>La situaci&#243;n de incomunicaci&#243;n en 
dependencias policiales no priva al detenido 
de asistencia letrada. 
</p>
<p>El sistema legal espa&#241;ol no reconoce el 
derecho del detenido a la asistencia por un 
m&#233;dico de su elecci&#243;n bajo ning&#250;n r&#233;gimen. 
</p>
<p>No es previsible una modificaci&#243;n legal a 
este respecto ya que el sistema vigente se 
asienta en la imparcialidad y la pericia de la 
asistencia m&#233;dica que proporciona el m&#233;dico 
forense, como instituci&#243;n adscrita a la 
administraci&#243;n de justicia. 
</p>
<p>La ley prev&#233; la posibilidad de que en caso de 
urgencia, el detenido sea atendido por otro 
facultativo del sistema p&#250;blico de salud e 
incluso por el m&#233;dico de una entidad 
privada. 
</p>
<p>En relaci&#243;n con los detenidos en r&#233;gimen de 
incomunicaci&#243;n, la aplicaci&#243;n de la 
recomendaci&#243;n del Relator Especial presenta 
el grave inconveniente de posibilitar la 
utilizaci&#243;n del &#8220;m&#233;dico de confianza&#8221; para 
transmitir al exterior noticias de la

denuncias correspondientes. 
</p>
<p>Resultar&#237;a ingenuo desconocer el hecho 
de que las organizaciones terroristas 
cuentan con su propia red de apoyo y 
asistencia letrada a los miembros de la 
organizaci&#243;n. La desconexi&#243;n del 
detenido de esta red resulta, en muchos 
casos, necesaria para garantizar una 
declaraci&#243;n libre y sin coacciones. 
</p>
<p>Los m&#233;dicos forenses prestan servicio a 
la Administraci&#243;n de Justicia tras ser 
seleccionados mediante concurso p&#250;blico 
conforme a los principios de m&#233;rito y 
capacidad y a sus conocimientos t&#233;cnicos 
y legales. Ni el Juez ni las autoridades 
pueden elegir qu&#233; m&#233;dico atiende a un 
detenido concreto. Pese a que el 
Protocolo de Estambul no es de obligado 
cumplimiento, los m&#233;dicos forenses 
est&#225;n aplicando las recomendaciones en 
&#233;l contenidas. Si el detenido presenta 
alg&#250;n signo de violencia externa durante 
el reconocimiento, el m&#233;dico tiene que 
hacerla constar en el parte de lesiones, 
que ser&#225; remitida al Juez. El detenido es 
tambi&#233;n examinado en el juzgado de 
guardia donde se le realiza un nuevo 
examen m&#233;dico.

<p>La instrucci&#243;n 12/2007 se&#241;ala que en el 
caso de que el detenido presente 
cualquier lesi&#243;n, imputable o no a la 
detenci&#243;n, o manifieste presentarla, 
deber&#225; ser trasladado de forma inmediata 
a un centro sanitario para su evaluaci&#243;n.

habitual que transcurran varios meses o m&#225;s

formula una denuncia por torturas y el 
momento en que el juzgado comienza la

un m&#233;dico forense.  
</p>
<p>La aplicaci&#243;n de medidas cautelares contra 
los funcionarios imputados por tortura y/o 
malos tratos no es habitual. Incluso en casos 
de imputaci&#243;n, estos son reincorporados al 
servicio debido la larga duraci&#243;n de la

<p>No se critica la utilizaci&#243;n de los

<p><b>Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur (Manfred 
Nowak) in the report of his visit to Sri Lanka from 1 to 8 October 2007 
(A/HRC/7/3/Add.6) 
</b></p>
<p>83. By letter dated 23 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent the following report to 
the Government of Sri Lanka, requesting information and comments on the follow-up 
measures taken with regard to the implementation of his recommendations. The Special 
Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not provided him with a response to his 
request. He looks forward to receiving information on its endeavours to implement his 
recommendations and he reaffirms that he stands ready to assist Sri Lanka in its efforts to 
prevent and combat torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur, who visited the country in October 2007 when the armed 
conflict between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
(LTTE) was at its height, is concerned about the reported continuing application or even 
broadening of emergency laws created during the conflict. Although the war ended, the 
Government reportedly continues to use sweeping emergency regulations that promote or 
allow arbitrary arrest and detention, prolonged and incommunicado detention, and torture. 
The Special Rapporteur on Torture appeals to the Government to repeal the emergency 
regulations or to review them thoroughly with a view to bringing them into line with 
internationally accepted standards of personal liberty, due process of law and the humane 
treatment of prisoners. 
</p>
<p>85. Equally, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about non-governmental information 
regarding persisting impunity for perpetrators of torture and ill-treatment, including 
members of the TMVP/Karuna group. In addition, the Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government of Sri Lanka to seriously consider introducing the recommended safeguards, 
such as the right to legal counsel, access to independent medical examinations, effective 
and independent investigations into allegations of torture, and a functioning monitoring 
mechanism into the legal system. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged by information 
that a draft Law on Witness and Victims of Crime Protection was presented to Parliament 
and hopes for its timely implementation. 
</p>
<p>86. Regarding prisons, the Special Rapporteur was alarmed about reports of continuing 
severe overcrowding, the non-separation of convicted and remand prisoners and in 
particular the detention of children together with adult detainees. The Special Rapporteur 
wishes to re-emphasise his recommendation to legally abolish the death penalty and to 
establish rehabilitation centres for the treatment of torture survivors. 
</p>
<p>87. Finally, the Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate his recommendation to consider 
the ratification of the OPCAT and the establishment of a National Preventive Mechanism. </p>

<p><b>Situation during visit 
</b></p>
<p>(A/HRC/7/3/Add.6)<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Information received in the reporting period 
</b></p>
<p>(a) End impunity for members of the 
TMVP-Karuna group 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was 
concerned about the reported links 
between the Government and the 
TMVP-Karuna group, which were 
confirmed by the TMVP 
representative the Special Rapporteur 
met in Trincomalee. The TMVP-
Karuna group has been accused of 
brutal human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> The TMVP continues to carry out 
unlawful killings, hostage-taking for ransoms, recruitment of child 
soldiers and enforced disappearances. On 7 October 2008, 
Vinayagamoorthi Muralitharan, otherwise known as Karuna, was 
sworn into Parliament, with the full support of the President and the 
Government. As military commander of the TMVP, and previously as 
a military commander in the LTTE, Karuna was suspected of serious 
human rights abuses and war crimes, including the abduction of 
hundreds of teenagers to serve as child soldiers, holding civilians as 
hostage, torture and killings. There has been no official investigation 
into these allegations. 
</i></p>
<p>(b) Ensure that detainees are given access 
to legal counsel within 24 hours of arrest, 
including persons arrested under the 
Emergency Regulations<b> 
</b></p>
<p>The Code of Criminal Procedure 
lacks fundamental safeguards, such as 
the right to inform a family member 
of the arrest or the access to a lawyer 
and/or a doctor of his or her choice 
for a person arrested and held in 
custody. The Code does not specify 
the interrogation conditions and is 
silent about the possibility of the 
presence of a lawyer and an 
interpreter during the interrogation. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Sri Lanka&#8217;s criminal procedure has not 
been reformed in this regard. In practice, linkages between the police 
and criminal lawyers sometimes prevent a suspect from being 
adequately represented. In other cases, lawyers who have visited 
police stations along with their clients had themselves been assaulted 
afterwards. The non-governmental source also quotes a senior police 
officer stating that one of the principal causes for torture was the 
absence of legal representation when a suspect was produced before 
a Magistrate at the very first instance. His observation was that this 
privilege was afforded, if at all, only to the elite. Where the 
emergency laws were concerned, the situation was even worse. Since 
lawyers did not visit army camps or STF camps, persons detained 
under emergency regulations did not receive legal assistance. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Detainees are denied confidential information with their legal 
counsel and interviews take place in the presence of law enforcement 
personnel, which undermines reporting of ill-treatment.</i> 
</p>
<p>(c) All detainees should be granted the 
ability to challenge the lawfulness of the 
detention before an independent court, e.g. 
through habeas corpus proceedings<b> 
</b></p>
<p>Detainees regularly reported that 
habeas corpus hearings before a 
magistrate either involved no real 
opportunity to complain about police 
torture, given that they were often 
escorted to courts by the very same 
perpetrators, and that the magistrate 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Extreme delays in the legal procedures 
in the Court of Appeal for habeas corpus applications have rendered 
this remedy practically ineffective. In the majority of cases, the 
preliminary inquiry before the Magistrates&#8217; Court takes many years 
and applications filed in the 1980s are still pending in the Court of 
Appeal. No time limits for the final determination of these 
applications exist. </i></p>

suspect was mistreated in custody. 
</p>
<p>(d) Ensure that magistrates routinely ask 
persons brought from police custody how 
they have been treated and, even in the 
absence of a formal complaint from the 
defendant, order an independent medical 
examination in accordance with the 
Istanbul Protocol<b> 
</b></p>
<p>Detainees face various obstacles in 
filing complaints and having access to 
independent medical examinations, 
which are frequently alleged to take 
place in the presence of the 
perpetrators, or are performed by 
junior doctors with little experience. 
</p>
<p>The fact that a system of Judicial 
Medical Officers (JMO) is in place in 
the country is a positive sign. 
Obstacles for victims of torture to 
access the JMOs result in loss of 
important medical evidence, 
impeding criminal proceedings 
against perpetrators. There is also no 
obligation for law enforcement 
officials or judges to investigate cases 
of torture ex officio.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Detainees may complain of ill-treatment 
and request a medical examination by a JMO. However, detainees 
rarely complain due to their fear of retribution by the custodial 
officers, to whose charge they are returned after production in court. 
Furthermore, detainees have little access to independent medical 
examinations; in many instances victims of torture are accompanied 
to the examination by the alleged perpetrators. In addition, doctors 
and JMOs often fail to record evidence of torture or provide false 
reports, and some doctors provide treatment to victims without 
disclosing the evidence of torture in official records. JMOs have been 
found to be complicit in covering up acts of torture.  
</i></p>
<p>(e) Ensure that all allegations of torture 
and ill-treatment are promptly and 
thoroughly investigated by an independent 
authority with no connection to the 
authority investigating or prosecuting the 
case against the alleged victim 
</p>
<p>Jurisdiction for offences under the 
Anti-Torture Act No. 22 lies with the 
High Court. Complaints have to be 
addressed to the Attorney General&#8217;s 
(AG) Department. Upon instruction 
of the AG, the Special Investigation 
Unit (SIU), under the supervision of 
the Inspector General of the Police 
(IGP), conducts the investigations. 
The Prosecution of Torture 
Perpetrators Unit (PTP) monitors the 
work of the SIU and the Criminal 
Investigation Department (CID), and 
is also in charge of investigating 
torture cases. The AG&#8217;s Department 
decides to indict alleged offenders 
based on files submitted by the SIU 
</p>
<p><i>NGO: Investigations into allegations of torture are in practice 
handled by the SIU. Aggrieved parties or their family members can 
lodge complaints with the ASP or SP of the relevant area. The 
ASP/SP records statements of the victims as well as that of witnesses 
and thereafter forwards the complaint to the legal division of the 
police. Upon receipt, the complaint is referred to the IGP, who then 
forwards it to the SIU with instructions to begin investigations. Since 
the SIU is directly under the command of the IGP, investigations 
commence only at the initiation of the IGP. The IGP may instead 
instruct the CID or another special unit of the police to investigate a 
complaint. These &#8220;special cases&#8221; are dealt with by the CID, headed 
by an ASP. The SIU is not solely dedicated to investigating 
allegations of torture; it also investigates other offences allegedly 
committed by police officers, such as fraud. According to the same 
information, the SIU&#8217;s cadre is insufficient and its officers are liable 
to transfer. The very fact that police officers investigate their 
colleagues impairs public confidence in the propriety and efficiency </i></p>

<p>and the PTP. 
</p>
<p>The indictments by the Attorney 
General have lead so far to only three 
convictions and eight acquittals. 
Senior police officers with regional 
command responsibilities also 
conduct inquiries into torture 
allegations. The National Police 
Commission (NPC) is in charge of 
disciplinary control over all officers 
except the Inspector General. 
However, this procedure was only 
established in January 2007.<b> </b>The 
legitimacy and credibility of the NPC 
has been questioned because of the 
appointments of the Commissioners 
by the President. The CID was given 
the mandate to handle all criminal 
investigations into complaints of 
alleged torture, other than complaints 
relating to allegations against CID 
officers. However, complaints of 
torture recorded at police stations are 
first referred to the Assistant 
Superintendent of Police (ASP) or the 
Superintendent of Police (SP) of the 
relevant area. The SIU also handles 
allegations of torture referred to the 
Government by the National Human 
Rights Commission, NGOs and the 
Special Rapporteur on Torture.  
</p>
<p><i>of the investigations. 
</i></p>
<p><i>The National Police Commission&#8217;s long-term effectiveness is 
threatened by the lack of a strong constituency supporting its 
independence and by the fact that it has failed to improve police 
accountability. 
</i></p>
<p><i>The police routinely fabricate information and alter reports to 
support their version of the facts. The period within which a crime is 
investigated by the police is susceptible to abuse of the parties 
associated with this process in several ways. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Despite Government commitments to address impunity, perpetrators 
of human rights violations do not face a serious threat of prosecution. 
There were no such convictions violations in 2008. 
</i></p>
<p>(f) Ensure all public officials, in particular 
prison doctors, prison officials and

an act of torture or ill-treatment, to report 
ex officio to the relevant authorities for 
proper investigation in accordance with 
Article 12 of the Convention against 
</p>
<p>In general, the Special Rapporteur 
noted with concern the absence of an 
effective ex officio investigation 
mechanism in accordance with 
Article 12 of the Convention against 
Torture. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Detainees do not mention torture to the 
Magistrate at their first hearing because of ignorance or fear of 
reprisals. The Court interprets this in a manner unfavourable to the 
accused. Often, the wrong person is produced before the Magistrate. 
The Magistrate does not take the trouble to interrogate the suspect or 
to confirm the identification of the suspect to ensure that the suspect 
has not been tortured. </i></p>

<p>(g) Ensure that confessions made by 
persons in custody without the presence of 
a lawyer and that are not confirmed before 
a judge should not be admissible as 
evidence against the persons who made 
the confession 
</p>
<p>Articles 24 to 27 of the Evidence 
Ordinance (EO) do not allow 
confessions in court that are extracted 
through torture. In addition, ordinary 
law provides that a confession made 
to a police officer or to another 
person while in police custody is 
inadmissible before the courts. This 
rule, however, is not applicable to 
persons detained under Emergency 
Regulations. Over the course of his 
visits to police stations and prisons, 
the Special Rapporteur received 
numerous consistent and credible 
allegations from detainees who 
reported that they were ill-treated by 
the police during inquiries in order to 
extract confessions. 
</p>
<p><i>See (b). <b>Non-governmental sources:</b> The emergency laws still allows 
the admissibility of confessions given to police officers above the rank 
of an ASP and imposes a burden on the accused to prove that the 
confession was not voluntary. It has been observed by a senior human 
rights lawyer that in 99% of the cases filed under the PTA, the sole 
evidence relied upon are confessions made to an ASP or an officer 
above this rank. Therefore, persons are charged on grounds based on 
involuntary statements derived through force. Courts have convicted 
persons on evidence of confessions in spite of medical reports of 
torture, the absence of legal representation and the lack of an 
interpreter during interrogation and trial. 
</i></p>
<p>(h) The burden of proof should shift to the 
prosecution to prove beyond reasonable 
doubt that the confession was not obtained 
under any kind of duress 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>(i) Expedite criminal procedures relating 
to torture cases by, e.g., establishing 
special courts dealing with torture and ill-
treatment by public officials 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur is concerned 
about the long duration of 
investigation with regard to cases of 
torture and ill-treatment of often more 
than two years and allegations of 
threats against complainants and 
torture victims. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> There is no constitutional or statutory 
safeguard against protracted trials. Indictments take several years to 
be forwarded to the accused. Even after an indictment is served and 
the case commences in the High Court, proceedings may drag on for 
years, allowing ample time for the accused police officers to threaten, 
intimidate or kill witnesses. The Government has said that the 
Attorney General has instructed his officers to give preference to 
cases coming under the CAT Act. However, there is little evidence of 
such prioritisation. There have been only three convictions and 
several acquittals under this Act. The vast majority of cases remain 
pending in the courts with little hope of a successful outcome.  
</i></p>
<p>(j) Allow judges to be able to exercise 
more discretion in sentencing perpetrators 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur appreciates 
that, by enacting the 1994 Torture 
Act, the Government has

<p>of torture under the 1994 Torture Act implemented its obligation to 
criminalize torture and bring 
perpetrators to justice. He is also 
encouraged by the significant number 
of indictments, 34, filed by the 
Attorney General under this Act. 
However, he regrets that these 
indictments have led so far only to 
three convictions. One of the reported 
factors influencing this outcome is the 
Torture Act&#8217;s high mandatory 
minimum sentence of seven years. It 
is effectively a disincentive to apply 
against perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>(k) Drastically reduce the period of police 
custody under the Emergency Regulations 
and repeal other restrictions of human 
rights under them 
</p>
<p>For three decades, emergency rule has 
continued between intervals in Sri 
Lanka. The Prevention of Terrorism 
Act (PTA) of 1979 was suspended in 
2002 after the CFA was agreed upon. 
However, the law is still in force and 
its section 9 (1), allowing to detain a 
person under detention order (DO) for 
a period of &#8220;three months in the first 
instance, in such place and subject to 
such conditions as may be determined 
by the Minister&#8221;, renewable to a 
maximum of 18 months, still applies. 
Although the CFA provided for the 
temporary suspension of the PTA, 
throughout this time many provisions 
of the PTA were reintroduced under 
the Emergency Regulations and now 
that the CFA has been abrogated, the 
temporary suspension of the PTA has 
been repealed. 
</p>
<p>New Emergency Regulations (ER, or 
Emergency Miscellaneous Provisions 
and Powers Regulations, EMPPR) 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> By Amendment Regulation 2008, the 
period of preventive detention of suspects arrested under Regulation 
19 EMPPR was extended to a further period of six months, where it 
appeared that the release of such a person would be detrimental to 
the interests of national security, thus extending the entire period of 
preventive detention to one and a half years. Such a suspect was 
mandated to be produced before a Magistrate every sixty days during 
this period. After operating for several months, this Regulation was 
suspended by order of the Supreme Court on 15 December 2008, 
which meant that the old Regulations 19 and 21 of EMPPR 2005 
were revived. Accordingly, the current state of the law is that 
suspects are required to be brought before a Magistrate after thirty 
days following arrest and can thereafter be kept up to ninety days in 
detention, in a place &#8220;authorised by the Inspector General of Police&#8221; 
(IGP). Following the expiration of the ninety day period, they must be 
remanded by a Magistrate into fiscal custody. Although the 
Regulation indicates that custody thereafter cannot be more than one 
year, the current practice is that fiscal custody is indefinitely 
extended by periodic remand orders issued by Magistrates. Lawyers 
appearing for these suspects say that a suspect is typically detainees 
for up to two years or more until the Attorney General decided to 
indict him/her or alternatively ask for the suspect&#8217;s discharge. </i></p>

</p>
<p>(l) Develop proper mechanisms for the 
protection of torture victims and witnesses 
</p>
<p>In general, the lack of effective 
witness and victim protection 
prevents the effective application of 
the laws in place. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> The police and security forces are 
known to put severe pressure on petitioners, lawyers, litigants, 
witnesses and families to drop human rights cases involving torture. 
Intimidation of witnesses is a common practice among law 
enforcement agencies. Once accused or indicted for torture, the law 
enforcement officers are kept in their positions.  
</i></p>
<p><i>A draft law on Witness and Victims of Crime Protection was 
presented to Parliament in 2008; however, this Bill has been pending 
for many months in the House. Its range is commendably wide but it 
was also criticized for being seriously flawed otherwise. 
</i></p>
<p>(m) Ensure that the constitution and 
activities of the NHRC comply with the 
Paris Principles, including with respect to 
annual reporting on the human rights 
situation and follow-up on past cases of 
violations 
</p>
<p>The NHRC is empowered to conduct 
investigations into complaints of 
violations of fundamental rights. 
However, it can only make 
recommendations and is not 
empowered to approach courts 
directly. In October 2007, the 
International Coordinating Committee 
of National Institutions for the 
Promotion and Protection of Human 
Rights (ICC) downgraded the 
NHRC&#8217;s status, due to concerns about 
the independence of the 
Commissioners, in view of the 2006 
presidential appointments, which 
were done without the 
recommendation of the Constitutional 
Council, as prescribed in Sri Lanka 
law. Concern was also express 
regarding the balance, objectivity and 
politicization of its work and its 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources: </i></b><i>The NHRC is mandated to investigate 
fundamental rights violations. In practice however, its investigative 
powers have had marginal impact because the Commission has no 
enforcement powers, has been unable to put clear policies into place, 
as well as effective and consistent practices in relation to 
investigations. It also suffers from a lack of resources and qualified 
staff. Its independence and integrity has been negatively affected as a 
result of its members being unilaterally appointed by the President, 
bypassing the pre-condition of approval by the Constitutional 
Council. The current Commissioners have no demonstrated record of 
commitment to human rights protection and are mainly lawyers and 
retired judges. 
</i></p>
<p><i>The NHRC is still under special review of the ICC; until a decision 
has been reached, it will remain under &#8220;B&#8221; status.</i> </p>

</p>
<p>(n) Establish appropriate detention 
facilities for persons kept in prolonged 
custody under the Emergency Regulations<b> 
</b></p>
<p>During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit 
to various police stations, he observed 
that detainees were locked up in basic 
cells, slept on the concrete floor and 
were often without natural light and 
sufficient ventilation. The conditions 
for those held in police stations under 
detention orders pursuant to the 
Emergency Regulations for periods of 
several months up to one year were 
inhuman. This applies both for 
smaller police stations, but 
particularly for the CID and TID 
headquarters in Colombo, where 
detainees were kept in rooms used as 
offices during the daytime, and forced 
to sleep on desks in some cases. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> The emergency laws continue to create 
an environment which permits torture and CIDTP, due to the 
extended period of detention, which at times take place in locations 
not supervised by the prison administration. Under the PTA, normal 
prison rules do not apply. Torture, denial of proper food and 
restrictions on visiting hours are observed, together with deplorable 
conditions at police stations and Special Task Force camps. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Unauthorized detention centres continue to be maintained. 
</i></p>
<p>(o) Establish an effective and independent 
complaints system in prisons for torture 
and abuse leading to criminal 
investigations<b> 
</b></p>
<p>The medical personnel in various 
prisons acknowledged that they 
received on a regular basis allegations 
of torture and other forms of ill-
treatment by persons who are 
transferred from police stations to the 
prisons. In many cases, these 
complaints are corroborated by 
physical evidence, such as scars and 
haematomas. However, the medical 
personnel only feels responsible for 
treating obvious wounds and does not 
take any further action, like reporting 
the alleged abuse to the authorities or 
sending the victim to a JMO. 
Sometimes the guards beat detainees 
if they have done something wrong. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Prison officials admit that torture and 
ill-treatment occurred within prison walls and that there were no 
regular procedures of inquiry and report. 
</i></p>
<p><i>There have been very few visits to detention facilities by Magistrates, 
the so-called Board of Visitors and the Human Rights Commission of 
Sri Lanka. There is no effective monitoring of facilities that 
accommodate inmates detained under emergency law or at police 
detention facilities.</i> </p>

at Bogambara Prison as well as torture 
allegations against TID, mainly in Boosa, 
aimed at bringing the perpetrators and 
their commanders to justice<b> 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur heard of a 
number of instances of corporal 
punishment at Bogambara prison. In 
one case, a preliminary disciplinary 
inquiry was conducted against the 
officer concerned and formal charges 
were to be presented against an 
officer by the Prisons Department.  
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(q) Design and implement a 
comprehensive structural reform of the 
prison system, 
</p>
<p>aimed at reducing the number of 
detainees, increasing prison capacities and 
modernizing the prison facilities<b> 
</b></p>
<p>The Government provided the Special 
Rapporteur with statistics indicating 
severe overcrowding of prisons. 
While the total capacity of all prisons 
amounts to 8,200, the actual prison 
population has reached 28,000. The 
combination of severe overcrowding 
and the antiquated infrastructure of 
certain prison facilities places 
unbearable strains on services and 
resources, which for detainees in 
certain prisons, such as the Colombo 
Remand Prison, where the lack of 
space was most obvious amounts to 
degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> The prisons are faced with severe 
overcrowding. There is a lack of adequate sanitation, food and water, 
and inadequate medical treatment, and the prisoners have little 
exposure to sunlight. The buildings are old, and the possibility of the 
spread of contagious disease remains a serious problem. 
</i></p>
<p>(r) Remove non-violent offenders from 
confinement in pre-trial detention 
facilities, and subject them to non-
custodial measures (i.e. guarantees to 
appear for trial, at any other stage of the 
judicial proceedings and, should occasion 
arise, for execution of the 
</p>
<p>judgement) 
</p>
<p>The Colombo Remand Prison is a 
very old institution and the conditions 
of detention are appalling: the 
institution is extremely overcrowded 
and prisoners are detained in poor 
hygienic conditions. On the day of the 
visit there were a total of 1,552 
detainees. Ninety persons were 
convicted, 1,332 persons were in pre-
trial detention and 130 persons were 
detained under the Emergency 
Regulations. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources: </i></b><i>A large number of prisoners are remand 
prisoners and it is estimated that only 25 % of remand prisoners are 
ultimately convicted.

convicted prisoners should be separated from remand prisoners is 
reflected also in the Sri Lanka Prison Rules 177 and 178. Upon 
admittance of a person into the prisons system, however, there is no 
distinction between the innocent and the guilty. Remand prisoners are 
not separated from those convicted.

<p>(t) Ensure separation of juvenile and adult 
detainees, and ensure the deprivation of 
liberty of children to an absolute 
minimum as required by Article 37 (b) of 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child<b> 
</b></p>
<p>In the TID facilities in Colombo the 
Special Rapporteur met eight children 
who were being held on account of 
being child soldiers for the LTTE. He 
strongly condemns the recruitment of 
children in the conflict, be it for 
fighting or other forms of servicing 
the armed groups. He also deems 
prolonged detention of minors in 
counter-terrorism detention facilities 
deeply worrying. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Section 48 of the Prisons Ordinance 
states that juvenile prisoners, whenever practical, shall be separated 
from adults; Section 13 of the Children and Young Persons 
Ordinance No 48 stipulates that children and young offenders should 
be kept separate from adults in police stations and courts, etc. 
Furthermore, the Community Based Corrections Act. No 46 of 1999 
stipulates a wide range of non-custodial orders for the rehabilitation 
of (child) offenders including unpaid community work. In practice, 
child offenders are kept in police cells together with adult offenders 
prior to being produced in court. Consequently, children are often 
exposed to abuse. Children kept in custody under emergency law face 
even greater hardships. Further, the police hardly follow alternatives 
to detaining children in the police station, such as release of children 
to their parents or placement in a remand home. The placement of 
children in adult prisons pending trial is a common practice, as there 
is lack of capacity in remand homes for children. 
</i></p>
<p>(u) Abolish capital punishment or, at a 
minimum, commute death sentences into 
prison sentences<b> 
</b></p>
<p>The death penalty is foreseen by 
Article 52 of the Penal Code. Murder 
is punishable by death (art. 296). No 
death sentence has been carried out in 
Sri Lanka since 1977. However, the 
High Court sentenced five police 
officers guilty of rape and murder to 
death sentences. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Although Sri Lanka is ranked as 
&#8220;abolitionist in practice&#8221; by non-governmental sources, it has not 
abolished capital punishment in its legislation. 
</i></p>
<p>(v) Establish centres for the rehabilitation 
of torture victims 
</p>
<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> There is no state sponsored system of

<p>(w) Ratify the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture, and establish 
a truly independent monitoring 
mechanism to visit all places where 
persons are deprived of their liberty 
</p>
<p>A number of shortcomings remain 
and, most significantly, the absence 
of an independent and effective 
preventive mechanism mandated to 
make regular and unannounced visits 
</p>
<p>Sri Lanka has not signed or ratified the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture.

No. 8 of 1991 provides for monthly visits to prisons by a Magistrate, </i></p>

<p>to all places of detention throughout 
the country at any time, to conduct 
private interviews with detainees, and 
to subject them to thorough 
independent medical examinations. It 
is the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s conviction 
that this is the most effective way of 
preventing torture. In the case of Sri 
Lanka, he is not satisfied that visits 
undertaken by existing mechanisms, 
such as the NHRC, are presently 
fulfilling this role, or carrying out this 
level of scrutiny. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur welcomes 
information from the Government 
that it intends to establish an inter-
agency body to study possible 
modalities and mechanisms to 
undertake visits to places of detention 
and also to strengthen the capacities 
and efficacy of the NHRC in this 
connection. 
</p>
<p><i>and Section 39 of the Prisons Ordinance empowered judges, 
members of parliament and Magistrates to visit the prisons at any 
time and hold therein &#8220;any inspection, investigation or inquiry.&#8221; 
Section 28(2) of the Human Rights Commission Act, No 21 of 1996 
empowers any person authorised by the Commission to enter at any 
time any place of detention, police station, prison or any other place 
in which any person is detained by judicial order or otherwise and to 
make such examinations or inquiries as may be necessary, to 
ascertain the conditions of detention of the persons detained therein. 
However, current emergency laws allow for detention of persons in 
places other than official detention facilities. By inference, visits to 
such undisclosed and secret places of detention are not possible. 
Though it is provided for by law that Magistrates visit remand 
prisons, this is seldom observed in practice. The Government has 
announced that it was considering the introduction of legislation to 
make it compulsory that Magistrates inspected places of detention. 
Yet, this intention has not been translated into actual practice. 
Officers of the NHRC, even on the rare occasions when they did visit 
places where persons were detained, were only shown the regular 
holding areas rather than the mess rooms and the toilets, where 
torture actually took place. Also, the fact that they have to obtain 
prior permission for these visits renders a &#8216;surprise element&#8217; 
impossible in such visits, which could help uncover abuse. 
</i></p>
<p>(x) Ensure that security personnel undergo 
extensive and thorough training, using a 
curriculum that incorporates human rights 
education throughout and that includes 
training in effective interrogation 
techniques and the proper use of policing 
equipment, and that existing personnel 
receive continuing education<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Human rights education, which was 
introduced into police training in the early 1980s, is a part of the 
curricula at the Sri Lanka Police Training School as well as at the 
Police Higher Training Institute. Human rights and humanitarian 
law also form part of the curricula in the training courses at all levels 
of the army and some courses are supplemented by training 
programmes conducted by the NHRC, the International Committee of 
the Red Cross (ICRC), non-governmental organisations and 
university institutions. However, the quality of the training is poor 
and the training facilities are sub-standard. The State has not 
adopted a national human rights plan.

<p>En 2008, les activit&#233;s de la CNDH, ont 
abouti &#224; la lib&#233;ration de plus de 300 d&#233;tenus 
pr&#233;ventifs dans les prisons du pays. Selon le

de plusieurs actions conjugu&#233;es r&#233;alis&#233;es par 
la CNDH, dont deux sont mentionn&#233;es ci-
dessous: 
</p>
<p>1. Les audiences foraines organis&#233;es en 
f&#233;vrier 2008 avec l&#180;appui du Bureau du Haut 
Commissariat des Nations Unies aux Droits 
de l&#180;Homme (HCDH-OHCHR) au Togo par

retard exag&#233;r&#233;, a abouti &#224; la lib&#233;ration des 
d&#233;tenues. 
</p>
<p>2. Dans le cadre des activit&#233;s marquant le 
60&#232;me anniversaire la D&#233;claration universelle 
des droits de l&#180;homme, la CNDH avec 
l&#180;appui du HCDH-OHCHR a organis&#233; un

du code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale, entre autre sur 
la d&#233;tention pr&#233;ventive comme mesure 
exceptionnelle, ainsi pr&#233;vu par l&#180;article 112. 
Non seulement l&#180;atelier a permis aux 
magistrats de r&#233;examiner les modalit&#233;s 
d&#180;application, mais a &#233;t&#233; suivi par la visite 
des prisons par un groupe compos&#233; de 
membres de la CNDH et de magistrats de 
chaque ressort. Un certain nombre de lacunes

<p>Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a 
constat&#233; personnellement dans 
de nombreux cas que la dur&#233;e

dans les postes de police ou de 
gendarmerie (quarante-huit ou 
quatre-vingt-seize heures) &#233;tait 
expir&#233;e et qu&#180;elle n&#180;avait pas &#233;t&#233; 
prolong&#233;e par le minist&#232;re

Cela signifie que de nombreux 
d&#233;tenus passent de longues 
p&#233;riodes dans des conditions 
&#233;pouvantables sans aucun 
fondement juridique. 
</p>
<p>Gouvernement : En 2008, des mesures ont 
&#233;t&#233; prises pour am&#233;liorer la prise en charge 
judicaire des d&#233;tenus et les conditions de 
d&#233;tention. Ainsi, les procureurs de la 
R&#233;publique et les juges d&#180;instruction font des 
visites p&#233;riodiques et inopin&#233;es dans les 
centres de d&#233;tention (commissariats, brigades 
de gendarmerie et prisons). De plus, 
l&#180;effectif des magistrats augmente de 25 
personnes chaque ann&#233;e (concours de 
recrutement) sur 5 ans suivant les objectifs

qu&#180;aucune condamnation ne 
puisse reposer sur des 
preuves obtenues sous la

claires &#224; ce sujet.

p&#233;riodiquement consulter les d&#233;tenues et font 
des examens m&#233;dicaux et mettent &#224; leur 
disposition des m&#233;dicaments. Le budget de 
la sant&#233; p&#233;nitentiaire avait &#233;t&#233; sensiblement 
revu &#224; la hausse dans la loi des finances

</p>
<p><b>Gouvernement : </b>Le gouvernement 
togolais est conscient que les conditions 
de d&#233;tention dans les prisons restent &#224; 
am&#233;liorer notamment sur les plans de 
l&#8217;hygi&#232;ne, de l&#8217;alimentation, de la sant&#233; 
et du logement.  
</p>
<p>Il existe au Togo 14 prisons dont deux ne 
sont plus fonctionnelles, et le surplus 
carc&#233;ral se monte &#224; 1140 d&#233;tenus. Cette 
surpopulation est due au fait que les 
populations des villes ont connu une 
progression num&#233;rique importante, de 
m&#234;me que la criminalit&#233;, alors que les 
infrastructures restent statiques et datent 
de la p&#233;riode coloniale. 
</p>
<p>Le sous-programme 2 du Programme 
National de Modernisation de la Justice, 
relatif &#224; la modernisation de la 
l&#233;gislation, a pr&#233;vu l&#8217;institution d&#8217;un juge 
de l&#8217;application de peines et d&#8217;un juge de 
la d&#233;tention et des libert&#233;s dans le cadre 
de la relecture et de la r&#233;&#233;criture du code

plus particuli&#232;rement pour des probl&#232;mes

des surveillants des deux sexes s&#8217;inscrit 
dans cette perspective.

les suicides, que certains 
responsables ont interpr&#233;t&#233;e 
comme signifiant que les 
d&#233;tenus devaient rester nus jour 
et nuit dans leur cellule. Or, 
d&#180;apr&#232;s le Gouvernement, la 
gendarmerie n&#180;a jamais donn&#233; 
l&#180;ordre de laisser nues les 
personnes en garde &#224; vue. 
</p>
<p>Gouvernement : Depuis les 
recommandations formul&#233;es en avril 2007, 
les dispositions pratiques ont &#233;t&#233; prises par 
les autorit&#233;s au niveau de la gendarmerie et 
de la police. En vertu de ces dispositions, les 
d&#233;tenus sont dans leurs tenues lorsqu&#180;ils sont 
en garde &#224; vue au bureau en attendant les 
instructions. Lorsqu&#180;ils doivent &#234;tre intern&#233;s 
dans la chambre de suret&#233;, ils sont fouill&#233;s et 
d&#233;barrass&#233;s de tout objet pouvant leur 
permettre de se suicider. Ainsi, ils sont 
gard&#233;s en short de sport ou en culotte, mais 
jamais nus.

carc&#233;rale. 
</p>
<p>Manque de clart&#233; dans le 
partage des responsabilit&#233;s entre 
la police et la gendarmerie. En 
principe la gendarmerie op&#232;re 
essentiellement dans les zones 
rurales, mais la distinction entre 
police et gendarmerie est 
devenue tr&#232;s floue et les deux 
intervenaient simultan&#233;ment 
dans les m&#234;mes zones (en 
particulier &#224; Lom&#233;) 
</p>
<p>Dans les prisons, le pouvoir est 
syst&#233;matiquement d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233; au 
&#171; bureau interne &#187; , c&#180;est-&#224;-dire 
aux d&#233;tenus les plus hauts dans 
la hi&#233;rarchie de la prison, ce qui 
est n&#233;cessairement source de 
corruption, de violence entre

certains d&#233;tenus &#224; l&#180;&#233;gard de

l&#180;Assembl&#233;e nationale et promulgu&#233; par le 
Pr&#233;sident de la R&#233;publique, fixe le statut 
g&#233;n&#233;ral des personnels militaires des Forces 
Arm&#233;es Togolaises duquel d&#233;coule le statut 
particulier de la gendarmerie nationale. Ce 
statut fixe clairement et distinctement les 
missions et les responsabilit&#233;s de la 
gendarmerie. Calqu&#233; sur le mod&#232;le fran&#231;ais, 
la gendarmerie est un corps des Forces 
Arm&#233;es Togolaises dont le minist&#232;re de la 
s&#233;curit&#233; et de la protection civile dispose 
pour emploi notamment en maintien de 
l&#180;ordre pour la s&#233;curit&#233;. La gendarmerie 
op&#232;re en zone rurale. Les missions 
essentielles sont : les missions de police 
judicaire, missions de police administrative, 
missions militaires. 
</p>
<p>En ce qui concerne les prisons, en 2008 des 
nouvelles dispositions ont &#233;t&#233; mises en place,

dispose du corps des gardiens de pr&#233;fecture

des prisonniers sera cr&#233;&#233;e. Selon le 
Gouvernement, le syst&#232;me de &#171;bureau

</b></p>
<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on Torture (Theo van 
Boven) pursuant to his visit to Uzbekistan from 24 November to 6 December 2002 
(E/CN.4/2003/68/Add.2) 
</b></p>
<p>93. By letter dated 23 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent the following table to 
the Government of Uzbekistan, requesting information and comments on the follow-up 
measures taken with regard to the implementation of his predecessor&#8217;s visit in 2002. He 
would like to thank the Government for providing information by letter dated 5 December 
</p><p>2009. 
</p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the various legislative amendments to the 
Criminal and Criminal Procedural Codes, which include the progressive introduction of the 
right to habeas corpus, the aim of establishing equality of arms between the prosecutor and 
the defence throughout judicial proceedings and obliging judges to issue a separate decision 
regarding allegations of torture or ill-treatment once invoked during a criminal trial. 
However, the Special Rapporteur continues to receive reports that show that these 
legislative amendments are not being implemented in practice.  
</p>
<p>95. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that an effective and independent mechanism still 
remains to be established to promptly, independently and thoroughly investigate all 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment. Such mechanism must also be able to effectively 
prosecute the alleged perpetrators, including police officials. In this connection, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that the reported numbers of initiated procedures against alleged 
violations by members of the law-enforcement bodies appears to be inexplicably low. 
</p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to urgently make the declaration 
provided for in article 22 of the Convention against Torture recognizing the competence of 
the Committee against Torture to receive and consider communications from individuals 
who claim to be victims of a violation of the provisions of the Convention. He also 
reiterates the importance of ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention (OPCAT).  
</p>
<p>97. The Special Rapporteur further expresses his concern that in practice non-
governmental organizations appear not to have access to penitentiary facilities for the 
purpose of monitoring, despite relevant orders issued by the Government. He remains 
further concerned that relatives still require written permission to visit arrested or detained 
family members.  
</p>
<p>98. Finally, the Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate his request made in 2006 to 
conduct a follow-up visit to the country to which he has thus far not received a positive 
reply. He believes it is crucial to make an assessment of the various legislative amendments 
and their implementation in practice with regard to the fight against torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.2 and E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.2 
</p>
<p><b>Steps taken since December 2007  
</b></p>
<p> (a) The highest 
authorities need to 
publicly condemn 
torture. They should 
declare unambiguously 
that they will not tolerate 
torture and similar ill-
treatment by public 
officials and that those in 
command at the time 
abuses are perpetrated 
will be held personally 
responsible for the 
abuses.  
</p>
<p> Government: this recommendation has been 
fully implemented as reflected in numerous 
legislative, practical and judicial reforms, such 
as the prohibition of torture contained in article 
26 of the 1992 Constitution, the accession to the 
Convention against Torture in 1995, the 
criminalization of torture by article 235 of the 
Criminal Code; the participation of the 
Parliament of Uzbekistan in the monitoring of 
the Convention against Torture; the Supreme 
Court resolutions of 19 December 2003 and 24 
September 2004 which excludes evidence 
obtained under torture, violence, threats, etc  
</p>
<p>Special units in charge of respect for human 
rights were created in the Ministry of Justice, the 
office of the Prosecutor General, and the 
Ministry of Interior, which deal with complains 
and petitions by citizens, including about 
torture;  
</p>
<p>The Prosecutor&#8217;s office, Ombudsman, the 
National Human Rights Centre and a number of 
international organizations and diplomatic 
missions monitor places of detention;  
</p>
<p>The 2004 National Action Plan against Torture 
guides anti-torture work; 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> The practice of 
torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and 
degrading treatment or punishment was not 
condemned by the highest authorities or the 
media. Official state agencies and Government-
controlled national media still avoid the word 
&#8220;torture&#8221; in their official documents or 
publications. Official public figures who are 
responsible for the investigation of criminal 
cases or handling of complaints and petitions 
on torture or other forms of cruel treatment, do 
not feel personally responsible despite the legal 
prohibition of torture in the Criminal Code. 
Moreover, the practice of investigating criminal 
cases in the system of law-enforcement 
agencies of Uzbekistan, with enormous 
influence of the so called principle of 
&#8220;automatism&#8221; on the system of criminal 
proceedings in the country, in practice results 
in the following: in case a person is arrested, 
he/she would necessarily be accused, go 
through the investigation, face trial, be 
convicted and sentenced to punishment.  
</i></p>
<p><i>Based on this approach, the highest officials 
encourage the use of torture in the system of 
criminal justice in order to obtain confessions 
as evidence.  
</i></p>
<p><i>Concerning the 2004 National Action Plan 
against Torture, a set of formal actions were 
included. 
</i></p>
<p><b>Government</b>: A number of steps have been 
taken. First, the Supreme Court issued a 
resolution on 14 June 2008 on &#8220;The courts&#8217; 
practice of the examination of criminal cases by 
judges related to torture and other cruel, </p>

punishment&#8221;, which obliges judges to issue a 
separate decision in relation to the member of 
the law enforcement bodies who allegedly 
committed the violation. Second, the 
concluding observations of the Committee 
against Torture were the subject of several 
sessions of a number of Senate Committees. 
Third, the Office of the General-Prosecutor 
held a session on the strengthening of the 
prosecutorial supervision (&#8216;nadzor&#8217;) in this 
regard. The Ministry of Internal Affairs held a 
session in 2008 during which questions of 
inadmissibility of coerced evidence were 
discussed. In 2008, the office of the Prosecutor 
received 2222 complaints in relation to 
unlawful actions by members of the law 
enforcement bodies (163 less than in 2007), 
among which 1643 concerned staff were from 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 7 regarding 
servants of the Security Service and 104 
regarding judges. 104 of the complaints related 
to allegations of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
9 criminal cases were opened against members 
of the law enforcement bodies; the concerned 
persons were suspended from their functions. 
</p>
<p>(b) The Government 
should amend its 
domestic penal law to 
include the crime of 
torture the definition 
consistent with article 1 
of the Convention 
against Torture and 
supported by an 
adequate penalty;  
</p>
<p>The prohibition of torture 
as contained in article 26 
of the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>Torture was not 
criminalized with 
commensurate penalties 
in criminal law. 
</p>
<p>CAT/C/UZB/CO/3, para. 5 dated November 
2008 holds that: &#8220;While the Committee 
acknowledges the efforts made to amend 
legislation to incorporate the definition of torture 
of the Convention into domestic law, it remains 
concerned that in particular the definition in the 
amended article 235 of the Criminal Code 
restricts the prohibited practice of torture to the 
actions of law enforcement officials and does 
not cover acts by &#8220;other persons acting in an 
official capacity&#8221;, including those acts that result 
from instigation, consent or acquiescence of a

<p><b>Government</b>: In December 2008, an order was 
issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs on the 
&#8220;Adoption of the Plan for major activities for 
the implementation of the National Action Plan 
for the implementation of the concluding 
observations of the Committee against Torture.  
</p>
<p>(c) Amend the 
domestic penal law to 
include the right to 
habeas corpus; 
</p>
<p>No habeas corpus. Government: Article 19 of the Constitution 
holds that the rights and freedoms of citizens are 
inviolable and only a court has the right to 
restrict them; 
</p>
<p>Presidential Decree &#8220;On the transfer of the right 
to sanction pre-trial detention to the courts&#8221; of 8 
August 2005 transferred the right to sanction 
pre-trial detention of suspects and accused 
persons to judges starting from 1 January 2008; 
it also provides that pre-trial detention should 
only be applied in exceptional cases, when other 
legal prevention measures would be ineffective; 
</p>
<p>Article 286 of the Administrative Code holds 
that relatives and the lawyer of any detained 
person have to be informed of the arrest. Article 
294 provides for the right of a person under 
administrative detention to legal aid at any 
moment, starting from his/her arrest. Article 297 
describes in detail the rights of lawyers to 
familiarize themselves with case materials, to 
file petitions and complaints. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> The situation did 
not improve following the introduction of 
habeas corpus because the judges issue the 
sanctions to detain based on instructions from 
officials of the executive branch. In 99% of all 
cases, the requests by prosecutors to sanction 
pre-trial detention are granted by courts.  
</i></p>
<p><i>The courts do not have the right to verify the 
legality of detention. Reconsideration of the 
decision of the court can be done only through 
an appeal within 3 days. The detainee does not 
have the right to periodically apply to a court 
within a reasonable time period asking for the 
detention order to be revoked; the participation 
of the lawyer at this stage is not mandatory; 
and the hearings are conducted in closed 
sessions.  
</i></p>
<p><i>The judge who considers the detention request 
of the prosecutor has the right to consider the 
criminal case concerning the same individual in 
all instances. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Article 286 of the Administrative Code is not 
applied. Relatives and friends of the detained 
persons are usually not notified, in some cases 
the lawyers are not allowed to be present in the 
courts.

<p><b>Government</b>: The recourse to habeas corpus is 
being introduced in progressive stages. The

<p><b>232</b> &#8220;On the transfer of the right to sanction pre-trial 
detention to the courts&#8221; was followed by the 
adoption of new legislation on 11 July 2007 
which amended, inter alia, articles 18 and 29 of 
the Criminal Procedure Code and article 10 of 
the Law on Judges. In addition, according to the 
amended article 243 of the Criminal Procedure 
Code, judges are now obliged to issue: 1) a 
decision about the pre-trial detention; 2) deny 
the pre-trial detention or 3) extend the period of 
custody for up to 48 hours for the parties to 
present additional evidence.  
</p>
<p>The amended legislation strengthens the 
guarantees and protection of the constitutional 
rights and freedoms in criminal procedures. 
First, it only allows pre-trial detention for 
premeditated crimes for which the foreseen 
sentence is higher than 3 years or for crimes by 
negligence with a sentence higher than 5 years. 
Second, the amended legislation provides that 
the two parties must be present in the judicial 
deliberations on the decision regarding 
measures for pre-trial detention. Third, the 
maximum period of remand in custody is 72 
hours, which can be extended for another 48 
hours on the request of both parties. Fourth, the 
decision of the court to adopt measures for 
detention in remand can be appealed to a court 
within 72 hours of the adoption of the decision. 
The maximum period for detention pending 
investigation is 3 months, which can be 
extended by the court by 5 months upon request 
of the prosecutor of the department, by 7 
months by the Deputy Prosecutor-General, by 9 
months by the Prosecutor-General, and year by 
the Prosecutor-General in case of serious 
difficulties in the investigation. In 2008, 453 
individuals were released from custody. In the

<p>(d) Take necessary 
measures to establish 
and ensure the 
independence of the 
judiciary in conformity 
with international 
standards and to ensure 
respect for the principle 
of the equality of arms 
between the prosecution 
and the defence in 
criminal proceedings; 
</p>
<p>Although granted by law, 
in practice the judiciary 
was not fully 
independent. 
</p>
<p>CAT/C/UZB/CO/3, para. 19: &#8220;The Committee 
remains concerned that there is a lack of security 
of tenure of judges, that the designation of 
Supreme Court judges rests entirely with the 
Presidency, and that lower level appointments 
are made by the executive which re-appoints 
judges every five years.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>Government: The independence of judges is 
guaranteed by the Constitution and by the Law 
on &#8220;Courts&#8221;; the only basis for a judicial 
decision is the law and that no outside 
interference is permitted; the governing 
principles are objectivity, justice, transparency, 
openness and equality of the parties;  
</p>
<p>The &#8220;Concept note on the deepening of judicial 
reform&#8221; led to amendments to several laws to 
ensure the effective implementation of the 
transfer of sanctioning of pre-trial detention to 
courts; 
</p>
<p>The material basis of general courts has been 
improved;  
</p>
<p>Regulations on &#8220;Guaranteeing the right to legal 
defence of detained, suspected and accused 
persons&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> The courts in 
practice do not perform the task of impartial, 
full and objective consideration of complaints 
and petitions of defendants in respect of torture 
or other similar forms of treatment or 
punishment during the pre-trial period of the 
criminal proceeding in contravention of 
provisions of the Law &#8220;On courts&#8221;. 
</i></p>
<p><i>One of the reasons for this situation is the 
involvement of the President in the appointment 
of judges of all levels as well as appointment of 
judges for a comparatively short period of five 
years. Though the law guarantees the 
independence of the judiciary, judges realize 
that their time in office would not be prolonged 
in case they &#8220;offend&#8221; the government.  
</i></p>
<p><i>In practice it is very difficult to find judges who 
act in accordance with the law in pronouncing 
their verdicts; cases are considered with an 
accusatory bias and very often the verdicts of 
the courts repeat the accusations, sometimes 
even including spelling mistakes and misprints 
contained in the initial accusations. The judges 
demonstrate with all their appearance that 
nothing depends on them, that they can not 
deliver an objective and legal judgment due to 
the fact that the &#8220;case is under control&#8221;, and 
the judgment of acquittal will be either 
repealed due to the mildness of the sentence by 
way of supervision on the basis of the protest 
issued by the higher-level prosecutor or court, 
or within one year after its coming into force </i></p>

<p><b>Government</b>: At present, the equality between

order on 23 June 2008 on &#8220;The educational 
research centre on democratisation and the

respect for the independence of the judicial 
system&#8221;. First, a separate information, analytic 
consultative body was established within the 
system of the Supreme Court, which works on 
the development of the judicial-legal reform. 
The Centre is also in charge of monitoring the 
courts&#8217; practice and elaborates proposals for the 
improvement of the justice system. The Centre 
initiated a series of legislative proposals such as 
the strengthening the powers of the lawyer in 
criminal trials, the improvement of the 
execution of judicial decisions and the 
limitation of the powers of the prokuratura in 
the area of supervision (&#8216;nadzor&#8217;) over the 
investigation of criminal cases. 
</p>
<p>In 2008, the prokuratura sent 14.407 criminal 
cases in relation to 21.865 individuals to the 
courts. It closed 1.088 cases in relation to 199 
individuals and sent 415 cases in relation to 495 
individuals to the courts where the parties had 
reached an agreement. The Ministry of Internal 
Affairs opened 30.343 cases in relation to 
38.890 individuals. It closed 2149 cases in 
relation to 449 individuals and sent 9.879 cases

of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, a Central 
Commission on Human Rights was established.

territorial organs. The commissions hold 
systematic sessions on the results of the 
services on the respect of legality and the 
protection of human rights, in compliance with 
the law &#8220;On the requests of citizens&#8221;. In 2009, 
the Department for the Protection of Human 
Rights and Legal Support of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs elaborated a methodological 
guide on human rights, including one chapter 
on issues related to the Convention Against 
Torture. In 2008, the Office of the Ombudsman 
received: 8 complaints about illegal actions of 
staff of penitentiary facilities; 268 complaints 
on actions by members of the law enforcement 
forces and 270 complaints related to violations 
of the investigation procedure. In 2008, the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs conducted 
monitoring of 11 penitentiary facilities and 
SIZOs in which foreign visitors participated.

example, through regular home visits, visits to 
the hospital as well as making regular

their complaint. Independent observers and 
human rights activists can confirm frequent 
cases when an officer from the law enforcement 
agencies, especially the prison guards in the 
colonies of the penitentiary institutions in 
Uzbekistan, are covertly encouraged to use 
torture against the arrested and convicted 
persons, but they are asked to do that 
&#8220;carefully&#8221; in order to avoid traces of torture. 
The victims of torture and their relatives very 
often state that the officers who use torture are 
promoted and continue their service in the

<p><i>Upon receipt of a complaint or petition on 
torture, the management of law-enforcement 
agency traditionally does its best not to accept 
or register such complaint, stating that the facts 
are not true, and that it is the intention of an 
arrested, suspected or accused person to avoid 
punishment. This irresponsible approach 
towards complaints of torture is very frequently 
observed among judges. At best, when the 
traces of torture are visible and they are 
properly documented by the defence, 
disciplinary proceedings are launched against 
the perpetrator, or the criminal case is 
launched on the basis of articles 205 and 206 
(&#8220;Abuse of authority&#8221; and &#8216;Misuse of 
authority&#8221;) of the Criminal Code. The demands 
of the victims of torture or the defence on the

of article 235 (torture) of the Criminal Code 
remain unsatisfied in 99.9% of cases.

This program remains on paper as there is no 
coordination of the efforts of involved agencies 
as well as responsibility for non-
implementation of activities envisaged by the 
program. The agencies have their own units 
that control the performance of their officers, 
but their activity is inefficient, as the 
professional achievements and effectiveness of 
a law-enforcement agency are assessed not on 
the basis of the number of complaints or 
petitions of torture that were considered by this 
agency and acted upon, but on the basis of the 
number of criminal cases properly handled by 
this agency and the number of accused persons 
subsequently sentenced. Such an attitude is 
subsequently replicated in the behaviour and 
activity of officials and staff of the law 
enforcement agencies.

despite the fact that the Uzbek counterparts 
asked the committee to resume its visits, so far 
the ICRC refuses to do so&#8221;. The International

The examined judicial practice in criminal

or accused has the right to be represented by a

after apprehension; the lawyer can meet his/her 
client in private; 
</p>
<p>Regulations &#8220;On Guaranteeing the Right to 
Legal Defence of Detained, Suspected and 
Accused Persons&#8221; of March 2003 provide for 
the participation of defence lawyers in criminal 
cases, describe mechanisms for providing free 
legal aid, establish a procedure for renouncing 
defence counsel, as well as a procedure for filing 
complaints about violations of the right to legal 
defence. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> Arrest protocols 
are often issued in violation of the prescribed 
time limits, as the Criminal and Criminal 
Procedure Codes provide that they should be 
composed immediately after the delivery of the 
person to the law-enforcement agency; 
following the issuing of the protocol, access to 
a lawyer is granted. It is difficult to prove this, 
since the court, when sanctioning the arrest, 
does not have the power to check the legality of 
detention and release the person in case it 
determines that the detentions was illegal.

<p><i>Nobody has the opportunity to check whether 
the rights of the detainee were explained to the

<p><b>Government</b>: By amended legislation of 31 
December 2008, the rights of detained, 
suspected or convicted persons were 
strengthened. The amended provisions of the 
Criminal Procedural Code now provide, inter

know with what he/she is charged; the right to 
make phone calls or otherwise inform a lawyer 
or a relative of the arrest and the place of 
detention; to have a defence lawyer and to meet 
with him/her in person, confidentially, as many 
times as desired and the right to request for the

submission of an application of pardon is 
dependent on the desire of the administration of

of transparency of penitentiary institutions and 
of any public rules in respect of administering 
the colonies in Uzbekistan, it is probable that 
the above-mentioned powers of the

instances of appeal have been exhausted and 
the presidential clemency remains the only 
hope for the restoration of justice, the right to 
appeal for pardon can emerge only after 
serving 20 years.

<p><i>According to paragraph 2 article 136 of the 
Criminal and Criminal Procedural Codes, 
those sentenced to life imprisonment must be 
put in prison cells with at least two other 
persons. Upon the request of inmates or in case 
of necessity they may be placed in solitary

two crimes (premeditated murder under

account all sanitary norms and international 
standards;  
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> A new colony was 
built in Jaslyk in 2008. The Government has 
interpreted this recommendation and shifted the 
discussion on the situation in Jaslyk to the issue 
of treatment of inmates rather than the issue of 
the geographic location of the colony. 
Moreover, in 2008 a new block was 
commissioned in Jaslyk for the purpose of 
holding persons sentenced to life or long term 
imprisonment<b>. 
</b></i></p>
<p><b>Government</b>: The implementation of the 
recommendation to close Jaslyk colony is 
currently not being studied. More than a quarter 
of the prisoners detained at Jaslyk colony lived 
in the Republic of Karakalkakstan and 
Khorezmskoy department prior to their arrests. 
As there are no other detention facilities in 
these regions, it is much cheaper and easier for 
the prisoners&#8217; families to visit them in Jaslyk 
than in other colonies. <b>

<p> Government: the question of making a 
declaration under article 22 of the Convention 
against Torture is currently under consideration; 
</p>
<p>The recommendation to make the declaration 
under article 22 of the Convention against 
Torture and the Optional Protocol (OPCAT) is 
an attempt to impose an unwanted step on a 
sovereign State. Whereas Uzbekistan has not 
acceded to the OPCAT, many measures have 
been taken to extend national and international 
monitoring efforts. 
</p>
<p>None of the Special Procedures has been invited.

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b><i> In November 2007 
the Government of Uzbekistan confirmed that it 
is considering making a declaration in 
accordance with article 22 of the UN 
Convention Against Torture. There were no 
developments or news on this matter since then. 
Rather, in contradiction to that commitment, 
the Government made another statement, which 
indicated that &#8220;the recommendation to make a 
declaration in accordance with Article 22 of the 
UN Convention Against Torture as well as 
Optional Protocol thereto (OPCAT) is an 
attempt to compel a sovereign state to make a 
move which it does not intend to make&#8221;. This is

<p>Government notes that the country ratified the

also provides for an individual complaint

<p><b>Annex I 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Guidelines for the submission of information on the follow-up to the 
country visits of the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
</b></p>
<p>1. Follow-up is a key-element in ensuring the effectiveness of recommendations of 
Special Procedure mechanisms. In this context, all Governments are urged to enter into a 
constructive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on torture with respect to the follow-up 
to his recommendations, so as to enable him to fulfil his mandate more effectively.  
</p>
<p>2. To obtain a comprehensive picture, the Special Rapporteur welcomes written 
information from international, regional, national and local organizations regarding follow 
up measures. The Special Rapporteur encourages information submitted through national 
coalitions or committees.  
</p>
<p>3. A summary of the content of the submissions from non-governmental sources is 
integrated in the follow-up table, which is then forwarded to the concerned State for its 
input and comments. In particular, States are requested to provide information on the 
consideration given to the recommendations, the steps taken to implement them, and any 
constraints which may prevent their implementation. 
</p>
<p>4. For a given country visit report, written information regarding follow-up measures 
to each of the recommendations should be submitted to the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights. Submissions should not exceed 10 pages in length.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur will include summaries of the written information submitted 
to him in the addenda on the follow-up to country visits of the report to the Human Rights 
Council.
