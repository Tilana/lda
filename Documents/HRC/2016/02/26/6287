<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.<footnote name="2">8. In 2006, the Stavanger district court held 271 remand hearings, of which 19 were related to 
custody decisions pursuant to the Immigration Act. The remaining were pretrial detention 
hearings of persons charged with criminal offences carrying a penalty of more than six months of 
imprisonment. Eight persons were released after the court&#8217;s decision.

</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention visited Norway from 27 April to 2 May 2007 
at the invitation of the Government. The Working Group travelled to Oslo, Stavanger and 
Troms&#248;, where it held meetings with Government authorities and civil society representatives. 
It visited 12 detention facilities, including prisons with convicted and pretrial detainees, police 
stations, an immigration detention centre, a psychiatric hospital and an adolescent psychiatry 
facility. The Working Group was able to interview in private 138 detainees chosen at random. 
</p>
<p> The present report outlines the different institutions and laws relating to deprivation of 
liberty and human rights in the context of criminal, police, immigration and mental health-care 
law. The Working Group highlights the fullest cooperation of the Government at all levels and 
spheres. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group commends the Government of Norway for its susceptibility to 
recommendations from internal and international control bodies and courts. The Working Group 
received clear indications that the Government would give full consideration to its 
recommendations contained in the present report. 
</p>
<p> In the report, the Working Group furthermore notes numerous best practices in the 
well-functioning criminal justice and penitentiary systems in Norway which feature 
checks and balances between independent institutions safeguarding against arbitrary detention 
and well-trained and professional prison staff. The legal aid scheme for the defence counsel is 
exemplary. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group recognizes that the Government is currently addressing the &#8220;waiting 
list&#8221; phenomenon, which refers to about 2,000 convicted individuals who are waiting to serve 
their prison terms. It further mentions the traditionally strong role of police which, however, has 
served the Norwegian society well. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group lauds the Government for its policy to avoid taking juveniles between 
the age of 15 and 18 into custody. At present, only eight remain in detention. The number of 
detained aliens is also low. The Working Group appreciates the fact that involuntary 
confinement in psychiatric institutions is the exception and patients are able to effectively 
challenge the compulsory admittance decision before an independent control commission and in 
the courts of law. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group notes the frequency of use of partial or total isolation during remand 
and after sentencing in Norway. The prosecuting authorities appear to dominate the regime of 
remand detention during the crucial investigation phase. Statistics reveal that courts reject 
requests for remand and the imposition of restrictions only in rare cases, either because the 
prosecuting authorities only submit well-founded applications or the judiciary is exercising 
limited control. The difficulties for prisoners in successfully challenging decisions on isolation 
taken by correctional service authorities after sentencing are also mentioned. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group also raises the issue of preventive detention, which is imposed when a 
sentence for a specific prison term is considered to be insufficient to protect society from an 
offender convicted for a serious (violent) crime. The Working Group notes the uncertainty for </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/4/Add.<footnote name="2">7. In 2006, there were 3,049 new remands in Norway, of which 2,<footnote name="9">0. In this context, the Working Group would like to emphasize that there is no right to early 
release on parole in international human rights law as such. However, according to principle 4 of 
the Body of Principles for the Protection of Persons Under any Form of Detention or 
Imprisonment, any form of detention and all measures affecting the human rights of the person 
and any form of detention or imprisonment shall be ordered by, or be subject to, the effective </footnote>77 were new prison 
entries and the remainder of them were persons who had their status in prison changed to 
remand. The average remand prison population was 569. The average length of stay on remand 
was 64 days. Until 27 April, there were 998 new remand prison intakes for 2007. The total of the 
pretrial detention population has remained fairly stable since 2003 (3,<footnote name="5">7. The execution of a court sentence of compulsory mental health care or compulsory care 
outside the criminal law context is governed by the provisions of chapter 5 of the Mental Health 
Care Act and the regulations enacted by the King.  </footnote>50; in 2004, 3,<footnote name="1">6. The Police Immigration Detention Centre in Trandum was established on 1 July 2004, and 
is run by the National Police Immigration Service under the supervision of the National Police 
Directorate. </footnote>77; in 
2005, 3,033). Separate statistics concerning the numbers of remand prisoners pending their 
appeal have not been available.  
</footnote>

</p>
<p>detainees concerning release dates and that preventive detention could potentially amount to 
indefinite detention. It also appears to be difficult for the detainees in preventive detention to 
have a decision to their detriment reversed in court since the judiciary relies on the assessment 
by the correctional services. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group notes that the &#8220;infoflyt&#8221; (&#8220;information flow&#8221;) national database was 
created to raise the quality of information on prison inmates for the purposes of ensuring prison 
security, preventing escapes, and enhancing the protection of society. Currently about 50 prison 
inmates are subjected to this system. This database, which is accessible only to high-ranking 
officials within the correctional services, prison governors and the national police directorate, but 
not to the prison inmates, their defence lawyers or courts. The Working Group argues that access 
to information is vital for inmates wishing to submit applications for early release or termination 
of a preventive detention term. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group finally refers to conflicts of competence between correctional service 
and mental health-care authorities regarding detainees requiring psychiatric treatment. There is 
no body competent to take the final decision on whether the person concerned should be 
transferred from a prison to a psychiatric hospital or vice versa, or stay in the respective 
detention facility if psychiatric doctors and correctional service authorities disagree. 
</p>
<p> On the basis of its findings, the Working Group makes recommendations to the 
Government in the areas of restrictions imposed in addition to deprivation of liberty, including 
the creation of a new system for challenging decisions taken by correctional service authorities, 
and related to preventive detention. It encourages the Government to monitor the development of 
the &#8220;infoflyt&#8221; database and to improve it, if necessary. Finally, it invites the Government to 
resolve conflicts of competence between correctional service authorities and psychiatric 
institutions. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.<footnote name="2">6. The prosecuting authority may, at any stage, decide on its own account, without referring 
to the court, to release the person prior to the expiry of the remand period authorized by a court. 
The Working Group has been informed that use is indeed being made of this power by 
prosecuting authorities.

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which was established pursuant to 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1991/42 and whose mandate was assumed by the 
Human Rights Council by its decision 1/102 and extended by resolution 6/4, visited Norway 
from 22 April to 2 May 2007 at the invitation of the Government. The delegation was composed 
of Le&#239;la Zerrougui, Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group, Manuela Carmena Castrillo, 
member of the Working Group, the Secretary of the Working Group, another official from the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and two interpreters. 
</p>
<p>2. During the entire visit and in all respects, the Working Group enjoyed the fullest 
cooperation of the Government and of all authorities it dealt with, and expresses its gratitude for 
their transparency and collaboration. It would also like to thank the representatives of Norwegian 
civil society it met. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  PROGRAMME OF THE VISIT 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Working Group visited Oslo, Stavanger and Troms&#248;. It visited various institutions 
where persons were detained: holding cells of the police districts of Oslo, Rogaland and 
Troms; Stavanger prison; &#197;na prison; Troms&#248; prison; Oslo prison; Bredtveit detention and 
security prison for women; Ila preventive and security detention prison; Trandum police 
immigration detention centre; Aasgaard psychiatric hospital (Troms&#248;); and the Adolescent 
Psychiatry Emergency Unit (Oslo). In these facilities, the Working Group held private interviews 
with 138 detainees. A full list of the institutions visited is attached to the present report 
(see appendix). 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group held meetings with the Minister and the Deputy Minister for Justice 
and Police and other authorities of the Ministry, including the Departments of Immigration and 
of Correctional Services; representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Labour and Social 
Inclusion; Health and Care Services; the Director of Public Prosecutions; the National Police 
Commissioner; representatives from the National Police Directorate and police authorities in the 
cities visited; Justices of the Supreme Court of Norway; judges of the Stavanger District Court; 
the Chairwoman of the Standing Committee on Justice of the Norwegian Parliament; prison 
authorities; representatives from the National Directorate of Immigration and of the Rogaland 
Probation Office in Stavanger; and psychiatrists. The Working Group also held discussions with 
representatives from Norwegian civil society, including members of the human rights 
subcommittee of the Norwegian Bar Association, the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the 
Norwegian Centre for Human Rights, which was established as the national human rights 
institution on 21 September 2001. The delegation also met with members of the Faculty of Law 
of the University of Troms&#248; dealing with the rights of the S&#225;mi people and of its Centre for 
S&#225;mi Studies. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/4/Add.<footnote name="2">3. The court decides whether the person concerned should be remanded in custody or whether 
it would be sufficient to impose other appropriate measures (see sections 184 and 188 of the 
Criminal Procedure Act). The court sets a specific time limit for pretrial detention, usually not 
exceeding four weeks, with the possibility of extension by four weeks at a time. If the 
prosecuting authority applies for an extension, it has to give an account of the ongoing 
investigation and its envisaged conclusion. 
</footnote>

</p>
<p><b>III.  LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Political system 
</b></p>
<p>5. Norway is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of Government based on 
pluralist democracy. Legislative powers are vested in a modified unicameral Parliament 
(<i>Storting</i>), whose members are elected through universal suffrage. Although the Norwegian 
Constitution of 1814, as amended, grants important executive powers to the King (or Queen), 
these are usually exercised by the Council of State on behalf of the King (&#8220;King in Council&#8221;). 
The Council of State comprises the Prime Minister, who is usually the leader of the majority 
party or the majority coalition party, and at least 7 ministers (currently 17), who are formally 
appointed by the King. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>6. The judiciary consists of the Supreme Court (<i>H&#248;yesterett</i>), which is the highest court in the 
country for all matters, including constitutional law, and consists of the Chief Justice and at 
least 4 other justices (currently 19), 6 courts of appeal, 71 district courts and specialized courts. 
Three of the Supreme Court justices serving in alternation form the Interlocutory Appeals 
Committee, also referred to as the &#8220;court within the court&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>7. All criminal cases are dealt with in the district courts as courts of first instance. Juries and 
lay judges decide together with professional judges. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  National Police and the Prosecution 
</b></p>
<p>8. Norway has a single police service with the National Police Directorate at the top, headed 
by the National Police Commissioner. The Norwegian Police acts under the constitutional 
responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Police. In addition to the ordinary police forces in 
the 27 police districts, Norway has seven special agencies organized directly under the National 
Police Directorate. 
</p>
<p>9. The prosecution authority is independent and may be instructed only by the King in 
Council. As defined in section 55 of the Criminal Procedure Act, prosecution authority is shared 
by the Director of Public Prosecutions and his Assistant Director, the public, deputy public and 
assistant public prosecutors, the chiefs and deputy chiefs of police, police prosecutors and other 
enumerated police officials, and the lensmen.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>10. The Director of Public Prosecutions leads the prosecuting authority by means of 
comprehensive instructions relating to investigation matters issued in the form of circulars.
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Lensmen are public officials in rural districts who also enjoy police powers in subordination to 
</p>
<p>the district Chief of Police. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.<footnote name="2">2. According to section 183 of the Criminal Procedure Act, the prosecuting authority seeking 
detention must bring the arrested person, as soon as possible and no later than on the third day 
following the arrest, before the competent district court. This section was amended by an act of 
28 June 2002 No. 55 to that effect, entering into force on 1 July 2006. If an arrested person is not 
brought before a court on the day after the arrest, the reason shall be noted in the court record. 
Section 3-1 of the regulations on the use of police holding cells further stipulates that arrested 
persons must be transferred from a police holding cell to a prison no later than 48 hours after the 
arrest, unless practical circumstances make that impossible. 
</footnote> 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>He also deals with complaints about decisions made by subordinate prosecuting authorities. 
The Director decides whether to issue indictments in cases concerning &#61472;crimes punishable by 
imprisonment of up to 21 years; crimes threatening State security, the Constitution and civil 
rights; and incitement to criminal acts, blasphemy and breaches of the duty of secrecy (sect. 65 
of the Criminal Procedure Act). Public prosecutors are competent to prosecute cases that do not 
fall under the superior or subordinate prosecuting authority. Public prosecutors prosecute 
criminal cases carrying a penalty of imprisonment of more than six years, as well as those heard 
in the appeals courts. 
</p>
<p>11. Prosecution may be delegated to police prosecutors; indeed, between 80 and 90 per cent of 
criminal cases in Norway are handled by them. The Director of Public Prosecutions may only 
exercise functional control over the police prosecutors, but is not competent to control their 
appointments or careers. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Penitentiary system 
</b></p>
<p>12. The penitentiary system is organized into three levels: at the central level, the Norwegian 
correctional services (<i>Kriminalomsorgens sentrale forvaltning</i>); six regional administrations; and 
local prisons and probation offices. The Norwegian Correctional Services is an integral part of 
the Correctional Services Department of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, and is responsible 
for carrying out remands in custody and penal sanctions. 
</p>
<p>13. Prison sentences and special penal sanctions may be served in preventive detention 
prisons, high-security prisons, low-security prisons, outside prisons subject to special conditions 
(home imprisonment), in hospitals for persons with acute mental or somatic illness, or in another 
appropriate institution. 
</p>
<p>14. Probation offices execute community sentences, ensure that persons released on probation 
comply with their terms of release, enforce conditional sentences, and monitor persons who are 
placed under non-custodial preventive supervision or who are serving their sentences at home. 
</p>
<p>15. Norway has 50 prisons and currently about 3,<footnote name="4">5. Norway has three prisons reserved for women only. In 2006, nine more prisons accepted 
women, either in mixed wings or in wings temporarily assigned to female prisoners. Those who 
are imprisoned in mixed wings have contact with male prisoners during the day, but occupy their 
own single cell to enjoy privacy.  
46. In 2006, 8 per cent of new remands were women; of whom four were kept in preventive 
detention. Approximately 200 women were held at Trandum Detention Centre, 2 of them being 
detained in the security wing. In November 2003, 42 per cent of the patients kept in compulsory 
mental health care were women. </footnote>00 individuals in detention. 
Around 2,000 convicts are currently waiting to serve their prison terms owing to a 
shortage of place. As at 25 April 2007, 19.<footnote name="5">6. Both types of compulsory care may only continue if the condition relating to a risk of 
repetition persists (section 39 (b) of the General Civil Penal Code). The persons convicted, their 
next of kin, or the person professionally responsible at the treating institution may apply for 
remission of the sanction through the prosecuting authority to the district court (sect. 39 (b), 
paras. 2 and 3). Such an application may not be made until one year after the transfer judgement 
or a judgement denying remission is legally enforceable. However, the prosecuting authority 
may, at any time, decide to remit the sanction. In any event, no later than three years after the last 
legally enforceable judgement has been passed, the prosecuting authority decides either to remit 
the sanction or bring the case before the district court, which will decide whether the sanction is 
to be continued (sect. 39 (b), para. 4).  
</footnote> per cent of the prison population were pretrial 
detainees, 2.<footnote name="4">1. In 2006, the average prison population of preventive detainees was 72, of whom 4 were 
women, 3 were serving their sentence in some form of treatment institution or hospital, and 1 
was between 18 and 20 years of age. In June 2007, there were 76 inmates in preventive 
detention, of whom 27 were convicted murderers, 20 convicted rapists, 7 convicted of other 
sexual offences, and 3 convicted of arson. </footnote> per cent of detainees who had failed to pay a fine, 5.<footnote name="6">7. Building new prisons or overcrowding cells are not appropriate alternatives to the &#8220;waiting 
list&#8221; and are not taken into consideration by the Government. Such solutions would undermine 
the efforts of the correctional services authorities to provide for proper rehabilitation of 
detainees. The responsibility of the State towards convicts and the standard of services provided 
to them renders the &#8220;waiting list&#8221; phenomenon virtually inevitable. However, the Working 
Group appreciates the fact that the Government has been addressing the issue through a number 
of suitable measures, including the consideration of early release of prisoners, if appropriate, and </footnote> per cent female 
prisoners, 19.<footnote name="3">5. Section 11, paragraph 2, of the Execution of Sentences Act allows for the committal of a 
convicted person to an especially high-security level department; section 37 allows the 
correctional services to wholly or partly exclude prisoners from the company of others as a 
preventive measure.  </footnote> per cent non-Norwegian citizens and 0.01 per cent (eight male) juveniles under 
the age of 18.

</p>
<p><b>B.  Legal framework of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  International human rights treaty obligations 
</b></p>
<p>17. Norway has ratified six of the core international human rights instruments in force.<b>2</b> It has 
entered a reservation to article 10, paragraph 2 (b) and paragraph 3 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights with regard to the obligation to keep accused juvenile persons and 
juvenile offenders segregated from adults. However, Norway has not made a reservation to 
article 37 (c) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Criminal procedure 
</b></p>
<p>18. The criminal justice system is dominated by the police during pretrial and trial detention 
and by the correctional services authorities after the final judgement of imprisonment. Both 
authorities are highly respected in Norwegian society for discharging their duties in a 
professional manner. 
</p>
<p><b>Detention on remand (<i>Varetekt</i>) 
</b>19. Section 171, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act stipulates that any person who is 
suspected with just cause of having committed a felony punishable by more than six months&#8217; 
imprisonment may be arrested when: (a) there is reason to fear that that person will evade 
prosecution or the execution of a sentence or other precautions; (b) there is an imminent risk that 
that person will interfere with any evidence in the case, for example, by removing clues or 
influencing witnesses or accomplices; (c) it is deemed necessary in order to prevent that person 
from again committing a criminal act punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding six 
months; or (d) that same person requests it for reasons that are found to be satisfactory. 
</p>
<p>20. Suspects of certain serious crimes as enumerated in section 172, paragraph 1 (b) of 
the Criminal Procedure Act may also be arrested without regard to the above-mentioned 
four conditions if they have made a confession or if &#8220;there are other circumstances that 
strengthen the suspicion to a considerable degree&#8221;. When considering the matter, particular 
importance is attached to whether the general sense of justice is likely to be offended or 
insecurity will be created if the suspected person remains at liberty. 
</p>
<p>21. As a rule, a decision to arrest must be made by the prosecuting authority. According to 
section 176, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act, when delay entails any risk, a police 
officer may make an arrest without a prior decision of the court or prosecuting authority.

interlocutory appeals against remand orders, regarding both the initial decision to remand a 
person in custody and the extension of pretrial detention. About 700 of these appeals were 
summarily dismissed. 
</p>
<p><b>Isolation on remand 
</b></p>
<p>30. Always upon application of the police prosecutor, the court may either impose 
communication restrictions of various degrees on the persons in pretrial custody (partial 
isolation) (sect. 186), or, when there is an imminent risk that they will interfere with evidence in 
the case, exclude them from the company of other prisoners (complete isolation) (sect. 186 (a)). 
Contact with the defence counsel is declared sacred by law.  
</p>
<p>31. Isolation may only be ordered upon a prior remand decision by the competent court, which 
must set a relative time limit for isolation as short as possible and not exceeding two (in special 
circumstances, four) weeks, which may be extended for up to two (or four weeks) at a time. The 
absolute time limit for continuous isolation is 6 weeks, when the charge relates to a criminal act 
punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 years, and, as a rule, 12 weeks for 
offences carrying more than 6 years. However, if compelling considerations make it necessary, 
the person on remand may continue to be kept in isolation for more than 12 weeks (sect. 186 (a), 
para. 3).  
</p>
<p>32. According to the statistics provided by the Government, of the 2,977 new prisoners on 
remand in 2006, 1,<footnote name="5">5. Proceedings aiming at the transferral to compulsory mental health care of psychotic or 
unconscious individuals not liable to a penalty may be instituted when it is deemed necessary for 
the protection of society. The decision is made by a court judgement, provided that the offender 
has committed, or has attempted to commit, a certain serious crime for the first time or a less 
serious crime repeatedly, as envisaged by section 39 of the General Civil Penal Code. 
The same provisos apply in the case of mentally retarded persons to be admitted to compulsory 
care.  
</footnote>86 were subjected to restrictions, the most common of which being letter and 
visits control (applied in 580 cases). A total of 72 persons were subjected to partial isolation, 
and 531 to total isolation. Partial isolation never lasted longer than 90 days, in most cases less 
than 30 days, with an average of almost 25 days per prisoner on remand.  
</p>
<p>33. The Working Group was informed by the Government that, in accordance with section 46, 
paragraph 2, of the Execution of Sentences Act, in the case of restrictions on remand, efforts are 
made by the correctional services to increase contact with prison staff. 
</p>
<p>34. Of the approximately 1,020 cases decided by the Interlocutory Appeals Committee of the 
Supreme Court between 2000 and 2006, only 15 cases concerned, among other matters, 
detention on remand in total isolation, and 42 were related to partial isolation in pretrial 
detention. The Committee overturned the Court of Appeal&#8217;s decision in about half of the cases of 
each type of isolation. These statistics have to be considered against the background that cases 
concerning isolation reach the Committee only upon appeal. 
</p>
<p><b>Isolation after sentencing 
</b></p>
<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.2 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>36. The available statistical data on restrictions pursuant to the Execution of Sentences Act 
indicate that, in 2006, security cells were used on 336 occasions, an increase of 18 per cent 
compared to 2005, but a decrease compared to 2001 to 2004. In 2006, the Supreme Court upheld 
a decision of the prison authorities, taken after the final conviction, to have a convict serving his 
sentence in a high-security ward separated from other prison inmates owing to an alleged high 
risk of escape. 
</p>
<p><b>Preventive detention (<i>Forvaring</i>) 
</b>37. When a sentence for a specific term is deemed to be insufficient to protect society, a 
preventive detention sentence in a correctional services institution may be imposed instead of 
imprisonment, if the offender is found guilty of a serious (violent) crime as enumerated in 
section 39 (c) No. 1, of the General Civil Penal Code, and there is deemed to be an imminent risk 
that the offender will commit such a felony again. Alternatively, preventive detention may be 
imposed for the reoffender of a less serious crime of the same nature, provided that the risk of 
relapse is deemed imminent, (sect. 39 (c) No. 2). 
</p>
<p>38. This sanction is the only penalty that could potentially be imposed for an indefinite period. 
When passing a sentence of preventive detention, the court fixes a minimum time limit that 
should not exceed 15 years, and a maximum time limit of 21 years. The court may extend the 
fixed term by up to five years at a time. Proceedings for such an extension may be instituted in 
the district court no later than three months before the period of preventive detention expires (see 
also section 39 (e). The minimum time limit is significant when inmates can apply for release on 
probation. Such an application may not be filed by the convicted person until one year after the 
sentence of preventive detention or a judgement denying release on probation. Hearings of cases 
concerning release on probation must be accelerated. It is also possible to release on probation a 
convict without the involvement of the courts if the prosecuting authority, the prison and the 
probation authorities consent (sect. 39 (f)). 
</p>
<p>39. In principle, persons sentenced to preventive detention must be placed in a specially 
designed unit. Most male preventive detainees are placed in Ila prison, while female preventive 
detainees are placed in Bredtveit prison.  
</p>
<p>40. In 2006, 14 new sentences of preventive detention were passed. All convicts concerned 
had been on remand before sentencing. The shortest minimum term fixed by the courts was 
2 years, and the longest 15 years. It has been brought to the attention of the Working Group, 
however, that, in isolated cases, courts have in the past ordered preventive detention for a 
minimum term of half a year and a maximum term of one year. 
</p>
<p> A/HRC/7/4/Add.2 
 page 13 
  
</p>
<p><b>3.  Detention pursuant to the Police Act 
</b></p>
<p>42. Section 8 of the Police Act allows for apprehension and detention for no longer than four 
hours in cases of disturbance of public peace and order, for identification, or if anyone is caught 
in the act of a crime. The police may also apprehend and take to a police station intoxicated 
persons accosting others or causing danger to themselves or others and detain them only until 
they are sober (sect. 9). Finally, the police may take into custody ill persons unable to take care 
of themselves and who might pose a danger for themselves or others for a period as brief as 
possible, and not exceeding 24 hours.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Juvenile justice 
</b>43. There is no separate juvenile justice system in Norway. Juveniles are tried in the same 
criminal courts as adults, with no comprehensive special legal regime. Some specific provisions 
relate to minors. The minimum age at which a person can be held criminally liable is 15 (see 
section 46 of the General Civil Penal Code). Persons under the age of 18 should not be arrested 
(section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Act) or ordered to complete isolation in pretrial detention 
(section 186 (a), paragraph 1, cl. 2, of the Criminal Protection Act) unless it is especially 
necessary. The relative time limit for isolation of juveniles under the age of 18 is two weeks at a 
time; the absolute time limit may never exceed eight weeks. It is the Government&#8217;s policy not to 
take any minors breaking the law into custody at all; there are no specific detention institutions 
for juveniles under the age of 18. At the time of the visit of the Working Group, eight such 
juveniles remained in detention. 
44. Pursuant to the act relating to Child Welfare Services, sections 4-24 <i>et seq.</i>, a juvenile 
below the age of 18 who has displayed serious behavioural problems either in the form of serious 
or repeated crime, or of persistent abuse of intoxicating substances, or in other ways, may, as a 
last resort, be compulsorily placed in an appropriate institution for up to four weeks with the 
possibility of one renewal up to 12 months. Placement orders are made by the County Social 
Welfare Board, whereby temporary orders may also be made by the head of the Child Welfare 
Administration and by the prosecuting authority. Such orders may only be made if the institution 
has the expertise and resources required to provide the child with satisfactory assistance in 
relation to the purpose of the placement.

</p>
<p><b>6.  Detention of aliens 
</b></p>
<p>47. Asylum-seekers are not taken into custody in Norway pending their applications; they are 
admitted to open reception centres located across the country, where they enjoy the right to 
freedom of movement. Asylum-seekers whose applications have been rejected and illegal 
immigrants liable for removal are, as a rule, not detained. At the end of March 2007, 7,220 
asylum-seekers were living in reception centres, including those whose rejection decision was 
final. 
</p>
<p>48. According to section 37 (d) of the Immigration Act, aliens are as a rule taken into custody 
at a detention centre for foreign nationals, which is administered by the police (Trandum 
Detention Centre being the only detention facility of this type at present), or exceptionally in 
other detention facilities, such as prisons or police stations. Aliens may be detained on two 
grounds: either to establish their identity (section 37 of the Immigration Act), or to effect their 
removal from the country (sect. 41).  
</p>
<p>49. There have been instances of voluntary detention in the past. However, such practice has 
ceased following the recent amendment of section 37 (d) of the Immigration Act, entering into 
force on 1 July 2007, which addressed criticism from various quarters, including the Norwegian 
Parliamentary Ombudsman for Public Administration<b>3</b> and the European Committee for the 
Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment<b>4</b>. The new 
section 37 (d) of the Immigration Act also regulates the rights of detainees and the use of force, 
and envisages the establishment of a supervisory board to monitor the operation of Trandum 
Detention Centre and treatment of foreign nationals detained therein. 
</p>
<p>50. According to section 37, paragraph 6, of the Immigration Act, the total period of custody 
for identification may not exceed 12 weeks unless there are special grounds. The time limit for 
arrest and detention pursuant to a deportation order is two weeks and may be extended for up to 
two weeks, no more than twice. Arrest and custody are the last resort and the court may instead 
impose less infringing measures (sect. 41, paras. 5-7). 
</p>
<p>51. Any arrest of foreign nationals whose identity is to be established, or who are liable to 
leave Norway, is ordered by the prosecuting authority. Where the authority wishes to detain the 
person arrested, it must, as soon as possible, and no later than the day after the arrest, bring the 
person before the competent court with a petition for remand in custody. Only where there is 
danger associated with the delay may a police officer undertake the arrest (sect. 37 (c), para. 3).

<p>52. Detention orders can be appealed in the ordinary court system. Decisions on the use of 
force or other treatment at the detention centre for foreign nationals are open for appeal to the 
National Police Directorate. Other administrative decisions regarding aliens may be appealed 
either to the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration or to the Immigration Appeals Board, 
depending on whether the police or the Directorate has taken the initial decision. 
</p>
<p>53. During proceedings, foreign nationals are entitled to legal aid in accordance with the Free 
Legal Aid Act, when general conditions are satisfied. When the court considers any question 
of custody it appoints a legal representative and orders the State to bear the costs 
unconditionally.  
</p>
<p><b>7.  Deprivation of liberty on grounds of mental health  
</b></p>
<p>54. Persons who are psychotic, unconscious or mentally retarded to a high degree at the time 
of committing an offence and are, thus, not criminally liable (see also section 44 of the Criminal 
Procedure Act) may be arrested under the same conditions as persons taken into remand 
detention, if proceedings relating to committal to compulsory mental health care or compulsory 
care have or are likely to be instituted or a judgement ordering committal has been made (see 
also sections 171, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Procedure Act, and paragraphs 39 and 39 (a) of 
the General Civil Penal Code).

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.2

</p>
<p><b>IV.  POSITIVE ASPECTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Cooperation of the Government  
</b></p>
<p>58. The Working Group was the first mandate-holder to request a mission to Norway, despite a 
standing invitation by the Government of Norway to all United Nations special procedures 
mandate-holders. The Government promptly agreed to receive the Working Group. During the 
entire visit, the Working Group enjoyed the fullest cooperation of the Government and of all 
authorities it dealt with on all levels and in all spheres. The delegation was able to visit all 
detention facilities requested and to meet and interview all detainees it chose at random. The 
representatives of the authorities met were willing to discuss openly all matters raised by the 
Working Group, were interested in its preliminary observations and strived to provide the 
delegation with all the information it requested. The Working Group reiterates its gratitude for 
the transparency and cooperation of the Government. 
</p>
<p>59. The Government is also to be lauded for its willingness to implement pertinent 
recommendations and decisions from internal and international control bodies and courts, such 
as the Norwegian Parliamentary Ombudsman, the European Committee for the Prevention of 
Torture and Inhuman of Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the European Court of Human 
Rights.<b>5</b> The Government also gave a clear indication that it would take into consideration the 
findings of the Working Group in the present report. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Well-functioning criminal justice and penitentiary systems 
</b>60. When the Working Group requested to visit Norway, it was interested in best practices to 
avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. It was aware that there had been no major issues of 
arbitrary detention to be observed since independent institutions in all spheres of Government at 
all levels, with checks and balances that prevent them from occurring. The national criminal 
procedure system functions efficiently and meets international human rights standards. The 
duration of pretrial detention is short on average and the right of the detainee to be brought 
promptly before a judge within the applicable time limits is generally complied with. Detainees 
are able, at all stages of the criminal proceedings, to effectively challenge the lawfulness of their 
detention. Appeal procedures after the trial and conviction in the court of first instance are 
conducted rapidly. 
</p>
<p>61. Pretrial detainees enjoy the right to be assisted by a lawyer of their choice from the first 
stage of criminal proceedings. The Working Group notes that this right to a lawyer is respected. 
Irrespective of need, the State bears all costs of the defence counsel, to guarantee the same 
quality of criminal defence for all. The accused may even decide to change counsel; the Working 
Group did not meet anyone whose costs, in such a situation, the State refused to cover. This 
might well be an unrivalled system and truly reflects the commitment of Norwegian society to 
equality before the law and to the good administration of justice, the rationale being that it is the 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  See, for example, the reports in notes 3 and 4 above.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/4/Add.2 
 page 17 
  
</p>
<p>State which puts one on trial, and which compensates the costs in return. Even bearing in mind 
that Norway is a wealthy country with a low crime rate, this system could serve as an example 
for other States, at least for those with sufficient financial resources. 
</p>
<p>62. Imprisonment means much more than just providing a place in a lock-up cell. The 
Working Group notes with appreciation a policy of real interest by the State in the penitentiary 
system as a whole that reflects the commitment of the Government and all pertinent institutions 
in Norway to provide prison inmates with education, health care and work in a suitable 
environment for rehabilitation without overcrowding cells. The Working Group is pleased to 
note that professional prison staff organize and conduct activities with the inmates, such as 
providing for work opportunities and schooling, which is obligatory for inmates serving their 
prison terms but is also offered to pretrial detainees. In fact, with four years of training prior to 
the first assignment, prison staff are very well trained. The Working Group observed that the 
Government takes great pride in them. 
</p>
<p>63. The Working Group also noted that, as a rule, prisoners do not have to share their cells 
with other inmates. It is aware that, in some Norwegian prisons, this rule cannot always be 
followed. At &#197;na prison, for example, some cells still house four inmates. However, the 
Working Group appreciates the fact that the Government is currently addressing this issue with a 
view to achieving the goal of one inmate, one cell; it should also be emphasized that, in those 
prisons where cells are occupied by more than one inmate, the cells have been designed for such 
occupancy. 
</p>
<p>64. The penitentiary policy, which is necessary to reduce the risk of detainees relapsing into 
delinquency after their release, has a price. Norway currently holds about 3,400 people in 
custody, but approximately 2,000 individuals convicted to serve a prison sentence sometimes 
have to wait for a significant period of time before they are able to commence their prison terms.  
</p>
<p>65. This &#8220;waiting list&#8221; phenomenon has also been fuelled by the Norwegian practice of passing 
rather short prison sentences for relatively minor offences in greater proportion than might have 
been the case in the other countries visited by the Working Group in the past. The Working 
Group was informed that, in some instances (for example, for certain traffic offences involving 
the use of intoxicating substances), prison sentences are mandatory by law, unless there are 
indications that the convict suffers from alcohol or drug abuse. In others, short-term prison 
sentences are handed down by courts following the precedents set by the Supreme Court.  
</p>
<p>66.  The Working Group would like to stress that the system of sentencing appears to work 
well in Norway. Owing to the low crime rate in general, the number of short sentences for 
relatively minor crimes is limited. The incarceration rate is generally low. In a country with 
about 4.6 million inhabitants, there were only 3,393 persons imprisoned as at 25 April 2007. 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>the exploration of ways to increase the use of alternatives to prison sentences, for example, 
community sentences or home imprisonment under electronic surveillance. The Working Group 
noted that, according to current estimates, the &#8220;waiting list&#8221; is expected to vanish by 
August 2008. The Working Group would like to praise the Government of Norway for having 
initiated reforms to achieve this goal in a relatively short time. 
</p>
<p>68. Generally, the Working Group observed a strong role of the police and the police 
prosecutors, who are in practice competent to prosecute and bring to trial between 80 and 
90 per cent of all criminal cases. The Working Group notes that this unique system has been in 
place since the 1880s and has served Norwegian society well. The professional attitude of the 
prosecuting authorities on all levels and of the police is also reflected in the fact that opinion 
polls rank the police as the most popular public authorities in Norway. Democratic values and 
respect for the rule of law are well entrenched in Norwegian society. Arrested persons, remand 
detainees and the accused face authorities in uniform throughout the entire proceedings. The 
Working Group would like the Government to monitor this system in order to ensure that no 
abuse occurs in a criminal justice system that would probably not function as well in less 
democratic societies. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Juvenile justice 
</b>69. Another positive aspect of the criminal justice system is the fact that minors breaking the 
law are criminally liable only from the age of 15. Detention of persons between 15 and 18 years 
of age is used as a last resort. Only eight currently remain imprisoned in connection with serious 
offences. The consequence of the Government&#8217;s policy to do its utmost to prevent detention of 
juveniles under the age of 18 and the lack of special closed institutions entail the consequence, 
however, that these minors are imprisoned together with adults. The Working Group met with 
one 17-year-old who was detained with adults in a high-security prison (Ila prison). 
</p>
<p>70. The Working Group understands that it is a policy decision of the Government to refrain 
from providing for a juvenile justice system specifically tailored to the needs of minors. 
Although the number of detained minors at present is low in comparison, the problem persists 
when juveniles above the age of 15 are detained together with adults while on remand or serving 
their sentences. The Working Group was informed that the issue is under consideration in 
Parliament and that a committee established by the Government, which is expected to finish its 
work by 1 October 2008, will make sure that its recommendations are within the framework of 
international obligations, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Low number of detained aliens 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Working Group appreciates the fact that asylum-seekers in Norway are not taken into 
custody pending their applications, nor are they subjected to administrative detention. Detention 
pursuant to the Immigration Act is ordered by a court within the prescribed time limit of one day 
after the arrest and is used only as a last resort in limited instances and for a short period on 
average. The Working Group understands that insufficient statutory regulations were in place for 
the management of the Trandum detention centre as previously raised by the European 
Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment<b>4</b> 
as well as by the Parliamentary Ombudsman.<b>3</b> The Group notes that the Norwegian Parliament 
has now filled this gap. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/4/Add.2 
 page 19 
  
</p>
<p><b>E.  Efficient control of committal to psychiatric institutions 
</b></p>
<p>72. The committal of persons to psychiatric institutions is the exception, not the rule. Patients 
are able to effectively challenge the decision before an independent control commission, and, in 
case of a negative outcome, before the ordinary civil courts. The control commission, which is 
chaired by a lawyer (who is qualified to serve as a judge), also consists of a physician and two 
lay persons, one of whom has personally been under mental health care or is a close relative of a 
patient or has represented the interests of the patient in his or her occupation or function. This 
composition ensures the legality of the process of compulsory admittance to mental health-care 
institutions. Even after submission, any extension of compulsory treatment or the release of the 
patient is decided by the commission. The system takes into account the sensitivity of the issue, 
allowing for the participation of persons who have been affected by mental diseases themselves 
in one way or another. At all stages of the proceedings, patients enjoy the assistance of a lawyer 
of their choice and the State covers all costs. It is a system strongly recommended for imitation 
by other States. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  ISSUES OF CONCERN 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Detention within the criminal justice context 
1.  Isolation in pretrial detention and during imprisonment 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Working Group is generally concerned at the frequency of the use of isolation in 
detention, both in remand and after sentencing. When in remand during the ongoing 
investigation, defendants may find themselves in partial or complete isolation, ordered by the 
competent court at the request of the police and prosecutors. Total isolation entails being locked 
up in a cell without any contact with other prison inmates or the outside world (television, radio 
or newspapers), except for a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>74. The Working Group recognizes that there are different systems of investigation and that, at 
times, it might be necessary to isolate in order to prevent interference with evidence. Such 
restrictive measures, however, must be decided upon on a case by case basis, when an 
assessment of the facts of each case indicates the requirement for isolation, and not on the mere 
basis of categories of charges or offences. Isolation and restrictions imposed upon pretrial 
detainees can be considered severe treatment that may weaken their position at a very important 
stage of the investigation, when the police are gathering evidence in order to bring charges 
against them. Albeit ordered by a court of law, the investigating authorities appear to dominate 
decisions on the regime of detention, because they enjoy the power to end restrictive regimes of 
detention without referring to the court. There is a risk that this power could be used to obtain 
information or to extract confessions from remand prisoners. 
</p>
<p>75. The statistics outlined above indicate that, since 2003, between 37 and 53 per cent of all 
new remand prisoners were subjected to some kind of restrictions, and that between 0.02 and 
3 per cent are subject to partial isolation, and between 11.62 and 17.<footnote name="8">9. The Working Group is by no means arguing that the database should be abolished. It 
serves an important purpose as far as security is concerned and increases the availability, 
reliability and quality of information. However, if information is also used to reject applications 
for release and, in certain instances, to impose restrictions or partial or total isolation upon the 
prisoner concerned, and the prison inmates are not aware of the information the State is holding 
against them, then the situation affects the right of the detainees to challenge the legality of the 
regime of detention. 
</footnote>4 per cent were subjected to 
total isolation. These are a comparably high numbers. In the light of an earlier visit of the 
European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment to Norway in 1999, the Director of Public Prosecutions conducted a survey on the 
use of restrictions in connection with remand in custody for that year. One conclusion of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.2 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>survey was that, in 53 per cent of the cases, no special grounds for applications for restrictions 
were given by the prosecution authorities although expressly required by criminal procedure law 
and reiterated in a directive issued by the Director of Public Prosecution. However, in the same 
period, only 7 per cent of the applications by the prosecuting authority for restrictions were 
rejected by the courts in full and 28 per cent in part. The survey also showed that, in 54 per cent 
of all cases, restrictions were applied for detainees charged with drug offences. 
</p>
<p>76. In Norway, the Working Group was able to meet with several detainees associated with the 
notorious NOKAS case, an armed robbery which led to the killing of a policeman in Stavanger. 
Many of the detainees had been isolated for several years until the first verdict was reached. At 
Ila prison, the delegation met with a man who had confessed to murder, but was nonetheless 
subjected to total isolation for more than a year. The Working Group has also been informed of 
cases in which the persons concerned find themselves in total isolation for two or three years. 
</p>
<p>77. The Working Group notes that statistical data for 2003 and 2007 indicate that only in rare 
cases do the District Courts reject an application for a person to be remanded in custody and 
subjected to restrictions by the (police) prosecuting authorities and that few appeals by the 
pretrial detainees concerned are successful. In the light of the survey conducted by the Director 
of Public Prosecution in 1999, two possible reasons are behind this situation: either the situation 
has improved and the prosecuting authorities largely present sound and well-founded 
applications in line with circular No. 4/2006 from the Director of Public Prosecution, indicating 
the reasons why detention on remand and restrictions or isolation is necessary; or the judiciary 
still exercises only limited control and readily adheres to the assessment of the prosecuting 
authorities as to whether the applicable criteria have been met. Since the Working Group lacks 
information on the relationship between the reasons given in the application for restrictions on 
remand and their acceptance or full or partial rejection by the courts, no definite answer may be 
provided. 
</p>
<p>78. The Working Group also met with convicted prisoners serving part of their terms in 
isolation on the basis of a decision of the prison authorities invoking their discretionary powers; 
for security or behavioural reasons; or because they belonged to certain categories of persons 
convicted of serious crimes. It is difficult for the detainees concerned to successfully challenge 
the decision taken by the prison authorities. The regional correctional services authorities seldom 
reverse a decision taken by the prison authorities. Outside the powerful correctional services, 
there is no automatic control system in place with the authority to quash decisions; convicted 
persons themselves have to file an application before the ordinary civil courts for revocation. The 
civil courts, acting in the context of review of administrative decisions rather than in one of a 
specific criminal law, rarely decide in favour of the applicant because the correctional services 
authorities are endowed with wide discretionary powers. Court proceedings are slow and 
cumbersome, and therefore do not provide an effective or timely remedy. The Working Group 
did not observe any situation in which the correctional services authorities had taken 
questionable decisions in this respect. However, there does not appear to be an effective, 
institutionalized and external control mechanism in place, as is the case in many other legal 
systems throughout the world. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/4/Add.2 
 page 21 
  
</p>
<p><b>2.  Preventive detention 
</b></p>
<p>79. Another issue of concern for the Working Group is the situation of prisoners sentenced to 
preventive detention, especially with regard to the broad discretionary powers of the prison 
authorities attached to the system and the extent of control by the courts. 
</p>
<p>80. The system of preventive detention as it applies today was introduced in 2001 and 2002 to 
replace the old system. It is aimed at protecting society from serious and violent offenders when 
there is a high risk of repeated offence, so that an ordinary fixed prison term with subsequent 
unconditional release is considered to be insufficient to protect society at large. Most of the 
77 prisoners sentenced to preventive detention in Norway (67) are kept at Ila prison. Their 
characteristics include a low level of education, no social network, psychiatric disorder and/or 
poor social skills, but also their vulnerability to assault or abuse by others. The average time 
spent in preventive detention is currently 10 years. 
</p>
<p>81. Compared to the former system, one improvement is that it is now up to the courts rather 
than the Ministry of Justice to decide about release on probation after the minimum preventive 
sentence has been served. The Working Group would also like to emphasize that it witnessed 
that a variety of programmes at Ila prison were implemented in order to treat preventive 
detainees and prepare them for release, notwithstanding the limited potential for change and 
improvement of many prisoners detained there. Often mental health-care institutions or ordinary 
prisons would not be the appropriate venue owing to security reasons. 
</p>
<p>82. The Working Group would like, however, to raise the issue of preventive detention for a 
number of reasons. Preventive detention could, in the extreme, amount to indefinite detention. 
The Working Group was informed about one former prison inmate at Ila prison who died in 
custody of old age. A related matter is the lack of certainty about the date of release, if any, for 
prisoners necessarily attached to a system of preventive detention with a minimum and a 
maximum period of time to be served in prison, if the maximum term can be prolonged 
potentially indefinitely. The Working Group is also troubled by the information it received on 
the case of a 17-year-old boy, charged with arson, for whom the Public Prosecutor sought and 
received a preventive detention sentence by the District Court, a decision which was, however, 
reversed on appeal. The boy had already spent six months at Ila prison. The Working Group was 
also informed about a case for which the court had set a minimum term of six months and a 
maximum of one year. It is questionable whether such preventive detention sentences foster the 
aim of protecting society at all and what treatment would be available for such persons in a 
preventive detention facility. Finally, even if the courts ultimately decide on the release, stay or 
extension of the maximum term, the judiciary has to rely on the assessment and information 
provided by the correctional services authorities. It also appears to be difficult for the prisoners 
concerned to have decisions to their detriment reversed on appeal. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  &#8220;Infoflyt&#8221; system 
</b></p>
<p>83. &#8220;Infoflyt&#8221; (loosely translated as &#8220;information flow&#8221;) is a national database that contains 
classified information on certain persons in detention. The Working Group was informed that 
about 50 prison inmates throughout the country are currently listed in the system, most of them </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>were alleged political extremists, terrorists or detainees related to organized crime, and that the 
figures were constantly growing. The Working Group was able to interview some of these 
detainees during its visit. 
</p>
<p>84. The database was set up in order to raise the quality of information on prison inmates, for 
the purposes of maintaining prison security, preventing escapes and enhancing the protection of 
society. Before the establishment of &#8220;infoflyt&#8221;, the information contained therein was exchanged 
by the police and the intelligence services and other pertinent authorities in a less systematic 
manner. 
</p>
<p>85. This information, however, does not only form the basis for decisions taken by the prison 
authorities to impose restrictions upon inmates up to the point of total isolation in order to 
maintain safety and security inside and outside the prison; it also becomes relevant when 
prisoners are, in principle, eligible for early release, usually after having served two thirds of 
their prison term, and for those in preventive detention. 
</p>
<p>86. Only a few high-ranking officials within the Norwegian correctional services at central 
level, the prison governor as head of the prison, and the National Police Directorate have access 
to the database. Access to the persons concerned or their lawyers may be granted in exceptional 
circumstances only. Norwegian courts do not have access. The Supreme Court of Norway has 
accepted this scheme. 
</p>
<p>87. Access to information is vital for prison inmates when they apply for early release or 
termination of a preventive detention term. Without disclosure of the information that the State 
holds against them, the persons concerned are not in a position to assess or dispute allegations, 
given that even the deciding judge has no access to the information. 
88. The Working Group understands that the only external control mechanism in place at 
present is the mandate of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, who is able to consult the database, but 
may not disclose any information contained therein. Moreover, the Ombudsman, although his 
mandate allows him to receive and act upon individual complaints, is not in a position to provide 
for an effective remedy to the detainees, since he is answerable solely to Parliament. 
</p>

</p>
<p>control of a judicial or other authority.<b>6</b> Consequently, the Working Group, in its opinion 
No. 34/2000<b>7</b> stated that the extension by two years of a prison term, three times by a parole 
board after the minimum term had been served, despite the outstanding behavioural record of the 
person concerned without giving substantive reasons, and in the absence of effective judicial 
review, amounted to arbitrary detention. Although that case differs from the present concern of 
the Working Group in that all information was available in the latter, the principles developed in 
the Working Group&#8217;s opinion apply even more so if not all pertinent information, which does not 
require classification, is known to the prisoner or the courts. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Detention outside the criminal justice context 
Conflicts of competence between correctional and mental health-care services 
</b></p>
<p>91. During its visit, the Working Group interviewed an inmate held in an ordinary prison who 
was sentenced for murdering his wife and who had obviously developed deteriorating psychiatric 
disturbances while in detention. The prison governor believed that the inmate would receive 
better mental treatment in a psychiatric institution and had sought his transfer there. The 
external psychiatric doctors treating him in prison apparently held the opinion that he should 
stay and receive treatment there. For the safety of his co-inmates, the convict was put into 
isolation. 
</p>
<p>92. The Working Group also received information about a prisoner whom the treating 
psychiatric doctors would like to see admitted to a psychiatric institution with a closed wing, 
where the patient could, in the view of the doctors, receive more appropriate treatment. 
However, the prison authorities refused to agree to a transfer for fear of the prisoner absconding. 
</p>
<p>93. During its visit, the Working Group received first-hand information and discussed with the 
competent Norwegian authorities a case that featured prominently in the media: that of an inmate 
at Ila prison, who had developed an acute psychosis that required his fixation on a stretcher. 
Despite the prison governor urging that the prisoner be transferred to a psychiatric hospital, the 
mental health-care authorities initially refused to receive him for safety reasons. The inmate was 
transferred only after the involvement of the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health and 
Care Services and after a week had passed. 
</p>
<p>94. The Working Group notes that it is the Government&#8217;s policy to avoid treatment of persons 
with mental health problems inside psychiatric institutions as far as possible. The committal of 
persons to psychiatric hospitals is resorted to only when absolutely necessary and for a limited 
period of time. Moreover, it is the Government&#8217;s position that mentally ill convicts should 
receive treatment in psychiatric institutions rather than in prison. While the Working Group 
supports that approach, however, it believes that the policy should not produce the results

<p>illustrated by the three cases described above. Apparently, there is no established body with the 
authority to take a final decision as to whether a person should be treated in a psychiatric hospital 
or remain in prison and be treated there, for example for safety reasons or to prevent an escape. 
At present, it appears that both services have to reach a mutual agreement. The consequence is 
that those who are concerned find themselves between two stools. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>95. The Working Group expresses its thanks to the Government of Norway for extending the 
invitation to visit the country and for providing the fullest cooperation conceivable before, 
during and after the visit. 
</p>
<p>96. During its mission, the Working Group observed a number of best practices in Norway 
designed to safeguard against arbitrary detention. They include a well-functioning criminal 
justice and penitentiary system in general and a remarkable legal-aid scheme, a true commitment 
to rehabilitation of prisoners, very few juveniles in custody, a low number of foreign nationals in 
detention awaiting their removal from the country and an efficient control mechanism in place 
with regard to committal to psychiatric institutions. The Working Group did not find any major 
issues of arbitrary detention. 
</p>
<p>97. The Working Group notes that the Government is well aware of the remaining areas where 
there is room for improvement to the system governing deprivation of liberty identified in the 
present report. The Working Group appreciates that those areas are being addressed. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> On the basis of its findings, the Working Group makes the following 
recommendations to the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Working Group encourages the Government to continue to monitor the 
practice of imposing restrictions and deprivation of liberty to ensure that it is carried out 
on a case by case basis. In this context, it invites the Government to arrange a survey by the 
Director of Public Prosecution on applications for remand and restrictions and partial and 
complete isolation in pretrial detention to follow up on the survey conducted in 1999 on the 
initiative of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The Working Group would like to be informed of 
the results; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The Working Group also invites the Government to consider establishing a new 
system for challenging decisions taken by the correctional services authorities on 
restrictions or partial or total isolation imposed upon prison inmates serving their 
sentences. The Government might want to create an external commission to that effect 
following the example of the independent control commission for patients subjected to 
compulsory mental-health care; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The Working Group supports the establishment of a working group by the 
Ministry of Justice mandated to evaluate the current system of preventive detention. The 
Working Group would like to receive its report; </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/7/4/Add.2 
 page 25 
  
</p>
<p><b> (d) With respect to the &#8220;infoflyt&#8221; database, the Working Group recommends that 
the judiciary be granted access to the information as and when the information contained 
therein is relevant to decisions on the early release of a prisoner or on the release of a 
preventive detainee. The Working Group invites the Government to continue to monitor 
the development of the database and its use and to improve the system, if necessary; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The Working Group recommends that the Government resolve conflicts of 
competence between correctional service and health-care authorities with respect to the 
admission of mentally ill prison inmates to psychiatric hospitals. This could be achieved by 
creating an independent commission in which all stakeholders are represented. The 
commission could also take a final decision as to whether the person transferred from a 
prison to a psychiatric institution will be allowed to be transferred from a closed wing to an 
open wing in the context of treatment. </b></p>
