<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times

Restructuring Support Agreement, certain lenders under the RBL Facility agreed 
to provide
the DIP Facility to the Debtors pursuant to the terms of a DIP Facility credit 
agreement. The DIP Facility was approved by the Bankruptcy Court and provides 
for a multi-draw senior secured superpriority term loan credit facility in the 
aggregate
amount of up to $25 million. Pursuant to the Plan, any amounts outstanding under
the DIP Facility will be paid in full in cash upon emergence. The Company has 
not drawn any amounts from the DIP Facility and does not expect to do so prior 
to
emergence.<B> </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-
size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Backstop Commitment 
Agreement.</B>&nbsp;In connection with the Restructuring Support Agreement, the 
Company entered into a backstop
commitment agreement (the &#147;Backstop Commitment Agreement&#148;), attached 
as Exhibit C to the Restructuring Support Agreement, with the commitment parties
thereto (collectively, the &#147;Backstop Parties&#148;), pursuant to which 
certain
holders of the Notes (in their capacity as Backstop Parties) agreed to provide a
$50.0 million&nbsp;commitment to backstop the Rights Offering. Under the 
Backstop Commitment Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay the Backstop 
Parties, on the
closing date of the transactions contemplated by the Backstop Commitment 
Agreement, a commitment premium equal to&nbsp;6.0 percent&nbsp;of the Rights 
Offering Amount (as defined below) (the &#147;Commitment Premium&#148;). If the 
transactions
contemplated by the Backstop Commitment Agreement are consummated, the 
Commitment Premium will be payable in shares of New Common Stock (as defined 
below). The Company would instead be required to pay, in cash, a termination fee
equal to&nbsp;4.0
percent&nbsp;of the Rights Offering Amount upon the occurrence of certain 
termination events as set forth in the Backstop Commitment Agreement. Pursuant 
to the Backstop Commitment Agreement, the Company will also be required to 
(A)&nbsp;reimburse
the Backstop Parties (i)&nbsp;for reasonable and documented fees and expenses of
counsel, consultants and a financial advisor, and any other advisors or 
consultants as may be reasonably determined by holders of the Notes that are 
party to the
Restructuring Support Agreement and the Backstop Parties, in consultation with 
the Company, and (ii)&nbsp;for filing fees, if any, required by antitrust laws 
and reasonable and documented expenses related to such filings and 
(B)&nbsp;indemnify the
Backstop Parties under certain circumstances for losses arising out of the 
Backstop Commitment Agreement, the Plan and the transactions contemplated 
thereby. </P>

Backstop Commitment Agreement, and the Rights
Offering Procedures, the Company is offering eligible creditors, including the 
Backstop Parties, shares of New Common Stock of the reorganized Company upon 
emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases for an aggregate purchase price of 
approximately $50
million&nbsp;(the &#147;Rights Offering Amount&#148;). Pursuant to the Backstop 
Commitment Agreement, the Backstop Parties have agreed to purchase all shares of
New Common Stock that are not duly subscribed for pursuant to the Rights 
Offering
Procedures at a per share purchase price equal to approximately $50&nbsp;million
divided by the total number of shares allocated to new money contributions
(without giving effect to the common stock issued or issuable under the Rights 
Offering or in
respect of the Commitment Premium or in respect of the Management Incentive Plan
(as defined below)).<B> </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt;

Confirmation Order, the rights to purchase New Common Stock in the Rights

Backstop Parties pursuant to the Backstop Commitment Agreement will be issued in
reliance upon
the exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended 
(the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), provided by Section&nbsp;4(a)(2) thereof 
and/or Regulation D thereunder. As a condition to the closing of the 
transactions contemplated by
the Backstop Commitment Agreement, the Company will enter into a registration 
rights agreement with certain of the Backstop Parties entitling such Backstop 
Parties to request that the Company register their securities for sale under the
Securities
Act at various times. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-

to backstop the Rights Offering, and the other transactions contemplated by the 
Backstop
Commitment Agreement, are conditioned upon the satisfaction of all conditions 
precedent to the effectiveness of the Plan, and other applicable conditions 
precedent set forth in the Backstop Commitment Agreement. The issuances of New 
Common Stock
pursuant to the Rights Offering and the Backstop Commitment Agreement are 
subject to certain conditions, and will be effective upon our emergence from the
Chapter 11 Cases. </P>

providing for certain shareholders&#146; rights, including minority shareholder 
protections (including amendment provisions relating to such minority 
shareholder
protections).<B> </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-

Date, the Company expects to enter into a new four-year senior secured revolving
credit
facility (the &#147;Exit Facility&#148;), which is intended to provide up to 
$200 million in borrowing commitments. The initial borrowing base under the Exit
Facility is expected to be $128 million. As contemplated in the Plan and 
depending upon the

certain notice procedures and transfer restrictions on the trading of the

Debtors also own oil

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Operating and market conditions in the oil and gas 
industry have undergone a profound transformation in recent years. In the fall 
of 2014, oil
prices plummeted due principally to global oversupply and have yet to 
recover&#151; falling from over $100 Bbl<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-
align:top">4</SUP> to below $27 per Bbl in February 2016 and currently trading 
at approximately $46 per
Bbl. Simultaneously, natural gas prices, in response to continued growth in 
domestic production and unseasonably mild weather, sustained a marked 
decline&#151;falling below $1.70 per MMBtu<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-
align:top">5</SUP> in
December 2015 and are currently trading at approximately $2.16 per MMBtu. In 
response, upstream producers in the Eagle Ford and across the United States have
experienced significantly reduced cash flows, which has in turn had a negative 
impact on
their ability to service funded-debt obligations, pay general and administrative
costs, and maintain drilling activities so that production remains constant. 
Indeed, over the course of 2015, the Debtors significantly reduced employee 
headcount and
reduced their number of operating rigs in the Eagle Ford from eight to one. In 
February 2016, the Debtors suspended their drilling program entirely. The 
following chart, showing the indexed performance of commodities prices against 
the trading
prices of the Notes and Penn Virginia&#146;s common shares, demonstrates just 
how closely the Debtors&#146; success is tied to commodities prices: </P> <P

trading prices of Penn Virginia&#146;s common shares
and the Notes have fallen to a fraction of their historical value&#151;a market 
reflection of the toll these difficult conditions and substantially lower

and operational &#147;rightsizing,&#148; the capital-intensive nature of the 
Debtors&#146; businesses, together with the Debtors&#146; highly leveraged 
capital structure, have made it difficult to withstand current headwinds. As a 
result, in January
2016, the Debtors engaged financial advisors and legal counsel to advise 
management and the board of directors regarding potential strategic alternatives
to enhance the Debtors&#146; liquidity and address their capital structure. 
Further, on
March&nbsp;22, 2016, the Debtors appointed R. Seth Bullock of Alvarez&nbsp;&amp;
Marsal North America, LLC (&#147;<U>A&amp;M</U>&#148;) as chief restructuring 
officer. Over the first four months of 2016, the Debtors and their advisors 
engaged the
RBL Agent, the RBL Lenders, and an ad hoc committee of Noteholders (the 
&#147;<U>Ad Hoc Committee</U>&#148;) regarding various restructuring 
alternatives&#151;both out-of-court and in-court&#151;to strengthen the

approximately 86
percent of the principal amount of the Notes agreed to the terms of the 
restructuring set forth in the Restructuring Support Agreement, a copy of which 
is attached hereto as <B><U>Exhibit B</U></B>. As discussed herein, in the 
months immediately
preceding the Petition Date, the Debtors explored various leverage points with 
the RBL Lenders and Noteholders, including the strategic liquidation of certain 
in-the-money hedging agreements, and arrived at a resolution under which both

therein, and to be implemented pursuant to the Plan, preserve value by enabling

the
Debtors&#146; emergence from chapter 11. Instead of litigating with the RBL

the DIP
Facility, and (c)&nbsp;participate in the Exit Facility and certain of the 
Noteholders have agreed to backstop the Rights Offering&#151;each of which 
commitments provide significant value to the Debtors. As of the Petition Date, 
holders of
approximately 87 percent in principal of the Debtors&#146; funded-debt

The compromises and settlements to be implemented pursuant to the Plan, preserve
value by
enabling the Debtors to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation with the 
Committee that would delay the Debtors&#146; emergence from chapter 11. For more

historic commodity price declines and a depressed operating environment. The 
Debtors strongly believe that the Plan is in the best interests of the 
Debtors&#146; estates,
represents the best available alternative, and significantly deleverages the 
Debtors&#146; consolidated balance sheet at a critical time when the commodity 
cycle downturn is negatively affecting highly-leveraged companies within the oil

New Common Stock may be used to incentivize key employees (and potentially 
including
officers) pursuant to the Management Incentive Plan. After the Effective Date, 
the New Board will determine allocations of New Common Stock under the 
Management Incentive Plan, if any. However, as the New Board has not been 
appointed, no
determination has been made at this time regarding whether or to what extent any
of the New Common Stock will actually be issued for this purpose (and on what

font-family:Times New Roman"><B></B>As set forth in the Liquidation Analysis 
attached hereto as <B><U>Exhibit F</U></B>, based on the Debtors&#146; analysis 
of all
available information, with the assistance of their advisors, the Debtors have 
assigned no value to the Avoidance Actions. The Debtors&#146; determination that
they would not recover any value if they pursued the Avoidance Actions is based 
on, among
other issues, the cost of potential litigation, the uncertainty of the outcome 
of such litigation, and anticipated defenses to the Avoidance Actions.<B> 
</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">According to the Ad Hoc Equity Group (as defined 
below), the Debtors&#146; statements of financial affairs disclose almost $400 
million of
transfers to insiders and third parties in the year before their bankruptcy 
filings. First, approximately $300 million of such transfers were on account of 
regular course intercompany payables and receivables as more fully described in 
the global
notes to the Debtors&#146; schedules and statements. Further, the Debtors 
disagree with this characterization of their statements of financial affairs, 
which statements speak for themselves. In any event, the Ad Hoc Equity Group 
objects to the
Debtors&#146; release of all Avoidance Actions with no explanation. </P> <P 
STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-
family:Times New Roman">In response, Debtors believe that any recoveries from 
estate-owed
causes of actions like the Avoidance Actions would first be available to satisfy
creditor recoveries with residual value (if any) going to equity. Given that the
Debtors believe that common equity is out of the money by more than 
$1&nbsp;billion,
the Debtors do not believe there is any scenario where the proceeds of the 
Avoidance Actions against insiders, even if prosecuted at a 100% success rate 
and without discount for professionals&#146; fees, would be a source of recovery
to holders of
Penn Virginia Common Stock or Preferred Stock. In any event, the global 
resolution embodied in the Restructuring Support Agreement&#151;and which now is
supported by the the Committee&#151;reflects the view of the Debtors and their 
key creditor
constituencies that pursuing the restructuring reflected in the Plan, which 
includes release of all Avoidance Actions, is the best path to maximize value in
the Chapter 11 Cases. </P>

one Debtor entity. Accordingly, holders of Note Claims have greater potential

2010, the Debtors divested their ownership interest in the MLP&#151;thereby 
becoming a
&#147;pure play&#148; E&amp;P company. From 2010 through 2014, during which time
the price of natural gas declined while the price of oil increased, the Debtors 
successfully transitioned from a heavy concentration on natural gas to an oil 
and
NGL-dominant producer. The Debtors&#146; current operations focus most heavily 
on the exploration and production of crude oil in the Eagle Ford, where the vast
majority of their assets are located. The Debtors also own more modest oil and 
natural
gas-producing properties in Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. </P> <P STYLE="margin-

operations consist
primarily of the exploration, production, and development of crude oil, NGLs, 
and natural gas, principally in the Eagle Ford. Generally, the Debtors own a 
working interest in leaseholds of properties from which these hydrocarbons are 
produced and,
in most cases, the Debtors act as the operator of the properties. In instances 
where the Debtors own less than 100 percent of the leasehold working interest in
a property, the Debtors and the other working interest owners generally enter 
into joint
operating agreements to govern the parties&#146; rights and responsibilities 
with respect to the development and operation of the acreage, including which 
party will be the operator. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">As of the Petition Date, the Debtors&#146; proved 
reserves were approximately 44 MMBOE, of which (a)&nbsp;75 percent were proved 
developed
reserves and (b)&nbsp;84 percent were oil and NGLs. As of the Petition Date, the
Debtors held interests in approximately 255 net productive wells, approximately 
86 percent of which the Debtors also operate, and owned approximately 120,000 
net acres
of leasehold and royalty interests, approximately 54 percent of which were 
undeveloped. For the December&nbsp;31, 2015 fiscal year, the Debtors&#146; total
production was comprised of 80 percent crude oil and NGLs and 20 percent natural
gas&#151;crude oil and NGLs accounted for 90 percent of product revenues. </P> 
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The Debtors&#146; assets are concentrated in the 
core NGL-rich
area or &#147;volatile oil window&#148; of the Eagle Ford. In 2015, the Debtors 
spent over $300 million in capital expenditures&#151;substantially all of which 
was on their Eagle Ford operations. The Debtors&#146; Eagle Ford operations 
accounted for
approximately 88 percent of the Debtors&#146; total production and approximately
82 percent, of the Debtors&#146; net productive wells. The Debtors&#146; crude 
oil is generally sold at a &#147;CDP&#148; or Central Delivery Point using 
short-term
floating price contracts. Generally speaking, the Debtors&#146; operations are 
highly sensitive to oil, NGL, and natural gas prices&#151;although, as described
below, such sensitivity is mitigated to a certain extent through the use of 
hedging
arrangements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%;

described in Article VIII.C.9 of this Disclosure Statement, entitled &#147;The 
Debtors&#146; Operations Depend, in Part, on the Pricing and Availability of 
Midstream Services and Access to

and-completion contracts
in the regular course of business. But, in light of the suspension of their 
drilling program, the Debtors are not currently party to any active well-
drilling and completion contracts. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Finally, the Debtors routinely enter into hedging 
arrangements (each, a &#147;<U>Swap Contract</U>,&#148; and, collectively, the 
&#147;<U>Swap
Contracts</U>&#148;) with counterparties to insure against declines in oil and 
natural gas prices. Under the Swap Contracts, depending on market conditions, 
either: (a)&nbsp;the applicable counterparty pays to the Debtors, on a monthly 
basis, the
positive difference, if any, between the fixed price under the applicable Swap 
Contract and the market price of oil during the relevant month; or (b)&nbsp;the 
Debtors pay the absolute value of the price differential to the Swap Contract 
counterparty
if the value is negative. The counterparties under the Swap Contracts have 
historically been either lenders under the RBL Facility or affiliates of such 
lenders. Prior to the Petition Date, the Debtors were party to six Swap 
Contracts. As described
in more detail below, the Debtors liquidated their prepetition Swap Contracts in
the months immediately preceding the Petition Date in an ultimately successful 
effort to facilitate restructuring discussions and manage liquidity. As of the
Petition
Date, the Debtors were not party to any active Swap Contracts, but recognize the
importance and value of such contracts. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-

Debtors&#146; businesses have recently
been under significant pressure from macroeconomic forces beyond their control. 
Rig counts, a common indicator of new upstream drilling activity, are down 
nearly 60 percent in North America over the past year. Demonstrating just how 
closely the
Debtors&#146; success is tied to commodities prices, the price of the Penn 
Virginia&#146;s publicly-traded common shares has fallen approximately 99 
percent since the end of 2014. In response to the recent market contraction, the
Debtors have
drastically reduced their drilling activities, reducing the number of operating 
rigs from eight to one over the course of 2015 and suspended their drilling 
program completely in February 2016. </P>

Debtors&#146; challenges came to a head in early 2016 when their registered 
independent public accountants issued an opinion with an explanatory paragraph 
expressing substantial doubt as to the Debtors&#146; ability to continue as a 
&#147;going
concern.&#148; The RBL Facility requires that the Debtors deliver audited, 
consolidated financial statements without such a qualification (<I>i.e.</I>, a 
&#147;clean opinion&#148;). As a result of this event of default, and certain 
cross-default
provisions applicable to the Notes, the Debtors classified all of their total 
outstanding funded-debt obligations&#151;more than $1.2 billion&#151;as short-
term as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. Such classification gave rise to a breach 
(upon the
March&nbsp;15, 2016 filing of Penn Virginia&#146;s Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2015) of the &#147;current ratio&#148; covenant under 
the RBL Facility. Further, due to the depressed and declining operating 
conditions, the
Debtors realized that they may not be able to satisfy certain other financial 
covenants applicable to the RBL Facility. <I> </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-

initial stopgap, on January&nbsp;8, 2016, the Debtors and the RBL Agent agreed 
to the Tenth RBL Amendment, under which: (i)&nbsp;the Debtors were permitted to 
convert to or continue LIBOR loans without having to make a solvency 
representation; and
(ii)&nbsp;the RBL Facility&#146;s mortgage requirement was increased from 80% to
100% (subject to certain exceptions) of the Debtors&#146; proved reserves. In 
search of a more lasting solution, during the first two months of 2016, the 
Debtors and
their advisors engaged the RBL Agent in discussions regarding an amendment to 
the RBL Facility that would give the Debtors breathing room to explore more 
comprehensive restructuring alternatives. On March&nbsp;15, 2016, the Debtors

balance. The Debtors&#146; agreement (made in consultation with the advisors to 
the Ad Hoc Committee) to liquidate the two Swap Contracts and apply the proceeds
to the outstanding RBL Facility
balance was a critical first step toward a broader consensus in these chapter 11
cases. The counterparties to all six of the Debtors&#146; prepetition Swap 
Contracts were also RBL Lenders or affiliates of RBL Lenders and would have 
argued for setoff
rights with respect to the proceeds from the Swap Contracts, although the 
Debtors felt they had certain arguments to the contrary. The Debtors&#146; 
agreement, in consultation with the advisors to the Ad Hoc Committee, to 
liquidate the first two
Swap Contracts pursuant to the Eleventh RBL Amendment reflects their assessment 
as to the relative strength of such arguments compared to the benefits of
proceeding toward a consensual resolution. Additionally, since the values of the
Swap Contracts
were declining in light of recent gains in crude oil prices, the Debtors&#146; 
strategic decision to liquidate such Swap Contracts avoided further value 
erosion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The Debtors&#146; ability to exercise the extension
of the Eleventh RBL Amendment to May&nbsp;10, 2016 was conditioned on a number 
of factors,
including, most significantly: (a)&nbsp;the representative from the Ad Hoc 
Committee not notifying the RBL Agent that it did not support the extension; and
(b)&nbsp;the Debtors liquidating two further Swap Contracts and using the 
majority of the
proceeds to pay down the RBL Facility balance. The Debtors ultimately satisfied 
these conditions and secured an extension of the Eleventh RBL Amendment to 
May&nbsp;10, 2016. In April 2016, the Debtors liquidated such additional Swap 
Contracts for
$22.6 million. Under the terms of the Eleventh RBL Amendment, the Debtors 
retained $6&nbsp;million from the proceeds of such Swap Contracts liquidation to
fund working capital needs. The Debtors used the remaining proceeds to pay down 
the RBL
Facility balance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-
indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Again, the Debtors&#146;
decision to liquidate such Swap Contracts reflected progress in their 
negotiations with the Ad
Hoc Committee and the RBL Lenders and, as with the prior liquidation of Swap 
Contracts, the Debtors&#146; decision was made with input from the advisors to 
the Ad Hoc Committee. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The Debtors and their advisors took full advantage 
of the additional runway afforded by the RBL Amendments and subsequent 
extension. In
addition to engaging with the RBL Agent and RBL Lenders, the Debtors engaged in 
substantial negotiations with the Ad Hoc Committee. In an exercise of their 
reasonable business judgment, the Debtors focused on a process by which they 
would liquidate
the Swap Contracts to pay down the RBL Facility balance in return for certain 
accommodations from the RBL Lenders&#151;most significantly their commitment to 
fund the Exit Facility. Similarly, the RBL Lenders were hesitant to proceed with
a
restructuring absent an agreement with the Ad Hoc Committee and some source of 
post-emergence, non-Exit Facility working capital. Accordingly, the Debtors 
negotiated the debt-for-equity swap with the Ad Hoc Committee and the terms of 
the Rights
Offering. Ultimately, the Debtors brokered a resolution under which significant 
stakeholders made both concessions and accommodations for post-emergence 
liquidity. The terms of this resolution are embodied in the Restructuring 
Support Agreement, the
Plan, and the DIP Facility. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; 
text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On May&nbsp;10, 
2016, the Debtors, lenders holding 100 percent of the principal amount of loans 
arising under
the RBL Facility, and holders of approximately 86&nbsp;percent of the principal 
amount of the Notes executed the Restructuring Support Agreement. On the 
Petition Date, in accordance with the Milestones, the Debtors commenced these 
chapter 11 cases.
Significantly, as required by the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Debtors 
liquidated their final two prepetition Swap Contracts in the week preceding the 
Petition Date, on May&nbsp;4, 2016 and May&nbsp;11, 2016, respectively. The 
Debtors
received an aggregate amount of approximately $15.3 million in connection with 
the final Swap Contract liquidations. In accordance with the Restructuring 
Support Agreement and the Amended Eleventh RBL Amendment the Debtors retained $5
million to
fund ongoing liquidity needs, including the administration of these chapter 11 
cases, and used the balance of the aggregate proceeds from the final Swap 
Contract liquidations to pay down the RBL Facility balance. In return, pursuant 
to the Amended
Eleventh RBL Amendment, the RBL Agent extended the terms of the Eleventh RBL 
Amendment to May&nbsp;12, 2016. The last two Swap Contract liquidations 
represent the final steps in the negotiation process&#151;the Debtors did not 
agree to liquidate the
final Swap Contract, a key source of potential funds for a non-consensual 
chapter 11 proceeding, until the parties had fully executed the Restructuring 
Support Agreement. </P>

font-family:Times New Roman">While the Debtors reasonably chose to liquidate the
Swap Contracts to facilitate the discussions
that ultimately led to the execution of the Restructuring Support Agreement, the
Debtors were left in the precarious position of being unhedged to commodity 
price risk as of the Petition Date. Due to the volatile nature of oil and gas 
prices,
E&amp;P companies rarely operate without hedging arrangements in place, and the 
Debtors have not historically done so. To insure against market risk both during
these chapter 11 cases and beyond, on the Petition Date, the Debtors filed a 
motion
seeking authority to enter into new, postpetition Swap Contracts (the 
&#147;<U>Swap Motion</U>&#148;). On May&nbsp;13, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court 
entered an order approving the Swap Motion and the Debtors entered into new Swap
Contracts shortly
thereafter. The new Swap Contracts will help to avoid business disruption during
a sensitive time when the Debtors are implementing the terms of an enterprise-
saving restructuring transaction. Moreover, as described below, securing the new
Swap
Contracts is a necessary condition to the Rights Offering and securing the 
maximum availability of $128 million under the Exit Facility. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt;

Agreement negotiations, the Debtors and their advisors engaged in a third-party 
marketing
process. With Jefferies&#146; assistance, the Debtors contacted 16 potential new
investors, including both strategic and financial investors. The Debtors 
ultimately received non-binding restructuring term sheets from four outside 
parties (the
&#147;<U>Third-Party Proposals</U>&#148;). The Debtors and their advisors 
engaged in an intense, comparative analysis of the transactions contemplated by 
the Restructuring Support Agreement and the Third-Party Proposals and determined

administrative expenses, and gathering, processing and transportation expenses. 
The funds will be allocated as as is necessary to the Debtors&#146; ongoing 
exploration
and production operations after the Chapter 11 Cases. As the New Board is not 
yet in place, the Debtors are not able to predict with certainty the exact

significant incremental liquidity by way of the Exit Facility and Rights 
Offering. The availability of the Exit Facility is of particular 
significance&#151;traditional
banks have become increasingly unwilling to lend to E&amp;P companies in light 
of current market conditions. To have a bank-funded exit facility <B><I>fully 
committed</I></B> as of the Petition Date is unprecedented in the recent wave of
E&amp;P
company chapter 11 filings. But, availability of the full $128 million capacity 
under the Exit Facility is dependent, in part, on the Debtors&#146; ability to 
secure &#147;Minimum Hedges&#148; as of the Effective Date. Accordingly, 
pursuant to the
Swap Motion the Debtors sought, and on May&nbsp;13, 2016 were granted, authority
from the Bankruptcy Court to enter into new, postpetition Swap Contracts, thus 
ensuring the maximum availability under the Exit Facility. </P>

operating performance. The Plan represents the successful culmination of months 
of restructuring efforts and gives the Debtors the best opportunity to withstand
current
adverse market conditions, generate sufficient liquidity to fund their 
operations, and maximize value for the benefit of their stakeholders. </P> <P

section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code, for holders of Claims entitled to vote on 
the Plan to make an informed judgment with respect their decision of whether to 
accept or reject the Plan. The Debtors disagree. </P>

even though the current holders of Penn Virginia Common Stock are deemed to 
reject the Plan
and are not entitled to vote, they are entitled to object to the Plan especially
insofar as the Plan proposes to release any claims they may have and is based 
upon a valuation, which if proven wrong, could entitle them to a recovery if the
value of
the Debtors&#146; assets exceeds the Debtors&#146; liabilities. The Ad Hoc 
Equity Group is currently participating in the Chapter 11 Cases and seeking 
status as an official statutory committee (to which the Debtors have objected).

alternative proposal to the Rights Offering backstopped by the Ad Hoc Committee.

Backstop Commitment Premium, reduce the discount associated with the per share 
purchase price
to 20%, and eliminate the $2 million fee in the event the Backstop Commitment

that this Disclosure Statement, the balloting procedures, and voting results are
appropriate, the Bankruptcy Court could still decline to confirm the Plan if it 
finds that any of the statutory requirements for Confirmation are not met. If a 
chapter 11 plan of reorganization is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it 
is unclear
whether the Debtors will be able to reorganize their business and what, if 
anything, holders of Allowed Claims against them would ultimately receive on

Disclosure Statement, Republic argued that the Debtors have not provided a

Note Claims (that are also Accredited Investors) to participate in the Rights

&#147;unfair discrimination&#148; under section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. 
The Debtors disagree. The Debtors are prepared to demonstrate at the 
Confirmation Hearing that the Plan&#146;s treatments of Class 5 Note Claims and 
Class 6(a) General
Unsecured Claims do not constitute unfair discrimination under the controlling 
standard in the Fourth Circuit. <I>See In re Jim Beck, Inc.</I>, 214 B.R. 305,

663&nbsp;F.3d 704
(4th Cir. 2011) and <I>In re National Heritage Foundation, Inc.</I>, 478 B.R.

comply with the controlling Fourth Circuit standards. Further, the global 
resolution embodied
in the Restructuring Support Agreement&#151;and which now is supported by the

&#147;restricted securities&#148; that may not be sold, exchanged, assigned or 
otherwise transferred
unless they are registered, or an exemption from registration applies, under the
Securities Act. Holders of Rights Offering Shares (other than the Backstop 
Parties) will not be entitled to have their Rights Offering Shares registered 
and will be
required to agree not to resell them except in accordance with the exemption
from registration provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, when available.
Rule 144 permits the public resale of restricted securities if certain 
conditions are met,
and these conditions vary depending on whether the holder of the restricted 
securities is an &#147;affiliate&#148; of the issuer, as defined in Rule 144. A 
non-affiliate who has not been an affiliate of the issuer during the preceding 
three months
may resell restricted securities after a six-month holding period unless certain
current public information regarding the issuer is not available at the time of 
sale, in which case the non-affiliate may resell after a one-year holding 
period. An
affiliate may resell restricted securities after a six-month holding period but 
only if certain current public information regarding the issuer is available at 
the time of the sale and only if the affiliate also complies with the volume, 
manner of
sale and notice requirements of Rule 144. While the Debtors currently expect 
that the current public information requirement will be met when the six-month 
holding period expires, they cannot guarantee that resales of the restricted 
securities will
qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144. In any event, Holders
of Rights Offering Shares should expect to be required to hold their Rights

A long

adverse effect on the Debtors&#146; businesses, financial condition, results of 
operations, and liquidity.&nbsp;So long as the proceedings related to the 
Chapter 11 Cases
continue, senior management will be required to spend a significant amount of 
time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively 
on business operations.&nbsp;A prolonged period of operating under Bankruptcy 
Court
protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and other key 
personnel necessary to the success and growth of the Debtors&#146; businesses. 
In addition, the longer the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Cases

likely it is that customers and suppliers will lose confidence in the 
Debtors&#146; ability to reorganize their businesses successfully and will seek 
to establish alternative commercial relationships. </P>

11 Cases continue, the Debtors will be required to incur substantial costs for 
professional
fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the Chapter 11 
Cases. The chapter 11 proceedings&nbsp;also require the Debtors to seek debtor-
in-possession financing to fund operations. If the Debtors are unable to obtain 
final
approval of such financing on favorable terms or at all, or if the Debtors are 
unable to fully draw on the availability under the DIP Facility, the chances of 
successfully reorganizing the Debtors&#146; businesses may be seriously

ongoing operations, the Debtors have incurred significant professional fees and 
other costs in connection with preparing for the Chapter 11 Cases and expect to 
continue
to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout the Chapter 11 
Cases. The Debtors cannot guarantee that cash on hand, cash flow from 
operations, and cash provided by the DIP Facility will be sufficient to continue
to fund their
operations and allow the Debtors to satisfy obligations related to the Chapter

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The Debtors&#146; liquidity, including the ability 
to meet ongoing operational obligations, will be dependent upon, among other 
things:
(a)&nbsp;their ability to comply with the terms and condition of any debtor-in-
possession financing and/or cash collateral order entered by the Bankruptcy 
Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases; (b)&nbsp;their ability to 
maintain adequate
cash on hand; (c)&nbsp;their ability to generate cash flow from operations; 
(d)&nbsp;their ability to develop, confirm, and consummate a chapter 11 plan or 
other alternative restructuring transaction; (e)&nbsp;the availability of 
incremental draws
under the DIP Facility; and (f)&nbsp;the cost, duration, and outcome of the 
Chapter 11 Cases. The Debtors&#146; ability to maintain adequate liquidity 
depends, in part, upon industry conditions and general economic, financial, 
competitive,
regulatory, and other factors beyond the Debtors&#146; control. In the event 
that cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and cash provided under the DIP 
Facility are not sufficient to meet the Debtors&#146; liquidity needs, the 
Debtors may be
required to seek additional financing. The Debtors can provide no assurance that
additional financing would be available or, if available, offered to the Debtors
on acceptable terms. The Debtors&#146; access to additional financing is, and 
for the
foreseeable future likely will continue to be, extremely limited if it is

of cash flow available to the Debtors to meet
their financial commitments and fund capital expenditures. Oil and natural gas 
prices also impact the Debtors&#146; ability to borrow money and raise 
additional capital. For example, the amount the Debtors will be able to borrow 
under the Exit
Facility will be subject to periodic redeterminations based, in part, on then-
current oil, natural gas, and NGL prices and on changing expectations of future 
prices. Lower oil, natural gas, and NGL prices may not only decrease the 
Debtors&#146;
revenues on a per-unit basis, but also may reduce the amount of oil, natural 
gas, and NGLs that the Debtors can produce economically in the future. Higher 
operating costs associated with any of the Debtors&#146; oil or natural gas 
fields will make
their profitability more sensitive to oil, natural gas, or NGL price declines. A
sustained decline in oil, natural gas, or NGL prices may materially and 
adversely affect the Debtors&#146; future business, financial condition, results
of operations,
liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures. In addition, a 
sustained decline in oil, natural gas, or NGL prices might result in substantial
downward estimates of the Debtors&#146; proved reserves. As a result, if there 
is a further
decline or sustained depression in commodity prices, the Debtors may, among 
other things, be unable to maintain or increase their borrowing capacity, meet 
their debt obligations or other financial commitments, or obtain additional

services agreements is,
in some instances, well above market. Failure to negotiate for improved economic
terms could have a material, adverse effect on the Debtors&#146; businesses. 
Moreover, any attempt to reject certain of the Debtors&#146; midstream services

also rely on the availability of water, which is crucial to conducting hydraulic
fracturing. A significant amount of water is necessary for drilling and

the Eagle Ford
has experienced severe droughts that have limited the water supplies that are 
necessary to conduct hydraulic fracturing. Although the Debtors have taken
measures to secure their water supply, the Debtors can make no assurances that 
sufficient water

In liquidations under chapter 11, the Debtors&#146; assets could be sold in an 
orderly fashion over a more extended period of time than in a liquidation under 
chapter 7.
Thus, a chapter 11 liquidation may result in larger recoveries than a chapter 7 
liquidation, but the delay in distributions could result in lower present values
received and higher administrative costs. Any distribution to holders of Claims 
under a
chapter 11 liquidation plan would most likely be substantially delayed. Most 
importantly, the Debtors believe that any distributions to creditors in a 
chapter&nbsp;11 liquidation scenario would fail to capture the significant going
concern value of
their businesses, which is reflected in the New Common Stock to be distributed 
under the Plan. Accordingly, the Debtors believe that a chapter&nbsp;11 
liquidation would not result in distributions as favorable as those under the 
Plan. </P>

font-family:Times New Roman">The recent ruling of Judge Kevin R. Huennekens in 
the <I>Alpha Natural Resources, Inc.</I>
bankruptcy proceeding is directly on point. On August&nbsp;3, 2015, Alpha 
Natural Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries 
(&#147;<U>Alpha</U>&#148;) filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 
11. Alpha is a coal company&#151;thus,
like the Debtors, operating in an industry suffering under the weight of the 
depressed commodities markets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-
bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the 
time of its filing,
Alpha was liable for approximately $4.17 billion in funded-debt obligations. 
Certain of Alpha&#146;s equity holders filed a motion seeking appointment of an 
equity committee. The equity holders argued, among other things, that Alpha was 
solvent
based on their prepetition public filings, which indicated significant equity 
value. Judge Huennekens denied the motion based on a fluid, market-based 
approach to valuing Alpha&#146;s assets. Hr&#146;g Tr. at 59&#150;62, <I>In re 
Alpha Natural
Resources, Inc.</I>, No.&nbsp;15-33896 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Dec. 17, 2015). Judge 
Huennekens found that the Bankruptcy Code&#146;s use of the phrase &#147;fair 
value&#148; in section 101(32)&#146;s definition of &#147;insolvent&#148; did 
not refer to
the book value provided in the debtors&#146; public filings (calculated in 
accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), but 
instead was a matter of market expectations. <I>Id.</I> Ultimately, Judge 
Heunnekens found that
evidence of market expectations did not support a finding that there was a 
substantial likelihood of meaningful recovery for Alpha&#146;s equity holders. 
<I>Id.</I> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Judge Kevin Gross recently reached a similar 
conclusion to Judge Heunnekens in his decision denying appointment of an equity 
committee in
the<I> Magnum Hunter Resources Corporation</I> bankruptcy proceeding. Like the 
Debtors, Magnum Hunter Resources Corporation and its subsidiaries 
(&#147;<U>Magnum</U>&#148;) are an E&amp;P company and have been severely 
impacted by recent market
conditions. Judge Gross determined that equityholders had &#147;no reasonable 
prospect of receiving a meaningful distribution,&#148; and further found that 
the equityholders&#146; reliance on the Magnum debtors&#146; book value was 
misplaced.
Hr&#146;g Tr. at 79-84, <I>In re Magnum Hunter Resources Corp.</I>, No.&nbsp;15-
12533 (Bankr D. Del. Apr. 18, 2016). Judge Gross specifically commented that 
&#147;[b]ook value, liquidation value, and going concern value are distinct 
metrics. . . .
Numerous courts have noted that book value is not indicative of the true value 
of a business.&#148;<I> Id.</I> at 83. Judge Gross ultimately determined that 
the going concern valuation prepared by Magnum&#146;s investment banker, similar
to the
Valuation Analysis attached to this Disclosure Statement as <B><U>Exhibit 
H</U></B>, was more indicative of Magnum&#146;s true enterprise value. </P>

most recent 2015 Form 10-K, the Debtors&#146; most recently disclosed book value
takes into
account an impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion. The Debtors strictly
adhered to FASB Accounting Standards Codifications (&#147;<U>ASC</U>&#148;) 932-
360-35 and 360-10-35 to account for the impairment of their assets. Moreover, it
is
important to point out that Penn Virginia&#146;s 2015 Form 10-K is supported by 
the attestation of KPMG LLP (one of the country&#146;s premier accounting 
firms), in which KPMG stated that &#147;[i]n our opinion, the consolidated 
financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of Penn Virginia Corporation and subsidiaries as of December&nbsp;31,

the class is listed on a stock exchange, the greater of 1% of the average weekly
reported volume of trading in such restricted securities during the four weeks

manner of sale requirement provides that the restricted securities must be sold 
in a broker&#146;s transaction, which generally means they must be sold through 
a broker and
handled as a routine trading transaction. The broker must receive no more than 
the usual commission and cannot solicit orders for the sale of the restricted 
securities except in certain situations. Third, if the sale exceeds 5,000 
restricted

The amount of COD Income, in general, is the excess of (a)&nbsp;the adjusted

available tax attributes is not subject to U.S. federal income tax and has no

instead, NOL carryforwards will be reduced by the amount of any interest 
deductions claimed during the three taxable years preceding the effective date

before the events giving rise to the change. The 382(l)(6)&nbsp;Exception also 
differs from the 382(l)(5)&nbsp;Exception in that under it the debtor

the length of the term of a debt instrument is an important factor in

such instrument is a security for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These 
authorities have indicated that a term of less than five years is evidence that 
the instrument is not a security, whereas a term of ten years or more is 
evidence that it is a
security. There are numerous other factors that could be taken into account in 
determining whether a debt instrument is a security, including the security for 
payment, the creditworthiness of the obligor, the subordination or lack thereof 
to other
creditors, the right to vote or otherwise participate in the management of the 
obligor, convertibility of the instrument into an equity interest of the 
obligor, whether payments of interest are fixed, variable, or contingent, and 
whether such
payments are made on a current basis or accrued. Since the obligations 
underlying the Note Claims were issued by Penn Virginia and have terms of more
