 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report is divided into four sections.  The first section sets out the activities 
that have been carried out under the mandate since the submission of the last report to the 
Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2006/5).  The main pillars of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
activities consist of sending communications, undertaking in situ visits and participating in 
international conferences.  A total of 64 communications were sent to 34 different countries 
during the period from 1 December 2005 to 30 November 2006.  Of these communications, 
27 were urgent appeals and 37 were letters of allegation.  Moreover, 39 of the communications, 
which addressed allegations of multiple human rights violations, were transmitted together with 
other special procedures.  The Special Rapporteur considers that in situ visits are the best way to 
comprehensively and thoroughly assess the freedom of religion or belief in a particular country.  
She has carried out two such visits during the period under review, to Azerbaijan and to the 
Maldives.  In addition to her regular country visits, the Special Rapporteur travelled to the 
Vatican where she held consultations with representatives of the Holy See.  She welcomes the 
recent invitations from the Governments of Tajikistan, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland and of Zimbabwe.  Further to Human Rights Council decision 1/107, the 
Special Rapporteur prepared a thematic report on &#8220;Incitement to racial and religious hatred and 
the promotion of tolerance&#8221; for the second session of the Human Rights Council in 
September 2006 together with Doudou Di&#232;ne, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance (A/HRC/2/3).  In the course of 
the year, the Special Rapporteur also participated in a number of conferences and international 
meetings where she was able to establish or renew ties with governmental, intergovernmental 
and non-governmental representatives as well as academics active in the field of freedom of 
religion or belief.   
</p>
<p> Taking stock of 20 years of mandate experience, the Special Rapporteur in the second 
section comments on the framework for communications she has been using since her previous 
report to the Commission (E/CN.4/2006/5, annex).  Through the means of an envisaged online 
digest according to the categories of her framework for communications the Special Rapporteur 
intends to draw the attention of the government concerned to the relevant international standards 
and also to make the mandate practice more easily accessible for non-governmental 
organizations active in this field.  The online framework will be available on the website of the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights at 
http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/religion/standards.htm. 
</p>
<p> In the third section of the report, the Special Rapporteur focuses on several issues of 
concern to her mandate.  These relate to the vulnerable situation of women, violations linked to 
counter-terrorism measures as well as the situation of religious minorities and new religious 
movements.   
</p>
<p>The fourth section of the report sets out her conclusions and recommendations.  The 
allegations received by the Special Rapporteur lead to the conclusion that the protection of 
freedom of religion or belief and the implementation of the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief is far from being 
a reality.  She emphasizes that there is an urgent need to eliminate the root causes of intolerance 
and discrimination and to remain vigilant with regard to freedom of religion or belief worldwide.  
It is equally crucial to depoliticize issues relating to religion or belief and to bring the discussion 
fully within the framework of human rights. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to resolution 2005/40 of the Commission on 
Human Rights and decision 2/102 of the Human Rights Council.  It covers the activities carried 
out under the mandate on freedom of religion or belief since the submission of the previous 
reports to the Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2006/5 and Add.1 to 4).   
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur on religious intolerance was initially appointed pursuant to 
Commission resolution 1986/20.  The Commission changed the title to Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief by its resolution 2000/33, which was approved by the Economic 
and Social Council by its decision 2000/261.  In July 2004, Asma Jahangir was appointed 
Special Rapporteur for a period of three years. 
</p>
<p>3. The present report is divided into four sections.  Section I presents the activities that 
have been undertaken under the mandate during the period under review.  Section II takes stock 
of the 20 years of mandate practice and announces an online digest of her framework for 
communications, which is intended to improve the effectiveness of her communications with 
Governments and non-governmental organizations.  Section III provides a more detailed analysis 
of several issues of concern to the mandate, namely the vulnerable situation of women, 
violations linked to counter-terrorism measures as well as the situation of religious minorities 
and new religious movements.  Section IV sets out the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s conclusions and 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>4. The summary of communications sent by the Special Rapporteur from 1 December 2005 
to 30 November 2006 and the replies received from Governments by 30 January 2007 is found in 
addendum 1 to the report.  Addendums 2 and 3 are the reports of the country visits to Azerbaijan 
and to the Maldives, respectively.   
</p>
<p><b>I</b>.  <b>ACTIVITIES OF THE MANDATE 
</b></p>
<p>5. On 25 November 2006, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the 1981 
Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on 
Religion or Belief was commemorated.  However, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern 
that the standards of this 1981 Declaration are still not universally implemented and that 
freedom of religion or belief is not a reality for many individuals throughout the world.  The 
reported instances of religious intolerance show that the right to freedom of religion or belief 
continues to be significantly challenged in many contexts and different parts of the world. 
</p>
<p>6. The three main pillars of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities consist of sending 
communications, undertaking in situ visits and participating in international conferences.  As in 
previous years, the monitoring of cases and situations of alleged violations of the right to 
freedom of religion or belief was carried out mainly in the context of acting on information 
provided by several sources, including individuals and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  
It should be noted that communications are not per se accusatory, but take up information with 
the aim of monitoring specific cases and eventually identifying, inter alia, patterns of violations.<b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>A</b>.  <b>Communications 
</b></p>
<p>7. The amount of information received from both individuals and NGOs on situations that 
appear to fall within the scope of the mandate is overwhelming and deals with a wide range of 
complex and sensitive issues.  One of the crucial activities undertaken by the Special Rapporteur 
in this regard is to engage in constructive dialogue with Governments by sending them 
communications in order to seek clarification on credible allegations received.  It is self-evident 
that these communications do not cover all the incidents and governmental action in the world 
that raise concern with regard to freedom of religion or belief.  Furthermore, the frequency with 
which religions and beliefs are covered by communications does not necessarily reflect their 
general situation in the world.   
</p>
<p>8. During the period from 1 December 2005 to 30 November 2006, a total 
of 64 communications were transmitted to 34 different countries.  The Special Rapporteur 
sent communications to Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Australia, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, 
Bhutan, China (People&#8217;s Republic of), Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, Eritrea, France, 
Georgia, Germany, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, 
Serbia and Montenegro,<b>1</b> Somalia, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkmenistan, the United States of 
America, Uzbekistan and Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>9. Of the 64 communications, 42 were sent to the Asian and Pacific region, 8 to Europe and 
North America, 7 to the Arab region, 6 to Africa and 1 to Latin America and the Caribbean.  In 
this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes that while there is an obvious imbalance between States 
regarding the amount of information received, the picture does depict positive trends in some 
regions, which has remained consistently encouraging.  The fact that some States are covered in 
the addendum 1 does not mean that other States are problem-free.  Indeed, the absence of 
information may sometimes be explained by the lack of a civil society or by obstacles that 
prevent the information from being transmitted outside the country.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>10. The communications sent during the period under review were made up of 27 urgent 
appeals and 37 allegation letters.  The Special Rapporteur is pleased that 21 of the urgent 
appeals and 18 of the allegation letters were sent jointly with other special procedures.  The 
Special Rapporteur welcomes once again this important collaboration, especially in view of the 
fact that violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief by its very nature are often 
coupled with violations of other human rights.  During the period under review communications 
were sent jointly with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression; the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health; the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially in women and children; the Independent Expert on minority issues; the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences; the Special 
Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance; the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants; the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism; the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers; the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography; the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention; the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>defenders; the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people; the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living; and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture.   
</p>
<p>11. The following issues were raised with the Governments:  freedom to adopt, change or 
renounce a religion or belief as well as freedom from coercion;<b> </b>the right to manifest one&#8217;s 
religion or belief;<b> </b>freedom to worship; places of worship;<b> </b>registration;<b> </b>and the freedom of 
religion or belief of vulnerable groups such as detainees, minorities, children and women.  As in 
previous years, the Special Rapporteur has received an important number of reports alleging 
discrimination on the basis of religion or belief, including inter-religious discrimination, 
intolerance, as well as gender discrimination.  The Special Rapporteur has also sent 
communications to some Governments requesting information on legislative issues, including 
draft laws and recently adopted bills dealing with the registration of religious organizations and 
the prohibition of so-called &#8220;unlawful conversion&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>12. A significant proportion of the communications were sent concerning cases in which 
violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief were coupled with violations of other 
human rights.  For instance, there have been cases where freedom of expression was also 
violated and where the situation concerned intra-religious conflicts and/or incitement to 
religious hatred.  There were further communications sent with regard to alleged cases of 
torture or ill-treatment of persons held in custody on the basis of their religion or belief, one 
case of death in custody, as well as recurring cases of religiously motivated forms of 
punishment.  As mentioned above, in cases which raised a number of human rights violations, 
the Special Rapporteur acted jointly with other relevant mandates.  She considers these joint 
communications to be a vital component of the whole system of special procedures, underlining 
the fact that all human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated.  She 
trusts that the particular features of her mandate can add some wealth to the human rights values 
and to the monitoring approaches. 
</p>
<p>13. A summary of communications sent from 1 December 2005 to 30 November 2006 and 
responses received from Governments by 30 January 2007 is contained in addendum 1, which 
also contains the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s observations on the concerns raised.  In order to facilitate 
the examination of reported violations, she intends to develop a model questionnaire relating to 
her mandate and, similarly to other special procedures, make this questionnaire available online 
for persons wishing to report cases of alleged violations.  The Special Rapporteur would like to 
emphasize, however, that communications are of course also considered even when they are not 
submitted in the form of the model questionnaire. 
</p>
<p><b>B</b>.  <b>In situ visits 
</b></p>
<p>14. A second pillar of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities is the conducting of country visits.  
These enable the Special Rapporteur to talk directly with governmental and non-governmental 
representatives and to get first-hand information at the sources.  She recalls that in its 
resolution 2005/40, the Commission on Human Rights urged &#8220;all Governments to cooperate 
fully with the Special Rapporteur and to respond favourably to her request to visit their countries 
so as to enable her to fulfil her mandate more effectively&#8221;.  Since the inception of the mandate, a 
total of 24 country visits have been undertaken by the mandate holders as well as a joint report 
with four other special procedures holders on the situation of detainees at Guant&#225;namo Bay </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(E/CN.4/2006/120).  In the period under review, two in situ visits were carried out, to Azerbaijan 
and to the Maldives.  The Special Rapporteur takes this opportunity to thank the Governments 
concerned for the cooperation they extended to the mandate.  Her reports on each of these visits 
can be found in documents A/HRC/4/21/Add.2 and A/HRC/4/21/Add.3, respectively. 
</p>
<p>15. Having visited Azerbaijan from 26 February to 5 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur 
considers that Azerbaijan is a country where there is a high level of religious tolerance and 
religious harmony.  However, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that, in some cases, the 
concerned authorities may have blurred the thin line that distinguishes facilitation of religious 
freedoms from control.  Certain situations related to the different aspects of this control have 
resulted in actual limitations of the collective right to freedom of religion or belief, such as 
difficulties in registration, restriction on religious literature, methods of appointment of clergy or 
obstacles for non-registered religious communities.  The Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to give special attention to any form of religious intolerance towards religious 
minorities, to take the appropriate measures to address and prosecute all forms of incitement to 
religious hatred and to strengthen the independence and neutrality of the judiciary. 
</p><p>16. During her visit to the Maldives from 6 to 9 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur 
observed the desire of the Maldivian people to preserve national unity.  However, she is 
concerned that the concept of national unity appears to have become inextricably linked to that 
of religious unity, which some of her interlocutors seemed to equate with religious homogeneity.  
Maldivian citizenship is based on religious belief.  Political rights, stemming from holding of 
public office to the right to vote, are only guaranteed to Muslims.  Non-Muslim foreign workers 
and professionals - even diplomats - in the Maldives cannot exercise their religious rights in 
public.  There are no religious sites or places of worship apart from Islamic Mosques.  While 
welcoming the recent adoption of the Law on the Human Rights Commission, the 
Special Rapporteur notes that it does not completely satisfy the requirements of the Paris 
Principles and that to unduly stress that members of the Human Rights Commission must be 
Muslim defeats the very spirit of seeking to uphold human rights.  Subsequent to her visit, the 
Maldivian Government took the important step of acceding to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (ICCPR) and its First Optional Protocol.  However, the Special Rapporteur regrets that 
the Government has entered a reservation to article 18 of ICCPR and she encourages the 
Government to keep this reservation under review. 
</p>
<p>17. In addition to these two traditional in situ visits, the Special Rapporteur has held also 
consultations with representatives of the Catholic Church when she travelled to the Vatican 
on 15 and 16 June 2006 (see A/61/340, paragraphs 37-42).  Her intention was to initiate a 
dialogue with representatives of the Catholic community and to identify issues on which the 
Catholic Church could increase its cooperation with the mandate.  The Special Rapporteur hopes 
to organize similar consultations with representatives of other major religious communities 
during her in situ visits in order to gain further experience related to inter-community relations in 
the area of religion or belief, especially from the angle of inter-religious dialogue and how the 
mandate may contribute to such initiatives. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the decision of the Governments of Tajikistan, of the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Zimbabwe to extend an invitation 
to her.  She is looking forward to carrying out in situ visits to the former two countries in 2007.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>However, she notes with concern the failure of the Governments of Cuba, Ethiopia, India, 
Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Mauritania, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Serbia and 
Montenegro<b>1</b> and Yemen to respond to her requests for an invitation.  The Special Rapporteur 
encourages these Governments to extend her an invitation without delay and reiterates that a 
formal invitation should be followed by proposals for the dates of the visit; otherwise, the 
invitation, whether standing or ad hoc, tends to lose its significance. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Thematic studies and international meetings 
</b></p>
<p>19. The third pillar of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities consists in drafting thematic studies 
as well as participating in conferences and international meetings.  Her predecessor, 
Abdelfattah Amor, had already drafted several thematic studies, thus complementing the 
traditional reports to the Commission on Human Rights and to the General Assembly with 
scholarly activities of the mandate.  Two of these thematic studies were destined for the 
preparatory committee of the 2001 World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in Durban; a further study dealt with freedom of religion or 
belief and the status of women from the viewpoint of religion and traditions. 
</p>
<p>20. Further to Human Rights Council decision 1/107, the Special Rapporteur prepared a 
report on &#8220;Incitement to racial and religious hatred and the promotion of tolerance&#8221; for the 
second session of the Human Rights Council in September 2006 together with Doudou Di&#232;ne, 
the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance (A/HRC/2/3).  In their joint report, the Special Rapporteurs recommend that 
the Human Rights Council call upon Governments of Member States to express and demonstrate 
a firm political will and commitment to combating the rise of racial and religious intolerance.  
While the right to freedom of religion or belief as such does not include the right to have a 
religion or belief that is free from criticism or from all adverse comment, the right to freedom of 
expression can legitimately be restricted for advocacy that incites to acts of violence or 
discrimination against individuals on the basis of their religion.  Freedom of religion or belief 
and freedom of expression are interdependent and interrelated.  Balancing the various aspects of 
human rights is an extremely delicate exercise which requires impartial implementation by 
independent and non-arbitrary bodies.  In the joint report the Special Rapporteurs encouraged the 
Human Rights Committee to consider the possibility of adopting complimentary standards on the 
interrelations between freedom of expression, freedom of religion and non-discrimination, in 
particular by drafting a new general comment on article 20 of the Covenant.   
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur participated in a number of conferences and international 
meetings whose topic areas were directly linked with her mandate.  On 15 February 2006, the 
Government of the Netherlands and Helsinki Espa&#241;a co-organized a conference on &#8220;Challenges 
to Tolerance in a Multicultural Society&#8221; in Madrid.  On 2 and 3 May 2006, the Special 
Rapporteur participated in a conference entitled &#8220;Challenging stereotypes in Europe and the 
Islamic World:  working together for constructive policies and partnerships&#8221; at Wilton Park, 
United Kingdom, which was jointly organized with the Organization of the Islamic Conference.  
Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur participated in the inauguration of the Center for Studies of 
Holocaust and Religious Minorities in Oslo on 24 August 2006.  Finally, the Special Rapporteur 
endorsed the international commemorative conference of the adoption of the 1981 Declaration </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>which was held in Prague and she delivered a keynote speech on 25 November 2006.  In the 
course of these various events she was able to establish or renew ties with governmental, 
intergovernmental and non-governmental representatives as well as academics active in the field 
of freedom of religion or belief.   
</p>
<p><b>II.  TWENTY YEARS OF MANDATE EXPERIENCE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Critical appraisal of the 1981 Declaration</b> 
</p>
<p>22. The Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination 
Based on Religion or Belief was adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 36/55 
on 25 November 1981.  The Special Rapporteur has been encouraging Governments and 
non-governmental organizations to support the commemoration initiatives that take stock of 
achievements since 1981, identify the provisions of the Declaration that today raise particular 
concern and to challenge rising trends of religious intolerance.  She is delighted that more 
than 50 Governments were represented at the international conference in Prague on 
25 November 2006 and that in total around 300 representatives of Governments, 
non-governmental organizations, religions and beliefs as well as international and 
national experts and academics attended this conference.  The standards of the 1981 Declaration 
were reaffirmed at the end of the conference by reading out a Prague Declaration on freedom of 
religion and belief, which is available online at 
http://www.tolerance95.cz/1981down/Prague_Declaration_on_FORB.doc.   
</p>
<p>23. The representative of the Netherlands to the Third Committee of the General Assembly 
in 1981, Jaap A. Walkate, rightly characterized the road leading towards its adoption as &#8220;long, 
arduous and full of obstacles&#8221; (A/36/PV.73, para. 16).  Given the significant obstacles during the 
drafting process, which eventually stalled the elaboration of a convention on religious 
intolerance until today, it is already an achievement that the 1981 Declaration was finally agreed 
upon.  The Special Rapporteur would like to stress the important role of non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) in the framework of the drafting history, which includes lobbying efforts 
and substantive contributions to the final wording of the declaration.  Such an active involvement 
of civil society is also needed nowadays.  The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate her 
gratefulness for the input of NGOs and religious associations which has been feeding into the 
work of her mandate.   
</p>
<p>24. The standards of the 1981 Declaration remain valid and the document may be called a 
comprehensive historical compromise.  In particular, the catalogue of rights enumerated in 
article 6 of the 1981 Declaration has been an important contribution to the international legal 
framework, inspiring also regional instruments such as the 1989 Vienna Concluding Document 
on the human dimension of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.  From the 
perspective of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate, however, there have been subsequent 
developments since 1981 concerning freedom of religion or belief, including the adoption of 
further legal instruments and international guidelines, which also need to be taken into account.  
These human rights instruments include, inter alia, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and 
the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families.  Furthermore, the Human Rights Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 22 (1993) 
elaborates upon article 18 of the Covenant, thus giving authoritative guidance for Governments 
and non-governmental organizations.  According to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s experience, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>particular attention needs to be given to the vulnerable situation of certain groups, such as 
women, children, religious minorities, migrant workers, refugees and persons deprived of their 
liberty.   
</p>
<p>25. There are other issues of concern which are alluded to in the 1981 Declaration but which 
have seen a more detailed elaboration in subsequent documents.  On 31 May 2001, the 
General Assembly adopted resolution 55/254 aiming at the protection of religious sites, in which 
the Assembly invited relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to 
contribute to the efforts to ensure that religious sites are fully respected and protected.  
Intimately linked with this issue is the question of national requirements concerning the 
registration of religious communities.  Registration appears often to be used as a means to limit 
the right of freedom of religion or belief of members of certain religious communities.  The 
Guidelines for Review of Legislation Pertaining to Religion or Belief, prepared by the Office for 
Democratic Institutions and Human Rights&#8217;s Advisory Panel of Experts on Freedom of Religion 
or Belief of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in consultation with the 
Council of Europe&#8217;s Venice Commission in 2004,<b>2</b> contain a concise chapter on laws governing 
registration of religious/belief organizations and the Special Rapporteur has also referred to the 
international legal standards in her previous reports and communications (see E/CN.4/2005/61, 
paragraphs 57-58 and E/CN.4/2006/5/Add.1, paragraphs 51, 240, 389 and 446).  Furthermore, 
national legislation on religious symbols may have adverse effects on individuals, either because 
they are prevented from identifying themselves through the display of religious symbols or 
because they are required to wear religious dress in public.  In this regard the Special Rapporteur 
has formulated a set of general criteria on religious symbols in order to provide some guidance 
on the applicable human rights standards and their scope (E/CN.4/2006/5, paras. 36-60).   
</p>
<p>26. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s opinion, much more needs to be done in order to universally 
safeguard freedom of religion or belief.  Various dimensions of the Declaration are unexplored 
yet and appropriate ways of implementing the 1981 Declaration&#8217;s standards would still need 
more fine-tuning.  Similarly to the drafting history of the 1981 Declaration, the Special 
Rapporteur expects another &#8220;long and arduous road full of obstacles&#8221; ahead until discrimination 
and intolerance based on religion or belief will finally be eliminated. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Role of the Special Rapporteur

<p>27. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief is closely related 
to the history and contents of the 1981 Declaration.  Created by Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 1986/20, the Special Rapporteur on religious intolerance, as the mandate used to be 
called, in the beginning had exclusively the mandate to examine incidents and governmental 
actions which were inconsistent with the 1981 Declaration&#8217;s provisions.  Gradually, the 
Commission on Human Rights included further provisions into the mandate&#8217;s remit, such as 
article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 18 of ICCPR and various other 
provisions of international human rights law.  The pertinent legal framework of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate is outlined in her 2005 report to the Commission on Human Rights 
(E/CN.4/2005/61, paras. 15-20). 
</p>
<p>28. As the first mandate-holder, Angelo Vidal d&#8217;Almeida Ribeiro, submitted his initial report 
on 24 December 1986; there are now 20 years of mandate experience.  In fact, the creation of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate encountered similar problems and obstacles compared to the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>elaboration of the 1981 Declaration.  Due to a diligent approach by the mandate-holders during 
the first couple of years, the mandate evolved step by step.  Thus it was possible to establish 
activities such as sending letters of allegation and urgent appeals, carrying out in situ visits and 
drafting thematic reports.  The change of the mandate title in 2000 was another important step 
because it confirmed the enlargement of the mandate&#8217;s scope.  Similarly to the 1981 Declaration 
the initial title used to be &#8220;Special Rapporteur on religious intolerance&#8221;.  Upon suggestion of the 
second mandate-holder, Abdelfattah Amor, it was changed to &#8220;Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion and belief&#8221;.  He argued that the new title encompasses not only religions but also beliefs 
(e.g. agnosticism, freethinking, atheism and rationalism) and that it facilitates cooperation with 
all parties concerned.  The concept of freedom of religion or belief is broader than the original 
non-discrimination approach.   
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur will continue to highlight issues that are of particular concern to 
the mandate through her communications with Governments and victims as well as during her in 
situ visits and in thematic reports.  In her activities she will remain vigilant in the task of 
protecting the individual and collective aspects of freedom of religion or belief but she will also 
deal with the preventive facets of the mandate.  With regard to prevention, an important step has 
been taken five years ago, when the Final Document of the International Consultative 
Conference on School Education in relation with Freedom of Religion and Belief, Tolerance and 
Non-discrimination was adopted in Madrid.  The previous mandate-holder, Abdelfattah Amor, 
had been instrumental in setting up this International Consultative Conference, held on the 
occasion of the 20th anniversary of the 1981 Declaration.  There have been promising follow-up 
activities by Governments and NGOs during global meetings of experts and exchanges of minds 
on regional levels.  However, these implementation efforts need a fresh impetus in order to 
further develop strategies on how religious intolerance and discrimination can be prevented and 
how freedom of religion or belief can be promoted through education.  The Special Rapporteur 
would like to emphasize the need to devise a strategy for the prevention of discrimination and 
intolerance based on religion or belief. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Online digest of the framework for communications 
</b></p>
<p>30. There is a wealth of information and legal reasoning to be found in the reports of the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief throughout the past 20 years.  The three 
mandate-holders have so far submitted 63 reports to the Commission on Human Rights, to the 
General Assembly and to the Human Rights Council, totalling more than 2,600 pages.  While 
electronic versions of the full texts of the reports since 1993 are available online via the Official 
Document System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org), finding the relevant answers 
to a given question may be compared to looking for a needle in a haystack. 
</p>
<p>31. For this reason, Ms. Jahangir intends to develop an online digest of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s framework for communications and to upload it on the OHCHR website 
(http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/religion/standards.htm).  In the annex of her previous 
annual report the Special Rapporteur has published this framework with various categories of 
relevant provisions of international human rights law which she uses as the legal yardstick.  The 
five main categories cover:  (1) elements of the right to freedom of religion or belief; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(2) discrimination on the basis of freedom of religion or belief; (3) the situation of vulnerable 
groups, including women, children, refugees, members of minorities and persons deprived of 
their liberty; (4) the intersection of freedom of religion or belief with other human rights; 
and (5) cross-cutting issues. 
</p>
<p>32. The framework for communications enables the Special Rapporteur to determine which 
elements, if any, of the mandate on freedom of religion or belief are raised by each allegation 
and to send more specific, tailored communications.  In particular, it allows her to draw the 
attention of the Government concerned to the particular international standards on the specific 
issue or issues and to ask pertinent questions about compliance.  Furthermore, it is intended to 
serve as a guide to the types of issues that are the subject of communications and, thus, it could 
be a useful tool for NGOs and other actors in their interactions with the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>33. Uploading the framework for communications on the OHCHR website will make the 
legal basis of freedom of religion or belief even more easily accessible for Governments and for 
civil society worldwide.  Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur plans to develop the existing 
framework into an online digest, illustrating the international standards with pertinent excerpts of 
the mandate-holders&#8217; findings according to the categories of her framework for communications.  
Consequently, the 20 years of mandate practice up to now may eventually help to flesh out the 
legal standards and contribute to their implementation.  Compiling this online digest is a 
time-consuming endeavour, especially as the human resources available to her mandate are very 
limited but exceedingly dedicated, however, the Special Rapporteur hopes to present a 
preliminary version in 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  ISSUES OF CONCERN TO THE MANDATE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Vulnerable situation of women 
</b></p>
<p>34. Since 1996, the Commission on Human Rights has persistently stressed in its resolutions 
the need for the Special Rapporteur to apply a gender perspective, inter alia, through the 
identification of gender-specific abuses in the reporting process, including in information 
collection and recommendations.  Although some countries initially have been reluctant to see 
the nexus between the discrimination of women and the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief, it is now accepted that the mandate-holder will raise cases or 
highlight situations that relate to the status of women.  Furthermore, resolution 2005/40 of the 
Commission on Human Rights explicitly invited the Special Rapporteur to address &#8220;the 
situations of violations and discrimination that affect many women as a result of religion or 
belief&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur regularly sends joint urgent appeals and allegation letters on this 
issue together with other special procedures holders, such as the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences as well as the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children.  The above-mentioned framework for communications 
contains a subcategory devoted to the vulnerable situation of women.  This subcategory details 
the applicable international human rights standards, e.g. articles 2 and 3 of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and Human Rights Committee 
general comment No. 28 (2000) on the equality of rights between men and women.   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>36. In practice, intolerance and discrimination is often applied with regard to multiple 
identities of the victim or group of victims.  Many of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communications 
and urgent appeals concern cases where women suffer from aggravated discrimination with 
regard to their religious, ethnic and sexual identities.  Women in many countries appear to be 
victims of double or triple forms of aggravated discrimination, owing to serious restrictions in 
the areas of education and employment.  Citizenship laws in a number of countries discriminate 
against women and their children because these regulations stipulate that mothers have fewer 
rights than fathers to transmit nationality.  Denying girls and women the right to wear religious 
symbols when they freely choose to do so may pose a problem in terms of international human 
rights law as well as does the forcible imposition of religious dress codes.  Discrimination and 
practices that are harmful to the health of women and girls are also applied within their religious 
communities for reasons of religious traditions or those ascribed to religion.  Furthermore, there 
have been reports of arrests, flogging, forced conversion and even murders targeted specifically 
at women in the context of intolerance based on religion or belief.  Female members of minority 
religions also tend to be prone to become victims of rape and violence stirred up by organized 
groups.   
</p>
<p>37. The freedom of religion or belief is a fundamental human right of a non-derogable 
character which can be limited only under restricted conditions.  Nevertheless, this right, like 
other human rights, cannot be used to justify the violation of other human rights and freedoms.  
That clause is, inter alia, provided by article 5 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and may, in certain cases, address situations of abuses committed in the name of 
religion.  The Human Rights Committee in its general comment No. 28 states that &#8220;Article 18 [of 
the ICCPR] may not be relied upon to justify discrimination against women by reference to 
freedom of thought, conscience and religion; States parties should therefore provide information 
on the status of women as regards their freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and indicate 
what steps they have taken or intend to take both to eliminate and prevent infringements of these 
freedoms in respect of women and to protect their right not to be discriminated against.&#8221;  
(para. 21) 
</p>
<p>38. The States&#8217; capacity and willingness to guarantee and protect de jure and de facto 
freedom of religion of all individuals within its jurisdiction is often the key to developing an 
appropriate framework for the protection of all human rights, including women&#8217;s rights.  It 
ensures that individuals can express themselves fully and dissent, even within their own religion; 
or, indeed, that they can choose not to have any religion at all.  No right should be protected at 
the expense of others.  Measures adopted to protect women&#8217;s rights, the right to freedom of 
religion or belief and other human rights should take into account all individuals in society.  The 
Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate the importance of ensuring that the right to freedom of 
religion or belief adds to the values of human rights and does not unintentionally become an 
instrument for undermining freedoms.  In this regard she welcomes recent statements and 
conference recommendations<b>3</b> which clarify religious views on female genital mutilation. 
</p>
<p>39. In 2002, the previous mandate-holder presented his thematic study entitled &#8220;&#201;tude sur la 
libert&#233; de religion ou de conviction et la condition de la femme au regard de la religion et des 
traditions&#8221; to the Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2002/73/Add.2).  It lists the different 
types of discrimination against women, such as practices that are harmful to the health of 
women, discrimination against women within the family, attacks on the right to life, honour 
killings, and attacks on their dignity, such as restrictions on the education of women or their </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>exclusion from certain functions.  The document is so far only available in the original French 
language version and the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate the request by the 
Commission on Human Rights in resolution 2004/36 that &#8220;from existing available resources and 
if necessary supplemented by voluntary contributions, the [study should] be translated into the 
other official languages of the United Nations and published as an official document&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Violations linked to counter-terrorism measures 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur has received numerous allegations that national counter-terrorism 
measures adopted in the post 9/11-context have had and continue to show adverse effects on the 
enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief worldwide.  The Special Rapporteur notes that these 
allegations relate both to countries where Muslims form a minority of the population and also 
where they are in the majority.  On many occasions, members of groups perceived to hold 
extreme religious views have been harassed, arrested or deported.  The Special Rapporteur is 
conscious of the fact that the States&#8217; obligation to protect and promote human rights requires 
them to take effective measures to combat terrorism.  However, she would like to underline that 
States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies with their obligations 
under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>41. Already in June 2003, the tenth meeting of special rapporteurs/representatives, experts 
and chairpersons of working groups of the special procedures of the Commission on Human 
Rights and of the advisory services programme addressed the fact that the anti-terrorism 
measures adopted by some States could include elements, or have unintended consequences, that 
undermined respect for fundamental human rights.  Concerns were raised that some groups had 
been specifically targeted, such as migrants, asylum-seekers or members of particular national, 
racial or religious groups.  While sharing in the unequivocal condemnation of terrorism, the 
participating mandate-holders in their joint statement (E/CN.4/2004/4, Annex 1) voiced their 
&#8220;profound concern at the multiplication of policies, legislation and practices increasingly being 
adopted by many countries in the name of the fight against terrorism which affect negatively the 
enjoyment of virtually all human rights - civil, cultural, economic, political and social&#8221;. 
42. In his latest report to the Commission on Human Rights, the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, 
Martin Scheinin, identified a current trend in counter-terrorism measures by States to tighten 
immigration controls, including through so-called racial, ethnic or religious profiling.  When 
reviewing the State reports to the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee, Mr. Scheinin 
stated that &#8220;it is well known that States frequently apply terrorism definitions that either do not 
meet the requirements of ICCPR article 15 (<i>nullum crimen sine lege, nulla poena sine lege,</i> 
non-retroactivity) or, even worse, are designed in bad faith to outlaw political opposition, 
religious entities, or minority, indigenous or autonomy movements that have never resorted to 
violence against persons&#8221;.  (E/CN.4/2006/98, para. 62.) 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Religious minorities and new religious movements 
</b></p>
<p>43. As noted in previous reports, religious minorities and new religious movements face 
various forms of discrimination and intolerance, both from policies, legislation and State 
practice.  Issues of concern relate to obstacles in the official registration procedures as well as 
inappropriate limitations when disseminating materials and displaying religious symbols.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, some religious minorities are adversely affected by manifestations of rejection or 
violence from non-State actors and by threats to their very existence as a specific community.  
When religious minorities are groups that are considered so-called non-traditional or new 
religious movements, the members of these communities may be the object of suspicion and 
suffer greater limitations to their right to freedom of religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>44. The first mandate-holder, d&#8217;Almeida Ribeiro, already in 1990 stated that &#8220;aspects having 
to do with the antiquity of a religion, its revealed character and the existence of a scripture, while 
important, are not sufficient to make a distinction [between religions, sects and religious 
associations].  Even belief in the existence of a Supreme Being, a particular ritual or a set of 
ethical and social rules are not exclusive to religions but can also be found in political ideologies.  
So far, a satisfactory and acceptable distinction has not been arrived at&#8221;.  (E/CN.4/1990/46, 
para. 110.)  His successor in the mandate, Abdelfattah Amor, added that &#8220;[r]eligions cannot be 
distinguished from sects on the basis of quantitative considerations, saying that a sect, unlike a 
religion, has a small number of followers.  This is not in fact always the case.  It runs absolutely 
counter to the principle of respect and protection for minorities, which is upheld by both 
domestic and international law and morality.  Besides, following this line of argument, what are 
the major religions if not successful sects?&#8221;.  (E/CN.4/1997/91, para. 95.)  The second 
mandate-holder further emphasized that the issue of sects or new religious movements is 
complicated by the fact that international human rights instruments provide no definition of the 
concepts of religion, sect or new religious movement:  &#8220;Added to this legal dimension is the 
general confusion regarding the term &#8216;sect&#8217; in particular.  Although the idea of a sect was 
originally a neutral one and meant a community of individuals constituting a minority within a 
religion and having split from it, it often now has a pejorative connotation so that it is frequently 
regarded as synonymous with danger, and sometimes a non-religious dimension when it is 
identified as a commercial enterprise.  The term &#8216;sect&#8217; is therefore in need of further clarification, 
as are the terms &#8216;religions&#8217;, &#8216;new religious movements&#8217; and &#8216;commercial enterprise&#8217;.  It is crucial 
to look at this phenomenon objectively so as to avoid the two pitfalls of either infringing the 
freedom of religion and belief or exploiting freedom of religion and belief for purposes other 
than those for which it has been recognized and protected.&#8221;  (E/CN.4/1998/6, paras. 116-117) 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur would like to join her predecessors&#8217; analysis concerning the 
complexity of defining religion and belief.  The pertinent international human rights standards 
seem to take the problem of finding a satisfactory definition of the &#8220;protected religion&#8221; into 
account by providing for a broad view of this concept.  The Human Rights Committee in its 
general comment No. 22 (1993) rightly argued:  &#8220;The terms &#8216;belief&#8217; and &#8216;religion&#8217; are to be 
broadly construed.  Article 18 is not limited in its application to traditional religions or to 
religions and beliefs with institutional characteristics or practices analogous to those of 
traditional religions.  The Committee therefore views with concern any tendency to discriminate 
against any religion or belief for any reason, including the fact that they are newly established, or 
represent religious minorities that may be the subject of hostility on the part of a predominant 
religious community.&#8221;  Furthermore, the Human Rights Committee reiterated that article 18 of 
the ICCPR &#8220;protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess 
any religion or belief&#8221; (para. 2).  This formula has already been quoted in various United Nations 
reports (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1987/26, para. 13; E/CN.4/1990/46, para. 110) and it is also used as a 
definition in the Madrid Final Document on School Education in relation with Freedom of 
Religion and Belief, Tolerance and Non-discrimination (E/CN.4/2002/73, Appendix). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>46. In line with this reasoning, the Special Rapporteur follows the approach of interpreting 
the scope of application for freedom of religion or belief in a large sense, bearing in mind that 
manifestations of this freedom may be subject to such limitations as are prescribed by law and 
are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and 
freedoms of others.  Rosalyn Higgins, who is currently President of the International Court of 
Justice and was a member of the Human Rights Committee when its general comment No. 22 
was drafted, &#8220;resolutely opposed the idea that States could have complete latitude to decide what 
was and what was not a genuine religious belief.  The contents of a religion should be defined by 
the worshippers themselves; as for manifestations, article 18, paragraph 3, existed to prevent 
them from violating the rights of others&#8221;.  (CCPR/C/SR.1166, para. 48.)  A similar statement 
was made by Abdelfattah Amor in his 1997 report to the Commission on Human Rights.  There, 
the second mandate-holder emphasized that, apart from the legal courses available against 
harmful activities, &#8220;it is not the business of the State or any other group or community to act as 
the guardian of people&#8217;s consciences and encourage, impose or censure any religious belief or 
conviction&#8221;.  (E/CN.4/1997/91, para. 99) 
</p>
<p>47. In this regard it seems to be particularly worrying when a religious community is 
empowered - either de jure or de facto - to decide about or to veto the registration of another 
religious or belief group.  The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that registration should 
not be a precondition for practising one&#8217;s religion, but only for the acquisition of a legal 
personality and related benefits.  Furthermore, registration procedures should be easy and quick 
and they should neither depend on reviews of the substantive content of the belief nor on 
extensive formal requirements.  Thus, requiring high minimum membership levels or a lengthy 
existence in the country concerned are no appropriate criteria for registration.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>IV</b>.  <b>CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>48.<b> The number and seriousness of mandate-related allegations received by the Special 
Rapporteur lead to the conclusion that the protection of freedom of religion or belief and 
the implementation of the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance 
and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief is far from being a reality.  Governments 
should redouble their efforts to uphold the provisions in their everyday work and 
non-governmental organizations may continue to exercise their role as public watchdogs 
and also inform on national best practices.  Numerous differing approaches in various 
countries may be noted and there still is a huge gap between rhetoric and practice in many 
instances. 
</b></p>
<p>49.<b> The principles contained in the 1981 Declaration need to be further disseminated 
among lawmakers, judges and civil servants but also among non-State actors.  It is of the 
utmost importance to promote the ideals of tolerance and understanding through 
education, for example by introducing human rights standards in school curricula and 
through the training of the teaching staff.  Religious tolerance can only be acquired if 
people learn from their earliest childhood about the existence and distinctive 
characteristics of other religious or faith-based communities.  There is an urgent need to 
eliminate the root causes of intolerance and discrimination and to remain vigilant with 
regard to freedom of religion or belief worldwide.  It is</b> <b>equally crucial to depoliticize issues 
relating to religion or belief and to bring the discussion fully within the framework of 
human rights. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>50.<b> The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that most situations of religious 
intolerance stem either from ignorance or from misleading information.  In her opinion, 
the right orientation to education is crucial for promoting religious harmony.  
Unfortunately, she regularly receives allegations about schoolbooks which display, and 
even encourage, a lack of respect for members of non-traditional religious minorities or for 
religions that differ from the predominant religion in the country.  The authorities 
concerned are called to promptly remove any passages from schoolbooks that run counter 
to religious tolerance or to withdraw such books.  In this regard, the 2001 Madrid Final 
Document on School Education in relation with Freedom of Religion and Belief, Tolerance 
and Non-discrimination offers important guidance for a desirable education of tolerance. 
</b></p>
<p>51.<b> The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s envisaged online digest of the past 20 years of mandate 
experience might help in disseminating the international standards of freedom of religion 
or belief.  In combining the categories of her framework for communications with 
pertinent excerpts from the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; reports, she hopes to make the applicable 
legal standards more easily accessible and understandable.  On the preventive level, this 
may eventually lead to an improved knowledge of the required or prohibited governmental 
actions.  With regard to the protection of victims, the online digest is intended to help in 
identifying the international human rights involved, thus facilitating the work of 
non-governmental organizations and their interactions with the Special Rapporteur. 
</b></p>
<p>52.<b> As many women suffer from aggravated discrimination with regard to their 
religious, ethnic and sexual identities, national and international action is required to 
prevent such aggravated discrimination and to improve the protective efforts.  Prevention 
requires first of all identifying cultural practices that are harmful for women and girls; 
States should then prepare strategies, e.g. through educative, legislative and health-related 
measures, in order to eliminate prejudicial practices especially where they are deeply 
rooted in society.  Protection necessitates effective application of existing national laws and 
international human rights standards; Governments should therefore reinforce domestic 
structures of control and official bodies for the protection of all human rights.  The Special 
Rapporteur hopes that her predecessor&#8217;s study entitled &#8220;&#201;tude sur la libert&#233; de religion ou 
de conviction et la condition de la femme au regard de la religion et des traditions&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/2002/73/Add.2)</b> <b>will</b> <b>be translated into the other official languages of the 
United Nations. 
</b></p>
<p>53.<b> Some counter-terrorism measures appear to include elements that undermine 
respect for fundamental human rights, including freedom of religion or belief.  While the 
Special Rapporteur is conscious of the fact that the States&#8217; obligation to protect and 
promote human rights requires them to take effective measures to combat terrorism, she 
emphasizes that States must also ensure that any measure complies with their obligations 
under international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law.  She reiterates the 
concern expressed by other mandate-holders that the application of terrorism definitions 
may be used to outlaw peaceful religious entities or to blacklist entire communities and 
religions, subjecting them to systematic suspicion.  States should refocus their efforts on the 
origins of terrorism and on the need to ensure protection and promotion of human rights 
without bias or selectivity. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>54.<b> Religious minorities and new religious movements are confronted with various 
forms of discrimination and intolerance, stemming both from Governments and from 
non-State actors.  It is critical that Governments commit themselves to full respect to the 
norms of human rights and play a role of bridge-builders rather than join the alarmists in 
widening the gap of understanding and mutual trust.  Rising religious intolerance 
deteriorates the quality of life for all people of the world.  Concerning the concepts of 
&#8220;religion&#8221; or &#8220;belief&#8221;, the Special Rapporteur interprets the scope of application for 
freedom of religion or belief in a large sense, bearing in mind that manifestations of this 
freedom may be subject to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to 
protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of 
others.  Furthermore, no religious community should be empowered to decide about or to 
veto the registration of another religious or belief group. 
</b></p>
<p>55.<b> Legislation with regard to advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence must be applied by independent and non-arbitrary 
bodies.  Accordingly the prosecution, while retaining their prosecutorial discretion, should 
rely on transparent and neutral standards when applying the legislation to specific cases.  
Furthermore an independent judiciary is an absolutely vital component in the process of 
effectively combating forms of expression that incite to religious or racial hatred.  The need 
for bodies which comply with international standards on the independence of the judges 
and lawyers in this context is a prime example of the importance of the interdependence of 
human rights.  It should also be noted that the application of so-called &#8220;hate speech&#8221; 
legislation can be particularly problematic where the law itself favours one religion, or 
where a religion rather than freedom of religion or belief is the object of protection. 
</b>56. <b>Religious controversies are historical.  They will continue to demand the 
international community&#8217;s attention and challenge societies to find creative ways of dealing 
with it.  There are no classic or tested recipes for resolving such sensitive issues.  
Nevertheless, at the very least, political leadership must collectively and openly commit 
itself to defy intolerance based on religion or belief.  In this regard, a continuing dialogue at 
all levels is essential.  There are indeed some remarkable examples where a call for 
dialogue has prevented violence or ended hostilities.  In many cases, such initiatives are 
even more successful when they include members of all faiths and beliefs, women as well as 
persons who are dispassionate in matters of religion.</b> </p>
