8.      
The Plaintiff in her evidence testified that she and her son Salen Prakash Maharaj (Deceased) went to Patel Sharma Lawyers to make wills. One Ms Mala of Patel Sharma Lawyers after obtaining all necessary details from both of them prepared two wills. She stated that she and her son signed the wills in the presence of two witnesses and one of them was Mala. She further stated that her son paid for preparation of both wills although she is unable to recall the amount paid to Lawyers.

9.      
She further stated that her son Salen Prakash Maharaj died of an accident on 24 November 2008 and upon his death she and her daughter in law (the Defendant) went to Patel Sharma Lawyers to find about the will and they were told by Ms Mala that there was no will of Salen Prakash Maharaj. She testifies that her daughter has discovered the will sometime in January 2010 of Salen Prakash Maharaj while searching for some papers. She stated that she is seeking from this court that the Letter of Administration that was granted to the Plaintiff be revoked and the original will of Salen Prakash Maharaj be probated.

10.     
In cross examination, several questions were asked on her understanding of a will. She explained her understanding of a will and stated that Ms Mala of Patel Sharma Lawyers explained about the will in Hindi language. She was also questioned on the signature of the will of the deceased and suggested that the signature of the will is a forged signature which she categorically denied. She stated that deceased made his own will.

11.     
She further stated in cross examination that she contacted Patel Sharma Lawyers several times because she knew that deceased made a will.

12.     
The Plaintiffs next witness was Ms Subhashni Lata Singh, a daughter of the Plaintiff. She testified that she made an appointment with Patel Sharma Lawyers for the deceased and the Plaintiff to make their wills. She stated that after the death of Salen Prakash Maharaj she together with the Plaintiff, the Defendant and her husband made enquiries from Ms Mala of Patel Sharma Lawyers regarding the will.

Mr Hiuare: Mrs Singh because of this after 1 year were looking for the will?
Mrs Singh: I was not looking for the will. I was looking for my other documents there. I found the will and I gave it back to the solicitor. If I was looking for the will I would not go back to Australia I will be still searching for the will here.

14.     
The Defendant Pranita Devi, the legal wife of the deceased testified that she was not aware of the will of her husband SalenPrakash Maharaj. After the death of the husband, on the request of Subhashni Lata Singh she, together with Subhashni, the Plaintiff and the Plaintiffs husband visited Patel Sharma Lawyers to enquire about the will. She testified what exactly transpired at the lawyers office in the following manner:

Ms. Devi: Suruj Sharma.
Mr. Hiuare: What did Suruj Sharma say that time?
Ms Devi: He asked me why I came there?
Mr. Hiuare: Did Suruj Sharma show you anything?
Ms Devi: No.
Mr. Hiuare: So what did Suruj Sharma tell you?
Ms. Devi: He asked me do you know anything about the probate and I told him no.
Mr. Hiuare: Did Mala or Suruj show you the will that time?
Ms. Devi: No.
Mr. Hiuare: And what did Suruj Sharma do that time?
Ms. Devi: He told us that he can take out the probate if there is no will. Mala checked and there is no will.
Mr Hiuare: What did Mr Sharma advise you to do?
Ms. Devi: Mr Sharma told Mala to fill a form.
Mr Hiuare: Do you know that form?
Ms Devi: No.
Mr Hiuare: Pranita who advised you that you are entitled to take out the Letter of Administration.

15.     
She further testified that she visited Patel Sharma lawyers again with her mothers brother Mr Jayawant Pratap, and other family members to discuss about a settlement. She testified in the following manner with regard to the proposed settlement:

Mr. Hiuare: Who else was helping you at Suruj Sharma after that?

Ms. Devi: My mothers brother suggested 65% to be given to Maya Wati and 35% for me.
Mr. Hiuare: And how&& this settlement?

16.     
She under cross examination admitted that the deceased from year 2006  2007 period was having defacto relationship with one Ms Pranita Singh, a girl of 15 year old, in the same house. She stated that she used to sleep with the Plaintiff as the deceased was also living in the house with one Ms. Pranita Singh.

17.     
The witness explained further, about the phone call she received from Patel Sharma lawyers regarding the will. He evidence was as follows:

Ms. Narayan: In your evidence in chief you said you became aware of Salens will when Mr Sharmas office called you and told you. Do you agree with that?

 Ms Devi: I do not have any idea of Salens will. I was contacted by Mr Suruj Sharma of Patel Sharma & Associates who advised me that there was a will in question and she &.. and basically in the absence of a will then Mrs. Prakash can apply for a probate. Patel Sharma had done the search and prior to that advised me that there was no will in question.

Ms. Narayan: When you were asked by your lawyer as to when you became aware of the will in response you were informed by Suruj Sharmas office that they have received the will. Do you agree with that?

Ms. Devi: In Suruj Sharmas office I applied for an Letter of Administration application&..

Ms. Narayan: She should be directed to answer the question.

Ms. Devi: After the Letter of Administration was granted at Sharmas office then Mrs Prakash brought into the picture a will  my husbands will.

Ms. Narayan: But do you agree with me that it was the office of Suruj Sharma that you see the will? That is what you said in evidence?

Ms. Devi: Mr Sharma was asked to see how the will was made from and Mr Sharma had actually applied for Letter of Administration which was granted. Only interested in seeing the will and looking at the contents of the will. That is the only thing he has to do.

Ms. Narayan: Now isnt it true when Mr Sharmas office the will they asked you to see a will?

Ms. Devi: Yes.

Ms. Narayan: So in actual fact Mrs Devi there was a will made by Mr Sharmas office of Salen Maharaj?

Ms. Devi: The difference is that Salen Maharaj had never executed a will through Suruj Sharmas office. Had it been that they granted a will they will not apply for Letter of Administration.

18.     
In the re-examination, she stated that Patel Sharma lawyers are their family lawyers and took out the Letter of Administration as there was no will. She also stated that she wanted to go to a different lawyer but could not afford another lawyer due to financial difficulties.

19.     
Mr. Jayawant Pratap in his evidence testified his involvement in the estate of Salen Prakash Maharaj. He stated the he helped the Defendant as she was his sisters daughter. He testified that he helped the Defendant in the following manner in his evidence:

Mr Hiuare: Did you seek any advice about this on behalf of Pranita? Did you see any lawyer?

Mr. Pratap: Yes Mr Suruj Sharma, Patel Sharma lawyers. Suruj Sharma is my brother in law from my sisters husbands side. He is very close to me too. In fact those people are very close to them too. I went to see him and I sat down. It was on a Saturday. I sat down and had a bowl of grog there then I was telling the story about Pranitas husband and how to take out the probate and after that there was a clerk by the name of Mala and she was looking and there is no will or anything. There were none there. They checked the computer too and the afternoon there was no copy of the will in the file too. Where there is no will both parties came Salens brother and my sisters daughter Pranita and together they will take out the probate. The probate has to be taken out in Pranitas name. She is the legal wife. Before that the mother in law was telling the solicitor to take out the probate under her name but the lawyer said it will go to the wife.

Mr. Hiuare: Where were you that time when they were inside the office? Were you outside the office or sitting together on the table?

Mr Pratap: I was Sharmas office. The first time only Pranita and myself, Mala Pranita and Rosie and Suruj Shama.

Mr. Hiuare: What did you specifically discussed?

Mr Pratap: Discussion was made between both parties. Suruj Sharma said there is no children so the properties will not all go to Pranita. We will be giving 35% and 65% to mother in law. At least she can get something out of it. After some time they found a will there. I get shock. Any paper has to be signed by him he always come and contact me. How come there is a will there which I do not know and Pranita does not know.

 The Determination

20.     
It is clear from agreed facts of the pretrial conference minutes that the execution of the will by the deceased is admitted. I re-iterate the following agreed facts in order to determine the issue in this case.

i.      
The Last Will of the Deceased was recovered on 23 January 2010.

ii.     
The Will was executed by the Deceased on 22 December 2006.

iii.    
The Deceaseds Will was prepared by Patel Sharma lawyers.

21.     
The Defendant in the Statement of Defence takes up the position of forgery as a ground to challenge and invalidate the will. However it is noted that, the issue of forgery has not been raised as a determination of issue at the pre-trail conference.

22.     
At the outset, court needs to examine the will of Salen Prakash Maharaj dated 22 December 2006 to ascertain whether the will is in accordance with the provisions of Wills Act Cap a which provides: 

6. Subject to the provisions of Part V a will is not valid unless it is in writing and executed in the following manner:

(a)     
It is signed by the testator or by some person in his presence and by his direction in such place on the document as to be apparent on the face of the will that the testator intended by such signature to give effect to the writing as his will;

(b)     
Such signature is made or acknowledged by the testator in the presence of at least two witnesses present at the same time; and

(c)     
The witnesses attest and subscribe the will in the presence of the testator, but no form of attestation is necessary.

23.     
In view of the provisions of the Wills Act, will dated 22 December 2006, is in compliance with the provisions of the same as it satisfies all necessary requirements for a valid will.

24.     
The Defendant submits that the Plaintiff failed to discharge its onus in proving the validity of the will as she the one who seeks to propound the will.

25.     
The Defendant in her submissions relies on Chandra v Chandra (2012) FJHC 1080, Judgment of Calanchini J to support her position.

In the above case, court held:

Whenever it is necessary for an executor to establish due execution of a will, he is required at common law, to call on of the attesting witnesses, if any was available (Bowman v Hodgson (1867) 1 L.R.P and D 362).

The burden imposed on a party who seeks to propound a will was stated clearly by Lord Hanworth MR in the Estate of Lavinia Musgrove, Davis v Mayhew [1927] P 264 at page 276.

It is clear first, that the onus of proving a will lies upon the party propounding it, and secondly, that he must satisfy the conscience of the Court that the instrument so propounded is the last will of a free and capable testator. To develop this rule a little further  he must show that the testator knew and approved of the instrument as his testament and intended it to be such.

Parke B in the course of his judgment in Barry v Butlin (1) says:

The strict meaning of the term onus probandi is this, that if no evidence is given by the party on whom the burden is cast, the issue must be found against him. In all cases the onus is imposed on the party propounding a will, it is in general discharged by proof of capacity, and the fact of execution, from which the knowledge of and assent to the contents of the instrument are assumed.

The Court will usually pronounce for a will if one of the attesting witnesses deposes to the due execution of the will. However the Court will not exclude further relevant evidence for the purpose of avoiding fraud. Vere  Wardale  v  Johnson and Others [1949] P 395 is authority for the proposition that the evidence of the attesting witness to a will is not necessarily conclusive and the court is competent to receive evidence in rebuttal. Willmer LJ page 397 stated:

It appears to me that the object of the legislature in imposing the strict formalities required by the Wills Act, 1837, was to prevent fraud. My duty here is to do all that I can to see that no fraud is perpetuated; and if I exclude further evidence such a ruling can only assist the possibility of the perpetration of fraud.

In the circumstances it is my opinion that it would be quite wrong, and no in accordance with authority, to exclude such further evidence with regard to the attesting of this will as may be available.

26.     
The applicability of the underlying principles in the above judgment in the instant case before court is of paramount importance.

27.     
In my view, the onus of the executor to establish the due execution of will was only if the execution of the will is contested or the will was executed subject to duress, under influence, or lack of proper material status. It is noted that there is no such allegation in this matter and no evidence was adduced to that effect by the Defendant.

28.     
The New Zealand Court of Appeal in J.J. Bishop v P. J Odea & Another  (1999) NZCA 239 considered the legal principles applicable in cases of testamentary capacity. It summarized the legal principles as follows:

(1) In probate proceedings those propounding the will do not have to establish that the maker of the will had testamentary capacity, unless there is some evidence raring lack of capacity as a tenable issue. In the absence of such evidence, the maker of a will apparently rational on its face, will be prensumed to have testamentary capacity Re White [1951] NZLR 393 (CA) and Peters v. Morris (CA 99/85:judgment 19 May 1987).

(2). If there is evidence which raises lack of capacity as a tenable issue, the onus of satisfying the Court that the maker of the will did have testamentary capacity rests on those who seeks probate of the will: Public Trustee v Bick [1973] 1 NZLR 301 and Peters v. Morris (supra).

29.     
In consideration of the above case authorities, it is clear to court that the burden shifts to Plaintiff only if there is any evidence before the court on lack of capacity and in the instance case, I re-iterate that there is no such evidence.

30.     
The Defendant as I stated in my earlier paragraphs that the issue of forgery of signature has not been raised as an issue for determination in this case although pleaded in the Statement of Defense.

31.     
Functions of the pleading has been clearly stated in the case Williams Associates Ltd v Gunwale [2009] FJHC 88; HBC 94 of 2004 (13 February 2009) at Para [106].

.. The Defendant had not specifically pleaded any such defence by way of equitable relief. On this issue, the decision of the High Court of Australia in Dare v Paulham (1982) 148 CLR 658 (Austlii: [1982] HA 70, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HAC/1982/70 .html) is worth noting:

"6. Pleadings and particulars have a number of functions: they furnish a statement of the case sufficient clear to allow the other party a fair opportunity to meet it (Gould and Birbeck and Bacon v. Mount Oxide Mines Ltd. (In lig.) [1916]HCA 81; (1916) 22 CLR 490, at p 517; they define the issues for decision in the litigation and thereby enable the relevance and admissibility of evidence to be determined at the trial (Miller v. Cameron [1936] HCA 13; (1936) 54 CLR 572, at pp576-577; and they give a defendant an understanding of a plaintiff's claim in aid of the defendant's right to make a payment into court. Apart from cases where there parties choose to disregard the pleadings and to fight the case on issue chosen at the trial, the relief which may be granted to a party must be founded on the pleadings(Gould and Birbeck and Bacon (1916) 22 CLR, at pp 517, 518; Sri Mahant Gogind Rao v. Sita Ram Kesho (1898) LR 25 Ind App 195, at p 207). But where there is no departure during the trial from the pleaded cause of action, a disconformities between the evidence and particulars earlier furnished will not disentitle a party to a verdict based upon the evidence. Particulars may be amended after the evidence in a trial has closed (Mummery v Irvings Pty Ltd, (1956) [1956] HCA 45; 96 CLR 99, at pp 111, 112, 127), though a failure to amend particulars to accord precisely with the facts which have emerged in the course of evidence does not necessarily preclude a plaintiff from seeking a verdict on the cause of action alleged in reliance upon the facts actually established by the evidence (Leotta v Public Trnsport Commission (N.S.W) (1976) 9 ALR 437, at p 446; 50 ALJR 666, at p 668) (at p664)."

32.     
As the issue of forgery has been specifically pleaded and some evidence was led to that effect, and inconsideration of the above judgment, I now consider the issue of forgery in this case.

33.     
The burden falls on the Defendant to establish that fraud was involved in the sense that the signatures on the will dated 22 December 2006 was not the signature of the deceased and has been forged. 

34.     
It is noted that there was no expert evidence of handwriting led in this case for comparison and no documents were produced in this regard. It is my considered view that mere suggestion to witnesses that the signature in the will is not similar to the signature of deceased is not sufficient to establish forgery in civil standard of proof. I conclude that the Defendant has failed to establish forgery in this case as there was no acceptable evidence before court, even if the court assumes that the forgery of the signature is an issue for determination in the minutes of the pretrial conference.

35.     
I also conclude that the execution of the will is an admitted fact and as a result it was not necessary for the Plaintiff to call either of the attesting witnesses to the will dated 22 December 2006 to establish due execution and hence validity.

36.     
I note that the parties in this case are in this predicament due to the inadvertence of the solicitors acted in the preparation of the will. When all the parties visited after the death of Salen Prakash Maharaj, they were categorically informed that there was no will. The same solicitor subsequently acted for the Defendant and took steps to take out Letter of Administration in favour of the Defendant. When the will was discovered and submitted to the solicitor, he contacted the Defendant and informed that there is a will and thereby the Letter of Administration is in issue. The solicitors are duty bound be maintain proper records and registers for the wills prepared by them on behalf of their clients. It appears that there was no such accurate system registration and recording of wills in the law firm. It also appears that the will is not registered. Wills (Amendment) Act requires the registration of will to avoid the circumstances similar to this case. It is further observed that the existence or the non existence of a will to a complete 3rd party, by the solicitors after the death is also a matter of concern of the court. In my view, the conduct of the solicitor acted for parties initially in preparation of the will and Letter of Administration is unacceptable and unsatisfactory.

37.     
In conclusion, I pronounce the will dated 22 December 2006 is the valid will I order that probate of the will dated 22 December 2006 be granted in favour of the Plaintiff as executor and trustee subject to the lodgment with Chief 

Registrar of the necessary application. I also order the Letter of Administration granted to the Defendant on 16 February 2009 be revoked forthwith. The Defendant is directed to provide an account of the estate within one month from this judgment. I also order that the Defendant pay the Plaintiff's costs of those proceedings which are fixed summarily in the sum of $1,500.00.
