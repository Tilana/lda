<p> <b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The first substantive right provided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>in its article 3, is the right to life, liberty and security of person. As stressed by the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Committee in paragraph 2 of its general comment No. 35, on article 9 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the right to liberty and security of 
</p>
<p>person is precious for its own sake, and also because the deprivation of liberty and security 
</p>
<p>of person have historically been principal means for impairing the enjoyment of other 
</p>
<p>rights.1 
</p>
<p>2. While the right to liberty of person is not an absolute right, any deprivation of liberty 
</p>
<p>must not be arbitrary and must be carried out with respect for the rule of law.2 As affirmed 
</p>
<p>by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 24/12, detainees retain all of their human 
</p>
<p>rights and fundamental freedoms, except for those lawful limitations that are demonstrably 
</p>
<p>necessitated by the fact of incarceration. 
</p>
<p>3. According to recent statistics, more than 10.2 million people around the world are 
</p>
<p>deprived of their liberty,3 about 3 million of whom are awaiting trial.4 Data further suggests 
</p>
<p>that the number of prisoners exceeds official prison capacity in at least 114 countries, and 
</p>
<p>that prisons in 92 of these countries hold between 100 and 200 per cent of their capacity, 
</p>
<p>while 22 hold over double, even triple or nearly quadruple their capacity.5 The levels of 
</p>
<p>overcrowding in places of deprivation of liberty around the world have been described as 
</p>
<p>endemic,6 alarming,7 extreme,8 chronic9 and outrageous,10 and are said to be an indicator of, 
</p>
<p>and contributor to, the global prison crisis.11 
</p>
<p>4. The phenomena of overcrowding and overincarceration are inherently intertwined. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment stated that &#8220;[t]he negative impact of the overuse of incarceration on human 
</p>
<p>rights is manifold. The overuse of imprisonment constitutes one of the major underlying 
</p>
<p>causes of overcrowding, which results in conditions that amount to ill-treatment or even 
</p>
<p>torture&#8221;.12 Furthermore, numerous United Nations bodies and mechanisms, including the 
</p>
<p>Security Council,13 the Human Rights Committee,14 the Committee against Torture,15 the 
</p>
<p>Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture,16 the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention17 and

<p>regional human rights bodies18 have all expressed serious concerns about overcrowding in 
</p>
<p>places of deprivation of liberty and its negative impact on the human rights of detainees.  
</p>
<p>5. Overcrowding is not only a problem in prisons but also in other places in which 
</p>
<p>individuals are deprived of their liberty. Article 4 of the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment defines the term &#8220;deprivation of liberty&#8221; as encompassing any place under 
</p>
<p>States&#8217; jurisdiction and control where persons are or may be deprived of their liberty, either 
</p>
<p>by virtue of an order given by a public authority, or at its instigation, or with its consent or 
</p>
<p>acquiescence. This definition corresponds to the long-standing practice of international and 
</p>
<p>regional human rights mechanisms, which have interpreted the term &#8220;deprivation of liberty&#8221; 
</p>
<p>to include settings beyond the criminal justice sector.19 The problem of overcrowding also 
</p>
<p>extends to such settings, including psychiatric hospitals,20 various centres for holding 
</p>
<p>irregular migrants and asylum seekers,21 including offshore centres for processing asylum 
</p>
<p>claims,22 and temporary airport holding facilities.23  
</p>
<p>6. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 24/12, encouraged States to address 
</p>
<p>overcrowding in detention facilities by taking effective measures. In the same resolution, it 
</p>
<p>requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit an analytical 
</p>
<p>report on the human rights implications of overincarceration and overcrowding, drawing on 
</p>
<p>the experience of United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms, seeking the views 
</p>
<p>of States, including on their practice regarding alternatives to detention, and other relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders. In response to a note verbale sent by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights, 23 States and 22 other stakeholders submitted their 
</p>
<p>views, which are available online.24  
</p>
<p>7. The present report contains an analysis of the human rights implications of 
</p>
<p>overincarceration and overcrowding, including the impact of overincarceration and 
</p>
<p>overcrowding on human rights, the main causes of overincarceration and overcrowding, 
</p>
<p>recommendations on ways to address these issues and conclusions.  
</p>
<p><b> II. The impact of overincarceration and overcrowding  
on human rights 
</b></p>
<p>8. The main element that defines deprivation of liberty is the inability of those who are 
</p>
<p>in detention to protect themselves, as their daily life is largely dependent on the decisions 
</p>
<p>taken by personnel in detention facilities.25 Therefore, when resorting to deprivation of 
</p>
<p>liberty, a State undertakes a duty of care26 and special responsibility27 towards those held in

<p>detention. Consequently, failure to fulfil this duty may entail State responsibility,28 
</p>
<p>including international responsibility.29 Except for those lawful limitations that are 
</p>
<p>demonstrably necessitated by the fact of incarceration, State authorities should ensure that 
</p>
<p>persons deprived of their liberty are able to enjoy all human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to liberty and security 
</b></p>
<p>9. As stressed by the Human Rights Committee, the right to liberty and security of 
</p>
<p>person applies to everyone, including those convicted of crime.30 While States enjoy a wide 
</p>
<p>margin of discretion in their choice of penal policy, the right to liberty of person articulated 
</p>
<p>in article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires that, as a 
</p>
<p>basic principle, States resort to the deprivation of liberty only insofar as it is necessary to 
</p>
<p>meet a pressing societal need and in a manner proportionate to that need.31 Moreover, any 
</p>
<p>deprivation of liberty must not be arbitrary and must be carried out with respect for the rule 
</p>
<p>of law.32  
</p>
<p>10. One of the fundamental safeguards against arbitrary deprivation of liberty is the 
</p>
<p>right to bring proceedings before a court to challenge the lawfulness of detention, which is 
</p>
<p>a self-standing33 and non-derogable right.34 In order to render this right effective, such 
</p>
<p>principles as impartiality of the court reviewing the detention, assistance by a legal counsel, 
</p>
<p>access to legal aid and authorities bearing the burden of proof must be observed.35 Yet, 
</p>
<p>numerous human rights bodies have reported serious infringements upon the right to liberty 
</p>
<p>as individuals are detained without any justification,36 those arrested are not promptly 
</p>
<p>brought before a judge,37 and a judicial decision regarding continued detention is not 
</p>
<p>rendered swiftly.38 Moreover, the ability of detainees to challenge their continued detention 
</p>
<p>is frequently hindered owing to a lack of access to legal representation and legal aid and 
</p>
<p>even the unavailability of judges.39  
</p>
<p>11. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention stated that the principle that deprivation 
</p>
<p>of liberty shall be imposed proportionately to meet a pressing public need is most relevant 
</p>
<p>to detention pending trial.40 This implies that pretrial detention should be a measure of last

<p>resort. However, international41 and regional42 bodies have expressed their concern over the 
</p>
<p>increasing use of pretrial detention and its excessive length, noting its significant 
</p>
<p>contribution to overcrowding,43 leading to a situation where, in some prisons, pretrial 
</p>
<p>detainees constitute the majority of the population.44  
</p>
<p>12. It has also been reported that, in some States, overcrowding makes it difficult to 
</p>
<p>monitor the implementation of each sentence. This infringes upon the right to personal 
</p>
<p>liberty of those who have already served their sentences and are not promptly released.45  
</p>
<p>13. Concerns have also been expressed over practices of preventive custody46 and post-
</p>
<p>conviction preventive detention47 employed by some States, which both infringe upon the 
</p>
<p>right to liberty and contribute to the problem of overincarceration and overcrowding.  
</p>
<p>14. Authorities in charge of places of detention bear the duty of care towards 
</p>
<p>detainees,48 a duty often neglected as &#8212; due to overcrowding &#8212; prison resources are 
</p>
<p>overstretched and staffing levels are inadequate for the numbers of detainees. This leads to 
</p>
<p>serious breaches of the right to security of detainees and instances where authorities fail to 
</p>
<p>protect detainees from inter-prisoner violence.49 Due to overcrowding, tensions may also 
</p>
<p>arise between the staff and detainees50 with a potential serious impact on discipline,51 
</p>
<p>leading to rule by the most powerful detainees,52 riots, disturbances and hunger strikes in 
</p>
<p>protest to the conditions of detention.53 Furthermore, overcrowding in detention facilities 
</p>
<p>may be so extreme that the authorities are unable to ensure the protection of detainees in 
</p>
<p>case of such emergencies as floods and fire,54 which in turn may infringe upon their right to 
</p>
<p>life.55

<p>15. Overcrowding has been established to constitute a severe form of ill-treatment,56

<p>inhuman or degrading treatment57 and even torture.58 Poor material conditions are 
</p>
<p>exacerbated by overcrowding and adversely affect all individuals living or working in

</p>
<p>16. Both international and regional human rights mechanisms have established breaches

<p>of the prohibition of torture due to overcrowding, as detainees are forced to live for

<p>prolonged periods in deplorable material conditions,60 unsuitable for a humane and

</b></p>
<p>17. States must respect the right to health and ensure equal access for all persons, 
</p>
<p>including prisoners or detainees, to preventive, curative and palliative health services.64 The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
</p>
<p>standard of physical and mental health has specifically noted the link between 
</p>
<p>overincarceration,65 overcrowding and infringements upon the right to health,66 especially in 
</p>
<p>relation to the spread of infectious and communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis67 and 
</p>
<p>hepatitis C.68 This poses risks not only to the health of other detainees, but also to the staff 
</p>
<p>and even the general population once prisoners are being released.69 
</p>
<p>18. Other United Nations and regional human rights bodies have also reported the 
</p>
<p>negative impact of overcrowding upon the right to health of detainees through denial of,70

<p>or inadequate access to, medical treatment,71 insufficient mental health services,72 lack of 
</p>
<p>health-care professionals in places of detention,73 failure to implement effective harm-
</p>
<p>reduction programmes and drug-dependence treatment.74 Overcrowding has also been 
</p>
<p>found to be a root cause of entirely preventable medical conditions.75  
</p>
<p>19. There are also various factors associated with overcrowding that contribute to the 
</p>
<p>denial of the right to health, such as poor natural light and ventilation in places of 
</p>
<p>detention,76 extreme temperatures,77 poor hygiene and sanitation standards,78 insufficient 
</p>
<p>provision for personal hygiene,79 and infestation with insects and vermin.80 Ultimately, 
</p>
<p>infringements on the right to health may adversely impact on the right to life of detainees.81 
</p>
<p><b> D. Right to food, water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation 
</p>
<p>emphasized that the lack of access to sanitation can be tantamount to inhuman or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment in certain circumstances, especially in the context of detention. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur noted that overcrowding in places of detention can seriously hinder the ability 
</p>
<p>of the authorities to ensure safe drinking water and proper sanitation.82  
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food has highlighted the frequent 
</p>
<p>infringements upon the right to adequate food of detainees83 and emphasized State 
</p>
<p>responsibility to provide those in detention with adequate food.84 The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>has also underlined the negative impact of overcrowding on the right to food.85 
</p>
<p>22. Numerous other United Nations and regional human rights bodies have also reported 
</p>
<p>serious infringements upon detainees&#8217; right to safe water and sanitation, as well as the right 
</p>
<p>to food. These infringements, attributed to overcrowding, include failure of the State to 
</p>
<p>provide adequate quality and quantity of food;86 adequate washing87 and toilet facilities;88

<p>safe drinking water89 and sanitation,90 including access to such basic hygiene products such 
</p>
<p>as soap and toilet paper free of charge,91 and adequate sleeping arrangements, including a 
</p>
<p>clean mattress and bedding.92  
</p>
<p>23. Failure to ensure proper implementation of these rights has led to violations of other 
</p>
<p>rights, including the right to safety and security, as inadequate food provision has led to 
</p>
<p>tensions in places of detention and even violence,93 as well as freedom from cruel, inhuman 
</p>
<p>or degrading treatment.94 Clean water supply, effective sewage and waste disposal, hygienic 
</p>
<p>food preparation and general hygiene practices are all essential to a clean and healthy 
</p>
<p>prison environment and to preventing and controlling the spread of disease,95 and their 
</p>
<p>absence can also negatively affect the right to health96 and even the right to life.97 
</p>
<p><b> E. Right to education and rehabilitation 
</b></p>
<p>24. Underlining that detainees constitute a highly marginalized group facing endemic 
</p>
<p>violations of their right to education, the Special Rapporteur on the right to education has 
</p>
<p>emphasized the negative impact of overcrowding on the exercise of this right. 
</p>
<p>Overcrowding puts significant strain on the available resources as demand exceeds the staff 
</p>
<p>and facilities available.98 It is common that people in places of detention are locked in 
</p>
<p>overcrowded cells for 23 hours a day without any purposeful out-of-cell activity99 and no 
</p>
<p>rehabilitation programmes,100 without possibilities to continue their education101 or take part 
</p>
<p>in skills development and vocational programmes.102

<p>25. Bearing in mind the importance of rehabilitation as an overarching aim of 
</p>
<p>imprisonment, the adverse impact of overcrowding on the availability of rehabilitation 
</p>
<p>services is of particular concern.103  
</p>
<p><b> F. Freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief has emphasized that all 
</p>
<p>persons deprived of their liberty have the right to freedom of religion or belief.104 
</p>
<p>Overcrowding has an adverse effect on all aspects of detention, which in turn negatively 
</p>
<p>impacts detainees&#8217; freedom of religion or belief. Often there is insufficient space for 
</p>
<p>religious practices,105 the possibility to observe religious rituals on certain days is 
</p>
<p>hindered,106 religious scripts are unavailable107 and there are reportedly problems with 
</p>
<p>regard to the type of meals suitable for members of different faiths.108  
</p>
<p><b> G. Right to privacy, family life and rights of family members 
</b></p>
<p>27. Overincarceration and overcrowding mean that those in detention live in very 
</p>
<p>crammed surroundings, thereby leading to a serious infringement of their right to privacy.109 
</p>
<p>The independent expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti has reported that the 
</p>
<p>severity of overcrowding in detention facilities is such that each detainee has no more than 
</p>
<p>40cm
2 
</p>
<p>of
 
living space.110 The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment or punishment reported situations in which inmates have to lie head to 
</p>
<p>toe in a foetal position, sleep in shifts or sitting up, owing to the lack of space as a result of 
</p>
<p>overcrowding.111 Many detainees also lack privacy even for such basic functions as using 
</p>
<p>toilet facilities.112  
</p>
<p>28. Overcrowding may lead to restrictions upon the right to maintain contacts with 
</p>
<p>relatives because facilities usually allocated for family visits may be reallocated for other 
</p>
<p>purposes owing to overcrowding. Moreover, some countries resort to so-called &#8220;balancing&#8221; 
</p>
<p>programmes whereby detainees are reallocated to different places of detention in order to 
</p>
<p>alleviate problems of overcrowding. This results in detainees being moved far away from 
</p>
<p>their families, adversely impacting their visit entitlements.113 This infringes not only upon 
</p>
<p>detainees&#8217; human rights but also on those of their family members. It may also have 
</p>
<p>negative impact upon the fair trial rights as detainees are moved far from the courts and 
</p>
<p>legal services.

<p>29. Furthermore, overincarceration may negatively affect family members who lose the 
</p>
<p>main breadwinner, thereby adversely impacting on the best interests of the affected child or 
</p>
<p>children.114  
</p>
<p><b> H. Right to equality and non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>30. The effects of overincarceration and overcrowding in places of detention are 
</p>
<p>especially negative for members of groups such as women,115 children,116 persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities,117 racial minorities118 and indigenous peoples,119 and non-citizens. Owing to 
</p>
<p>overstretched resources, the specific needs of persons belonging to these groups cannot be 
</p>
<p>addressed. Failure to separate pretrial detainees from others,120 adults from children121 and 
</p>
<p>men from women122 has been alleged to lead to exploitation and sexual violence.123 The 
</p>
<p>specific needs of women and girls in relation to their right to health are disregarded,124 in 
</p>
<p>particular in the case of pregnant women, girls and nursing mothers.125 There are reports of 
</p>
<p>young children being detained with their mothers126 and failure to respect the special needs 
</p>
<p>of children in detention.127 Places of detention are reported to have insufficient number of 
</p>
<p>female128 or minority129 staff, which impacts adversely upon women130 and members of 
</p>
<p>minorities in detention. Furthermore, persons with disabilities are held in environments that 
</p>
<p>include areas inaccessible to them131 and often prisoners with mental illnesses are not 
</p>
<p>separated from others.132 
</p>
<p>31. Overcrowding and the associated failure to address the needs of the members of 
</p>
<p>these groups in detention has made them particularly vulnerable to violence,133 and can lead

</p>
<p>security of their family members, who may become victims of extortion.135 Furthermore, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment has noted that, in severely overcrowded prisons, meaningful activities such as 
</p>
<p>work, education and recreation are only made available to &#8220;a few privileged prisoners who 
</p>
<p>&#8216;cooperate&#8217; and/or pay the necessary corruption fees&#8221;.136 
</p>
<p><b> III. The main causes of overincarceration and overcrowding 
</b></p>
<p>32. The main causes of overincarceration and overcrowding include deficiencies within 
</p>
<p>the criminal justice system; excessive recourse to pretrial detention; absence and/or 
</p>
<p>improper administration of alternatives to detention; specific sentencing policies; and lack 
</p>
<p>of oversight over the places of detention. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Deficiencies within the criminal justice system 
</b></p>
<p>33. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture noted that it had encountered 
</p>
<p>high incarceration rates and resultant severe prison overcrowding and argued that &#8220;the fact 
</p>
<p>that a State locks up so many of its citizens cannot be convincingly explained away by a 
</p>
<p>high crime rate; rather, the general outlook of members of the law enforcement agencies 
</p>
<p>and the judiciary must, in part, be responsible&#8221;.137 An effective criminal justice system138 
</p>
<p>with all actors &#8212; including the police, prosecution, defence lawyers and the judiciary &#8212; 
</p>
<p>working efficiently and according to the rule of law and requirements under international 
</p>
<p>human rights law is essential to ensure that the cases of persons who come in contact with 
</p>
<p>this system are dealt with efficiently and in accordance with the law. In reality, however, 
</p>
<p>criminal justice systems around the world encounter major challenges and shortcomings. 
</p>
<p>34. The so-called &#8220;zero tolerance polices&#8221; adopted in many States have led to a high 
</p>
<p>increase in the number of arrests,139 even for minor offences such as drunkenness, crossing 
</p>
<p>the railway, or shoplifting,140 and to people being held in custody for long periods.141 
</p>
<p>Moreover, some practices, such as police being rewarded for making arrests,142 and 
</p>
<p>overbroad legislation, rules and regulations143 have reportedly led to arbitrary arrests. In 
</p>
<p>turn, this situation has contributed significantly to overincarceration and overcrowding.
 
 
</p>
<p>35. Following arrest, the efficiency with which authorities are able to deal with the case 
</p>
<p>of each detainee is crucial to reducing overcrowding and overincarceration. Pretrial

<p>detention is often prolonged owing to inadequate police investigations, lost case files and a 
</p>
<p>shortage of judges. In many States, there are huge backlogs of cases, especially involving 
</p>
<p>pretrial detention, and an urgent need to increase judicial capacity to deal with these.144 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, owing to lack of resources and trained officers, alternative measures and 
</p>
<p>parole systems are not implemented.145 The efficiency of the criminal justice system is also 
</p>
<p>negatively impacted by inappropriate communication systems between prosecutors, public 
</p>
<p>defenders and judges.146 These deficiencies within the criminal justice system also mean 
</p>
<p>that the status of those in detention is not reviewed at regular intervals.147 Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>many States lack comprehensive and well-resourced legal aid programmes.  
</p>
<p>36. Moreover, many individuals remain in detention owing to the absence of centralized 
</p>
<p>registers and the lack of an effective system to monitor the length of pretrial detention or 
</p>
<p>progress in the implementation of sentencing.148 In the absence of such registers, and with 
</p>
<p>poor communication between criminal justice actors,149 authorities simply lack accurate 
</p>
<p>knowledge about who is due to be released. This not only prolongs pretrial detention but 
</p>
<p>also keeps those who have already completed their sentence in custody, thereby 
</p>
<p>contributing to overcrowding.150 
</p>
<p><b> B. Excessive recourse to pretrial detention 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture has stated that the excessive use and 
</p>
<p>length of pretrial detention is a major cause of overcrowding,151 and that the overuse and 
</p>
<p>misuse of pretrial detention needs to be tackled as a matter of priority.152 Other 
</p>
<p>international153 and regional154 bodies have also reported an excessive recourse to pretrial 
</p>
<p>detention, a measure that should only be a last resort and subject to certain conditions,155 
</p>
<p>but that in practice is often applied even to such minor cases as theft of a mobile 
</p>
<p>telephone,156 a pen or a chicken.157 In some countries, pretrial detainees reportedly

<p>constitute the majority of the prison population,158 and over 90 per cent of detainees in some 
</p>
<p>settings.159  
</p>
<p><b> C. Absence and/or improper administration of alternatives to detention 
</b></p>
<p>38. According to the Special Rapporteur on Prisons and Conditions of Detention of the 
</p>
<p>African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the &#8220;increase in prison population 
</p>
<p>cannot alone be attributed to higher rates in crime. Simply put, in most jurisdictions, there 
</p>
<p>is the belief that prison is preferable to any alternative; thus, the punitive element that 
</p>
<p>characterizes this sanction remains the cornerstone of modern day correctional and penal 
</p>
<p>systems. In spite of the proven efficiency and effectiveness of non-custodial alternatives, 
</p>
<p>harsher penalties in the form of longer prison sentences continue to be imposed&#8221;.160  
</p>
<p>39. This view is shared by other international161 and regional162 bodies who point to the 
</p>
<p>absence of alternatives to detention or shortcomings in their implementation as a significant 
</p>
<p>contributor to overincarceration and overcrowding. Further contributing factors are the 
</p>
<p>unavailability, dysfunctionality or excessively onerous conditions of bail;163 the 
</p>
<p>ineffectiveness of the probation service and little recourse to parole;164 the absence of or a 
</p>
<p>poorly functioning system of alternatives to detention, including community service,165 
</p>
<p>electronic supervision and house arrest;166 and the reluctance of prosecutorial and judicial 
</p>
<p>authorities to employ non-custodial sentences,167 or the lack of their availability to the 
</p>
<p>judiciary, especially in less serious cases, and lack of encouragement to use those 
</p>
<p>options.168  
</p>
<p><b> D. Sentencing policies 
</b></p>
<p>40. The policies that a State puts in place in response to crime have direct implications 
</p>
<p>for the number of detainees and the length of time that they spend in detention. So-called 
</p>
<p>&#8220;zero tolerance policies&#8221; have increased the number of criminal convictions with custodial 
</p>
<p>sentences and &#8212; coupled with the low acquittal rate and common use of detention &#8212; have 
</p>
<p>led to overcrowding in prisons.169  
</p>
<p>41. As stated by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, &#8220;[m]any countries have 
</p>
<p>seen an increasingly rapid rate of legislative response to criminal acts, and are now

<p>beginning to experience the combined effects of habitual offender laws, generally increased 
</p>
<p>minimum sentences with less discretion available to judges in each individual case, and 
</p>
<p>post-conviction preventive detention&#8221;,170 which leads to overincarceration and 
</p>
<p>overcrowding.  
</p>
<p>42. The following phenomena have been reported as factors contributing to 
</p>
<p>overincarceration and overcrowding: the failure to include time served on custodial remand 
</p>
<p>in sentence calculation;171 the application of mandatory sentences especially for minor, non-
</p>
<p>violent crimes172 and severe penalties for drug-related offences;173 the imposition of 
</p>
<p>excessively lengthy prison sentences, especially life sentences,174 contrary to the principle 
</p>
<p>of proportionality;175 the absence of reasonable sentencing guidelines that would permit the 
</p>
<p>reduction of excessively lengthy sentences;176 the lack of discretion for judges when 
</p>
<p>sentencing, which prevents them from taking into consideration the individual 
</p>
<p>circumstances of the detainee and the case;177 a great limitation to the remission of 
</p>
<p>sentences;178 and ambiguities in the legislation that lead to unnecessary detention.179 
</p>
<p><b> E. Lack of oversight of places of detention 
</b></p>
<p>43. Lack of oversight of places of detention is also a factor contributing to 
</p>
<p>overincarceration and overcrowding. There are reports of improper record keeping in places 
</p>
<p>of detention even to the extent that authorities do not know the exact number of detainees 
</p>
<p>held at any given time or their status,180 and are unaware of their living conditions. At 
</p>
<p>times, beds are so close together that, at full capacity or even at somewhat below capacity, 
</p>
<p>living conditions would still be extremely precarious.181 Owing to infrequent or absent 
</p>
<p>visits to places of detention, prosecutors and/or the judiciary182 lack proper understanding of 
</p>
<p>the levels of overcrowding and consequences of overincarceration. They are therefore 
</p>
<p>unable to take this factor into consideration when making decisions regarding detention, 
</p>
<p>sentencing or release.

<p><b> IV. Addressing overincarceration and overcrowding and their 
human rights implications 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Need for a proactive and holistic approach 
</b></p>
<p>44. Overincarceration and overcrowding cannot be tackled overnight, and the 
</p>
<p>complexity of these phenomena requires a combination of legislative, administrative, 
</p>
<p>political and economic measures, including a comprehensive policy and an action plan to 
</p>
<p>implement it. This view is shared by national institutions,183 regional mechanisms184 and 
</p>
<p>international bodies.185 Both regional and international bodies have pointed out that, while 
</p>
<p>measures such as the construction of new and the renovation of existing detention facilities 
</p>
<p>may provide an immediate, short-term relief to the overcrowding problem, they have not 
</p>
<p>been found to constitute an effective and lasting solution.186  
</p>
<p>45. As stated by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, the only viable 
</p>
<p>way to control overcrowding is to adopt policies designed to limit or moderate the number 
</p>
<p>of persons sent to prison.187 In order to achieve this, the Committee argues in favour of a 
</p>
<p>more concerted, holistic and proactive approach, based on wide-ranging discussions 
</p>
<p>involving all relevant parties, including parliamentarians, prosecutors, judges and 
</p>
<p>representatives of monitoring bodies.188  
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to challenge detention, assistance by legal counsel and access  
</b></p>
<p><b>to legal aid 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, in its Draft Basic Principles and 
</p>
<p>Guidelines on remedies and procedures on the right of anyone deprived of their liberty to 
</p>
<p>bring proceedings before a court, has stated that the right to challenge detention is a judicial 
</p>
<p>remedy designed to protect personal freedom and physical integrity and that it is a non-
</p>
<p>derogable right.189  
</p>
<p>47. The right to challenge detention is an important tool for addressing the problem of 
</p>
<p>overcrowding given accounts of individuals being detained illegally, or when the pretrial 
</p>
<p>detention limits are not respected or indeed prisoners are not promptly released after 
</p>
<p>serving their sentence.190 In order to make this right effective, every detainee must be able 
</p>
<p>to take proceedings before an independent court, without substantial delay,191 and to appear 
</p>
<p>before the court in person. Furthermore, the burden of establishing the legal basis, as well

<p>as the reasonableness, necessity and proportionality of detention, lies with the authorities 
</p>
<p>responsible for the detention.192  
</p>
<p>48. Moreover, the Draft Basic Principles and Guidelines on remedies and procedures on 
</p>
<p>the right of anyone deprived of their liberty to bring proceedings before a court provide that 
</p>
<p>anyone deprived of their liberty shall, at any time during their detention, have the right to 
</p>
<p>legal assistance by counsel of choice and access to legal aid.193 While lawyers are the first 
</p>
<p>providers of legal aid, the United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid 
</p>
<p>in Criminal Justice Systems also suggest that States involve a wide range of stakeholders as 
</p>
<p>legal aid service providers, including non-governmental organizations, community-based 
</p>
<p>organizations, religious and non-religious charitable organizations, professional bodies and 
</p>

<p><b> C. Appropriate use of places of detention 
</b></p>
<p>49. The specific purpose for which detention places, including prisons and police 
</p>
<p>stations, are built or established195 needs to be taken into account when persons are 
</p>
<p>detained. Facilities such as police stations must be used exclusively for short detention as 
</p>
<p>these are not suited to extended custody and lack the necessary space, sanitation and other 
</p>
<p>facilities required to ensure adequate conditions of detention.196 The capacity of places of 
</p>
<p>detention must be assessed realistically and any such assessment must be based on 
</p>
<p>allocation of reasonable space for each detainee.197 Ensuring an effective register system for 
</p>
<p>tracking the detention period of each pretrial and sentenced detainee is essential to allow 
</p>
<p>detention places to manage their capacities.198 Finally, all detention places should be staffed 
</p>
<p>adequately so that they can be run effectively and with due respect to the human rights of 
</p>
<p>those detained. 
</p>
<p>50. Equally, the negative impact of overcrowding is exacerbated for individuals held in 
</p>
<p>detention places that are not suitable for their specific needs, such as children, women, 
</p>
<p>elderly persons, persons with disabilities and mentally ill.199 Furthermore, persons who are 
</p>
<p>remanded in custody or sentenced should not continue to be detained in police stations, 
</p>
<p>unlike the practice in some States due to the overcrowding in many prisons.200  
</p>
<p>51. In addition, administrators of places of detention should not be left to cope with the 
</p>
<p>phenomenon of overcrowding201 and there should be an effective communications system 
</p>
<p>between the various actors of the criminal justice system to ensure that detention places are

<p>not expected to hold people beyond their capacities. Practices such as a legal prohibition on 
</p>
<p>overcrowding202 should be considered favourably. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Pretrial detention as a last resort 
</b></p>
<p>52. Since excessive recourse to pretrial detention is one of the major causes of 
</p>
<p>overincarceration and overcrowding around the world,203 strict adherence to relevant 
</p>
<p>international norms and standards will go a long way in addressing these phenomena. 
</p>
<p>Pretrial detention should only be a measure of last resort.204  
</p>
<p>53. Furthermore, as stressed by the Human Rights Committee in its general comment 
</p>
<p>No. 35, &#8220;[d]etention pending trial must be based on an individualized determination that it 
</p>
<p>is reasonable and necessary taking into account all the circumstances, for such purposes as 
</p>
<p>to prevent flight, interference with evidence or the recurrence of crime&#8221;.205 This means that 
</p>
<p>pretrial detention should not be mandatory without regard to individual circumstances,206 a 
</p>
<p>practice common in some States,207 and that alternatives to pretrial detention must be duly 
</p>
<p>considered also when deciding upon continued pretrial detention. The time limits imposed 
</p>
<p>for pretrial detention must be strictly observed.208 Moreover, if the length of time that the 
</p>
<p>defendant has been detained for reaches the length of the longest sentence that could be 
</p>
<p>imposed for the crimes charged, the defendant should be released.209 
</p>
<p><b> E. Alternatives to custodial measures  
</b></p>
<p>54. Against the background of international standards on non-custodial measures,210 one 
</p>
<p>of the key recommendations of international,211 regional212 and national bodies213 regarding 
</p>
<p>the reduction of overincarceration and overcrowding rates is to develop a policy to increase 
</p>
<p>resort to non-custodial measures and to alternatives to custodial sentences. As stated by the 
</p>
<p>European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, &#8220;a strategy for the sustainable reduction 
</p>
<p>of the prison population should be put in place, which ensures that imprisonment is in

<p>practice the measure of last resort at all stages of the criminal justice system, from pretrial 
</p>
<p>to the execution of sentences&#8221;.214  
</p>
<p>55. In order to render alternatives to detention effective, there must be a variety of 
</p>
<p>measures available at pretrial and conviction stage, such as affordable bail,215 automatic bail 
</p>
<p>for most offences,216 monetary fines, electronically monitored house arrest,217 community 
</p>
<p>service, juvenile punishment and supervision of paroles218 as well as remission or 
</p>
<p>commutation of sentences and parole or pardon system.219 Eligibility criteria for all these 
</p>
<p>alternative measures should be reviewed so as to widen their scope of application.220 In 
</p>
<p>particular, it is crucial that alternatives to custodial measures are duly considered for such 
</p>
<p>groups as women, elderly, children and people with disabilities.221  
</p>
<p>56. However, alternatives to detention should not only be provided for in legislation, but 
</p>
<p>also implemented in practice.222 In order to ensure that there is support from the 
</p>
<p>prosecutorial services, the judiciary and the public, it is essential that the system of 
</p>
<p>alternatives to detention is run efficiently223 and is adequately resourced.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Proportionate sentencing 
</b></p>
<p>57. Proportionate sentencing is an essential requirement of an effective and fair criminal 
</p>
<p>justice system. This requires that custodial sentences are imposed as measures of last resort 
</p>
<p>and applied proportionately to meet a pressing societal need.224  
</p>
<p>58. In order to meet the requirement of proportionality, States have been revising their 
</p>
<p>penal policies and legislation in order to reduce minimum and maximum penalties,225 
</p>
<p>decriminalize numerous categories of petty crimes and reduce criminal sanctions for 
</p>
<p>economic offences,226 thus contributing to reducing the total prison population.227 Equally, 
</p>
<p>reviewing sentencing policies to reduce or eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for 
</p>
<p>lesser, non-violent offences and to provide more reasonable sentencing guidelines in order 
</p>
<p>to reduce excessively lengthy sentences also has had a positive effect upon the reduction of 
</p>
<p>overincarceration and overcrowding.228 Appropriate action, including training, should be 
</p>
<p>taken vis-&#224;-vis the prosecutorial and judicial authorities with a view to eliminating 
</p>
<p>unnecessary recourse to pretrial custody and modifying the sentencing practices.229 Special

<p>attention should be paid to the reduction of life sentences and ensuring a genuine possibility 
</p>
<p>of parole for all detainees, including those serving life sentences.230 
</p>
<p><b> G. Rehabilitation and reduction of reoffending rates 
</b></p>
<p>59. Providing effective rehabilitation services while in custody and following release as 
</p>
<p>well as addressing reoffending are important factors in reducing overcrowding.231 Targeted 
</p>
<p>crime-prevention programmes aimed at specific groups must be considered.232 
</p>
<p>60. Addressing reoffending rates is a complex task requiring a policy of reintegration 
</p>
<p>into society of former detainees233 and involvement from families234 as well as the 
</p>
<p>community concerned,235 so as to ensure effective reintegration. Further measures, such as 
</p>
<p>drug rehabilitation programmes in order to reduce the risk of reoffending, should be 
</p>
<p>considered favourably.236 
</p>
<p><b> H. Oversight and complaints mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>61. Regular monitoring of places of detention is an important factor in addressing the 
</p>
<p>issues of overincarceration and overcrowding, as it increases transparency and efficiency of 
</p>
<p>the prison system237 and makes it possible to detect and combat the phenomena.238 
</p>
<p>Moreover, it is important that monitoring be carried out by a variety of relevant bodies and 
</p>
<p>institutions.  
</p>
<p>62. Oversight by the prosecutors and judiciary is important so that they are cognizant of 
</p>
<p>the prevalent conditions when taking decisions about detention.239 It is also hoped that the 
</p>
<p>draft Basic Principles and Guidelines on remedies and procedures on the right of anyone 
</p>
<p>deprived of their liberty to bring proceedings before a court will help to establish effective 
</p>
<p>mechanisms to ensure judicial oversight over all situations of deprivation of liberty.240 
</p>
<p>Inspections carried out by various professional bodies to ensure observance of such 
</p>
<p>standards as health and safety, building standards, hygiene and sanitation are paramount.241

<p>human rights institutions and civil society contributes to monitoring the overcrowding and 
</p>
<p>assisting authorities with its reduction.242 
</p>
<p>63. The existence and proper functioning of independent complaints mechanisms fully 
</p>
<p>accessible to detainees is also extremely important in order to alleviate overcrowding, 
</p>
<p>overincarceration and their negative effects.243  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>When resorting to deprivation of liberty, States infringe upon one of the core 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights: the liberty of person. In order to justify such interference, States 
</b></p>
<p><b>should apply deprivation of liberty as a measure of last resort and only after 
</b></p>
<p><b>alternatives have been duly considered.  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>However, when deprivation of liberty is absolutely necessary, the State bears 
</b></p>
<p><b>special responsibility towards those it detains. This entails an obligation to treat all 
</b></p>
<p><b>prisoners with respect due to their inherent dignity and value as human beings, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>very first requirement of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Treatment of Prisoners (Mandela Rules).</b>244<b>  
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The overuse of detention overstretches the often scarce prison resources, puts 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention staff in extremely difficult, even dangerous conditions, and has serious 
</b></p>
<p><b>implications on the human rights of persons deprived of their liberty. Moreover, 
</b></p>
<p><b>overincarceration also constitutes one of the major underlying causes of 
</b></p>
<p><b>overcrowding, which results in conditions that can amount to ill-treatment or even 
</b></p>
<p><b>torture.</b>245<b>  
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>In order to address overincarceration and overcrowding and their human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights implications, several recommendations are made in section IV of the present 
</b></p>
<p><b>document, including to adopt a proactive and holistic approach; ensure respect for 
</b></p>
<p><b>d</b>etainees&#8217; <b>right to challenge detention, to be provided with assistance by legal counsel 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to have access to legal aid; use places of detention only for the purpose for which 
</b></p>
<p><b>they are fit; use pretrial detention only as a last resort; develop and implement 
</b></p>
<p><b>alternatives to custodial measures during pretrial and post-conviction; review penal 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies and legislation to ensure proportionate sentencing; provide effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>rehabilitation services to contribute to reducing reoffending rates; and ensure the 
</b></p>
<p><b>existence and proper functioning of independent oversight and complaints 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Since deprivation of liberty by its very nature increases social disadvantage and 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerability to human rights violations, steps taken by States to fulfil and protect the 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights of those it detains are of immense significance.</b>246<b> Proactive steps to address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>phenomena of overincarceration and overcrowding in places of detention not only 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that States comply with their international obligations, but also guarantee 
</b></p>
<p><b>detainees the dignity inherent to every human being. </b>
