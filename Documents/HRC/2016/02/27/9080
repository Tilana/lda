<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 7/9 entitled 
&#8220;Human rights of persons with disabilities&#8221;. In this resolution, the Human Rights Council 
decided to hold on an annual basis an interactive debate on the rights of persons with disabilities. 
The Council further decided to hold its first such debate in the course of its tenth session, 
focusing on &#8220;key legal measures for ratification and effective implementation of the Convention, 
including with regard to equality and non-discrimination&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2. To support this debate, the Council requested the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) &#8220;&#8230; to prepare a thematic study to enhance awareness and 
understanding of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, focusing on legal 
measures key for the ratification and effective implementation of the Convention, such as those 
relating to equality and non-discrimination, in consultation with States, civil society 
organizations, including organizations of persons with disabilities, and national human rights 
institutions &#8230;&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>3. In conducting the thematic study, OHCHR has sought written submissions from various 
stakeholders, including States, intergovernmental organizations, national human rights 
institutions and non-governmental organizations, including organizations of persons with 
disabilities. OHCHR also organized a one-day open-ended consultation on the theme of the 
study on 24 October 2008 in Geneva and participated in relevant expert and other meetings. The 
findings and recommendations that emerged from the consultation process have informed the 
content of the study.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  LEGAL MEASURES FOR RATIFICATION 
</b></p>
<p>4. As of the date of the submission of this report, 46 States are parties to the Convention 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and 27 are parties to its Optional Protocol, while 138 
and 81 countries respectively are signatories to the two instruments.<b>2</b> The Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities is the first human rights treaty that contemplates the 
possibility of regional integration organizations, in addition to States, becoming parties to the 
Convention, and article 44 regulates such attribution. The European Community is a signatory to 
the Convention.

<p>

</p>
<p>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) at: 
http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/disability/HRCResolution79.htm. 
<b>2
</b>  Information on the status of the Convention and its Optional Protocol is available at: 
</p>
<p>http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/ratification/15.htm. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>5. Not only was this Convention negotiated in a shorter time than any other human rights 
convention in the history of international law, it has also attracted swift ratification by States, 
second only to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>6. Ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and of its 
Optional Protocol requires States to undertake steps both at the international and national level. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  International measures for ratification 
</b></p>
<p>7. At the international level, a State that intends to become a party to the Convention and its 
Optional Protocol must express its consent to be bound by the treaty in one of the forms 
prescribed by the Convention. Article 43 establishes that consent to be bound can be expressed 
through the methods of ratification, accession or confirmation. 
</p>
<p>8. Ratification consists of the deposit of the instrument of ratification<b>4</b> nationally executed by 
the State with the Secretary-General of the United Nations as the depositary of the Convention in 
accordance with article 41. Expression of consent to be bound through ratification is a two-step 
process, as it requires signature of the Convention by the State prior to the deposit of the 
instrument of ratification. While the act of signature does not make a State party to the treaty, it 
requires the signatory State to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the 
treaty.<b>5</b> With the deposit of the act of ratification, on the other hand, the &#8220;State establishes on the 
international plane its consent to be bound by the Convention&#8221;.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>9. Accession consists of the deposit of an instrument of accession with the depositary and has 
the same legal effect as ratification; unlike ratification, however, it does not require to be 
preceded by signature. &#8220;Confirmation&#8221; is used as an equivalent for the term &#8220;ratification&#8221; when 
an international organization expresses its consent to be bound to a treaty.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>10. A State can decide to ratify both the Convention and its Optional Protocol or the 
Convention only. Such intention needs to be reflected in the instrument executed and deposited 
by the State. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  The Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted by the General Assembly 
</p>
<p>on 20 November 1989 and entered into force on 2 September 1990, after the deposit of 
its 20th ratification. 
<b>4
</b>  &#8220;Instrument&#8221; means a document signed by the Head of State, Head of Government or Minister 
</p>
<p>of Foreign Affairs which unambiguously conveys the intent of the Government on behalf of the 
State to consider itself bound by the Convention (and its Optional Protocol if it is the case).

 <p> 
</p>
<p>11. Ratification at the international level should not be confused with ratification at the 
national level, which a State might be required to undertake in accordance with its own 
constitutional provisions and practice before it expresses consent to be bound internationally. 
Ratification at the national level is inadequate to establish the intention of a State to be legally 
bound at the international level and the required actions at the international level shall also be 
undertaken to this purpose.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>12. Once the State or other entity with treaty-making capacity has expressed its consent to be 
bound by the Convention by an act of ratification, accession or confirmation, and where that 
treaty has entered into force for that particular State (in the case of the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities, on the thirtieth day after the deposit of the instrument),<b>9</b> the State or 
entity becomes a party to the Convention.<b>10</b> At this stage the State or entity is bound by the 
provisions of the treaty under international law. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  National measures for ratification 
</b></p>
<p>13. Constitutional law and practice regulate the various aspects of the process that take place at 
national level prior to ratification or accession at the international level. Notwithstanding the 
specificities of individual countries, two approaches can be identified for national ratification, 
which are defined by the role played by the legislative branch of government. 
</p>
<p>14. In civil law countries, ratification takes place through the approval of the treaty by the 
legislative branch. After the vote of approval, the ratification act is sent to the executive for its 
promulgation, publication and deposit with the depositary of the treaty. Numerous States parties 
to the Convention that submitted contributions for this study such as Argentina, Chile, Croatia, 
Ecuador, Hungary, Mali, Niger, Panama and Spain, for example, ratified the Convention through 
a law of parliament; Mexico ratified it through approval by one of its legislative chambers. In 
most countries with a common law tradition, on the other hand, as well as in other legal systems, 
ratification of the Convention took place through an act of the executive and where parliament 
was involved in the process, it was in a consultative capacity. Executive decisions have been 
adopted in Bangladesh, New Zealand and Thailand, for example, to ratify the Convention. 
</p>
<p>15. Regardless of the differences between the two approaches, and of the specificities of 
national systems, domestic processes for ratification offer important opportunities for 
awareness-raising and promoting understanding of the treaty under consideration. 
</p>
<p>16. In the first instance, States considering ratification should review national legislation and 
policies for compliance with the Convention. Several of the submissions for this study make 
reference to such a process being undertaken prior to ratification, the scope and depth of which

 <p> 
</p>
<p>appear significantly diverse.<b>11</b> Of interest is the practice in certain States of conducting national 
interest analyses,<b>12</b> which highlight issues such as the reasons for becoming a party to a given 
treaty, the implications of becoming a party in terms of obligations and costs arising from the 
ratification of the Convention and the related implementation issues, with reference to both 
identification of legislation in place and analysis of such legislation in terms of compliance. The 
national interest analysis accompanies the proposal for ratification in its internal process. As the 
next chapter indicates, any pre-ratification review should be part of a process that continues in 
the implementation phase to review existing and proposed legislation. 
</p>
<p>17. Secondly, the experience of States parties that have engaged in adequate consultation prior 
to ratification appears to result in a positive impact on the implementation of the Convention. 
Adequate consultation should take place at the level of government departments and agencies, 
and State and territory level where applicable. Such consultation should enhance understanding 
of the Convention, contribute to ascertaining compliance of laws, policies and programmes with 
the Convention and identify areas for improvement. Non-governmental stakeholders and in 
particular civil society and organizations of persons with disabilities should also be integrated in 
such national consultations. Full and effective participation and inclusion in society of persons 
with disabilities is a general principle of the Convention,<b>13</b> which also specifically establishes the 
duty on States to closely consult and actively involve persons with disabilities in the 
development and implementation of policies that affect them.<b>14</b> Submissions for this study have 
highlighted the beneficial impact of officially translating and widely disseminating the 
Convention in national languages, to publicly launch the process of ratification, to make publicly 
available a plan that includes timelines and opportunities for consultation, and to invite civil 
society and organizations of persons with disabilities to make submissions presenting their views 
on the opportunities, implications and challenges of ratification. The need to support the 
participation of organizations of persons with disabilities in consultations, including with 
financial support, should also be carefully considered. The findings of the national interest 
analysis carried out by the government should eventually be made public. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Reservations and interpretative declarations 
</b></p>
<p>18. Some States that have ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
have sought to adjust the application of the treaty by means of interpretative declarations or 
reservations. Article 2, paragraph 1 (d), of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties defines 
a &#8220;reservation&#8221; as &#8220;a unilateral statement, however phrased or named, made by a State when 
signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  Such as for example in the submissions of Nepal, New Zealand, Niger, Romania and 
</p>
<p>Slovakia.

</b></p>
<p>  CRPD, art. 4 (3). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that State&#8221;. 
Article 46 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities allows parties to lodge 
reservations provided that such reservations are not &#8220;incompatible with the object and purpose of 
the present Convention&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>19. So far, El Salvador, Malta, Mauritius and Poland have entered reservations to the 
Convention and several States have lodged &#8220;declarations&#8221; to the Convention. It should be noted 
that the taxonomy chosen by States as to the qualification of their statements as &#8220;reservations&#8221; or 
&#8220;declarations&#8221; exerts no legal effect, and the nature of the exception is solely determined by its 
content in accordance with article 2 of the Vienna Convention. At the time of writing, only the 
reservation lodged by El Salvador had attracted a formal objection from the Government of 
Austria for its &#8220;general and vague wording&#8221;.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>20. States considering lodging reservations or declarations to the Convention should consider 
that the treaty-monitoring bodies have consistently expressed the view that reservations diminish 
the scope of protection afforded by treaties.<b>16</b> Accordingly, treaty bodies have consistently 
sought, through their respective mechanisms, to restrict the scope of existing reservations and 
encouraged their removal by States parties.<b>17</b> It is expected that the Committee on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities will also address reservations and declarations lodged by States parties 
to the Convention during the periodic review of State party reports established by article 35 of 
the Convention. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  LEGAL MEASURES FOR IMPLEMENTATION 
</b></p>
<p>21. By ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, States take an 
obligation under international law to implement it. Implementation is the process whereby States 
parties take action to ensure the realization of all rights contained in a given treaty within their 
jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  The incorporation of the Convention in the legal system of States parties 
</b></p>
<p>22. It should not be assumed that once the Convention has entered into force for a State, it has 
automatically become part of its national law. There exist two main approaches to the status of 
treaties within the domestic legal system, on the basis of which States are referred to as &#8220;monist&#8221; 
and &#8220;dualist&#8221; countries. These two approaches are defined by the prevalence of respectively 
monist or dualist theories on the relationship between international and national law.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>18
</b>  See A. Aust, <i>Modern Treaty Law and Practice</i> (Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp. 146 
</p>
<p>and 150. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>23. In some States parties to the Convention such as Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, 
Hungary, Mali, Niger, Qatar, Slovenia and Spain, for example, the provisions of the Convention 
have direct legal effect on the national legal framework and are in principle directly applicable 
including in courts of law. In such States, international agreements to which the State is a party 
become part of domestic law by effect of the ratification of the international agreement (monist 
approach). In so-called dualist legal systems, on the other hand, the international and national 
legal systems form part of two separate legal spheres. In such countries, international human 
rights treaties to which the State is a party have no force, as such, within the domestic legal 
system and domestic legislation must be adopted to incorporate the treaty into the domestic legal 
order. While some States parties have made amendments to existing legislation for compliance 
with the Convention, it appears that the steps taken so far fall short of giving direct effect to the 
full Convention in the domestic system.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>24. Human rights treaty bodies have often recommended incorporation of the treaty in the 
domestic legal order as a measure for realizing the full potential of the treaty. The Human Rights 
Committee, for example, while noting that the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights does not explicitly require States parties to incorporate the Covenant, also expressed the 
view &#8220;that Covenant guarantees may receive enhanced protection in those States where the 
Covenant is automatically or through specific incorporation part of the domestic legal order&#8221; and 
invited States parties to proceed to incorporation.<b>20</b> Similar views were expressed by the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: &#8220;legally binding international human rights 
standards should operate directly and immediately within the domestic legal system&#8221; and &#8220;while 
the Covenant does not formally oblige States to incorporate its provisions in domestic law, such 
an approach is desirable&#8221;.<b>21</b> The views expressed in these general comments are often reiterated 
during the discussion of the periodic reports of States parties and contained in concluding 
observations as recommendations.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The hierarchy of the Convention in the legal system of States parties 
</b></p>
<p>25. According to information provided, in States where the Convention is directly applicable, 
it has been assigned different levels within the domestic hierarchy of laws. Costa Rica, for 
example, recognizes the Convention in the supra-constitutional rank, with the effect that it takes 
precedence over the national constitution in the aspects in which it recognizes broader rights or 
protection. In Argentina, a bill was presented to Parliament for recognition of the Convention at 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>19
</b>  Full incorporation or transformation takes place by the adoption of an act to which the 
</p>
<p>Convention is attached as a schedule.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>constitutional level, similar to other human rights treaties. Moreover, in several States such as 
Croatia, Mali, Mexico and Niger, international human rights treaties to which the State is a party 
are regarded as standing above national laws. 
</p>
<p>26. Human rights treaty bodies have often addressed the issue of the place of international 
human rights treaties in the domestic legal hierarchy, demanding clarity as to the level of the 
treaty. Appreciation has been consistently expressed for States that have recognized human 
rights treaties as holding constitutional status. The Human Rights Committee explicitly noted 
that prevalence of international human rights treaties even above constitutional norms &#8220;flows 
directly from the principle contained in article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of 
Treaties, according to which a State Party &#8216;may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as 
justification for its failure to perform a treaty&#8217;&#8221;. The Committee noted that this principle 
&#8220;operates so as to prevent States parties from invoking provisions of the constitutional law or 
other aspects of domestic law to justify a failure to perform or give effect to obligations under 
the treaty&#8221;.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>27. Reservations lodged by States that do not recognize the predominance of the Convention in 
case of a conflict between the Convention and constitutional or national laws might present 
challenges from the perspective of compatibility with article 27 of the Vienna Convention. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  General legal obligations 
</b></p>
<p>28. Article 4 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities defines the scope of 
the general legal obligations undertaken by States parties. It requires States &#8220;to ensure and 
promote the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with 
disabilities without discrimination of any kind on the basis of disability&#8221; and provides the 
overarching framework within which the rights specified in the Convention are to be promoted 
and protected. States are required to &#8220;refrain from engaging in any act or practice that is 
inconsistent&#8221; with the Convention and to &#8220;adopt all appropriate legislative, administrative and 
other measures for the implementation of the rights recognized in the &#8230; Convention&#8221;. Treaty 
bodies monitoring other human rights treaties have indicated that appropriate measures for 
implementation of human rights obligations may include legislative, judicial, administrative, 
educational, financial and social measures.<b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>29. By requiring States to give effect to their obligations &#8220;by all appropriate measures&#8221;,<b>25</b> the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities adopts a broad and flexible approach to 
implementation that allows for the legal particularities of each State to be taken into account, 
including in particular the status of the treaty in the domestic legal order, as well as other 
</p>
<p>

<p>  CRPD, art. 4, para. 1 (a). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>relevant considerations. Notwithstanding such flexibility, the means through which the 
Convention is given effect must be appropriate in the sense of producing results that are 
consistent with the full discharge of the obligations of the State party. In all cases, in accordance 
with article 4, paragraph 3, States are required to closely consult and actively involve persons 
with disabilities through their organizations in the development and implementation of 
legislation and policies to implement the Convention. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Measures for implementation 
</b></p>
<p>30. It is a basic principle of international law that a State party to an international treaty must 
ensure that its own domestic law is consistent with what is required by the treaty.<b>26</b> It follows 
that, except in the rare cases in which the rights and principles of the Convention are already 
protected by domestic law, States parties are required upon ratification to make appropriate 
changes to domestic law to ensure its conformity with the Convention.<b>27</b> This duty applies also to 
States where the Convention is part of national law as &#8220;incorporation by itself does not avoid the 
need to ensure that all relevant domestic law, including any local or customary law, is brought 
into compliance with the Convention&#8221;<b>28</b> and also to States where the Convention enjoys 
constitutional status and above. Accordingly, article 4, paragraph 1 (b), of the Convention 
obliges States parties to &#8220;take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to modify or 
abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices that constitute discrimination against 
persons with disabilities&#8221;. In order to adequately implement the Convention, one of the first steps 
that States need to undertake is a comprehensive review of the national legislation and policy 
framework. Treaty bodies have often explicitly recommended that States parties undertake such 
a review<b>29</b> and that it be rigorous and &#8220;consider the Convention not only article by article, but 
also holistically, recognizing the interdependence and indivisibility of human rights&#8221;.<b>30</b> 
</p>
<p>31. According to information provided for this study, numerous States parties and signatories 
to the Convention have embarked on an internal review of legislation for compliance, the scope

<p>review has so far resulted in the adoption or amendment of legislation, it is essential to underline 
that given the scope of the Convention, this review needs to be comprehensive and extend to 
areas of the law that go beyond the traditional scope of disability-related legislation.<b>31</b> The good 
practice of some countries that have reviewed both criminal and civil laws including laws 
regulating accessibility, elections, immigration and citizenship, administration of justice, 
detention and prisons, insurance, education, employment, health, mental health and compulsory 
assessment and treatment, guardianship and legal personality, welfare and pensions regulations, 
for example, is noted.<b>32</b> The participation of civil society organizations and in particular of 
organizations of persons with disabilities in such a review is required by the Convention. In 
some cases, civil society organizations have specifically highlighted their concern at the lack of 
initiative of the State party in the area of legal reform. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  The content of legislative measures 
</b></p>
<p>32. The mandate entrusted to OHCHR by the Human Rights Council in resolution 7/9 focuses 
the scope of this study on legal measures such as those related to equality and non-discrimination 
for the purpose of enhancing &#8220;awareness and understanding of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>33. In all cases, it should be noted that the Convention sets out the obligations on States parties 
in relation to civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. While the Convention does not 
recognize any new human right of persons with disabilities, it clarifies the application of existing 
rights to the specific situation of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>34. The following sections treat selected provisions of the Convention in order to highlight 
legal measures that might be required in these areas for compliance with the Convention. As it is 
not possible to cover all articles comprehensively, they should be taken as illustrative examples 
of the reforms required by the Convention. The choice of provisions to address in the context of 
this study has been made on the basis of the contributions provided by States, national human 
rights institutions, civil society and organizations of persons with disabilities in the course of the 
consultations for this study. Where recommendations for legal reform are made, they should be 
read in the light of article 4, paragraph 4, of the Convention, which makes it clear that the 
Convention does not undermine or replace higher standards of protection that might be provided 
for in national legislation. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>31
</b>  By referring to the traditional scope of disability-related legislation, reference is made to 
</p>
<p>legislation based on a medical understanding of disability and primarily focusing on areas of 
health, prevention of disability, rehabilitation and social welfare.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Definition of disability 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Convention addresses the situation of those persons who experience barriers to 
participation in all areas of life, which are associated with an impairment, and who as a result 
cannot enjoy their fundamental human rights. By conceiving disability as a social phenomenon, 
the Convention encompasses persons with a diverse range of impairments (physical, sensory, 
mental and intellectual) and considers various types of barriers (legal, physical, attitudinal, and 
others) that persons with such impairments might face in the enjoyment of their human rights. At 
a minimum, the Convention clarifies that persons with disability shall include &#8220;persons who have 
long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various 
barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with 
others&#8221;.<b>33</b> 
</p>
<p>36. It is essential to the full and effective implementation of the Convention that definitions of 
disability in national legislation reflect an understanding of disability as a social phenomenon. 
This requires the repeal of medically-based definitions construed along types of impairments, or 
of definitions based on the notion of daily life activities, in which the incapacity to carry out such 
activities is linked to the impairment. Furthermore, national disability legislation must 
unequivocally protect all persons with disabilities, including persons with mental and intellectual 
disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Equality and non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>37. Equality and non-discrimination are the primary principles permeating the whole 
Convention. References to equality and non-discrimination are multiple and can be found in 
various parts of the Convention, including in the preamble,<b>34</b> purpose,<b>35</b> general principles<b>36</b> and 
general obligations<b>37</b> of States. Article 5 recognizes the right of all persons to equality before and 
under the law and the right to equal protection and benefit of the law without any discrimination. 
Article 5, paragraph 2, establishes the obligation on States parties to prohibit all discrimination 
on the basis of disability. In accordance with article 2 of the Convention, discrimination on the 
basis of disability means &#8220;any distinction, exclusion or restriction on the basis of disability which 
has the purpose or effect of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an 
equal basis with others, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, 
social, cultural, civil or any other field ... including denial of reasonable accommodation&#8221;. 
Reasonable accommodation is defined in article 2 of the Convention with reference to

<p>&#8220;necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate or 
undue burden&#8221; and is to be considered a measure promoting equality.<b>38 </b>The Convention also 
clarifies that specific measures that might be required to promote equality shall not be considered 
discriminatory. 
</p>
<p>38. The broad-spectrum clauses of article 5 must be read in conjunction with the specific 
non-discrimination and equality measures that are attached to the broad range of rights contained 
in the Convention, such as for example in matters of marriage, family, parenthood and 
relationships (art. 23), education (art. 24), health (art. 25), employment (art. 27), standard of 
living and social protection (art. 28) and participation in public and political life (art. 29). 
</p>
<p>39. For the effective implementation of the right to equality and non-discrimination, it is above 
all necessary that a general guarantee of equality and prohibition of discrimination on the basis 
of disability be included in legislation, which shall apply to all public and private actors 
operating in a given country. Such guarantee shall extend to all forms of discrimination based on 
disability and shall not be limited to discriminatory conduct against persons with disabilities, 
with the result that persons without disabilities are also entitled to protection under article 5:<b>39</b> 
this could be the case of a parent caring for a child with a disability who is discriminated against 
in employment because of the status of the child. Secondly, legislation must afford a person 
reasonable accommodation, the obligatory nature of which must be clearly established. By way 
of example, the duty to reasonably accommodate consists of the duty of a public or private entity 
to make the modifications or changes that are required by a person with a disability in the 
context of education, transport, employment or access to justice, to ensure the equal access of the 
person to the service or to the activity. It is recommended that the duty to accommodate be 
expressed in an open format so not to result in exclusion from protection; and that the factors 
upon which to assess the reasonableness of the accommodation request be provided.<b>40</b> Thirdly, 
equality legislation should foresee the adoption of positive measures required to promote 
de facto equality of persons with disabilities. Such measures might be either temporary or 
permanent, and shall not be considered discriminatory. 
</p>
<p>40. The Convention does not express a preference for the exact type of legislation that will 
give effect to the right to equality and non-discrimination on the basis of disability. States are 
free to choose the approach most suited to their specific legal systems and characteristics and 
might enact a comprehensive disability equality and non-discrimination law that also regulates

 <p> 
</p>
<p>sectors such as health, education and so on; or they might decide to include disability amongst 
the otherwise prohibited grounds in general legislation and then proceed to integrate equality and 
non-discrimination guarantees in sectoral legislation. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Convention recognizes accessibility both as a general principle of the Convention as 
well as a stand-alone provision. Article 9 recognizes an accessible environment as instrumental 
to the realization of the rights of persons with disabilities to independent living and full 
participation in all areas of life and requires States parties to take appropriate measures to ensure 
access to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communication, 
including information and communication technologies and systems, and to other facilities open 
to the public. 
</p>
<p>42. For accessibility legislation to be effective, it is necessary first and foremost that minimum 
standards and guidelines for the accessibility of services and facilities open to the public be 
adopted. Such standards and guidelines should be comprehensive and address the various types 
of barriers that persons with different impairments might face. Provisions should be made with 
reference both to new and existing buildings and regulate a time frame and the nature of 
interventions required for progressive conformity, in consultation with organizations of persons 
with disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Recognition before the law, legal capacity and decision-making 
</b></p>
<p>43. Article 12 of the Convention requires States parties to recognize persons with disabilities 
as individuals before the law, possessing legal capacity, including capacity to act, on an equal 
basis with others. Article 12, paragraphs 3 and 4, requires States to provide access by persons 
with disabilities to the support they might require in exercising their legal capacity and establish 
appropriate and effective safeguards against the abuse of such support. The centrality of this 
article in the structure of the Convention and its instrumental value in the achievement of 
numerous other rights should be highlighted. 
</p>
<p>44. Article 16, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights already 
requires the recognition of legal personality of persons with disabilities. The implementation of 
the obligations contained in article 12, paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5, of the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities, on the other hand, requires a thorough review of both civil as well 
as criminal legislation containing elements of legal competence. 
</p>
<p>45. In the area of civil law, interdiction and guardianship laws should represent a priority area 
for legislative review and reform. Legislation currently in force in numerous countries allows the 
interdiction or declaration of incapacity of persons on the basis of their mental, intellectual or 
sensory impairment and the attribution to a guardian of the legal capacity to act on their behalf. 
Whether the existence of a disability is a direct or indirect ground for a declaration of legal 
incapacity, legislation of this kind conflicts with the recognition of legal capacity of persons with 
disabilities enshrined in article 12, paragraph 2. Besides abolishing norms that violate the duty of 
States to respect the human right to legal capacity of persons with disabilities, it is equally 
important that measures that protect and fulfil this right are also adopted, in accordance with 
article 12, paragraphs 3, 4 and 5. This includes: legal recognition of the right of persons with </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>disabilities to self-determination; of alternative and augmentative communication; of supported 
decision-making, as the process whereby a person with a disability is enabled to make and 
communicate decisions with respect to personal or legal matters; and the establishment of 
regulations clarifying the legal responsibilities of supporters and their liability. 
</p>
<p>46. Norms of laws disqualifying a person from office or performing a function on the basis of 
their disability also need to be abolished. These include norms disqualifying persons with 
disabilities from running for political positions, or from participating in juries or as witnesses to 
legal acts. 
</p>
<p>47. In the area of criminal law, recognition of the legal capacity of persons with disabilities 
requires abolishing a defence based on the negation of criminal responsibility because of the 
existence of a mental or intellectual disability.<b>41</b> Instead disability-neutral doctrines on the 
subjective element of the crime should be applied, which take into consideration the situation of 
the individual defendant. Procedural accommodations both during the pretrial and trial phase of 
the proceedings might be required in accordance with article 13 of the Convention, and 
implementing norms must be adopted. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Right to liberty and security of the person 
</b></p>
<p>48. A particular challenge in the context of promoting and protecting the right to liberty and 
security of persons with disabilities is the legislation and practice related to health care and more 
specifically to institutionalization without the free and informed consent of the person concerned 
(also often referred to as involuntary or compulsory institutionalization). Prior to the entrance 
into force of the Convention, the existence of a mental disability represented a lawful ground for 
deprivation of liberty and detention under international human rights law.<b>42</b> The Convention 
radically departs from this approach by forbidding deprivation of liberty based on the existence 
of any disability, including mental or intellectual, as discriminatory. Article 14, paragraph 1 (b), 
of the Convention unambiguously states that &#8220;the existence of a disability shall in no case justify 
a deprivation of liberty&#8221;. Proposals made during the drafting of the Convention to limit the 
prohibition of detention to cases &#8220;solely&#8221; determined by disability were rejected.<b>43</b> As a result, 
unlawful detention encompasses situations where the deprivation of liberty is grounded in the 
combination between a mental or intellectual disability and other elements such as 
dangerousness, or care and treatment. Since such measures are partly justified by the person&#8217;s 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>41
</b>  Often referred to as &#8220;insanity defence&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>42
</b>  See for reference the Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and the 
</p>
<p>Improvement of Mental Health Care, A/RES/46/119, available at: http://www.un.org/documents/ 
ga/res/46/a46r119.htm. 
<b>43
</b></p>
<p>  In the course of the third session of the Ad Hoc Committee on a Comprehensive and Integral 
International Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights and Dignity of Persons 
with Disabilities, proposals were made to add the word &#8220;solely&#8221; to then draft article 10, 
paragraph 1 (b), so it would read &#8220;any deprivation of liberty shall be in conformity with the law 
and in no case shall be based solely on disability&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>disability, they are to be considered discriminatory and in violation of the prohibition of 
deprivation of liberty on the grounds of disability, and the right to liberty on an equal basis with 
others prescribed by article 14. 
</p>
<p>49. Legislation authorizing the institutionalization of persons with disabilities on the grounds 
of their disability without their free and informed consent must be abolished. This must include 
the repeal of provisions authorizing institutionalization of persons with disabilities for their care 
and treatment without their free and informed consent, as well as provisions authorizing the 
preventive detention of persons with disabilities on grounds such as the likelihood of them 
posing a danger to themselves or others, in all cases in which such grounds of care, treatment and 
public security are linked in legislation to an apparent or diagnosed mental illness. This should 
not be interpreted to say that persons with disabilities cannot be lawfully subject to detention for 
care and treatment or to preventive detention, but that the legal grounds upon which restriction of 
liberty is determined must be de-linked from the disability and neutrally defined so as to apply to 
all persons on an equal basis. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Right to live independently and be included in the community 
</b></p>
<p>50. The provisions of article 19 of the Convention carry far-reaching implications for all forms 
of institutionalized care of persons with disabilities. The recognition of the right of persons with 
disabilities to independent living and community inclusion requires the shift of government 
policies away from institutions towards in-home, residential and other community support 
services. The key element of any intervention aimed at giving effect to the right to independent 
living and community inclusion is the explicit legal recognition of the right of persons with 
disabilities to determine where and with whom to live. This recognition should also openly 
reflect the unlawfulness of arrangements for residential care made against the wishes of a person 
with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>51. De-institutionalization is necessary but not sufficient to achieve the goal of independent 
living. In most cases, a national strategy that integrates interventions in the area of social 
services, health, housing and employment, at a very minimum, will be required. For the effective 
implementation of such strategies it is necessary that the independent living principle be rooted 
in a legislative framework which clearly establishes it as a legal right and in turn places duties on 
authorities and service providers, while also allowing for recourse in case of violation. Such 
legislative frameworks shall include the recognition of the right to access the support services 
required to enable independent living and inclusion in community life, and the guarantee that 
independent living support should be provided and arranged on the basis of the individual&#8217;s own 
choices and aspirations, in line with the principles of the Convention.<b>44 
</b></p>
<p><b>7.  Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>52. Compliance with article 24 of the Convention requires first and foremost the recognition of 
the right of persons with disabilities to education in an inclusive education system and the 
removal of legal barriers to the inclusion of persons with disabilities in the regular education 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>44
</b>  CRPD, art. 3 (a). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>system of the country. Both direct and indirect legal barriers must be removed in the phase of 
admission as well as during education. The duty to provide reasonable accommodation of the 
individual&#8217;s requirements must be clearly established in national legislation. Such obligations 
shall be clearly established for all education providers, public or private. Overall institutional 
responsibility for the education of children with disabilities shall remain within the Ministry of 
Education and laws placing the education of persons with disabilities under the competence of 
the social welfare sector shall be repealed. Together with the obligations related to the right of 
children with disabilities to free and compulsory primary education, such duties are immediately 
applicable. 
</p>
<p>53. Secondly, States should formally identify standards of education to ensure that persons 
with disabilities can enjoy available, accessible, acceptable and adaptable education on an equal 
basis with others.<b>45</b> While such standards are to be progressively realized, States are under the 
obligation to take immediate steps towards the realization of the right to education by persons 
with disabilities to the maximum of available resources. These standards shall cover at a 
minimum: availability of inclusive, quality and free primary education and secondary education 
on an equal basis with others in communities of residence; physical and communication access 
(Braille, alternative script, augmentative and alternative methods, sign language); means and 
format of communication and peer support; provision of individualized student support where 
necessary; provision of adaptable curricula that aim at the full development of human potential, 
the sense of dignity and self-worth of the human being and contribute to the development by 
persons with disabilities of their talents, personality and creativity, and enable participation.<b>46 
</b></p>
<p><b>8.  Right to work and employment 
</b></p>
<p>54. Article 27 of the Convention emphasizes the right of persons with disabilities to work on 
an equal basis with others, including their right to equal pay for equal work, as well as trade 
union rights. The Convention prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability and guarantees 
reasonable accommodation in all phases of work and employment, including recruitment, hiring 
and employment, advancement and conditions of work. It requires positive measures to ensure 
that the open labour market is inclusive to persons with disabilities and to promote opportunities 
for employment or self-employment. Article 27 restates the prohibition of slavery and servitude 
and the protection from forced or compulsory labour on an equal basis with others. 
</p>
<p>55. In the spirit of the Convention, any legislation on employment of persons with disabilities 
needs to protect against any form of discrimination, direct and indirect, in all sectors, forms and 
levels of employment. The prohibition of discrimination shall apply to all phases of employment, 
including conditions for access to employment, to self-employment or occupation, including 
selection criteria and recruitment conditions, vocational guidance, vocational training, practical 
work experience, employment and working conditions, including dismissal and pay, membership 
of, and involvement in, an organization of workers or employers, or any organization whose 
members carry on a particular profession, including the benefits provided for by such 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>45
</b>  See also A/HRC/4/29, para. 28. 
</p>
<p><b>46
</b>  CRPD, art. 24, para. 1 (a), (b) and (c). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>organizations. National legislation shall impose the duty to provide reasonable accommodation, 
clarify the elements of such conduct and the factors upon which to assess the reasonableness of 
the accommodation, and unequivocally link a denial of reasonable accommodation to an act of 
discrimination. It should be noted that article 27, paragraph 1 (a), prohibits discrimination on the 
basis of disability on all matters concerning all forms of employment and is not limited to 
prohibiting discrimination against persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>56. The scope of the protection granted by the Convention should be carefully mirrored in 
national legislation. A general provision on the admissibility of affirmative action measures 
should be included in legislation, clarifying that such measures shall not be taken as 
discriminatory against other members of society. Special measures established by law might 
include the determination of quotas in the recruitment of persons with disabilities. Other 
measures might include the provision of financial subsidies to employers, including tax 
reductions, vocational guidance and placement services. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Judicial measures 
</b></p>
<p>57. For rights to have meaning, effective remedies must be available to redress violations. This 
requirement is implicit in the Convention and consistently referred to in the context of the other 
major human rights treaties. Administrative remedies might in certain cases be adequate to 
vindicate rights. In other cases, judicial protection of rights appears indispensable in order to 
satisfy the requirement of the Convention, and should extend to economic, social and cultural 
rights, besides civil and political rights.<b>47 
</b></p>
<p>58. Even in States parties where the Convention is not directly applicable, ratification of or 
accession to the Convention creates a strong interpretative preference in favour of the 
Convention, which requires the judiciary to apply domestic law in a manner that is consistent 
with it. States parties are required to promote appropriate training on the Convention for the 
judiciary in accordance with article 13. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  LEGAL MEASURES FOR NATIONAL MONITORING 
</b></p>
<p>59. Article 33 of the Convention on national implementation and monitoring requires States 
parties to establish mechanisms for the implementation and monitoring of the Convention at 
national level. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is the first human 
rights treaty that contains detailed provisions on the establishment and functioning of national 
monitoring and implementation frameworks. The incorporation of such provisions has been 
celebrated as a measure to consolidate the institutional preconditions necessary to ensure the 
realization of the rights of the Convention.<b>48</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Focal points and coordination mechanisms at government level 
</b></p>
<p>60. Other non-binding United Nations instruments such as the 1993 Standard Rules on the 
Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities recommended the establishment of 
entities at government level to serve &#8220;as national focal points on disability matters&#8221;.<b>49</b> Numerous 
States that contributed to this study, therefore, reported on the existence of focal points and/or 
entities assigned responsibilities related to the development, implementation and monitoring of 
policies and programmes on disability.<b>50</b> 
</p>
<p>61. With a view to ensuring compliance with the Convention, it is recommended that States 
parties to the Convention or those considering ratification undertake an assessment of existing 
institutions with a view to adopting the necessary amendments for compliance with article 33 
where required. The submission of Nepal, for example, makes specific reference to the need to 
critically revise the existing institutional framework for effectiveness and compliance with the 
Convention.<b>51</b> The mandate of government focal points should specifically include overseeing 
the implementation of the Convention, as acknowledged in the submission of Cyprus.<b>52</b> 
</p>
<p>62. Furthermore, while the Convention does not make specific recommendations as to the 
form and function of such entities, several considerations should be noted: ideally, the focal 
point (or focal points) should be located at the highest level of government, for example at the 
level of a minister or a commissioner within a given ministry. The establishment of a focal point 
or points and its/their mandate should take place through legal measures. The mandate should 
clearly address the need for coherent and coordinated government activity in the area of 
disability, and the focal point/s shall be allocated adequate human and financial resources. These 
entities should be adequately resourced in order to positively contribute to the implementation of 
national strategies and plans adopted to give effect to the Convention. 
</p>
<p>63. The establishment of a coordination mechanism at government level in addition to focal 
points is encouraged under the Convention, although optional.<b>53</b> A coordination mechanism 
might take the shape of an inter-ministerial group, tasked with coordinating implementation of 
the Convention across respective departments/sectors or levels of government and could prove 
particularly beneficial in systems of devolved administration, such as federal States.

<p><b>B.  National monitoring framework 
</b></p>
<p>64. In addition to designating institutions at government level tasked with implementation, the 
Convention requires States to maintain, strengthen, designate or establish a framework to 
&#8220;promote, protect and monitor&#8221; the implementation of the Convention.<b>54</b> Effectively, therefore, 
the Convention envisages two parallel structures at national level: the first, at government level, 
tasked with implementation. The second, at State level, tasked with promoting, protecting and 
monitoring implementation is required to include one or more independent mechanisms and to 
take into account the &#8220;principles relating to the status and functioning of national institutions for 
the protection and promotion of human rights&#8221;.<b>55</b> 
</p>
<p>65. The Convention leaves to States parties the choice of instituting specific disability 
mechanisms or assigning the monitoring function to existing entities. Whatever the preferred 
choice, it must be noted that any institutions assuming the monitoring role must take into account 
the principles relating to the status and functioning of national institutions for the protection and 
promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>66. The elements of an appropriate framework are likely to vary according to the national and 
administrative systems of States, as explicitly provided for in article 33. The performance of 
functions related to the promotion, protection and monitoring might, however, include: 
awareness-raising and public education campaigns; the conduct of public inquiries; the 
preparation of studies and reports reviewing legislation and policies for compliance; and the 
promotion of harmonization of national law and practice with international standards. 
Furthermore, functions might also include reporting to government, parliament or any other 
competent body, in an advisory function, on human rights and disability matters, upon request or 
its own volition; contributing to reports which States are required to submit to United Nations 
bodies and committees; encouraging ratification or accession to human rights instruments and 
ensuring their implementation; and the hearing of complaints and petitions. 
</p>
<p>67. The importance of promptly initiating a consultation with national human rights 
institutions in relation to the role they can play in monitoring and promoting the implementation 
of the Convention should be highlighted. Such discussion is essential, including in cases in 
which States opt for assigning the monitoring mandate to a broader framework, of which 
national human rights institutions shall be part. In this regard, it is important to highlight the very 
specific prescription of the Convention that civil society and &#8220;in particular persons with 
disabilities and their representative organizations be involved and participate fully in the 
monitoring process&#8221;.<b>56</b> In Sweden, consultations are taking place between the Office of the 
Ombudsperson and civil society to explore organizational alternatives for the participation of 
civil society.

<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>States considering ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and its Optional Protocol should engage in a domestic effort to clarify the 
implications of becoming a party to the Convention. Review of domestic legislation and 
policies for the identification of gaps or areas for reform should be a key element of such a 
process, which should also include meaningful and adequate consultation with 
stakeholders, including civil society and organizations of person with disabilities. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>States becoming parties to the Convention should carefully evaluate the opportunity 
to lodge reservations or interpretative declarations to the Convention. Human rights treaty 
bodies have consistently expressed the view that reservations might have the effect of 
diminishing the scope of protection afforded by treaties. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Incorporation of the Convention in the domestic legal order of States parties realizes 
the full potential of the treaty and results in enhanced protection. States parties where the 
Convention is not automatically incorporated into the national legal system should consider 
the adoption of specific measures for this purpose. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>International human rights treaties prevail over national legislation. Provisions of 
constitutional law as well as other aspects of domestic law cannot be invoked to justify a 
failure to perform or give effect to the obligations assumed by States upon ratification of 
the Convention. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The domestic review for compliance with the Convention that States are required 
to conduct should extend to all areas covered by the treaty, including equality and 
non-discrimination measures required for the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights 
by women, men and children with disabilities. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>With a view to guaranteeing effective equality of persons with disabilities in all areas 
of life, legislative measures are not sufficient and should be accompanied by judicial, 
administrative, educational, financial and social measures, amongst others. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>States parties to the Convention should ensure that all rights enshrined in the 
Convention are justiciable before national courts and access to justice for persons with 
disabilities should be ensured, in accordance with article 13. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>States parties are required to establish or designate national implementation and 
monitoring structures in accordance with article 33. The effective establishment and 
functioning of such structures plays a key role in the effective implementation of the 
Convention. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>States parties to the Convention should continuously assess the impact of policies and 
legislation adopted to give effect to the Convention, in cooperation with persons with 
disabilities and their representative organizations and other relevant stakeholders.
