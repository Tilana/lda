<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 18/2, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), in cooperation with concerned 
United Nations agencies and other experts, to prepare concise technical guidance on the 
application of a human rights-based approach to the implementation of policies and 
programmes to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, and to present it to the 
Council at its twenty-first session. 
</p>
<p>2. In 2011, OHCHR circulated a note verbale to all States and international 
organizations requesting information on existing technical guidance pertaining to human 
rights and maternal mortality and morbidity.1 In addition to desk-based research, the present 
report was informed by responses to the note verbale, close cooperation with United 
Nations agencies, academics and civil society organizations working in the area of maternal 
mortality and morbidity, an expert group consultation and a public consultation.  
</p>
<p>3. Maternal mortality and morbidity continue to exact a terrible toll on women, and 
especially impoverished women, in many countries worldwide. Some 287,000 women died 
of maternal causes in 2010,2 and between 10 and 15 million more suffer debilitating 
complications annually, severely affecting their well-being. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) estimates that from 88 to 98 per cent of maternal deaths are preventable.3 
</p>
<p>4. Millennium Development Goal 5 calls for a 75 per cent reduction in maternal 
mortality ratios from 1990 levels and universal access to reproductive health by 2015, the 
latter being the target that is most off-track.4 At the High-level Plenary Meeting of the 
General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals in 2010, the Secretary-General 
launched the Global Strategy for Women&#8217;s and Children&#8217;s Health to accelerate progress. As 
a result of the Global Strategy, an information and accountability commission was 
established, which issued a report recognizing the centrality of human rights to achieving 
progress, and made 10 recommendations, the implementation of which can support the 
guidance contained in the present report.5  
</p>
<p>5. The primary purpose of the present report is to assist policymakers in improving 
women&#8217;s health and rights by providing guidance on devising, implementing and 
</p>
<p>monitoring policies and programmes to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, and 
fostering accountability in accordance with human rights standards.6

</p>
<p> 6 Particular situations, such as emergencies, may require additional guidance with regard to compliance 
with human rights standards and other obligations under international law, including humanitarian 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>6. Although primarily aimed at health decision-makers, the guidance is also relevant to 
other sectors, including finance and education, as well as parliamentarians, judiciaries, 
inter-governmental agencies, national human rights institutions and donor States. The 
engagement of civil society is necessary for the effective implementation of the guidelines, 
and to hold Governments to account.  
</p>
<p>7. The High Commissioner encourages the implementation of the present technical 
guidance. The Human Rights Council could consider encouraging the dissemination of the 
guidance to all relevant parts of Government as well as other stakeholders and promoting 
its use in programmes and policies to eliminate maternal mortality and morbidity. The 
Council could also encourage inter-agency dialogue and collaboration within the United 
Nations systems on the implementation of the guidance through their own policies, 
programmes and technical support. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General principles  
</b></p>
<p>8. Human rights are about empowerment and entitlement of people with respect to 
certain aspects of their lives, including their sexual and reproductive health. International 
human rights law includes fundamental commitments of States to enable women to survive 
pregnancy and childbirth as part of their enjoyment of sexual and reproductive health rights 
and living a life of dignity. Sound public health practice is crucial to enable States to fulfil 
these basic rights, but it must be complemented by broader measures to address women&#8217;s 
empowerment.  
</p>
<p>9. The present technical guidance builds on two previous OHCHR reports. In the first 
(A/HRC/14/39), OHCHR identified seven human rights principles fundamental for 
understanding maternal mortality and morbidity as a human rights issue: accountability, 
participation, transparency, empowerment, sustainability, international assistance and non-
discrimination. In the second (A/HRC/18/27), OHCHR outlined categories of good 
practices to address maternal mortality and morbidity in compliance with human rights 
obligations: enhancing the status of women, ensuring sexual and reproductive health rights, 
strengthening health systems, addressing unsafe abortion, and improving monitoring and 
evaluation. The work of other human rights mechanisms has also been taken into account in 
the guidelines.7  
</p>
<p>10. <b>A human rights-based approach identifies rights-holders and their entitlements 
and corresponding duty-bearers and their obligations, and promotes strengthening 
</b></p>
<p><b>the capacities of both rights-holders to make their claims and duty-bearers to meet 
</b></p>
<p><b>their obligations</b>.<b> </b>These rights and obligations are provided for under international human 
rights law.  
</p>
<p>11. <b>The technical guidance, like previous OHCHR reports, are grounded in the 
respect for sexual and reproductive health and rights, as set out in the Programme of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Action of the International Conference on Population and Development</b>8<b> and 
</b></p>
<p><b>reiterated and expanded upon in subsequent United Nations documents and

(United Nations publication, Sales No. E.95.XIII.18), chap. I, resolution 1, annex. </p>


<p>12. <b>A human rights-based approach is about health and not isolated pathologies; it 
is premised upon empowering women to claim their rights, and not merely avoiding 
</b></p>
<p><b>maternal death or morbidity</b>. Express recognition of the right to health, including a 
comprehensive understanding of sexual and reproductive health in constitutions and/or 
legislation, together with accountability mechanisms for the vindication of health rights is 
essential to a rights-based approach. 
</p>
<p>13. <b>Measures are required to addr</b>ess the social determinants of women&#8217;s health<b> 
that affect the enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights</b>. In all 
countries, patterns of maternal mortality and morbidity often reflect power differentials in 
society and the distribution of power between men and women. Manifested in poverty and 
income inequality, gender discrimination in law and practice, and marginalization based on 
ethnicity, race, caste, national origin and other grounds are social determinants that affect 
multiple rights.  
</p>
<p>14. <b>States must take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against 
women, including gender-based violence, forced and early marriage, nutritional 
</b></p>
<p><b>taboos, female genital mutilation/cutting and other harmful practices.</b>9 Maternal 
mortality and morbidity is a product of discrimination against women, and denial of their 
human rights, including sexual and reproductive health rights. 
</p>
<p>15. Human rights require &#8220;particular attention to vulnerable or marginalized 
groups&#8221;.10 Among other groups, adolescents, ethnic and racial minorities, indigenous 
women, women with disabilities, sex workers, HIV-positive women, displaced and war-
affected women, women living in underserved areas and other stigmatized and excluded 
populations should be paid special attention.11  
</p>
<p>16. <b>Applying a rights-based approach to the reduction of maternal mortality and 
morbidity depends upon a just, as well as effective, health system.</b> Health systems are 
more than delivery apparatus for interventions and commodities. A society in which rich 
and poor women alike &#8211; irrespective of race, ethnicity, caste, disability or other 
characteristic &#8211; can rely on the health system to meet their sexual and reproductive health 
needs fairly is a more just society. In turn, claims for sexual and reproductive health goods, 
services and information should be understood by health system users, providers and 
policymakers as fundamental rights, not as commodities to be allocated by the market or 
matters of charity.12  
</p>
<p>17. <b>In a human rights framework, women are active agents who are entitled to 
participate in decisions that affect their sexual and reproductive health.</b> To be 
effective, participation should enable women to challenge political and other forms of 
exclusion that prevent them from exercising power over decisions and processes that affect 
their lives, including their sexual and reproductive health. This requires meaningful 
participation in the identification of problems, policy design and budget allocation, and the 
evaluation of programmes and policy implementation. 
</p>
<p>18. <b>Accountability is not an afterthought in a rights-based approach, but 
fundamental to each stage of the process </b>&#8211;<b> from identifying accountability gaps in a

</b></p>
<p><b>feedback from the ground through to implementation in practice</b>. Lessons learned 
through structures of accountability must inform the continual process of adjusting existing 
programmes and future planning. 
</p>
<p>19. <b>The design, organization and coordination of the components of the health 
system should be guided by fundamental human rights principles, including non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination/equality, transparency, participation and accountability</b>.13  
</p>
<p>20. Ensuring women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health rights requires meeting 
<b>standards with regard to health facilities, goods and services</b>: 
</p>
<p>(a) Availability of both the underlying determinants of health, as well as 
hospitals, clinics and other health-related buildings, trained medical and professional 
personnel receiving domestically competitive salaries, and essential drugs;  
</p>
<p>(b) Accessibility in four overlapping dimensions: physical, economic 
(affordable), non-discrimination, and regarding information;  
</p>
<p>(c) Acceptability in terms of respect for medical ethics and of the culture of 
individuals, minorities, peoples and communities, sensitive to gender and life-cycle 
requirements, as well as being designed to respect confidentiality and improve the health 
status of those concerned;  
</p>
<p>(d) Quality, including skilled medical personnel, scientifically approved and 
unexpired drugs and hospital equipment, safe and potable water, and adequate sanitation;14 
respectful care for women using health services is a critical dimension of both quality and 
acceptability. 
</p>
<p>21. <b>States are required </b>to use &#8220;maximum available resources&#8221; for the progressive 
<b>realization of economic, social and cultural rights; if resource constraints make it 
</b></p>
<p><b>impossible for the State to </b>fulfil women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health rights 
</p>
<p><b>immediately, the State must demonstrate that it has used all the resources at its 
</b></p>
<p><b>disposal to do so as a matter of priority</b>.15 Multiple obligations relating to sexual and 
reproductive health rights are not subject to resource availability, including obligations 
related to a national plan of action, and the elimination of harmful practices and 
discrimination.16 Those obligations subject to &#8220;progressive realization&#8221; require the adoption 
of all appropriate measures in a deliberate, concrete and targeted manner, within the 
&#8220;maximum available resources&#8221;, including resources from international cooperation.17 
There is a strong presumption against any retrogressive measures in relation to sexual and 
reproductive health.18 
</p>
<p>22. <b>States should protect against interference with sexual and reproductive health 
rights by third parties by enforcing appropriate laws, policies, regulations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>guidelines</b>. States are responsible for exercising due diligence, or acting with a certain 
standard of care, to ensure that non-governmental actors, including private service

<p>providers, insurance and pharmaceutical companies, and manufacturers of health-related 
goods and equipment, as well as community and family members, comply with certain 
standards.19 States may be held responsible for private acts if they fail to act with due 
diligence to prevent, investigate and punish violations of rights.20  
</p>
<p>23. <b>Where the health system is decentralized,</b> t<b>he national Government remains 
accountable for complying with human rights obligations, including those relating to 
</b></p>
<p><b>sexual and reproductive health.  
</b></p>
<p><b> III.  Planning and budgeting 
</b></p>
<p>24. Public health planning traditionally begins with the acknowledgement of a maternal 
mortality and morbidity problem, and then goes on to propose how to address it within the 
current societal framework. Rights-based planning goes further by also examining the 
dominant assumptions underlying the structural determinants of women&#8217;s health, and then 
includes strategies to address those factors, to reshape the possibility frontier for advancing 
maternal health. A human rights-based approach therefore changes decision-making 
processes, and the issues and actors included in those processes, as well as outcomes.  
</p>
<p>25. A human rights-based approach requires a multi-sectoral approach to economic and 
social planning and budgeting, including, at a minimum, coordination among a variety of 
Government ministries and departments, as well as with other key actors, such as the 
private sector, development partners and civil society. Moreover, planning and budgeting 
processes cannot leave all decision-making to technical experts; full transparency and 
meaningful participation by the people affected are required for devising effective, 
democratically legitimate and sustainable solutions to the inevitable policy trade-offs. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Planning 
</b></p>
<p>26. <b>Guaranteeing the right to health requires the State, as a core obligation, to 
adopt a national public health strategy and plan of action (national plan). </b>The national 
plan, coordinated with subnational plans, must comprehensively cover the health needs of 
the entire population, clearly identifying responsible actors in various contexts and 
establishing accountability mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>27. <b>The national plan must contain a sexual and reproductive health strategy, 
encompassing maternal health.</b> It should reflect the pivotal importance of sexual and 
reproductive health, including maternal health, and follow best practices, including those 
set out by WHO.21 Linkages between sexual and reproductive health and related policies, 
including education and nutritional policy, should be drawn explicitly. 
</p>
<p>28. <b>The national plan, and policies linked to it, must be based on an up-to-date 
situational analysis of </b>women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive hea<b>lth and rights, informed 
</b></p>
<p><b>by suitably disaggregated data and trends, as well as vital registration.</b> Human rights 
require an understanding of which population groups are deprived of access, and 
determining the reasons behind that deprivation at both the national and subnational levels.

<p>Disaggregation of data according to the criteria of sex, age, urban/rural residence, ethnicity, 
marital status, HIV status, number of children, as well as by education, wealth quintile and 
geographic region, is critical in this regard.22  
</p>
<p>29. <b>A situational analysis should identify duty-bearers and assess institutional 
capacities and needs in terms of human, financial and other resources, in both public 
</b></p>
<p><b>and private sectors.</b> Such an analysis will thus assist in the identification of accountability 
gaps in sexual and reproductive health, and help to ensure adequate funding and staffing of 
facilities, awareness-raising and training, including regarding human rights, and the 
potential need to establish or to strengthen accountability mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>30. <b>A situational analysis should include a broadly participatory review of the legal 
framework and the enactment, modification or rescission of laws, policies, regulations 
</b></p>
<p><b>and guidelines, as required</b>.<b> </b>Express legal recognition of sexual and reproductive health 
rights, equality between men and women and health as a human right should be 
accompanied by regulations providing for women&#8217;s access to services.23 Laws and policies 
that impede access to sexual and reproductive health services must be changed, including 
laws criminalizing certain services only needed by women; laws and policies allowing 
conscientious objection of a provider to hinder women&#8217;s access to a full range of services; 
</p>
<p>and laws imposing third-party authorization for access to services by women and girls.  
</p>
<p>31. <b>Under international law, a State is obligated to adopt appropriate measures;</b>24<b> 
appropriate measures are evidence-based measures.</b> All measures should be based on 
authoritative public health guidance, including international guidelines, that reflect the 
highest level of evidence available and are updated regularly as new evidence emerges.25 
Although the State enjoys a margin of appreciation in realizing rights, the Government 
must be able to justify publicly policy choices and priorities, and the basis on which they 
have been made.26  
</p>
<p>32. <b>Essential interventions, services and medicines must be defined in accordance 
with core obligations under international law and consistent with the best available 
</b></p>
<p><b>evidence</b>.27 The State may consider additional interventions, services, commodities and 
medicines across the reproductive continuum of care to be &#8220;essential&#8221; within its jurisdiction 
insofar as they supplement, rather than displace, those established as priorities according to 
the best public health evidence. As evidence evolves, the national plan should be updated 
accordingly.  
</p>
<p>33. <b>Authoritative public health guidelines include the following interventions </b>&#8211;<b> to 
which universal access should be effectively ensured in the national plan </b>&#8211;<b> as essential 
</b></p>
<p><b>for improving maternal health</b>: family planning services; prevention and management of 
sexually transmitted infections, including HIV; management of unintended pregnancies, 
including access to safe abortion services, wherever legal, and post-abortion care; 
appropriate antenatal care; detection of domestic violence; management of pre-labour 
rupture of membranes and preterm labour; induction of labour for prolonged pregnancy;

<p>prevention and management of post-partum haemorrhage; caesarean sections; and 
appropriate post-partum care.28 Best practices indicate that newborn care should be 
provided along with delivery and post-partum care for women. 
</p>
<p>34. <b>Authoritative public health evidence indicates that the following medicines </b>&#8211;<b> to 
which universal access should be effectively ensured in the national plan </b>&#8211;<b> are 
</b></p>
<p><b>essential for improving maternal health</b>; oxytocics; antibiotics; misoprostol and 
mifepristone; magnesium sulphate; anti-retroviral medications and testing kits; anti-
malarial medications in many countries and a full range of contraceptive methods, 
including condoms, hormonal methods and intrauterine devices.29  
</p>
<p>35. <b>The national plan should explicitly include additional actions necessary to 
enable women to effectively enjoy their sexual and reproductive health, including but 
</b></p>
<p><b>not limited to their entitlements to these interventions and medicines.</b>30 For example, it 
should address improved access for adolescents to comprehensive sexuality education, 
sexual and reproductive health information and care, including family planning.31 It should 
also address the elimination of discriminatory laws and policies and harmful practices that 
present indirect and direct barriers to the use of such essential services by women and to the 
effective enjoyment of their sexual and reproductive health rights. 
</p>
<p>36. <b>Before finalization, the key elements of the national plan must be assessed for 
their likely impact on the maternal health of different population groups and income 
</b></p>
<p><b>quintiles.</b> Such ex ante impact assessment should particularly consider the impact on 
vulnerable and excluded populations, including but not limited to women with disabilities, 
racial and ethnic minorities, conflict-affected and displaced women, adolescents and other 
marginalized groups, according to national context. 
</p>
<p>37. <b>A rights-based approach to health is a holistic and integrated approach to 
health systems.</b> The national plan should recognize that the effective provision of 
emergency obstetric care and the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted 
infections requires both the integration of services and well-functioning referral systems, 
including adequate communications and transportation and a continuum of care from home 
to hospital and across stages of a woman&#8217;s interaction with the health system.32  
</p>
<p>38. <b>Explicitly considering the requirements of availability, accessibility, 
acceptability and quality under international law will help to ensure that planning 
</b></p>
<p><b>addresses appropriately each component of the health system:</b> service delivery, health 
workforce, information, medical products, vaccines and technologies, financing, leadership 
and governance.  
</p>
<p>39. <b>The national plan should specify capacity-strengthening measures for the 
health workforce and requirements for the number and distribution of health workers 
</b></p>
<p><b>while </b>ensuring respect for health workers&#8217; rights, including their labo<b>ur rights.</b> Where 
the conditions of work for health workers are a concern, the plan should specify measures 
to improve them.

<p>40. <b>The national plan should set out deliberate steps to realize universal access to 
sexual and reproductive health services, in terms of financing, population coverage 
</b></p>
<p><b>and service expansion.</b>  
</p>
<p>41. <b>The national plan should address disparities in the substantive enjoyment of 
sexual and reproductive health rights based on prohibited grounds of discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>as well as inequalities in wealth, level of education or area of residence</b>.33   
</p>
<p>42. <b>Remedying de facto discrimination in access to sexual and reproductive health 
services may require special measures to ensure equitable spending and distribution 
</b></p>
<p><b>of health facilities, goods and services, including where absolute population numbers 
</b></p>
<p><b>or cost effectiveness data would not ordinarily warrant such action</b>. Such special 
measures are not construed as discrimination under human rights law.34 
</p>
<p>43. <b>The national plan should be devised and its implementation reviewed in 
consultation with the populations affected</b>. The criteria and evidence for prioritizing must 
be transparent and subject to public scrutiny. Power differentials based on literacy, 
language, social status or other factors, which may exclude the women and girls most 
affected by the decisions taken, should be redressed to promote their meaningful 
participation.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Budgeting 
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>The identification of budgetary needs requires the involvement of a range of 
ministries and departments</b>; for example, adolescent pregnancy must be addressed in 
conjunction with the Ministry of Education and will require adequate budgets for both 
health and education sectors. 
</p>
<p>45. <b>The State must devote the maximum available resources to sexual and 
reproductive health</b>. The establishment and sustainability of an adequate fiscal envelope 
to afford the maximum available resources is critical to a rights-based approach; where 
structural imbalances exist between expenditures and revenues, strengthened and 
rationalized revenue collection should be undertaken before cuts are made to critical health 
areas, including sexual and reproductive health.  
</p>
<p>46. <b>The budget should ensure that financing is not borne disproportionately by the 
poor</b>.<b> </b>Out-of-pocket costs cannot impede accessibility of care, irrespective of whether 
services are provided by public or private facilities.35   
</p>
<p>47. <b>Addressing maternal health as a human rights issue in budget formulation 
confers added protection for resources allocated to related programmes at both the 
</b></p>
<p><b>national and subnational levels</b>:  
</p>
<p>(a) If the overall available budget increases, resources for maternal health should 
increase accordingly insofar as significant need in that area remains. In particular in the 
case of high-burden countries, the principle of progressive realization under human rights 
law means that the budget for maternal health programmes would be expected to increase 
unless there is public justification to the contrary;  
</p>
<p>  
 33 E/CN.4/2000/4, para. 19. 
 34 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, art. 4; International 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, art. 1; Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities, art. 5.  
</p>
<p> 35 E/CN.4/2000/4, para. 12; WHO, <i>World Health Report 2010: Health Systems Financing: the Path to 
Universal Coverage</i> (Geneva, 2010). </p>


<p>(b) &#8220;Maximum available resources&#8221; under international law include resources 
from international assistance and cooperation;36 however, increased resources from external 
sources should not replace governmental funding of sexual and reproductive health 
programming unless publicly justified and based on an impact assessment;  
</p>
<p>(c) If the overall budget of the State decreases, resources for sexual and 
reproductive health programmes should not be decreased unless the Government 
demonstrates that it has taken all reasonable measures to avoid such reductions;  
</p>
<p>(d) As reducing budgets for programmes directed at low-income and 
marginalized women may constitute retrogression under international law, Governments 
bear a special burden in demonstrating the need for such cuts. 
</p>
<p>48. <b>Both national and subnational governments should establish participatory 
processes, such as public hearings, during budget formulation</b>. Citizens, civil society 
organizations, academics and health service providers should be able to contribute 
meaningfully to budgeting discussions, including by identifying needs, and be aware of 
decision-making criteria. 
</p>
<p>49. <b>Budgets earmarked for sexual and reproductive health should not be 
reassigned, diverted or underspent during the fiscal year</b>. In decentralized health 
systems, budgets should be allocated and funds distributed to the regions and districts in a 
timely and equitable manner.  
</p>
<p>50. <b>In order to implement budgets effectively and ensure that they are properly 
spent, annual work plans that clearly allocate responsibilities at all levels of 
</b></p>
<p><b>government should be used</b>.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>51. <b>The</b> <b>human rights principles of transparency and accountability call for both 
allocated and spent budgets on sexual and reproductive health to be disaggregated by 
</b></p>
<p><b>functional and programmatic classifications and on the basis of regional reporting</b>. 
Sexual and reproductive health spending should be clearly identifiable in the overall budget 
and available in a format readily accessible to the general public.  
</p>
<p>52. <b>Budgets should include provisions for ensuring effective accountability, 
including monitoring, access to justice for the poor, and both judicial and non-judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability mechanisms to facilitate timely redress</b>. 
</p>
<p><b> IV.  Ensuring implementation in practice 
</b></p>
<p>53. Despite elaborate national planning and policies, a failure to respect, protect and 
fulfil women&#8217;s rights to maternal health is often observed or becomes evident in 
implementation. Identifying an obstruction to effective implementation requires periodic, 
bottom-up, local diagnostic exercises to ascertain and provide feedback on what is 
happening to whom and where; why it is happening (what factors are preventing women, or 
certain women, from safely experiencing pregnancy and childbirth and enjoying their 
sexual and reproductive health rights more broadly?); who or what institution is responsible 
for such factors, and for addressing the problem; and how action should be taken (what do 
different duty-bearers need to do to address each factor?).  
</p>
<p>54. Human rights accountability requires follow-up on diagnosed problems and 
proposed remedial responses by the duty-bearers identified. Appropriate channels must 
therefore be available at the facility, district, regional and national levels, and across sectors 
</p>
<p>  
 36 E/C.12/2007/1, para. 5. </p>


<p>and branches of government, for reviewing findings and taking appropriate action to 
address identified problems. 
</p>
<p>55. The two examples in the section below are merely illustrative. The effective 
application of a rights-based approach requires a contextualized understanding of the 
particular issues and challenges, including the availability, accessibility, acceptability and 
quality of goods, services and facilities, as well as of the underlying causes of maternal 
mortality and morbidity.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Example of identified problem: women arriving late or failing to seek 
</b></p>
<p><b>emergency obstetric care  
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>The first step is to analyse the cause of delays and failure to seek care.</b> <b>A human 
rights-based approach places responsibility on the State for ensuring available, 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessible, acceptable and quality facilities, goods and services to address life-
</b></p>
<p><b>threatening delays</b>. Delays in the decision to seek care or opting out of the health system 
entirely are treated not as idiosyncratic, personal choices or immutable cultural preferences 
but as human rights failures. They are affected by the inequitable and sometimes 
discriminatory distribution of health-care facilities, goods and services that makes 
emergency obstetric care both unavailable and physically inaccessible, as well as by a lack 
of awareness of the emergency signs among family and community members and the lack 
of empowerment of women to make decisions about their own well-being. Delays in arrival 
can also be attributable to out-of-pocket costs, lack of transportation or communications, 
and/or poor infrastructure. Lack of cultural sensitivity and acceptability of care at facilities, 
including language and provision for traditional birthing customs, also leads to a reluctance 
to seek care. If abortion laws are overly restrictive, responses by providers, police and other 
actors can discourage care-seeking behaviour. Lastly, when the population perceives that 
care quality is poor &#8211; even if not directly related to sexual and reproductive health &#8211; 
including lack of respectful treatment at facilities, it also affects decisions to seek care and 
undermines the health system as a core social institution.  
</p>
<p>57. <b>The second step is to identify responsibility for each specific factor leading to 
delays or failure to seek care.</b> For example, if a lack of a constant supply of medication or 
supplies is identified as undermining quality of care and generating distrust in the health 
system, it may be attributable to a variety of causes, including lack of adequate record-
keeping at the facility, regional and/or national level that does not permit allocation 
formulas for inputs to reflect actual needs; a lack of local warehousing to ensure stockpiles 
of medications at the district and/or regional level; a flawed national procurement process 
not permitting equitable or timely distribution of quality medicines; corruption at any level; 
illicit or unscrupulous pricing practices by private manufacturers; or a combination of the 
above. These issues are not just technical ones; they affect the effective enjoyment of 
women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health rights. 
</p>
<p>58. <b>The third step is to suggest and prioritize actions by different duty-bearers 
required for each factor causing the problem</b>. For example, if the national procurement 
process for medicines is flawed, the Ministry of Health may need to examine procedures 
followed to award contracts and for quality control; and ineffective or ideologically-based 
policies regarding the selection of medicines, including contraception. In addition, budgets 
may need to be modified by the Ministry, together with other ministries, to meet actual 
needs and address pre-existing disparities or exclusion of certain subpopulations; 
institutional oversight may need to be strengthened at the facility, district, regional and 
national levels to promote robust quantification of needs and reduce corruption; funding 
may need to be secured from donors to integrate information technologies into the health 
system; or a combination of the above. </p>


<p><b> B. Example of identified problem: adolescent girls are suffering from 
</b></p>
<p><b>disproportionately high rates of maternal morbidity and death 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The first step is to analyse not only why adolescent girls suffer from high rates 
of maternal morbidity and death, but also why they are becoming pregnant. A human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights-based approach defines the problem and addresses it in terms of both the 
</b></p>
<p><b>immediate and underlying causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, given that 
</b></p>
<p><b>they determine the possibilities for resolving concrete problems at the local level</b>. 
Amidst many other factors, adolescent pregnancy might be due to a lack of comprehensive 
sexuality education; gender norms that reinforce early pregnancy; early marriage; high 
levels of sexual violence and/or transactional sex; a lack of youth-friendly health services; 
lack of affordable and accessible contraception; or a combination of the above. 
Disproportionately high rates of morbidity and death may be attributable to, inter alia, late 
arrival at health facilities or failure to seek care for any of the reasons noted in the example 
above. Among adolescents, there might also be a disproportionately high rate of self-
induced abortion and fear of criminal sanctions; a marked lack of awareness relating to 
obstetric alarm signals; perceived and actual insensitivity to youth in facilities; or a 
combination of the above. 
</p>
<p>60. <b>The second step is to identify responsibility for each factor, which may 
transcend the health sector</b>. For example, if gender norms reinforce early pregnancy, 
there may be lack of awareness of girls&#8217; rights to education and equality among family 
members and of the health risks of pregnancy for young adolescents; lack of positive 
leadership by community elders, local teachers and political leaders regarding gender roles; 
lack of education regarding women&#8217;s rights and gender equality in national school 
</p>
<p>curricula, coupled with forced pregnancy testing in schools or other policies that reinforce 
gender norms; national legislation that directly discriminates against women and girls or 
has a disproportionate adverse impact on them; economic pressures that contribute to early 
marriage and pregnancy; or a combination of the above.  
</p>
<p>61. <b>The third step is to suggest and prioritize actions by different duty-bearers 
required for each factor causing the problem</b>. For example, national legislation that 
directly discriminates against women and girls or has a disproportionate adverse impact on 
them, including in relation to age of marriage, education, land title and inheritance, or 
employment, in addition to health, should be modified. Legislation, policies and regulations 
directly affecting the health sector, including overly restrictive criminalization of services 
used by women, third-party authorization or unregulated conscientious objection, should be 
modified, and newly established obligations of providers and rights of individual users 
should be disseminated. Among other things, the national Government should undertake 
media and other awareness-raising campaigns targeted at adolescents, adults and 
disadvantaged groups, as well as at key stakeholders, such as community leaders and school 
teachers, to disseminate messages promoting gender equality and changes in legislation that 
may require funding from external donors in addition to cooperation with civil society.  
</p>
<p>62. The more specific the identification of the problem and the reasons for it, the more 
likely it is that duty-bearers may be held effectively responsible; this can only be done 
effectively at the local level. 
</p>
<p>63. <b>The deliberation process itself is critical to understanding the complexities of 
addressing maternal mortality and morbidity and the responsibilities of duty-bearers, 
</b></p>
<p><b>as well as to developing effective and sustainable solutions that are legitimate to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>public</b>. Local diagnoses will be conducted by an array of actors in contextually contingent 
ways, and not all of them will involve all stakeholders. Nevertheless, the meaningful 
participation of affected communities is essential, in particular of women from </p>


<p>marginalized and vulnerable groups and health workers, in efforts to identify problems, 
causes and duty-bearers, and in prioritizing remedial actions and solutions.   
</p>
<p>64. <b>Evaluating factors that may constitute obstacles in practice requires examining 
sequencing and coordination within and between systems, including the appropriate 
</b></p>
<p><b>alignment of</b>: 
</p>
<p>(a) Laws and policies (for example, ensuring appropriate protocols are issued 
and disseminated by the Ministry of Health to provide for abortion where it is legal);  
</p>
<p>(b) Policies and budgets (for example, shifting budget allocations toward the 
needs of the poorest quintiles and/or marginalized groups);  
</p>
<p>(c) Budgets and programmes (for example, ensuring that costs do not raise 
barriers to access to essential sexual and reproductive health care);  
</p>
<p>(d) Policies and programmes (for example, ensuring that all levels of providers 
are actually performing functions set out in national and regional policies);  
</p>
<p>(e) Training and programmes (for example, ensuring that sufficient numbers of 
mid-level providers are recruited and trained to meet the sexual and reproductive health 
needs of the population).  
</p>
<p>65. <b>A rights-based approach requires simultaneous attention to immediate health 
interventions and the longer-term social transformation required to reduce maternal 
</b></p>
<p><b>mortality and morbidity</b>. Overcoming identified obstacles to all essential interventions, 
supplies and medicines within the context of health system strengthening must be 
prioritized. At the same time, however, efforts are also required to address any broader 
patterns of discrimination against women and/or particular groups of women that affect 
maternal mortality and morbidity.  
</p>
<p>66. <b>Full respect for the rights of both health system users and health workers is 
fundamental to a rights-based approach</b>. Any form of abuse, neglect or disrespect of 
health system users undermines their rights. Institutions need to be organized and managed 
to facilitate respect for women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health rights, such as provision for 
</p>
<p>privacy and confidentiality. Systematic education is required for policymakers, planners, 
health system administrators and providers to ensure that women&#8217;s access to care is treated 
as a right and that all duty-bearers understand their corresponding obligations of conduct. 
Moreover, in a health system, health workers are rights-holders as much as duty-bearers. 
Ensuring adequate working conditions and treatment of health workers, including salary 
and benefits, disciplinary processes and voice, is necessary to respect their rights and, in 
turn, to promote health system effectiveness in addressing maternal mortality and 
morbidity.  
</p>
<p><b> V.  Accountability  
</b></p>
<p>67. As has been stressed throughout the present report, accountability is central to every 
stage of a human rights-based approach. It requires not just transparency but meaningful 
participation by affected populations and civil society groups. Effective accountability also 
requires individuals, families and groups, including women from vulnerable or 
marginalized populations, to be aware of their entitlements with regard to sexual and 
reproductive health and are empowered to make claims grounded in them. 
</p>
<p>68. In the sections above, emphasis was put on the importance of assessing 
accountability gaps within and beyond the health sector in the situational analysis and 
addressing them through planning and budgeting, as well as regular, ground-up diagnostic 
exercises and follow-up, in order to ensure implementation in practice. Monitoring, the </p>


<p>dimensions of review and oversight, and remedies are also critical elements of the circle of 
accountability, as is establishing donor accountability.37 
</p>
<p><b> A. Monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>Monitoring in a human rights framework requires the use of indicators, not all 
of which are quantitative or relate to the health sector</b>.38 A rights-based approach 
requires systematically tracking and evaluating: 
</p>
<p>(a) Changes in structural factors over time; this includes, but is not limited to, 
examining whether adopted laws explicitly recognize sexual and reproductive health rights; 
adopting a national plan; and modifying laws that discriminate against women, as well as 
institutions, such as creating a national human rights institution;  
</p>
<p>(b) Policy and budgetary efforts within and beyond the health sector. Policy 
efforts include, for example, costing, resourcing and implementation measures with regard 
to the national plan. Resources and expenditures relating to sexual and reproductive health 
should also be tracked, as should the capacity to relate spending to human rights goals and 
commitments, such as the elimination of financial barriers to care;  
</p>
<p>(c) Concrete results in terms of women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health, and 
maternal mortality and morbidity in particular; this includes outputs, outcomes and impact 
in health system categories, ranging from availability, accessibility, acceptability and 
quality (both through objective indicators, such as case fatality rates, and subjective 
measures of women&#8217;s satisfaction) of health facilities, goods and services to ultimate 
</p>
<p>effects, such as fertility and adolescent birth rates and maternal mortality ratios.39 
</p>
<p>70. <b>Effective monitoring requires functioning health information systems, civil 
registration systems and disaggregated data</b>. The disaggregation of information on the 
basis of sex, age, urban/rural residence and ethnicity, as well as of education, wealth 
quintile and geographic region insofar as possible, is essential for ensuring non-
discrimination and equity, and affording due protection to vulnerable and marginalized 
groups.40  
</p>
<p>71. <b>Quantitative indicators should facilitate the drawing of conclusions with regard 
to compliance with international obligations relating to sexual and reproductive 
</b></p>
<p><b>health rights</b>.41 In addition to disaggregation, as stated above, quantitative indicators 
should be (a) continuously or frequently measurable in order that the actions taken by an 
administration may be measured in a timely manner; (b) objective, to permit comparison 
across time and countries and/or subregions; (c) programmatically relevant, to enable 
priority setting and identification of accountability gaps; and, ideally, (d) subject to local 
audit to promote accountability to populations served. Not all maternal health indicators 
currently used at the national and international levels comply with such criteria; however, 
both Governments and development partners should foster accountability by ensuring that

 38 See HRI/MC/2008/3.

</p>
<p>maternal and child mortality and morbidity. WHO, <i>Keeping Promises, Measuring Results </i>(see

</p>
<p>reproductive rights, maternal health, and the Millennium Development Goals&#8221;, <i>Nordic Journal of 
Human Rights</i> (on file with the secretariat). </p>


<p>as many of the criteria as possible are met, including data objectivity (as in measures of 
skilled birth attendance).  
</p>
<p>72. <b>Monitoring should facilitate the strengthening of the health system, including of 
the health information system</b>.<b> </b>Emergency obstetric care is a core obligation under 
international law, and is the core maternal health intervention that depends most on a 
functioning, coordinated health system. Broader collection of information on the 
availability and use of emergency obstetric care, which depends on health facility survey 
data, can strengthen health information systems. 42 Health information systems should also 
address biases in current demographic and health data, which may affect vulnerable and 
marginalized groups, such as by excluding floating and migrant populations and women 
who do not have live births. 
</p>
<p>73. <b>Monitoring should encompass non-State actors, including, but not limited to, 
pharmaceutical, commodities and device manufacturers, insurance companies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>private service providers</b>.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Forms of review and oversight  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Human rights accountability requires multiple forms of review and oversight, 
including</b>:  
</p>
<p>(a) Administrative accountability with regard to sexual and reproductive health 
calls for internal rules and norms in health facilities and within the Ministry of health, 
which set standards for conduct and make subordinates accountable to superiors, to be 
monitored by a person or committee with no conflicts of interest; 
</p>
<p>(b) Social accountability calls for civil society and public participation at all 
levels of decision-making regarding sexual and reproductive health, and throughout the 
project cycle. Community-based oversight of facility staff, finances and quality of care at 
facilities, such as &#8220;community scorecards&#8221;, &#8220;community-based local administration&#8221; of 
health facilities and accompaniment of women by family and community members can all 
contribute to social accountability and should be implemented according to context;  
</p>
<p>(c) Political accountability calls for both national and subnational Governments 
to be able to justify to legislators the criteria used and decisions taken regarding sexual and 
reproductive health. For legislative oversight to be meaningful, the Executive should 
transparently share budget and planning documents, as well as results, and provide 
adequate time and information for meaningful deliberation by parliamentarians and local 
legislatures;  
</p>
<p>(d) National legal accountability includes the duty of the State to guarantee 
effective enjoyment of human rights, including the duty to provide effective legal remedies 
to victims.43 Legal remedies can be judicial and non-judicial, such as by through a national 
human rights institution;44<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>  
 42 WHO, UNFPA, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the Averting Maternal Death and 
</p>
<p>Disability Programme, <i>Monitoring Emergency Obstetric Care </i>(2009); see also WHO, <i>World Health 
Report 2005: Make Every Mother and Child Count</i> (Geneva, 2005).  
</p>
<p> 43 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 3, para. 5. 
 44 See for example Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;Realizing sexual and reproductive 
</p>
<p>health rights in Kenya: a myth or reality?&#8221;, 2012, available from 
www.knchr.org/reproductivehealth.aspx.  </p>


<p>(e) International accountability<b> </b>calls for the systematic integration of information 
on efforts to prevent and reduce maternal mortality and morbidity into reports submitted to 
international human rights mechanisms, including regional human rights bodies, treaty 
monitoring bodies and for the universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council, 
together with implementation of recommendations thereof.  
</p>
<p>75. <b>A human rights-based approach depends on fostering accountability of 
multiple actors and at various levels, within and beyond the health sector, including, 
</b></p>
<p><b>but not limited to</b>:  
</p>
<p>(a) <b>Professional accountability</b>. Although front-line health workers must not be 
treated as scapegoats for institutional failures, effective standards should be in place to 
ensure quality of care, and sanctions by professional associations, medical councils and/or 
licensing bodies should be applied in the event of proven negligence, abuse or malpractice, 
irrespective of whether providers are tenured;  
</p>
<p>(b) <b>Institutional accountability</b>. Accountability at the facility level requires 
continuous oversight and regular follow-up with regard to any gaps identified. Complaint 
procedures should be instituted in all facilities for health system users, including appeal 
procedures for decisions by institutional management or ethics committees denying access 
to any form of sexual and reproductive health care. Furthermore, internal ombudsperson 
procedures should be instituted for review of health workers&#8217; complaints in each facility, 
with possibility for appeal;  
</p>
<p>(c) <b>Health system accountability</b>. In addition to continuous systemic 
monitoring and regular diagnostics of obstacles, reviews of all maternal deaths should be 
conducted routinely in order that lessons may be learned at all levels of the health system:- 
from individuals&#8217; behaviour and practices to national policies, and along the continuum of 
care from home to hospital. Maternal death reviews should be conducted in the spirit of 
shared responsibility rather than attributing blame, and to inform actions to prevent future 
maternal deaths;  
</p>
<p>(d) <b>Private actor accountability</b>.<b> </b>Corporate enterprises and other non-State 
actors have a responsibility to respect women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health rights, 
</p>
<p>which means that they should act with &#8220;due diligence&#8221; or appropriate care to avoid 
interfering with such human rights.45 In turn, appropriate laws, policies, regulations and 
guidelines should be established and enforced by the State with regard to such 
infringements; 
</p>
<p>(e) <b>Donor accountability</b>. Donors have obligations of international assistance 
and cooperation with regard to sexual and reproductive health rights, including both 
financial and non-financial obligations, as described below. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Remedies 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Remedies are essential to give effect to rights</b>. They may take the form of 
restitution, compensation, satisfaction or guarantees of non-repetition.46 Remedies may be 
administrative, but appeal to judicial review from administrative proceedings will often be 
appropriate.47 Remedies may also be provided through a national human rights institution. 
</p>
<p>  
 45 See A/HRC/17/31. 
 46 E/C.12/2000/4, para. 59. 
 47 E/C.12/1998/24, para. 9. </p>


<p>In all cases, remedies should be accessible, affordable, timely and effective, which will 
require adequate funding, capacity and mandates.  
</p>
<p>77. <b>Judicial remedies have a key role to play in relation to sexual and reproductive 
health rights</b>, including:  
</p>
<p>(a)<b> </b>Ensuring the implementation of existing laws and policies;  
</p>
<p>(b) Reforming laws, policies and budgets that do not adequately protect sexual 
and reproductive health rights; 
</p>
<p>(c) Challenging discriminatory barriers to sexual and reproductive health care;  
</p>
<p>(d) Providing redress for violations of sexual and reproductive health rights in 
practice.  
</p>
<p>78. <b>National human rights institutions should also promote accountability with 
regard to sexual and reproductive health rights</b> by, inter alia,  investigating violations of 
women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health rights; monitoring implementation of legislation, 
performance of selected institutions, court judgements and recommendations made by 
international human rights bodies; and organizing public hearings and education campaigns 
about maternal mortality and morbidity and human rights. 
</p>
<p>79. <b>To ensure the</b> <b>effective use of remedies, the State must systematically raise 
</b>awareness about the applicability of claims relating to women&#8217;s sexual and 
</p>
<p><b>reproductive health rights among lawyers, judges and the public, and provide 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate funding for accountability mechanisms. </b> 
</p>
<p>80. <b>Systems of effective recourse depend on parliamentarians supporting improved 
</b>accountability for violations of women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health rights,<b> 
</b>including by addressing physical, economic and other barriers to recourse systems, 
especially for vulnerable or marginal groups; lack of timely relief; lack of awareness of 
remedies; inadequacy of existing causes of action to secure redress; and deficiencies in

<p><b> VI.  International assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>81. All development partners should contribute to the creation of a social and 
international order in which human rights, including women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive 
health rights, may be realized.48 Human rights obligations with regard to advancing global 
health, including sexual and reproductive health, call for<b> </b>shared approaches and systems of 
collective responsibility together with a global development agenda that centrally reflects 
issues of social and environmental sustainability, equality and respect, and the fulfilment of 
human rights. Underlying issues concerning maternal mortality and morbidity, such as 
gender equality and sustaining effective and an equitable health system, are challenges 
faced in countries of all income levels. 
</p>
<p>82. Obligations of international assistance and cooperation require States in a position to 
assist to do so. They require States that can demonstrate their lack of available resources to 
</p>

 48 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, art. 28. See also the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness 
</p>
<p>(2005) and the Accra Agenda for Action (2008) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) (available from www.oecd.org/dataoecd/30/63/43911948.pdf), para. 13 (c). </p>


<p>meet their human rights obligations to stem resource loss, both financial and human, and to 
seek international cooperation.49  
</p>
<p>83. There is increasing recognition of the responsibilities of non-State development 
partners to ensure that human rights are not violated through their activities.50  
</p>
<p>84. Obligations to provide international assistance and cooperation supplement but do 
not displace obligations of national Governments. 
</p>
<p>85. <b>All development partners should ensure that their development policies are 
rights-</b>based, which includes refraining from doing harm to women&#8217;s sexual and 
</p>
<p><b>reproductive health</b>.<b> </b>For example, restrictions in aid, such as on information regarding 
critical reproductive services or intellectual property regimes that create barriers to 
accessing essential medicines interfere with Governments&#8217; abilities to realize women&#8217;s 
sexual and reproductive health rights.51  
</p>
<p>86. <b>International cooperation should be aimed at strengthening the capacity of 
national health systems to advan</b>ce women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health rights. 
Development partners should refrain from creating a parallel administration to that of the 
Ministry of Health and/or utilizing systems other than those of the Government. 
</p>
<p>87. <b>Donor States should protect wom</b>en&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health rights <b>by 
effectively regulating private actors over which they exercise control</b>.52 These include 
pharmaceutical companies, commodities and device manufacturers, and other companies 
that affect the delivery of sexual and reproductive health services abroad.  
</p>
<p>88. <b>Policy coherence is essential to the global partnership for development</b>. For 
example, donor States should not invest in strengthening health systems while drawing 
away, or allow private actors in their jurisdictions to draw away, human resources from 
them through migration policies.53 Donor States, individually and collectively, should also 
evaluate trade, economic, fiscal and debt policies for coherence with the advancement of 
women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health rights. 
</p>
<p>89. <b>Development partners should ensure predictable, harmonized and transparent 
economic assistance</b>.54 Agreement should be reached with national Governments on 
consolidated budget support as well as reporting of &#8220;externally funded expenditures&#8221;.55 The 
Creditor Reporting System of the OECD Development Assistance Committee should be 
improved to capture, in a timely manner, all sexual and reproductive health spending by 
development partners,56 which should be publicly available and disseminated in accessible 
formats.
