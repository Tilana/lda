1 Under Listing Rule 4.7.3, an entity must lodge with ASX a completed Appendix 4G at the same time as it lodges its annual report with ASX.
Listing Rule 4.10.3 requires an entity that is included in the official list as an ASX Listing to include in its annual report either a corporate
governance statement that meets the requirements of that rule or the URL of the page on its website where such a statement is located. The
corporate governance statement must disclose the extent to which the entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate
Governance Council during the reporting period. If the entity has not followed a recommendation for any part of the reporting period, its corporate
governance statement must separately identify that recommendation and the period during which it was not followed and state its reasons for not
following the recommendation and what (if any) alternative governance practices it adopted in lieu of the recommendation during that period.
Under Listing Rule 4.7.4, if an entity chooses to include its corporate governance statement on its website rather than in its annual report, it must
lodge a copy of the corporate governance statement with ASX at the same time as it lodges its annual report with ASX. The corporate governance
statement must be current as at the effective date specified in that statement for the purposes of rule 4.10.3.
2 “Corporate governance statement” is defined in Listing Rule 19.12 to mean the statement referred to in Listing Rule 4.10.3 which discloses the
extent to which an entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance Council during a particular reporting period.
3 Mark whichever option is correct and then complete the page number(s) of the annual report, or the URL of the web page, where the entity’s
corporate governance statement can be found. You can, if you wish, delete the option which is not applicable.
Throughout this form, where you are given two or more options to select, you can, if you wish, delete any option which is not applicable and just
retain the option that is applicable. If you select an option that includes “OR” at the end of the selection and you delete the other options, you can
