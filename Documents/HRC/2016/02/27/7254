<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In resolution 24/16, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to draft a study on the 
</p>
<p>prevention of human rights violations and its practical implementation, and to present the 
</p>
<p>study to its thirtieth session. As requested in the resolution, this study takes into account the 
</p>
<p>outcome of the panel discussion on the role of prevention in the promotion and protection 
</p>
<p>of human rights, held at the twenty-seventh session of the Council (A/HRC/28/30).  
</p>
<p>2. In preparation for this study, OHCHR sought contributions through a questionnaire 
</p>
<p>addressed to States, national human rights institutions (NHRIs), civil society, relevant 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental bodies and international organizations. The questionnaire covered issues 
</p>
<p>including which legislative, judicial and administrative measures &#8211; as well as action-
</p>
<p>oriented policies, practices and strategies to prevent human rights violations and abuses &#8211; 
</p>
<p>are in place at the national level; and provisions for effective remedies for victims. It sought 
</p>
<p>information on policies and processes for collection, maintenance and analysis of statistical 
</p>
<p>data on human rights; the steps taken to promote a human rights culture; the role of civil 
</p>
<p>society; measures and procedures for following up on recommendations from international 
</p>
<p>and regional human rights bodies; and the contribution of such bodies to the prevention of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations. Information was provided by Albania, Argentina, Australia, Cuba, 
</p>
<p>Cyprus, Georgia, Honduras, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Kazakhstan, Madagascar, Mexico, the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Moldova, Paraguay, Qatar, Slovakia, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine and 
</p>
<p>United Arab Emirates; as well as by Austrian Ombudsman Board, Her Majesty&#8217;s

</p>
<p>rights violations (Part II); identify practical means through which to prevent violations (Part 
</p>
<p>III); and highlight the role of international and regional stakeholders (Part IV). 
</p>
<p><b> II. Concept of prevention  
</b></p>
<p>4. By becoming parties to international treaties, States assume obligations and duties 
</p>
<p>under international law to respect, protect and fulfil human rights for all persons within 
</p>
<p>their territory or jurisdiction, without discrimination of any kind.2 Further, &#8220;States, 
</p>
<p>including all branches thereof, have the primary responsibility for the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of all human rights, including the prevention of human rights violations&#8221;.3 The 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1  The full text of the replies is available from the Secretariat. 
</p>
<p> 2  Art. 2, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Human Rights Committee&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>General Comment 31 (2004); art. 2, Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child&#8217;s General Comment 5 (2003).  
</p>
<p> 3  A/HRC/RES/24/16, para. 2. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has held that States have 
</p>
<p>&#8220;a legal duty to take reasonable steps to prevent human rights violations&#8221; (<i>Velasquez Rodriguez 
</i></p>
<p><i>v. Honduras</i>, 29 July 1988). E. Decaux and S. Touz&#233;, <i>La Pr&#233;vention des Violations des Droits de 
</i></p>
<p>l&#8217;Homme (Paris, Editions A. Pedone, 2015). </p>


<p>obligations of States include the duty to protect against human rights abuse by third parties, 
</p>
<p>including private actors.4 States may breach their international human rights law obligations 
</p>
<p>where they fail to take appropriate steps to prevent, investigate, punish and redress private 
</p>
<p>actors&#8217; abuse.5  
</p>
<p>5. The obligation to prevent human rights violations is expressly formulated in some 
</p>
<p>treaties6 and has been addressed more broadly in human rights treaty bodies&#8217; General 
</p>
<p>Comments7 and reports, notably in relation to: the prevention of torture,8 genocide,9 mass 
</p>
<p>atrocities,10 incitement to hatred,11 violent extremism,12 and the elimination of 
</p>
<p>discrimination on particular grounds (such as race,13 religion or belief14 or sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation (A/HRC/29/23)) or with regard to a particular group (such as women,15 persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities16 and minorities (A/HRC/28/30, paras. 13&#8211;14); A/69/66). The consideration 
</p>
<p>of prevention of violation of these specific rights highlights some common features and 
</p>
<p>approaches to prevention, including the identification of risk and mitigating factors, and the 
</p>
<p>development of some practical tools.  
</p>
<p>6. For example, the prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes 
</p>
<p>against humanity requires &#8220;sustained efforts to build the resilience of societies to atrocity 
</p>
<p>crimes by ensuring that the rule of law is respected and that all human rights are protected, 
</p>
<p>without discrimination; by establishing legitimate and accountable national institutions; by 
</p>
<p>eliminating corruption; by managing diversity constructively; and by supporting a strong 
</p>
<p>and diverse civil society and a pluralistic media&#8221;.17 Further, the Protocol for the Prevention

</p>
<p>Forms of Discrimination against Women General Recommendations 19 and 28. The European Court 
</p>
<p>of Human Rights has established that claims may arise against the State when the police fail to protect 
</p>
<p>individuals from violations of their rights by other individuals (<i>Osman v. United Kingdom </i>(Appl. 
</p>

<p>and the Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity 
</p>
<p>and all forms of Discrimination18 seeks to ensure that States respond to root causes by 
</p>
<p>prohibiting discrimination and condemning discriminatory ideologies, combating impunity, 
</p>
<p>and establishing early warning mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>7. Some treaty provisions point to an obligation of negative result (prevention being 
</p>
<p>successful when there is no violation),19 while in some cases prevention can be seen as an 
</p>
<p>obligation of positive conduct (taking all necessary steps to adopt concrete and effective 
</p>
<p>measures to prevent violations).20 The International Court of Justice has declared that the 
</p>
<p>obligation to prevent genocide is one of conduct and not one of result, in the sense that a 
</p>
<p>State cannot be under an obligation to succeed, whatever the circumstances, in preventing 
</p>
<p>the commission of genocide; the obligation is rather to employ all means reasonably 
</p>
<p>available to them so as to prevent genocide so far as possible.21 In this regard, article 6 of 
</p>
<p>the Arms Trade Treaty prohibits any transfer of conventional arms where the State party has 
</p>
<p>knowledge at the time of authorization that the arms would be used notably in the 
</p>
<p>commission of genocide and crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p>8. Furthermore, the terminology used for instance in relation to the prevention of 
</p>
<p>torture usefully distinguishes between specific practical actions which need to be taken for 
</p>
<p>preventive purposes (direct prevention or mitigation), and the response to violations which 
</p>
<p>needs to be taken in order to remedy those violations and prevent recurrence (indirect 
</p>
<p>prevention or non-recurrence).22 
</p>
<p><b>  Direct prevention/mitigation 
</b></p>
<p>9. Direct prevention aims to eliminate risk factors and establish a legal, administrative 
</p>
<p>and policy framework which seeks to prevent violations. It is also contingent on 
</p>
<p>establishing a culture of respect for human rights, good governance23 and the rule of law, 
</p>
<p>and an enabling environment for a vibrant civil society and free press. For example, the 
</p>
<p>prevention of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment includes 
</p>
<p>adopting laws prohibiting their use and providing for prosecution of those who violate 
</p>
<p>them. It also includes putting in place procedural safeguards &#8211; such as registers in places of 
</p>
<p>detention and video recordings of interrogations &#8211; as well as ensuring independent 
</p>
<p>oversight, including regular monitoring of places of detention by independent bodies.  
</p>
<p><b>  Indirect prevention/non-recurrence 
</b></p>
<p>10. Indirect prevention of human rights violations, or non-recurrence, takes place after a 
</p>
<p>violation has occurred. It aims to prevent recurrence by identifying and addressing causes 
</p>
<p>of violations of all human rights,24 through investigation and prosecution, ensuring the right

<p> 23  See Good Governance Practices for the Protection of Human Rights (United Nations 2007). 
</p>
<p> 24  The United Nations system approach to transitional justice can be helpful to frame a preventive 
</p>
<p>approach in seeking to prevent recurrence of human rights violations which have occurred (including 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>of victims and societies to know the truth about violations, and the right of victims to an 
</p>
<p>effective remedy,25 in accordance with international law.26 Indeed, &#8220;effective domestic 
</p>
<p>mechanisms of oversight, including complaints mechanisms, form an essential part of the 
</p>
<p>apparatus of prevention. These mechanisms will take a variety of forms and operate at 
</p>
<p>many levels&#8221; (CAT/OP/12/6, para. 5(g)). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Prevention in practice 
</b></p>
<p>11. This section will consider the practical implementation of prevention of violations, 
</p>
<p>namely the importance of establishing a legislative and institutional framework for 
</p>
<p>prevention; the crucial role of human rights education; and how planning and monitoring 
</p>
<p>tools can contribute to prevention, in particular in the development of policies. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Legislative and institutional framework for prevention  
</b></p>
<p>12. The creation of a preventive legislative and institutional framework requires a 
</p>
<p>coherent and complementary range of actions, underpinned by an inclusive and 
</p>
<p>participatory approach which includes women and others who face discrimination. As a 
</p>
<p>first step, prevention includes ratifying human rights treaties27 and adopting laws and 
</p>
<p>policies that guarantee human rights in law and practice. For example, this can include 
</p>
<p>introducing a positive duty on public bodies to have due regard to human rights and 
</p>
<p>equality in their work and conduct their business in a manner that is consistent with human 
</p>
<p>rights.28  
</p>
<p>13. Regular and systematic review of existing and proposed legislation for compliance 
</p>
<p>with a State&#8217;s human rights obligations is an important safeguard.29 Such review may be 
</p>
<p>done through a judicial, parliamentary or internal State process. National human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions30 may be specifically mandated to complement such a review and to provide 
</p>
<p>

<p>identifying root causes) and engendering institutional reform in relation to State structures and 
</p>
<p>institutions that facilitated or promoted such violations. Guidance Note of the Secretary-General; 
</p>
<p>United Nations Approach to Transitional Justice (United Nations, 2010); Transitional Justice and 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (United Nations, 2014). 
</p>
<p> 25 The Human Rights Committee has taken the view that the right to an effective remedy may in certain 
</p>
<p>circumstances require State parties to provide for and implement provisional or interim measures to 
</p>
<p>avoid continuing violations and to endeavour to repair at the earliest possible opportunity any harm 
</p>
<p>that may have been caused by such violations (General Comment No. 31, para. 19).

</p>
<p>Member States on the verification of the compatibility of draft laws, existing laws and administrative 
</p>
<p>practice with the standards laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights. See related 
</p>
<p>discussion below about impact assessments of proposed laws and policies. 
</p>
<p> 30  Response by the Republic of Moldova; Response by Hungary.  The Subcommittee on Prevention of 
</p>
<p>Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment specifies that the &#8220;State 
</p>
<p>should inform the [National Preventive Mechanism] of any draft legislation that may be under 
</p>
<p>consideration which is relevant to its mandate and allow the NPM to make proposals or observations 
</p>
<p>on any existing or draft policy or legislation. The State should take into consideration any proposals 
</p>
<p>or observations on such legislation received from the NPM.&#8221; (CAT/OP/12/5, para. 28). </p>


<p>relevant authorities with information about compatibility or recommendations, which have 
</p>
<p>led to changes in proposed laws or policy. Review may also require that draft legislation be 
</p>
<p>submitted to a body prior to being sent to the legislature, with an accompanying document 
</p>
<p>specifying that it has been reviewed and is compatible with the State&#8217;s human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations.31 The review process may include consultation with other actors such as civil 
</p>
<p>society, to provide additional information and expertise throughout the legislative process.32 
</p>
<p>Bodies mandated to undertake such a review should be independent, impartial and their 
</p>
<p>comments taken into account when revising legislation or policies. 
</p>
<p>14. Further, international human rights norms and standards should become part of the 
</p>
<p>national legal system33 so as to ensure they can be invoked in national courts. This requires 
</p>
<p>the establishment of an effective system of administration of justice,34 with courts 
</p>
<p>empowered to interpret constitutional provisions in line with the State&#8217;s human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations and international or regional jurisprudence,35 and enabling them to strike down 
</p>
<p>laws which are deemed unconstitutional.36 
</p>
<p><b>  Need for a victim-centred approach to prevention 
</b></p>
<p>15. Provisions should be in place to provide effective remedies for victims. The 
</p>
<p>establishment of effective monitoring mechanisms to check for actual and potential 
</p>
<p>violations, and to ensure that groups or individuals are not discriminated against in law, 
</p>
<p>policy and practice, is also key. Indeed, prevention is &#8220;as much the practice as it is the 
</p>
<p>content of a State&#8217;s legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures&#8221; (CAT/OP/12/6, 
</p>
<p>para. 3).  
</p>
<p>16. The legal system should be accessible to all, without discrimination on any grounds, 
</p>
<p>including nationality, financial means and language. In turn, this requires that victims know 
</p>
<p>about their rights, available remedies and how to access them. Similar issues arise where 
</p>
<p>non-judicial remedies are used. Provision of free legal advice and pro bono services for 
</p>
<p>victims of human rights violations by NHRIs, civil society, and bar associations can assist 
</p>
<p>in ensuring accessibility of remedies. 
</p>
<p><b>  National human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>17. The establishment of NHRIs compliant with the Paris Principles37 constitutes 
</p>
<p>another important institutional element of the preventive framework. Some are specifically

<p>inspections and independent, effective and timely complaints systems, is key to profound 
</p>
<p>behavioural and institutional change.41 Inspections may look at systemic problems as well 
</p>
<p>as individual situations, and result in timely public reporting of findings and 
</p>
<p>recommendations. Reports may include a requirement that those who are inspected produce 
</p>
<p>an action plan within a specified time period, that includes whether recommendations are 
</p>
<p>accepted in whole, in part or rejected, and the action taken or planned in response. In turn, 
</p>
<p>this plan can be monitored by the inspecting body, and forms the basis for the next 
</p>
<p>inspection. In this way, action, monitoring and follow-up are built in to a regular, ongoing 
</p>
<p>system. 
</p>
<p><b>  Role of civil society  
</b></p>
<p>19. The provision of a protective and enabling environment in law and practice for civil 
</p>
<p>society is also an important element for prevention. This includes a conducive legal, 
</p>
<p>institutional and administrative framework; access to justice and an end to impunity for 
</p>
<p>violations against defenders; strong and independent NHRIs; effective protection policies 
</p>
<p>and mechanisms paying attention to groups at risk; specific attention to women defenders; 
</p>
<p>non-State actors that respect and support the work of defenders; safe and open access to 
</p>
<p>international human rights bodies; and a strong and dynamic community of defenders.42 
</p>
<p>Reprisals for communicating with national, regional and international human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms should also be prohibited.43  
</p>
<p>20. Indeed, civil society has a vital role to play in the prevention of human rights 
</p>
<p>violations.44 They assist in identifying issues of concern, monitoring and advising on laws, 
</p>
<p>policies and practices of States and private actors, bringing their grassroots contacts and 
</p>
<p>expertise on issues to bear in all these respects. Civil society45 also engages in human rights 
</p>
<p>education and training, including helping to change perceptions about groups and issues.

<p>These activities inform and lead into their engagement in regional and international human 
</p>
<p>rights reporting mechanisms, starting with engagement at the national level, through the 
</p>
<p>national consultations and report preparation, through the external aspect, and back to the 
</p>
<p>national level for the implementation phase. Their role in bringing cases at the national, 
</p>
<p>regional or international level is also important. 
</p>
<p><b>  Measures regarding prevention of human rights abuses by private actors 
</b></p>
<p>21. States generally have discretion in deciding upon the appropriate steps to prevent, 
</p>
<p>investigate, punish and redress private actors&#8217; abuse. They should consider the full range of 
</p>
<p>permissible preventative and remedial measures, including policies, legislation, regulations 
</p>
<p>and adjudication.46 For example, with relation to discrimination against women, the 
</p>
<p>appropriate measures include the regulation of the activities of private actors with regard to 
</p>
<p>education, employment and health policies and practices, working conditions and work 
</p>
<p>standards, and other areas in which private actors provide services or facilities, such as 
</p>
<p>banking and housing (CEDAW/C/GC/28, para. 13). 
</p>
<p>22. Importantly, States do not relinquish their international human rights law obligations 
</p>
<p>when they privatize the delivery of services47 such as water and sanitation (A/HRC/15/31), 
</p>
<p>education (A/69/402) or powers of arrest or detention.48 States should ensure that they can 
</p>
<p>effectively oversee the enterprises&#8217; activities, including through the provision of adequate 
</p>
<p>independent monitoring and accountability mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>23. Concomitantly to State obligations, the Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
</p>
<p>Rights49 set out the elements which business enterprises should follow in order to meet their 
</p>
<p>corporate responsibility to respect human rights. First, they must institute a policy 
</p>
<p>commitment to meet the responsibility to respect. Second, they must undertake ongoing 
</p>
<p>human rights due diligence to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for their human rights 
</p>
<p>impact, and be prepared to communicate their commitment and actions externally, 
</p>
<p>including to those groups likely to be affected by their operations. As operations, context 
</p>
<p>and impact may change, a business enterprise should periodically reassess its potential or 
</p>
<p>actual impact on all human rights. Business enterprises should also seek to prevent or 
</p>
<p>mitigate any adverse impact that is directly linked to their operations, products or services 
</p>
<p>through their business relationships. Finally, they must have processes in place to enable 
</p>
<p>remediation for any adverse human rights impact to which they cause or contribute. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The role of human rights education 
</b></p>
<p>24. Human rights education contributes to the prevention of human rights violations and 
</p>
<p>conflict, and to the enhancement of participation in decision-making processes within a 
</p>
<p>democratic system.50 It should be intended as a lifelong and participatory process 
</p>
<p>developing knowledge, skills and attitudes which prompt behaviour to defend and promote 
</p>
<p>human rights. In this sense, it empowers rights-holders to claim their rights, and develops 
</p>

<p>military and public officials,51 to meet their obligations to protect, respect and fulfil human 
</p>
<p>rights. Inadequate human rights education has been identified as one of the greatest 
</p>
<p>obstacles to the enjoyment of all human rights by all persons (A/HRC/28/30, para. 20). 
</p>
<p>25. Human rights education is primarily a State responsibility.52 States should 
</p>
<p>systematically infuse human rights education in the formal education system, and in the 
</p>
<p>training of State agents. For example, training of judges and lawyers should encompass 
</p>
<p>human rights norms and standards as well as related international and regional 
</p>
<p>jurisprudence.53 Specific and methodologically-sound guidance is provided by the Plans of 
</p>
<p>Action for the first (primary and secondary school systems) and second phase (higher 
</p>
<p>education and training of civil servants, law enforcement officials and the military) of the 
</p>
<p>World Programme for Human Rights Education,54 which seeks to advance national 
</p>
<p>implementation of human rights education programmes in all sectors. The Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council has reviewed the evaluation report (A/HRC/30/24) of the second phase of the 
</p>
<p>World Programme, based on national evaluation reports submitted by States; and States 
</p>
<p>could consider including national implementation of human rights education as a regular 
</p>
<p>element in the Universal Periodic Review.55 
</p>
<p>26. Human rights education and training include curriculum and material development, 
</p>
<p>the use of learner-centred and participatory methodologies, the adoption of enabling 
</p>
<p>policies and policy implementation measures, and the fostering of learning environments in 
</p>
<p>which human rights are respected. To enable this, related knowledge and skills of teachers 
</p>
<p>and educators should be strengthened. Inclusive schools, universities and educational 
</p>
<p>institutions which promote human rights, model respect for others, and embrace and 
</p>
<p>celebrate diversity can be key in fostering both inclusivity itself and inclusive attitudes, and 
</p>
<p>should be encouraged and protected by the State.56  
</p>
<p>27. In addition to being a specific responsibility of the State, human rights education is 
</p>
<p>also undertaken by other stakeholders, including NHRIs (A/HRC/28/30, para. 20) and civil 
</p>
<p>society.57 OHCHR supports national efforts for human rights education through its field 
</p>
<p>presences, coordinates the World Programme for Human Rights Education, provides expert 
</p>
<p>advice, elaborates and disseminates methodological tools based on good practice, and 
</p>
<p>maintains resources to facilitate information-sharing.58 
</p>
<p>28. Many NHRIs promote human rights education using a variety of tools including 
</p>
<p>radio programmes, games and interactive tools, and online programmes. NHRIs also focus 
</p>
<p>on specific groups that are more likely to face discrimination or violations. This includes 
</p>
<p>programmes aimed at specific groups and those interacting with these groups, such as 
</p>
<p>social services, teachers and school staff, and police. NHRIs may identify particular needs 
</p>
<p>of specific groups through their monitoring role, individual cases and broader statistical 
</p>
<p>analysis, which demonstrates the benefits of coherence and cross-fertilization between the 
</p>
<p>different functions of these bodies.

<p>29. NHRIs also promote public awareness of human rights59 in the media, through press 
</p>
<p>releases, reports, expert opinions and recommendations60 (including advocacy for the 
</p>
<p>ratification of human rights treaties61). NHRIs have created Visitor Centres as a means of 
</p>
<p>education and outreach, and some take part in television programmes including to present 
</p>
<p>cases and issues to the public.62 Finally, NHRIs further serve to share good practices and 
</p>
<p>lessons learned between States where their recommendations and views are made public, 
</p>
<p>for example as part of annual reports.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Planning and monitoring tools 
</b></p>
<p>30. A number of planning and monitoring tools may assist States and other stakeholders 
</p>
<p>in the prevention of human rights violations, in particular in the development of policies. 
</p>
<p>Some States have developed national action plans on human rights63 or action plans on 
</p>
<p>specific thematic issues,64 which can serve to guide prevention efforts. Further, the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a body which brings together relevant State entities, NHRIs and civil 
</p>
<p>society to advise either the State or the NHRI in relation to human rights issues in general 
</p>
<p>or in relation to a specific group,65 for example older persons,66 is also important. 
</p>
<p><b>  Human rights impact assessments 
</b></p>
<p>31. Human rights impact assessments are instruments for examining policies, 
</p>
<p>legislation, programmes and projects prior to their adoption to identify and measure their 
</p>
<p>impact on human rights (e.g. A/HRC/19/59/Add.5). They are designed to identify the 
</p>
<p>intended and unintended impact on the enjoyment of human rights, and the State&#8217;s ability to 
</p>
<p>protect and fulfil them. As such, they are a planning tool to prevent human rights violations 
</p>
<p>by assessing the formal or apparent compatibility of laws, policies, budgets67 and other 
</p>
<p>measures with human rights obligations, as well as the likely impact in practice, thus 
</p>
<p>creating the opportunity for reconsideration, revision or adjustment prior to adoption. Prior 
</p>
<p>consultation with relevant stakeholders can assist in identifying possible impacts on human 
</p>
<p>rights. Such efforts can lead to government branches and departments adopting a mandatory 
</p>
<p>human rights-based approach to planning, as well as a mandatory and systematic use of 
</p>
<p>international and regional human rights mechanisms recommendations in the formulation 
</p>
<p>of public policies.68 A noteworthy and recent example includes the requirement in article 7 
</p>
<p>of the Arms Trade Treaty that, when a proposed transfer of conventional arms is not 
</p>
<p>prohibited, the exporting State must still assess notably where they could be used to commit

<p>or facilitate serious violations of international human rights law or international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>32. When undertaken by policymakers, human rights impact assessments can ensure that 
</p>
<p>all human rights are factored into policy development at the earliest possible stage. For 
</p>
<p>example, policy planning should ensure adequate social protection and combat social 
</p>
<p>exclusion. This is crucial in particular as many States have responded to the recent global 
</p>
<p>financial crisis with austerity measures that significantly cut social sector spending.69 
</p>
<p>According to a recent OHCHR report, &#8220;cuts in public sector employment and in funding for 
</p>
<p>social safety nets have resulted in the denial or infringement of economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights, especially for populations that are already marginalized or at risk of 
</p>
<p>marginalization and in some cases may violate the prohibition on discrimination in the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights&#8221; (E/2013/82, para. 70). The Chairperson of the Committee on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has in this regard noted that, to comply with their 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations, States parties to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights must justify austerity measures by demonstrating that such measures actually protect 
</p>
<p>the rights outlined in the Covenant, and particularly the rights of the most vulnerable. This 
</p>
<p>requires States to demonstrate that all other alternatives have been exhausted and that the 
</p>
<p>measures are necessary, proportionate, respectful of minimum core obligations and non-
</p>
<p>discriminatory.70 
</p>
<p><b>  Data collection and analysis of statistics 
</b></p>
<p>33. Data collection and analysis of statistics about the population and specific issues is 
</p>
<p>essential to prevent and address discrimination against specific groups. This in turn requires 
</p>
<p>that data coverage is sufficiently accurate and representative: where groups are not included 
</p>
<p>in the first place in data collection, their absence from programmes, or discrimination 
</p>
<p>against them, will not appear in statistics. Participation by NHRIs, civil society, specific 
</p>
<p>groups and statisticians in the preparation of surveys and questionnaires helps to minimize 
</p>
<p>this risk. A human rights approach to data disaggregation requires reaching the most 
</p>
<p>vulnerable and marginalized groups, and ensuring that human rights safeguards are in place 
</p>
<p>for the collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of that data (including ensuring 
</p>
<p>the rights to data protection, registration and self-identification).71  
</p>
<p>34. Helplines, complaint and petition registries of NHRIs (A/HRC/18/24, para. 43) and 
</p>
<p>similar programmes are a useful supplement to systematic data collection and may also 
</p>
<p>provide a basis for identifying issues and problems that are not being adequately addressed 
</p>
<p>or had not previously been identified. 
</p>
<p><b>  Human rights indicators 
</b></p>
<p>35. Human rights indicators72 are essential tools to help States assess their own progress 
</p>
<p>in ensuring the enjoyment of human rights by their people, planning for actions to prevent 
</p>
<p>human rights violations, and monitoring the implementation of such actions for 
</p>
<p>effectiveness and whether adjustments or further actions are needed. In the work of the

</p>
<p>also E/2011/90 on the use of indicators in realizing economic, social and cultural rights. </p>


<p>United Nations human rights treaty bodies, for example, the use of appropriate indicators is 
</p>
<p>a way to help State parties make precise and relevant information available to the treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies, and to help them assess progress in the implementation of State obligations under 
</p>
<p>the treaties.73 
</p>
<p>36. OHCHR has developed a conceptual and methodological framework of indicators 
</p>
<p>that can be applied and contextualized through participatory processes at the national level. 
</p>
<p>The framework recommends the development of structural, process and outcome 
</p>
<p>indicators. This configuration should help assess the steps being taken by States in 
</p>
<p>addressing their obligations &#8211; from commitments and acceptance of international human 
</p>
<p>rights standards (structural indicators) to efforts being made to meet the obligations that 
</p>
<p>flow from the standards (process indicators) and on to the results of those efforts (outcome 
</p>
<p>indicators). For example, with regard to the right to liberty and security of person, a 
</p>
<p>structural indicator might indicate the date of entry into force and coverage of the right in 
</p>
<p>the constitution; a process indicator might reflect the proportion of complaints received on 
</p>
<p>the right investigated and adjudicated by the NHRI; and the outcome indicator would 
</p>
<p>indicate the proportion of arrests and detentions declared unlawful by national courts.74 
</p>
<p><b>  Follow-up to recommendations by human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>37. The development of tools to follow up on recommendations addressed to States by 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms is also very important. In the first instance, compiling 
</p>
<p>recommendations in a publicly available, accessible and coherent form75 enables relevant 
</p>
<p>government bodies and other stakeholders to monitor their implementation. This could take 
</p>
<p>the form of a publicly available and regularly updated online database which could indicate 
</p>
<p>the status of implementation, and would also facilitate the consideration of such 
</p>
<p>recommendations in the development or revision of any national strategy or plan of action 
</p>
<p>on human rights. Specific laws or procedures can be adopted for the national 
</p>
<p>implementation of international and regional jurisprudence, and invite a representative of 
</p>
<p>the victim to participate in the governmental body charged with national implementation of 
</p>
<p>that individual case.76 Standing mechanisms can also be established within ministries to 
</p>
<p>monitor the implementation of recommendations, in particular in light of structural issues 
</p>
<p>which may have been identified through regional human rights mechanisms, and to seek to 
</p>
<p>prevent further violations based on these issues.77 
</p>
<p>38. The implementation of human rights recommendations from human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms into national policies and programmes requires effective coordination, an 
</p>
<p>analytical framework and a harmonious methodological approach. The causes of human 
</p>
<p>rights violations may be obvious, for example laws or policies which exclude certain 
</p>
<p>groups from education. They may also be more complex and encompass a range of legal, 
</p>
<p>policy, practical and social attitudes. Participation of affected persons can help to identify 
</p>
<p>the causes and to consider possible solutions, as well as address the right to participate in 
</p>
<p>decisions. The establishment of inclusive standing coordination and follow-up mechanisms 
</p>
<p>has proven a useful tool in that regard (A/HRC/27/41, para. 101). Consultation and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 73  E.g. the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
</p>
<p>recommended that Honduras should develop disaggregated indicators to monitor and document 
</p>
<p>incidents of inter-prisoner violence with a view to revealing root causes and designing appropriate 
</p>
<p>prevention strategies (CAT/C/HND/CO/1, para. 17).

</p>
<p> 77  Response by Ukraine. </p>


<p>involvement of all levels of government from the outset helps to ensure their continued 
</p>
<p>engagement through to the implementation phase. The creation of (inter-)ministerial or 
</p>
<p>inter-institutional bodies with a clearly designated lead ministry, which also include NHRIs 
</p>
<p>and civil society, can enhance the capacity for timely action. Ensuring the involvement of 
</p>
<p>the same bodies or processes for consultation and coordination with regard to prevention of 
</p>
<p>human rights, as for implementation of recommendations from human rights mechanisms, 
</p>
<p>can contribute to effectiveness, coherence and consistency.  
</p>
<p>39. Planning, monitoring and accountability related to the human rights commitments 
</p>
<p>contained in the new post-2015 Agenda will also be key. States have reaffirmed in the final 
</p>
<p>draft of the sustainable development goals that the new post-2015 Agenda would be guided 
</p>
<p>by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including full respect 
</p>
<p>for international law; and grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>international human rights treaties and other international instruments such as the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Right to Development.78 Achieving the effective implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Agenda will depend on the creation of a strong &#8220;follow-up and review&#8221; framework to 
</p>
<p>ensure that commitments are met.79 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Role of international and regional stakeholders in prevention  
</b></p>
<p>40. International and regional stakeholders can assist States in identifying and proposing 
</p>
<p>remedial action in relation to gaps or weaknesses in protection, laws, policies and practices, 
</p>

<p><b> A. International and regional human rights mechanisms

<p>41. International and regional human rights mechanisms80 complement and assist 
</p>
<p>national processes for prevention of human rights violations, through external insight and 
</p>
<p>expertise with regard to the situation, laws, policies and practices, drawing on their 
</p>
<p>knowledge of practices and challenges faced by other States. They also encourage 
</p>
<p>interaction and engagement between the State and other stakeholders on human rights 
</p>
<p>issues, and serve to inform the content of rights as their recommendations are often public. 
</p>
<p>The Human Rights Council has recalled its role in the prevention of human rights violations 
</p>
<p>through cooperation and dialogue, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 60/251 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/RES/24/16, preamble). While the international system brings a global perspective 
</p>
<p>and universality to human rights protection, regional mechanisms may have a &#8220;greater 
</p>
<p>capacity for early detection, and could draw on experience from comparable situations in

</p>
<p>inter alia seek to strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation,

<p> 80  These include United Nations mechanisms, and those established, for example, by the European

<p>countries&#8221; (A/HRC/28/30, para. 18).  
</p>
<p>42. These mechanisms typically monitor the implementation of human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations through the consideration of periodic reports and examination of individual 
</p>
<p>communications. In their views on such communications, relevant mechanisms not only 
</p>
<p>consider whether or not a violation has occurred in an individual case, they also provide an 
</p>
<p>analysis of their causes, as well as identify what action should be taken to prevent 
</p>
<p>recurrence.81 Complaints mechanisms may also directly prevent human rights violations 
</p>
<p>through their interim measures provisions.82 Another example of the functions of 
</p>
<p>international and regional mechanisms includes friendly settlement procedures of the Inter-
</p>
<p>American Commission on Human Rights, which seeks to guarantee non-repetition to 
</p>
<p>prevent future violations of human rights.83 These guarantees have included adoption of 
</p>
<p>new laws and repeal of existing ones,84 implementation of public policies designed to 
</p>
<p>protect human rights, and human rights training for public officials.85 
</p>
<p>43. Mechanisms for the prevention of torture,86 the special procedures established by the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council and some treaty bodies undertake country visits and produce 
</p>
<p>thematic reports and studies. Many also contribute to prevention by developing new 
</p>
<p>standards and guidelines, and assisting States in the interpretation of provisions included in 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments. Some are mandated to conduct inquiries or early warning or 
</p>
<p>urgent actions which have the prevention of human rights violations as their primary 
</p>
<p>objective.87  
</p>
<p>44. The Universal Periodic Review is a unique process through which the human rights 
</p>
<p>records of all United Nations Member States are considered. It constitutes an opportunity 
</p>
<p>for States to provide information on action taken to improve the human rights situation and 
</p>
<p>to overcome challenges to the enjoyment of human rights by all individuals within their 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction. It can assist States in identifying potential violations and ways in which to 
</p>
<p>address them, including through sharing of good practices. Follow-up to recommendations 
</p>
<p>has led to positive legislative and policy change.88 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 81 For example, the Human Rights Committee commended &#8220;the prompt response and the measures 
</p>
<p>taken by the State party to remedy the infringements on religious freedom identified in the 
</p>
<p>Committee&#8217;s views in Communication No. 1155/2003 [<i>Leirv&#229;g v. Norway</i>, Views adopted on 
</p>
<p>3 November 2004], including the adoption of amendments to the Education Act&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(CCPR/C/NOR/CO/5). 
</p>
<p> 82  Some mechanisms may, at any stage before a case is considered, issue a request to the State for 
</p>
<p>&#8220;interim measures&#8221; in order to prevent any irreparable harm to the author or alleged victim in the 
</p>
<p>particular case. Typically, such requests are issued to prevent actions that cannot later be undone, for 
</p>
<p>example, the execution of a death sentence or the deportation of an individual facing a risk of torture.

<p><b> B. Contribution of international and regional organizations to prevention 
</b></p>
<p>45. International and regional organizations, including the United Nations,89 contribute 
</p>
<p>to the prevention of human rights violations through their respective mandates by 
</p>
<p>supporting States to fulfil their obligations in respect of human rights.90 General Assembly 
</p>
<p>resolution 48/141 specifically mandates OHCHR to &#8220;play an active role in removing the 
</p>
<p>current obstacles and in meeting the challenges to the full realization of all human rights 
</p>
<p>and in preventing the continuation of human rights violations throughout the world&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR provides technical expertise and capacity development to assist governments to 
</p>
<p>fulfil their obligations, support individuals to claim their rights and speak out objectively on 
</p>
<p>human rights violations.91 Further, for example within the Council of Europe, States may 
</p>
<p>seek assistance in preparing laws or assessing their compliance with human rights standards 
</p>
<p>from the Council of Europe Human Rights Directorate and its European Commission for 
</p>
<p>Democracy through Law (Venice Commission). 
</p>
<p>46. The recent launch of the Human Rights up Front (HRuF) initiative has reinforced the 
</p>
<p>crucial role of the United Nations in prevention. HRuF is a United Nations Secretary-
</p>
<p>General&#8217;s initiative designed to ensure that the United Nations system takes early and 
</p>
<p>effective action to prevent or respond to serious and large-scale violations of international 
</p>
<p>human rights or humanitarian law, as mandated by the Charter of the United Nations and 
</p>
<p>resolutions. The primary focus is on prevention and in ensuring that all United Nations 
</p>
<p>entities place the protection of people&#8217;s human rights at the heart of United Nations 
</p>
<p>strategies and operational activities,92 while supporting States&#8217; action to discharge their 
</p>
<p>responsibilities.  
</p>
<p>47. Indeed, many crises are the result of protracted and dynamic processes that have at 
</p>
<p>their root long-lasting patterns of violations of a range of rights that, for not having been 
</p>
<p>addressed early enough, have fuelled instability, violence and conflict. A United Nations-
</p>
<p>wide response requires that early signs of violations are identified and acted upon in a 
</p>
<p>timely manner. For this purpose, the early availability of human rights information and 
</p>
<p>analysis, linking patterns of violations of rights with political and security developments, is 
</p>
<p>key. Alongside United Nations human rights field presences, human rights mechanisms 
</p>
<p>collect a wealth of information on human rights issues, including on gaps in human rights 
</p>
<p>protection, risks of violations and patterns, scale and nature of violations. This information, 
</p>
<p>when effectively analysed, coordinated and channelled, has informed the development of 
</p>
<p>strategies and responses in partnership with States, as well as decisions on the best course 
</p>
<p>of action by the United Nations. By placing the focus on prevention, the HRuF initiative 
</p>
<p>strengthens this link between violations as early warning signs and early action by the 
</p>
<p>United Nations.93  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 89  One of the purposes of the United Nations is &#8220;to maintain international peace and security, and to that 
</p>
<p>end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(Article 1, Charter of the United Nations). The role of the International Criminal Court and similar 
</p>
<p>bodies in complementing and reinforcing national criminal justice processes can also assist in 
</p>
<p>preventing impunity and future human rights violations.

</p>
<p> 93  HRuF is beginning to result in changes in the way the United Nations internally approaches situations

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>48. Prevention of human rights violations is primarily the responsibility of the 
</p>
<p>State. It requires a proactive, continuing and systemic process of addressing risk 
</p>
<p>factors and causes of human rights violations through a range of measures, including 
</p>
<p>law, policy and practice, to ensure respect for and protection of all human rights for 
</p>
<p>all those within the State&#8217;s <b>territory</b> or jurisdiction. International and regional 
</p>
<p>organizations contribute to the prevention of human rights violations through their 
</p>
<p>respective mandates by supporting States to fulfil their human rights obligations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>49. A framework for the prevention of human rights violations requires the 
</p>
<p>ratification of human rights treaties and their implementation at the domestic level; 
</p>
<p>regular and independent review of existing and proposed laws and policies for 
</p>
<p>compliance with those provisions; and ensuring effective remedies for human rights 
</p>
<p>violations that provide redress for the victim and institutional change to prevent 
</p>
<p>recurrence. This in turn requires the establishment of independent institutions, 
</p>
<p>including NHRIs and an accessible and effective legal system.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>50. A culture of human rights compliance should be developed through effective, 
</p>
<p>independent, transparent monitoring and inspection, which engages critically and 
</p>
<p>constructively with all stakeholders, including rights holders, in particular women and 
</p>
<p>members of the most vulnerable and marginalized groups.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>51. Effective human rights education, which develops knowledge, skills and 
</p>
<p>attitudes prompting action for human rights and uses sound methodologies, is 
</p>
<p>essential and complementary to other preventive measures.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>52. States must protect against human rights abuse by private actors and may 
</p>
<p>breach their international human rights law obligations where they fail to take 
</p>
<p>appropriate steps to prevent, investigate, punish and redress private actors&#8217; abuse. 
</p>
<p>States should consider the full range of permissible preventative and remedial 
</p>
<p>measures, including policies legislation, regulations and adjudication. Concomitantly, 
</p>
<p>private actors should also respect the human rights of others, and business enterprises 
</p>
<p>should comply with their responsibility to respect human rights. This requires taking 
</p>
<p>adequate measures for the prevention, mitigation and, where appropriate, 
</p>
<p>remediation of adverse human rights impacts. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>53. The State should provide an enabling environment for NHRIs and civil society 
</p>
<p>to perform their functions, which will further contribute to its primary responsibility 
</p>
<p>to prevent human rights violations. NHRIs and civil society provide independent 
</p>
<p>expertise, assistance to victims, information to the public and specific groups about 
</p>
<p>their rights and how to access them, and undertake other functions such as visiting 
</p>
<p>places where persons are deprived of liberty.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>54. Planning and monitoring tools, including human rights impact assessments, can 
</p>
<p>assist States to promote and protect human rights, and prevent violations thereof 
</p>
<p>through human rights indicators, collection and analysis of statistics, taking into 
</p>
<p>account the OHCHR framework (HR/PUB/12/5).<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>African Republic in 2013-14, the HRUF approach created a renewed sense of responsibility among 
</p>
<p>United Nations senior leadership of the need to address the crisis from a human rights protection 
</p>
<p>perspective. </p>


<p>55. International and regional human rights mechanisms bring independent 
</p>
<p>expertise and provide impetus for national action and reflection. Complaints 
</p>
<p>procedures and early warning mechanisms can also contribute to the prevention of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations.<b>
