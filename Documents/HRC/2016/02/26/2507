<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that the Convention on the Rights of the Child constitutes the standard

importance of the Optional Protocols thereto, as well as other human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> all previous resolutions on the rights of the child of the Commission on 
Human Rights, the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly, the most recent 
being Council resolution 19/37 of 23 March 2012, and Assembly resolutions 67/146 and

Rights as well as in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and taking note of

capacities, in all matters and decisions affecting their lives, and take steps to ensure the 
allocation of available resources to the maximum extent possible to achieve the full 
realization of the right of the child to the highest attainable standard of health, including by 
strengthening international cooperation in this field, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> the commitments made by States to make every effort to accelerate 
the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including Millennium 
Development Goals 4, 5 and 6 by 2015, and taking into account the ongoing consultations 
on the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming further</i> that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or 
her personality, should grow up in a family environment, while the best interests of the 
child shall be the guiding principle of those responsible for his or her nurture and 
protection, and that families&#8217; and caregivers&#8217; capacities to provide the child with care and a 
safe environment should be promoted, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the discussions held during the full-day annual meeting on the rights 
of the child focused on the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, and 
taking note of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 
the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health,1 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the work of special procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights 
Council relevant to the right of the child to health, as well as of the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children and the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming also</i> the Global Strategy for Women&#8217;s and Children&#8217;s Health launched in 
September 2010 by the Secretary-General, as well as the strong political and financial 
commitments made by States with regard to its implementation and supporting initiatives, 
including the Commission on Information and Accountability for Women&#8217;s and Children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Health, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming further</i> the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health, 
adopted in May 2012 at the sixty-fifth World Health Assembly, in which the States 
Members of the World Health Organization expressed their political will to reduce health 
inequities through action particular to each society, on the social determinants of health, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that environmental damage and occupational risks have potentially 
negative effects on children and their enjoyment of their right to the highest attainable 
standard of health and to an adequate standard of living, 
</p>
<p> <i>Profoundly concerned</i> that the situation of children in many parts of the world 
remains critical and has been negatively affected by the world financial and economic 
crisis, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that, in early childhood, children are more vulnerable to disease, 
trauma, all forms of physical and mental violence, neglect, injury, maltreatment and abuse, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 11/8 of 17 June 2009, 18/2 of 28 
September 2011 and 21/6 of 27 September 2012 on preventable maternal mortality and 
morbidity, as well as the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights on preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and human rights and the 
related technical guidance on the application of a human rights-based approach to the 
</p>

<p>implementation of policies and programmes to reduce preventable maternal morbidity and 
mortality,<footnote name="2">A/HRC/21/22 and Corr.1 and 2. </footnote> 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that more than six million nine hundred thousand children under 
the age of 5 die each year, mostly from preventable and treatable causes, caused by lack of 
access to health care and services, including access to skilled birth attendants and 
immediate newborn care, as well as to health determinants, such as safe drinking water and 
sanitation, safe and adequate nutrition, and that mortality remains highest among children 
belonging to the poorest and most marginalized communities, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> that access to clean water and sanitation can reduce the risk of child mortality 
by 50 per cent, as well as reduce diseases such as anaemia, and vitamin deficiency, which 
undermine maternal health, and malaria, diarrhoea and malnutrition, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that addressing inequities in child health and encouraging an equally 
high standard of health care within countries is crucial to reducing child mortality, 
achieving improvements in child well-being and in the realization of children&#8217;s rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> about the multiple discrimination and stigmatization children face 
because of factors such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth, immigration status or other 
status, which have a negative impact on their development, survival and right to health, 
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> the need to mainstream a gender perspective and to recognize the child 
as a rights-holder in all policies and programmes relating to children&#8217;s health,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that realizing the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of health is strengthened by a progressive path towards universal health 
coverage, with specific priority for the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable children, 
by providing functioning health systems that include universal access to comprehensive 
quality health care, including public health measures and protection, and that addresses 
determinants of health through an integrated, multi-sectoral approach, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also</i> that the realization of the right of the child to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of health is strengthened by health financing systems which 
evolve so as to avoid significant direct payments at the point of delivery, and include a 
method for pre-payment of financial contributions for health care and services, as well as a 
mechanism to pool risks among the population, 
</p>
<p><b> I. Implementation of the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest 
</b></p>
<p><b>attainable standard of health 
</b></p>
<p> 1. <i>Acknowledges</i> that the Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most 
universally ratified human rights treaty, and urges the States that have not yet done so to 
become parties, as a matter of priority, to the Convention and the first two Optional 
Protocols thereto, and to consider signing and ratifying the third Optional Protocol thereto, 
on a communications procedure, and, concerned at the great number of reservations to the 
Convention, urges States parties to withdraw reservations incompatible with the objective 
and purpose of the Convention and the Optional Protocols thereto and to consider 
reviewing regularly other reservations with a view to withdrawing them; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls upon</i> States to take all necessary measures to ensure that the right of the 
child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is 
</p>

<p>promoted and protected, without any kind of discrimination, including through the 
enactment and implementation of laws, strategies and policies, gender- and child-
responsive budgeting and resource allocation, and adequate investment in health systems, 
including comprehensive and integrated primary health care, including in efforts to achieve 
Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 and in the health work force; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Reaffirms</i> the right of the child to express their views freely in all matters and 
decisions affecting their health, and that those views should be given due weight in 
accordance with their evolving capacities, and calls upon States to provide disability-, 
gender- and age-sensitive assistance to enable active and equal participation of all children; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure the enjoyment by all children of all their civil, 
cultural, economic, political and social rights without discrimination of any kind, and to 
take effective and appropriate measures to ensure the right of all children to the enjoyment 
of the highest attainable standard of health, on an equal basis with others, as well as access 
to quality, affordable and equitable health care and social services, without discrimination 
of any kind, and to ensure that all such children, in particular victims of violence and 
exploitation, receive special protection and assistance; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms</i> the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or, where 
applicable, the members of the extended family or community as provided for by local

<p> 8. <i>Urges</i> all States to ensure birth registration free of cost to all children 
immediately after birth through universal, accessible, simple, expeditious and effective 
registration procedures, in accordance with article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and article 24 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to 
continuously raise awareness of the importance of birth registration at the national, regional 
and local levels, to ensure free or low-fee late birth registration, to identify and remove 
physical, administrative, procedural and any other barriers, paying due attention to, among 
others, those barriers relating to poverty, disability, gender, nationality, displacement, 
statelessness, illiteracy and detention contexts,<b> </b>and to persons in vulnerable situations that 
impede access to birth registration, including late birth registration, and to ensure that 
children who have not been registered enjoy their human rights; 
</p>
<p> 9.  <i>Calls upon</i> States to strengthen their international commitment, cooperation 
and mutual assistance with the objective of fully realizing the right of the child to the 
highest attainable standard of health<b>,</b> including through the sharing of good practices, 
research, policies, monitoring and capacity-building;

</p>
<p><i>  Malnutrition 
</i></p>
<p> 11. <i>Calls upon</i> all States and, if appropriate, relevant international organizations,

irreversible effects of chronic undernutrition in early childhood, up to the age of 2 years, 
and to reaffirm the rights of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent 
with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from 
hunger so as to be able to fully develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Recognizes</i> the importance of the implementation of the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation for the full realization of the right of the child to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and therefore 
urges States, and through them services providers, to ensure a regular supply of safe, 
acceptable, accessible and affordable drinking water and sanitation services of good quality 
and sufficient quantity, guided also by the principles of equity, equality and non-
discrimination, bearing in mind that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation 
for their populations is to be progressively realized with full respect for national 
sovereignty; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Welcomes</i> the comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant and 
young child nutrition of the World Health Organization, adopted on 26 May 2012 at the 
sixty-fifth World Health Assembly, with its targets and time frame, and urges States and,

and reintegration of children and adolescents with mental disability; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Calls on</i> States to provide support to children with mental disability and their 
families to prevent placement of children in institutions, and to ensure that decisions take 
fully into account the principle of the best interests of the child, promote living 
arrangements in family settings within the community and that procedural safeguards and 
an independent and impartial review body in line with international standards are in place 
to ensure that children in mental health institutions enjoy their fundamental freedoms and 
basic rights;
