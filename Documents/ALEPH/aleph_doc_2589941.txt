Second Quarter 2016 Operational and Financial Results
The Partnership’s second quarter 2016 reported revenues, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of
$26.2 million, $6.3 million and $14.5 million, respectively, which represents an increase over the
Partnership’s second quarter 2015 reported revenues, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $19.1
million, $2.8 million and $10.6 million, respectively. Operating income increased by $4.4 million to
$6.2 million for the second quarter 2016 when compared to the second quarter 2015 operating
income of $1.9 million, which increase was principally due to the following:
Revenues increased by $7.1 million, or 37%, to $26.2 million as compared to $19.1 million, which
increase was related to (i) $3.5 million of new agreements acquired in the Pennsylvania terminals
acquisition and the Pawnee terminal acquisition, (ii) $4.2 million of a full quarter of operations at
the Joliet terminal and (iii) $0.7 million of additional customer activity at the Partnership’s
·
Baltimore, Brooklyn and Toledo terminals. The increased revenue was offset by (i) $1.4 million as
a result of the expiration of short-term contracts and customer non-renewals at the Partnership’s
Blakeley and Portland terminals and reduced throughput activity at the Partnership’s Selma
terminal and (ii) less than $0.1 million decrease in ancillary services fees as a result of reduced
heating fees due to a mild winter.
 
Operating expenses increased by $1.2 million, or 17%, to $8.2 million as compared to $7.0
million, which increase was the result of higher repair and maintenance expenses, utilities,
·
employee and contract labor expenses as a result of the Pennsylvania terminals acquisition, the
Pawnee terminal acquisition and a full quarter of operations at the Joliet terminal.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $1.1 million, or 20%, to
$4.4 million as compared to $5.5 million, which was a result of a $1.6 million decrease in due
diligence expenses offset by increased professional fees associated with a customer dispute and
·
audit and tax expenses of $0.1 million, an increase in salaries and related payroll taxes and
benefits due to the Partnership’s recent acquisitions of $0.1 million and an increase in expenses
paid to the Partnership’s general partner of $0.2 million.
Depreciation expense increased by $1.1 million, or 42%, to $3.7 million as compared to $2.6
million, which increase was primarily due to the impact of the Pennsylvania terminals acquisition,
the Pawnee terminal acquisition and a full quarter of operations at the Joliet terminal, the 2015
·
capital expenditure program at the Gulf Coast terminals for customer expansion activities and
incremental maintenance. Amortization expense increased by $1.5 million, which increase was
primarily due to the intangible assets purchased in the Joliet and Pawnee terminals acquisitions.
As of June 30, 2016, the Partnership's storage capacity was approximately 7.7 million barrels,
which represents approximately a 1.0 million barrel, or 15%, increase when compared to the
Partnership’s capacity at June 30, 2015. The increase in storage capacity is related to the
Pennsylvania terminals acquisition and the Pawnee terminal acquisition.
The Partnership's throughput activity increased by 98.4 mbpd, or 154%, to 162.5 mbpd during the
second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. The increase was due to the
Pennsylvania terminals acquisition, the Pawnee terminal acquisition, a full quarter of operations at
the Joliet terminal, and increased customer activity at the Partnership’s Baltimore, Blakeley,
Brooklyn, Chickasaw, Mobile, Mobile-Methanol, Norfolk, Portland and Toledo terminals offset by
decreased customer activity at the Partnership’s Spartanburg and Selma terminals.
In July 2016, the Partnership declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.44 per unit, or $1.76 per
unit on an annualized basis, for the period from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016. The
distribution will be paid on August 12, 2016 to unitholders of record on August 8, 2016.

Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements and information in this press release constitute “forward-looking
statements.” Certain expressions including “believe,” “expect,” “intends,” or other similar
expressions are intended to identify the Partnership’s current expectations, opinions, views
or beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on the Partnership.
While management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable when
made, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the Partnership will be
those that it anticipates. The forward-looking statements involve significant risks and
uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Partnership’s control) and assumptions that
could cause actual results to differ materially from the Partnership’s historical experience
and its present expectations or projections. Important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from forward-looking statements include but are not limited to: (i)
adverse economic, capital markets and political conditions; (ii) changes in the market place
for the Partnership’s services; (iii) changes in supply and demand of crude oil and
petroleum products; (iv) actions and performance of the Partnership’s customers, vendors
or competitors; (v) changes in the cost of or availability of capital; (vi) unanticipated capital
expenditures in connection with the construction, repair or replacement of the Partnership’s
assets; (vii) operating hazards, unforeseen weather events or matters beyond the
Partnership’s control; (viii) inability to consummate acquisitions, pending or otherwise, on
acceptable terms and successfully integrate acquired businesses into the Partnership’s
operations; (ix) effects of existing and future laws or governmental regulations; and (x)
litigation. Additional information concerning these and other factors that could cause the
Partnership’s actual results to differ from projected results can be found in the
Partnership’s public periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”),
including the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015, as filed with the SEC on March 11, 2016 and any updates thereto in the Partnership’s
subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Forms 8-K. Readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as
of the date thereof. The Partnership undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise
any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Partnership defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income
taxes and depreciation and amortization expense, as further adjusted for other non-cash
charges and other charges that are not reflective of its ongoing operations. Adjusted
EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that management and external users of the
Partnership’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors,
lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess (i) the performance of the Partnership’s
assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital structure or historical cost
basis of the Partnership’s assets; (ii) the viability of capital expenditure projects and the
overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities; (iii) the Partnership’s ability
to make distributions; (iv) the Partnership’s ability to incur and service debt and fund capital
expenditures; and (v) the Partnership’s ability to incur additional expenses. The Partnership
believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors
in assessing its financial condition and results of operations.
3
The Partnership defines Distributable Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less (i) cash interest
expense paid; (ii) cash income taxes paid; (iii) maintenance capital expenditures paid; and
(iv) equity earnings from the Partnership’s interests in Gulf LNG Holdings Group, LLC (the
“LNG Interest”); plus (v) cash distributions from the LNG Interest. Distributable Cash Flow is
a non-GAAP financial measure that management and external users of the Partnership’s
consolidated financial statements may use to evaluate whether the Partnership is
generating sufficient cash flow to support distributions to its unitholders as well as to
measure the ability of the Partnership’s assets to generate cash sufficient to support its
indebtedness and maintain its operations.
The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net income and to
Distributable Cash Flow is cash flows from operating activities. Neither Adjusted EBITDA
nor Distributable Cash Flow should be considered an alternative to net income or cash
flows from operating activities, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow
have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items
that affect net income. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or Distributable Cash
Flow in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Partnership’s results as reported
under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow may be
defined differently by other companies in the Partnership’s industry, the Partnership’s
definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. Please see the
reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and cash flows from operating activities to
Distributable Cash Flow in the accompanying tables.
