<p>  Mandates of special procedures ....................................................................................................  70 </p>


<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Special procedures are mandated by the Human Rights Council to report to it and for 
some mandates also to the General Assembly on their activities (see Appendix I).   
</p>
<p>2.  At the fifteenth annual meeting of special procedures, held in Geneva from 23 to 
27 June 2008, mandate holders supported the periodic issuance of a joint communications  
report to prevent inconsistencies among mandate holders reporting on the same 
communications to the Council; avoid duplication and rationalize documentation; allow the 
examination of cross-cutting human rights issues; and ensure that the content of 
communications and any follow-up would feed into the universal periodic review process 
more effectively (A/HRC/10/24, para 34-35). In 2009, the sixteenth annual meeting of 
special procedures mandate holders decided that a joint communications report would be 
prepared (cf. A/HRC/12/47, para 24-26), with this decision being reconfirmed by the 
seventeenth annual meeting of special procedures in 2010. Mandate holders decided that 
the report should contain summaries of communications, and statistical information 
(A/HRC/15/44, para. 26-27).  
</p>
<p>3. The Outcome of the review of the work and functioning of the Human Rights 
Council calls on the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to maintain 
information on special procedures in a comprehensive and easily accessible manner, and 
encourages the use of modern information technology to reduce the circulation of paper 
(A/HRC/RES/16/21, Annex, para. 29 and 60). 
</p>
<p>4.  The report strengthens transparency, efficiency and reduces documentation and 
related costs. Short summaries of allegations communicated to the respective State or other 
entity are included in the report, and the communications sent and responses received are 
accessible electronically through hyperlinks.  
</p>
<p>5. Communications are reproduced in the language in which they were sent.  Replies 
received in Arabic, Chinese or Russian are included with translations into English, where 
available.  
</p>
<p>6. This report covers all urgent appeals and letters of allegations sent by special 
procedures mandate holders between 16 March and 31 May 2012 and all replies received 
between 16 May and 31 July 2012. Communications sent before 16 March 2012 are 
reported in A/HRC/20/30, A/HRC/19/44 and A/HRC/18/51 respectively. 
</p>
<p>7. The report also includes replies received between 16 May and 31 July 2012, relating 
to communications sent by special procedures mandate holders before 16 March 2012. 
Some of these replies supplement information communicated earlier by the respective 
State.   
</p>
<p>8. The present report contains urgent appeals sent by the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention and by the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and joint 
urgent appeals sent by them together with other mandates.  It does not contain other types 
of communications issued by these mandates, processed according to their own distinctive 
procedures, which will continue to be reported exclusively in the annual reports of these 
two working groups. 
</p>
<p>9. The names of some alleged victims have been obscured in order to protect their 
privacy and prevent further victimization. Names of concerned victims who would 
otherwise have their identities protected are mentioned only when the concerned individual 
has expressively consented or requested to include his or her name in the public report. In 
the original communications, the full names of the alleged victims were provided to the </p>


<p>Government concerned. Names of alleged perpetrators have systematically been blackened 
out in State replies to preserve the presumption of their innocence. 
</p>
<p>10. In preparing the statistics included in this report, uniform reporting periods have 
been used, reflecting all communications sent between 16 March and 31 May 2012, and 
responses received in relation to these communications until 31 July 2012. </p>

Alleged raid on two Palestinian television stations by the Israel Security Forces 
(ISF). According to the information received, on 29 February 2012 ISF soldiers 
raided the headquarters of Watan TV and Al Quds Educational TV (AQTV) in Area 
A of the West Bank (Ramallah and al-Bireh respectively), and confiscated 
broadcasting equipment from both channels, as well as a large number of computers, 
equipment and documents from Watan TV. As a result, broadcasting by both 
television stations was suspended until partial transmission was made possible 
through the support of other Palestinian channels. Reportedly, no document 
explaining the purpose of the raid or the seizure of the equipment was presented, 
and the operation was carried out by officials from the Israeli Ministry of 
Communications, who were escorted by ISF soldiers. According to the ISF 
spokesperson, both channels have been broadcasting illegally, interrupting the 
transmission of television stations in Israel, and interfering with aircraft 
communication at Ben Gurion airport.

<p>Alleged threats to the right to an adequate standard of living, the right to food and 
the right to housing posed by illegal sand extraction. According to the information 
received, around 12,000 villagers living on Mayadip Island on the Meghna River 
face increased risk of food insecurity and homelessness as a consequence of soil 
erosion caused by sand extraction carried out by two companies without government 
authorization. Reportedly a court order issued on 26 April 2011 requiring the 
cessation of the sand extraction from the riverbanks close to Mayadip Island is not 
being enforced in practice. It is alleged that unless the practice of extracting sand is 
stopped, erosion will have a lasting impact on livelihoods and food insecurity in the 
area and result in the mass displacement of the island&#8223;s residents.

<p>Follow up on an alleged illegal decision suspending the activities of 29 NGOs in 
Masvingo. According to the information received, the decision of the Governor of 
Masvingo who ordered the suspension of the activities of 29 NGOs on 14 February 
2012 is illegal as the domestic law does not provide the Governor with the authority 
to suspend the activities of any NGOs. When ordering the suspension of the 29 
associations, it was argued that the associations concerned failed to submit to the 
Provincial Governor&#8223;s office a certificate of registration together with a 
</p>
<p>Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the local authority. It is reported 
that there is no legal obligation for an NGO to register with the Provincial 
Governor&#8223;s Office and there is no obligation for an NGO to conclude a MoU with 
</p>
<p>the local authorities. The suspension of 29 NGOs in the Masvingo province was the 
subject of an earlier communication (see A/HRC/19/44, case no ZWE 3/2012).

<p>Alleged acts of intimidation against the Chief Justice, and other alleged attempts to 
curtail the independence of the judiciary. According to the information received, the 
Chief Justice, Mr. Salamo Injia, was arrested on 8 March 2012. Reportedly, on 2 
August 2011, there was a change of Government and appointment of a new Prime 
Minister, Peter O&#8223;Neill, which followed four months of absence by the Prime 
</p>
<p>Minister Michael Somare on medical grounds and intense political debate around 
leadership of the country. A special Supreme Court reference was reportedly filed 
challenging Mr. O&#8223;Neill&#8223;s Government for not being constitutionally formed nor 
legitimate. On 12 December 2011, the Supreme Court reportedly ruled 3-2 in favour 
of the reinstatement of Mr. Michael Somare as Prime Minister and made a 
declaration that Mr. O&#8223;Neill&#8223;s Government was unconstitutional. The Chief Justice 
was reportedly part of the majority bench. It is further reported that, in this context, 
the Parliament passed, on 21 March 2012, a Judicial Conduct Bill, which presented 
elements of concern with respect to the independence of the judiciary vis-&#224;-vis the 
legislative and executive powers.

<p>Alleged acts of intimidation and threats against human rights defender by security 
forces. According to the information received, on 9 February 2012, about 25

Shah&#8223;s home in the town of Bin Qasim. Mr. Ali Shah is the Chair of the Pakistani 
Fisher folk Forum (PFF) and the General Secretary of the World Forum of Fisher 
Peoples (WFFP). Reportedly, earlier that day a Rangers&#8223; Lieutenant Colonel had

Forum during the past year, in an apparent response to their efforts to resist forcible 
land acquisition and the clearing of mangroves in coastal villages in and around

Parliament of Uganda on 7 February 2012. Reportedly, there are several grave 
human rights concerns regarding the contents of the Bill. These include the 
imposition of the death penalty for &#8222;aggravated homosexuality&#8223;, including for &#8222;serial 
</p>
<p>offenders&#8223; and those who are living with HIV; the criminalization of the &#8222;promotion

<p>Alleged human rights violations committed during a specific police operation in S&#227;o 
Paulo. According to the information received, since 3 January 2012, security forces 
at the S&#227;o Paulo state level, in partnership with local authorities, have carried out 
operations in a central neighbourhood in S&#227;o Paulo, unofficially named 
&#8222;Cracol&#226;ndia&#8223;, with the declared objective to combat drug trafficking. In spite of the 
declared aim, the vast majority of people displaced through these operations are 
allegedly not drug traffickers, but drug users and persons living in poverty.

<p>Alleged killing of environmental rights defender and death threats against another 
human rights defender. According to the information received, on 22 October 2011, 
two days after he and two fellow defenders had filed a complaint against illegal 
logging activities, Mr. Joao Chupel Primo, one of the leaders of the Area Settlement 
Project in the Riozinho Anfrisio Reserve, was shot and killed in the car repair shop 
where he worked in the city of Itaituba, Par&#225;. Reportedly, on 17 February 2012, after 
having received assistance from Ms. Lygia Zamali Fernandes, who works with the 
Federation of Communities from Big Lake Land Area (FEAGLE), an organisation 
which seeks to promote rights of 140 traditional communities in Par&#225;, the other two

received, the death sentence of Mr. Abdolreza Ghanbari was upheld on appeal and 
his request for a pardon from the Amnesty and Clemency Commission was rejected 
at the end of February 2012. Mr. Ghanbari had been tried before Branch 15 of the 
Tehran Revolutionary Court on 30 January 2010, and sentenced to death for 
moharebeh (enmity against God) for alleged links with the banned opposition group, 
the People&#8223;s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI). It is further reported that Mr. 
</p>
<p>Mohsen Daneshpour Moghaddam and his son Ahmad Daneshpour Moghaddam had 
their death sentences confirmed on appeal. They were also convicted on the same 
charges in January 2010. They reportedly remained on death row. All of the accused 
had been arrested following the December 2009 Ashura religious commemorations. 
There were serious due process concerns regarding the conduct of their trials. The 
accused were the subject of a previous communication (see A/HRC/18/51, case no 
IRN 1/2011).

military court rejected Mr. X&#8223;s appeal. Reportedly, Mr. X&#8223;s health has dramatically 
</p>
<p>deteriorated while in prison and, all efforts to transfer him to Tashkent prison-
hospital facility N 64/18 had been unsuccessful.

<p>Alleged difficulties and obstacles to full voter participation and voting rights 
particularly for those belonging to minority groups. According to the information 
received, since 2011, several U.S. States have enacted a broad array of voting 
restrictions and allegedly discriminatory laws, or have otherwise impeded 
democratic political participation. These various restrictive measures fall into three 
general categories, each of which operates at a different point in the voting process: 
first, at the voter registration stage; second, at the early voting stage; and third, on 
Election Day itself. These measures and other efforts reportedly have discouraging 
or impeding impacts on political participation particularly by persons belonging to 
minority groups, particularly African-Americans and Latinos. Specifically, in 2011, 
14 states passed 25 laws that together allegedly block more than 5,000,000 citizens 
access from voting. Since 2008 the ability to vote of persons belonging to such 
minority groups has allegedly been impeded through state legislative initiatives, 
state constitutional amendments, and executive orders that result in barriers to 
voting.

allowed to file an asylum seeker application until after UNHCR intervened. On 21 
March 2012, Mr. X was notified of the rejection of his application for refugee status 
and was deported to Uzbekistan. Mr. X was reportedly not given a chance to appeal 
to the Minister of Justice which he was entitled to within 14 days. His mother later

<p>Alleged forced eviction of families from the Borei Keila community in Phnom 
Penh. According to the information received, on 3 January 2012, state and private 
security forces, violently and forcibly evicted around 300 families living in Borei 
Keila and reportedly destroyed their homes. On 11 January 2012 and on 2 February 
2012, law enforcement officials allegedly arbitrarily detained a number of women, 
children and other residents who were peacefully protesting against their forced 
eviction. Reportedly, a number of residents had only been released after having 
accepted relocation to resettlement sites lacking to date basic services, potable water 
and sanitation services. These sites are reported not to conform to international 
standards on adequate housing. Since then about 600 persons were relocated, the 
majority are reportedly women and children as well as families living with 
HIV/AIDS who also suffer from tuberculosis and other diseases with no adequate 
access to medical care at those relocation sites.

Alleged risk of execution for a drug trafficking offence following denial of a judicial 
appeal. According to the information received, Mr. Yong Vui Kong, a national of 
Malaysia, was arrested on 13 June 2007, on charges of drug trafficking. Mr. Yong 
was found in possession of 47.27 grams of diamorphine. Under the Misuse of Drugs 
Act in Singapore, a defendant is reportedly automatically presumed guilty of drug 
trafficking in cases where possession of heroin exceeds two grams. On 14 
November 2008, Mr. Kong was sentenced to death pursuant to section 33 of the 
Misuse of Drugs Act. Mr. Yong&#8223;s last judicial complaint focused on the alleged 
unequal treatment before the law and unequal protection of the law. On 4 April 
2012, the Court of Appeal of Singapore dismissed Mr. Yong&#8223;s appeal.

<p>Alleged undue restriction to the right to freedom of association and excessive use of 
force during demonstrations. According to the information received, in early April 
2012, the Swazi Government de-registered the Trade Union Congress of Swaziland 
(TUCOSWA), which, in a recent statement, called for the boycott of the 2013 
elections. On 12 April, Swazi police forcibly disrupted a peaceful demonstration in 
Mbabane organized by the TUCOSWA and other civil society groups. 15 trade 
union members were reportedly arrested, including Mr. Muzi Mhlanga, Secretary 
General of the National Teachers&#8223; Union. On 14 April, police reportedly disrupted a 
</p>
<p>prayer gathering in the Lutheran Church in Manzini and arrested church leader Mr. 
Sydney Nyembe, an executive of the Commission of Concerned Church Leaders. 
The authorities are working on a censorship law which would allegedly ban 
Facebook and Twitter users from criticizing the King. These measures reportedly 
form part of an on-going campaign aimed at intimidating and silencing those calling 
for political reforms and promoting human rights in Swaziland.

of Nepal. While some flooding in the area is a natural phenomenon, the annual

April 2012, Mr. Mohammed Salih Al-Bajady was convicted of, inter alia, being a 
member of the human rights NGO Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, and 
calling on the families of political detainees to protest and hold sit-ins. In late March 
2012, prosecutors reportedly imposed a foreign travel ban on human rights activists 
Mr. Muhammad Fahd al-Qahtani, Mr. Walid Abu al-Khair and Mr. Mukhlif 
Shammari for &#8220;security reasons.&#8221; On 10 March 2012, a sit-in at the University of 
King Khalid in Abha was allegedly met with excessive use of force. On 13 March 
2012, the court hearing related to the case of Mr. Fadhil Ali Al- Sulaiman, who was 
charged with demonstrating, resisting arrest and injuring the security forces in 
relation to his participation in two peaceful assemblies in Hofuf in March 2011, was

<p>Allegation of mistreatment and continued arbitrary detention. According to the 
information received, Mr. Erkin Musaev, Uzbek national, a former UNDP 
employee, was arrested by the Uzbek National Security Service on 31 January 2006, 
on charges of disclosure of state secrets, among others, and sentenced to 15 years of 
imprisonment. On 9 May 2008, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention declared 
in its Opinion No. 14/2008 that the deprivation of liberty of Mr. Musaev was 
arbitrary. In early February 2011, Mr. Musaev was transferred from a prison in 
Bekabad city to a high security prison in Navoi region where he remained detained. 
Mr. Musaev has reportedly been subjected to intermittent beating, while detained in 
Navoi prison. He was reported to be in poor health. Mr. Musaev was the subject of 
earlier communications (see A/HRC/18/51, case no UZB 1/2011).

<p>Alleged death sentence and imminent execution on charges of moharebeh (enmity 
against God).  According to the information received, Mr. Hamid Ghassemi-Shall, 
dual national of Iran and Canada, was arrested on 24 May 2008 while visiting his 
mother in Iran. He was subsequently placed in solitary confinement in Evin prison 
for 18 months without any legal representation. While in pre-trial detention, he was 
allegedly forced to confess to the charges brought against him. In November 2009, 
Mr. Ghassemi-Shall was sentenced to death following an allegedly unfair trial by a 
Revolutionary Court. Pursuant to article 186 of the Penal Code of Iran, he was 
convicted of enmity against God (moharebeh) relating to alleged espionage and 
cooperation with the banned People&#8223;s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI). The 
</p>
<p>evidence used as a basis for his conviction consisted of a confession made under 
duress. On 7 November 2009, the Supreme Court upheld his death sentence.

<p>Alleged prosecution of a human rights defender in relation to his legitimate 
activities and to the exercise of his right to freedom of expression. According to the 
information received, Mr. John Kapito, Chairperson of the Malawi Human Rights 
Commission, was approached by a group of police officers on 17 March 2012 who 
questioned him and proceeded to search his car, allegedly in search of guns and 
seditious materials, and his house later in the same day. Mr. Kapito was charged 
with possession of seditious materials, although no such materials were reportedly 
found, and possession of foreign currency. He was released on bail in time to travel 
to Geneva for a meeting of the International Coordinating Committee (ICC) of 
National Human Rights Institutions. It is alleged that this case is part of a pattern 
whereby sedition charges are used to silence human rights defenders in Malawi.

specialist medical care. According to the information received, Mr. Phyo Wai Aung 
was accused of being involved in bombings during the traditional New Year festival 
which took place on 15 April 2010. The trial was allegedly held behind closed doors 
for the first 14 months.  Defence lawyers were allegedly denied the right to cross-
examine prosecution witnesses. At the sixth hearing, the judge ordered that charges 
be brought against the lawyers and their client for intentionally causing an insult to a 
judicial officer under the Contempt of Courts Act 1926. The judge reportedly cut off 
the defendant&#8223;s testimony after only six hearings during which the defendant could 
not possibly go through all the rebuttals in the prosecution case, which involved 
charges carrying the death sentence.  Reportedly, requests for the trial to be reheard 
and appeals for the defendant to receive specialist medical treatment went unheeded.

<p>Allegation concerning more than 1,500 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons who 
are currently engaged in an open-ended hunger strike. According to the information 
received, Mr. Bilal Diab and Mr. Thaer Halahleh, two Palestinian prisoners, are at 
immediate risk of death since they began their hunger strike on 28 February 2012. 
Information received also indicates that many prisoners have been subjected to 
excessive and abusive solitary confinement and prolonged isolation. Prisoners and 
their visitors have also undergone forced strip searches. Those involved in the 
hunger strike have been subjected to further punitive measures such as being 
constantly transferred between prisons; monetary fines; denial of family visits; 
denial of electricity and water supply; forced DNA sampling and limited access to 
lawyers and independent, external physicians. Some prisoners have been denied 
family visits since 2007.

<p>Alleged trafficking of migrant workers from Cambodia and Myanmar for the 
purpose of labour exploitation and debt bondage. According to information 
received, Mr. X, a Cambodian in his thirties came to Thailand in December 2010 
through a broker, CDM Trading Manpower Co Ltd, based in Cambodia. He entered 
into a contract with CDM to work at Phatthana Frozen Food Factory in Thailand. It 
is reported that his salary, attendance bonus and working days were less than what 
was stipulated in his contract. Accommodation and health care were allegedly not 
provided for. Moreover, part of his salary and his passport are reportedly withheld 
by his employer, to prevent him from leaving until his debts are settled. Reportedly, 
other cases point to a pattern of trafficking of migrant workers from Cambodia and 
Myanmar for labour exploitation and debt bondage in Thailand, particularly those 
working in Phatthana Frozen Food Factory and Vita Food Factory.

<p>Alleged threats and harassment against a human rights defender and his family and 
the alleged arbitrary detention or enforced disappearance of a number of his 
relatives and supporters. According to the information received, Mr Chen 
Guangcheng and his family have been under extralegal house arrest since September 
2010, until Mr. Chen Guangcheng&#180;s alleged escape on 22 April 2012. Reportedly, 
on 26 April 2012, a group of men attempted to break into the home of Mr. Chen 
Guangfu, brother of Mr. Chen Guangcheng. Reports indicate that Mr. Chen 
Guangfu was detained before being subsequently released and forbidden from 
leaving his village. Mr. Chen Guangfu&#8223;s son, Mr. Chen Kegui, is allegedly in 
</p>
<p>custody in the Yinan County Detention Centre. Furthermore, on 28 April, Messrs. 
Chen Guangcun and Chen Hua, both cousins of Mr. Chen Guangcheng, were 
reportedly arrested. Their fate and whereabouts allegedly remained unclear. On 3 
May 2012, Mr. Jiang Tianyong was allegedly detained and beaten after attempting 
to visit Mr. Chen Guangcheng in hospital. It is further alleged that Mr. Chen 
Guangcheng's wife, Ms. Yuan Weijing, was harassed and threatened following her

residents in the thapathali settlement, including 401 children, were forcibly evicted 
on 8 May, and 249 houses and a community school destroyed in the process. 
Allegedly, no prior notice was issued to families, and excessive force was used 
during the eviction. Alternative accommodation or housing has not been provided. It 
is reported that families, with nowhere else to go, have been staying on bare land at 
the site, in dire conditions. The government has allegedly not taken any relocation 
measures although it previously announced it intended to secure land for relocation 
and would cover three-months rent for each family as a temporary measure. 
Potential evictions of the Bagmati river bank settlements were the subject of a 
previous communication (see A/HRC/20/30, case no NPL 1/2012).

<p>The National Truth Commission of Brazil was formally constituted with the

President Rousseff in November 2011, this is the next critical step towards the 
establishment of the National Truth Commission responsible for investigating 
human rights violations, including killings, torture and forced disappearances 
committed under military rule between 1964 and 1985. The Special Rapporteurs 
referred to the benefits of a commission of inquiry (A/HRC/19/61) and the integral 
role the mechanism can provide to facilitating the formal investigation of legacies of 
killings, torture and other forms of ill-treatment, and pave the way to effective and 
fair prosecutions. Reference was also made to HRC Res. 18/7 of the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-
recurrence, who can contribute, upon request, to the provision of technical 
assistance or advisory services on issues pertaining to that mandate.

<p>Alleged incommunicado detention, torture, unfair trial and sentence to death for 
moharebeh. According to the information received, on 26 January 2009, security 
forces arrested Mr Behrouz Alakhani, a 26 year old Kurdish citizen, on charges of 
cooperation with the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan (PJAK) and participation in the 
murder of the Khoy Prosecutor. He was held incommunicado for 19 months before 
his transfer to Orumiyeh Central Prison, and was allegedly subjected to severe 
psychological and physical torture. During his detention, he was reportedly deprived 
of access to a lawyer and contacts with family members. In December 2010, Mr 
Alakhani was brought before Orumiyeh Revolutionary Court, where he was 
sentenced to ten years imprisonment for possessing and transporting arms, and to 
the death penalty on charges of moharebeh, following a trial which violated 
procedural safeguards.

<p>Alleged imposition of travel bans on, due process violations against and sentencing 
of human rights defenders. According to the information received, on 13 February 
2011, the Minsk City Court dismissed Mr. Valiantsin Stefanovich&#8223;s appeal, 
upholding an order to pay a fine of 53 million roubles for &#8220;non-payment or 
incomplete payment of taxes&#8221;. Mr. Stefanovich is the Vice-Chairman of the Human 
Rights Centre &#8220;Viasna&#8221;. On 24 January 2012, the Minsk City Court reportedly 
</p>
<p>dismissed the appeal of Ales Bialiatski, Chairman of &#8220;Viasna&#8221; and FIDH Vice-
President, upholding the sentence of four and a half years imprisonment and fines 
totalling 757 million roubles for &#8220;tax evasion on a large scale&#8221;. It is alleged that 
</p>
<p>these criminal cases were politically motivated. Reportedly, Mr. Aleh Volchek, 
Head of Legal Aid to the Population, was sentenced to four days of administrative 
detention on 30 January for &#8220;petty hooliganism&#8221; after his organisation had published 
</p>
<p>a report on the trial of Mr. Bialiatski. In March 2012, Ms. Zhanna Litvina, 
chairperson of the Belarusian Association of Journalists (BAJ), and Messrs. 
Valiantsin Stefanovich, Aleh Hulak, member of the Belarusian Helsinki Committee 
(BHC), Andrey Dynko, editor-in-chief of the independent newspaper &#8220;Nasha Niva&#8221;, 
and Harry Pahanyayla, chairman of the Legal Commission of the BHC, were all 
allegedly denied permission to leave the country. Viasna, the BHC, the BAJ and 
Nasha Niva were among the subjects of an earlier communication (see 
A/HRC/19/44, case no BLR 7/2011).

<p>Alleged arbitrary detention of the former President of Mongolia. According to the 
information received, on 13 April 2012, Mr. Enkhbayar Nambar, 53 years old,  
former President of Mongolia and Chairman of the Mongolian People&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>Revolutionary Party (MPRP),  was taken into custody in Tuv Aimag Prison on 
charges of corruption, without the issuance of a proper court order and with 
restricted and monitored access to his legal counsel. It is alleged that the former 
President went on a hunger strike on 4 May and that his health deteriorated, 
requiring his transfer to a hospital.  He was reportedly released on bail on 14 May 
and ended his hunger strike.

<p>Alleged incidents of violence, including against members of the Anywa community 
and the deteriorating security situation in the Gambella region following the 
involuntary displacement of communities from the region. According to the 
information received, recent violent incidents in the region have been triggered by 
the forced displacement of the minority/indigenous people of Gambella from their 
traditional territories which they have inhabited for centuries, in order to make way 
for agro business enterprises supported by the Government. Reportedly, in a series 
of events between February and May 2012, military forces have killed, injured, 
detained, or taken to unknown locations dozens of civilians, including Anywa 
people living in the Gambella region in general and in Abobo Woreda district in 
particular. These events were allegedly carried out in retaliation for killings by 
unknown gunmen of two police officers and numerous civilians. Several of these 
incidents were allegedly carried out in or around camps of Saudi Star Agro Plc., one 
of the two biggest foreign investors in the region.

Allegations concerning a decision by the Finland Supreme Administrative Court has 
the effect of diminishing Sami self-determination. According to the information 
received, in order to register on the Sami electoral roll to elect representatives of the 
Sami Parliament, the Parliament has required that potential registrants meet both 
self-identification and language requirements. On the basis of these criteria, the 
Sami Parliament of Finland declined to admit four individuals onto its electoral 
register. However, in September 2011, the Finland Supreme Administrative Court 
reversed the decision of the Sami Parliament and decided that self-identification by 
any person with any ancestor registered as &#8220;Lapp&#8221; dating back to as far as 1763 
</p>
<p>should be a sufficient criterion for registration. Concern is expressed that 
elimination of the language requirement for registration to the electoral roll will 
result in an influx of registrants to the electoral roll and a diluting of Sami decision-
making power within the Sami Parliament.

<p>Alleged arbitrary arrest and torture in detention of a human rights lawyer, and false

2012, Mr. Ahmed El-Sayed was detained upon arrival at Jeddah Airport and Saudi 
authorities reportedly informed his wife that he had been tried in absentia and 
sentenced to one year&#8223;s imprisonment and 20 lashes for insulting the King. Mr. El-
Sayed is an Egyptian human rights lawyer who represents a number of Egyptian 
citizens who have allegedly been detained arbitrarily in Saudi Arabia. Allegedly, on 
21 April, Mr. El-Sayed confessed to drug trafficking while being tortured in Zahban 
Prison. On 24 April, the Saudi Embassy in Egypt allegedly issued a statement 
declaring that Mr. El-Sayed had been arrested for having 21,380 Xanax tablets in his 
possession, a claim that the Egyptian authorities in Cairo Airport reportedly deny. It 
is reported that Mr. El-Sayed was on trial at the time the communication was sent, 
and that the prosecution had requested the imposition of the death penalty.

Alleged planned building of an eight-lane highway through the Bukit Brown 
Cemetery. According to information received, the Bukit Brown Cemetery, which is 
of remarkable natural, cultural and historical value, enables people to build a sense 
of identity and belonging to the region, is used as a space for the living cultural 
practices of people, is an important recreational and leisure space with a unique 
combination of heritage and nature, and provides a valuable database for researchers 
and scholars. In September 2011, the Government of Singapore reportedly 
announced the construction of a new road through the Bukit Brown Cemetery to 
relieve traffic congestion; the decision taken by the Government to build the road 
was allegedly not preceded by a meaningful consultation process.

Alleged threat of mass forced evictions and additional violations of the right to 
adequate housing following the recent adoption of the Law for the Transformation 
of Areas under Disaster Risk. According to information received, the Law of 18 
May 2012 threatens the enjoyment of the right to adequate housing of more than six 
million households. The Law presents a number of problematic provisions, in 
particular a lack of concrete definitions, accountability mechanisms, administrative 
or judicial recourse for affected communities, coupled with the extensive decision-
making powers of Government and local authorities with regard to the 
determination of buildings to be demolished and the actual demolition process. The 
implementation of the Bill as it is may allegedly lead to mass forced evictions, 
infringements on the rights to property and housing, and to an increased number of 
people made homeless or left in worse housing and living conditions. Reports 
received indicate that there has been very little consultation with potentially affected 
communities and civil society organizations during the drafting of the Law.

<p>Alleged arrest and detention, ill-treatment, judicial harassment and sentencing of 
women human rights defenders. According to the information received, Ms. 
Faranak Farid was arrested in Tabriz on 3 September 2011 by plain-clothes 
security officials. She was reportedly severely beaten during her arrest, subjected 
to ill-treatment during interrogation and forced to sign a document which she was 
unable to read. She was allegedly sentenced to ten days temporary detention based 
on charges of &#8220;insulting the Supreme leader&#8221;, &#8220;propaganda against the system&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;acting against national security&#8221;.  The arrest of Ms. Farid was reportedly linked to 
her involvement in peaceful demonstrations. On 4 September 2011, Ms. Fereshteh 
Shirazi was allegedly arrested and detained in Amol prison. It is suspected that the 
reason for her arrest may be related to her women&#8223;s rights activities and entries 
made on her blog. The case is reportedly based on accusations of &#8220;acting against 
</p>
<p>State security&#8221;, &#8220;publicising lies&#8221; and &#8220;causing unease in the public mind.&#8221; On 14 
</p>
<p>September 2011, Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh was reportedly sentenced by Branch 54 of 
the Appeals Court to six years imprisonment and a ten-year ban on practicing as a 
lawyer. The sentence allegedly relates to charges of &#8220;propaganda against the state&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;collusion and gathering with the aim of acting against national security&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;membership of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre&#8221;.  On 26 September 2011, 
</p>
<p>Branch 26 of the Islamic Revolution Court reportedly sentenced Ms. Narges 
Mohammadi to eleven years in prison on charges of &#8220;assembly and collusion 
</p>
<p>against the national security&#8221;, &#8220;membership of the Defenders of Human Rights 
Centre&#8221; and &#8220;propaganda against the Islamic Republic&#8221;.  The ruling reportedly 
</p>
<p>referred to Ms. Mohammadi&#8223;s human rights activities as attempts to overthrow the 
</p>
<p>Islamic Republic.  Ms. Shiva Nazar-Ahai was reportedly sentenced on 8 January 
2011 by Branch 36 of the Tehran Appeals Court to four years imprisonment to be 
spent in internal exile away from her home. The sentence reportedly relates to 
charges of &#8220;attempts to deface the Islamic Government&#8221;, &#8220;disturbing the public 
peace of mind&#8221; and &#8220;waging war against God&#8221;.

arrested Mr. Goudarzi&#8223;s mother, Ms. Parvin Mokhtareh, at her home. On 13 
September, Mr. Mohammed Seifzadeh, a founding member of Defenders of 
Human Rights Centre (DHRC), was reportedly summoned to court. The charges 
brought against the aforementioned individuals have included, inter alia, 
&#8220;propaganda against the system&#8221;, &#8220;offending the Leader of the revolution&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;acting against national security&#8221;. In September 2011, several lawyers who

<p>On 21 October 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, the Vice-Chair of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and 
Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances sent a letter to the Islamic Republic of Iran related to their joint 
study on global practices in relation to secret detention in the context of countering 
terrorism (A/HRC/13/42). The joint study was part of a consultative process with 
States. In the same spirit of cooperation, the mandate holders/experts would like to 
continue engaging with States in ensuring appropriate follow-up to the joint study. 
In this context, they invited the Islamic Republic of Iran to provide them with 
information on measures taken to investigate the allegations contained in the joint 
study and if found true, to rectify the situation in compliance with international 
human rights norms and standards; to implement the related recommendations; and 
to provide any other relevant information.

<p>Alleged raid on and search of the home of human rights defender. According to the 
information received, on 3 October 2011 an armed contingent of sixty police 
officials from the states of Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh arrived in trucks at the 
home of Ms. Kavita Srivastava, National General Secretary of the People&#8223;s Union 
</p>
<p>for Civil Liberties (PUCL), in Jaipur city, Rajasthan. The police allegedly searched 
Ms. Srivastava&#8223;s home when she was not there, based on a search warrant which 
related to &#8220;a dangerous Naxalite&#8221;. It is reported that the police suspected that the 
</p>
<p>individual was sheltering in Ms. Srivastava&#8223;s home; however, they did not find any 
</p>
<p>evidence of this. The police allegedly attempted to push Ms. Srivastava&#8223;s elderly 
father and also harassed two domestic workers. It is further reported that police 
stopped her sister and her friend who were close to the house.

<p>Alleged imminent execution of Mr. Lo Zaniar (or Zanyar) Moradi and Mr. 
Loghman (or Loqman) Moradi. Mr. Zaniar (or Zanyar) Moradi and Mr. Loghman 
(or Loqman) Moradi, belonging to the Kurdish minority, were convicted of the 
charges of &#8220;enmity against God&#8221; (moharebeh) and &#8220;corruption on earth&#8221; for 
</p>
<p>allegedly murdering the son of a senior cleric in Marivan, Kordestan province, 
north-eastern Iran, on 4 July 2009. In addition they were also convicted of 
participating in armed activities of Komala, a Kurdish opposition group. They were 
sentenced to public hanging on 22 December 2010 by Branch 15 of the Tehran 
Revolutionary Court. On 12 October 2011, the Supreme Court upheld the 
convictions. It is alleged that both men were coerced into confessing to the offense 
of murder after being tortured for 25 days and that during interrogation Mr. Zaniar 
Moradi was subjected to lashing, vulgar insults and threatened with sexual 
violence. Reportedly these individuals have been targeted for arrest and execution 
on the grounds of their Kurdish ethnicity and political activism conducted by them 
or their family members.

Alleged impact on human rights compliance and accountability for human rights 
violations of proposed new legislation and recent domestic court decisions.  
According to the information received, although the Status of Forces Agreement 
between the United States and Iraq will expire on 31 December 2011, some U.S. 
private military and security companies will remain in the country.  The legal 
status and accountability of PMSCs in Iraq and elsewhere is unclear.  The Civilian 
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, which would extend United States jurisdiction 
over PMSC employees that commit certain crimes while working for the United 
States abroad, contains a carve-out for authorised intelligence activities that 
undermines the possibility of comprehensive criminal accountability for PMSC 
employees involved in serious human rights violations.  Also according to 
information received, several recent United States court cases directly relate to, or 
potentially affect, contractor accountability: Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, 
Minneci v. Pollard, Al-Quraishi v. Nakhla, Al Shimari v. CACI, Saleh v. Titan and 
Mohamed v. Jeppeson Dataplan.

November 2011, Mr. Azamjon Formonov was subjected to beatings and ill-
treatment while in detention at the 64/71 Special Regime Colony to force him to 
write a letter concerning his treatment while in detention. Other members of 
HRSU, Messrs. Nasim Isakov, Alisher Karamatov and Gaybullo Jalilov, continue 
to be detained and have allegedly been subjected to ill-treatment as well while in 
detention. Mr. Zafar Rahimov remains in detention since being imprisoned in 
October 2007.  Mr. Khabibilla Okpulatov remains in detention since 2005 and his 
sentence was extended in August 2009 before he was due to be released. Mr. 
Azamjon Formonov and Mr. Alisher Karamatov were the subjects of previous 
communications (see A/HRC/4/37/Add.1 paras 715 &amp; 719). Mr. Gaybullo Jalilov

Alleged dire social and economic conditions of the Attawapiskat First Nation, 
northern Ontario, Canada, and the alleged poor living conditions in aboriginal 
reserves. According to the information received, many of the Attawapiskat First 
Nation live in unheated shacks or trailers, with no running water, posing severe 
problems in light of the impending harsh winter. Reportedly, the Government of 
Canada has agreed to provide emergency housing in Attawapiskat to address the 
crisis situation. However, this assistance has allegedly been made contingent on 
third party management of funds, which the Attawapiskat First Nation rejects as 
not being responsive to their needs.  The Band also reportedly continue to suffer 
from the effects of a number of disasters, including an oil spill in 1979 that 
destroyed the public schools and a massive sewage flood in 2009, allegedly caused 
by a DeBeers diamond mine located on Attawapiskat traditional lands. First 
Nations communities are reportedly systematically underfunded as compared to 
non-Aboriginal towns, and the federal government allegedly maintains a 2% cap 
on spending increases for core services for Aboriginal peoples and cities.

<p>Alleged trial of human rights defender on charges of l&#232;se majest&#233;. According to the 
information received, on 30 April 2011, Mr. Somyot Prueksakasemsuk, human 
rights defender and magazine editor, was arrested at Aranyaprathet district, Sa 
Kaeo Province, and charged with contravening the l&#232;se majest&#233; law. His arrest 
came only five days after he held a press conference in Bangkok launching a 
campaign to collect 10,000 signatures to petition for a parliamentary review of the 
l&#232;se majest&#233; law or Section 112 of the Thai Criminal Code. He was reportedly 
detained in Bangkok Special Prison and transferred to Sa Kaeo Provincial Court on 
12 November 2011. On 1 November 2011, his fourth bail request was denied. 
Different venues in different parts of Thailand, and different judges, have been 
allocated for the remainder of the hearing which will allegedly place an undue 
burden on Mr. Prueksakasemsuk. Mr. Prueksakasemsuk was the subject of a 
previous communication (see A/HRC/19/44, case no THA 5/2011).

<p>Alleged arrest, detention and launching of criminal proceedings against lawyers in 
the context of anti-terrorism operations. According to the information received, on 
22 November 2011, 39 lawyers and one legal worker were arrested in the scope of 
an operation aiming at dismantling an alleged terrorist network known as the 
Kurdish Communities Union (KCK), an organisation believed to be the &#8220;urban 
branch&#8221; of the armed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The lawyers were 
</p>
<p>reportedly taken into custody in Istanbul for their alleged membership in KCK 
under charges of &#8220;membership of an illegal organisation&#8221; and &#8220;directing an illegal 
</p>
<p>organization&#8221;. The police had reportedly raided their offices and houses, searched 
</p>
<p>and confiscated their files and made copies of their hard drives

<p>Allegation of increased tension between the Government and the Judiciary, which 
culminated on 16 January 2012 in the arrest and detention of the Chief Judge of the 
Criminal Court. According to the information received, Mr. Abdulla Mohamed 
was arbitrarily arrested in violation of the procedures established by the law and 
was reportedly held incommunicado until 20 January 2012. The Government has 
publicly explained the arrest as a consequence of the inability or unwillingness of 
the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) to take disciplinary action against judge 
Mohamed and therefore guarantee the accountability of judges in general. 
However legitimate may be the concerns over the effective functioning of the JSC, 
the behaviour of some judges and the situation of the judiciary as a whole, this 
does not authorize in any way resorting to unlawful arrest and detention, as in the 
case of Mr. Mohamed.

<p>Alleged excessive use of force during peaceful demonstrations. According to the 
information received, on 22 December 2011, police and internal security forces 
violently dispersed a peaceful demonstration taking place at Khartoum University 
where students gathered in support of Manaseer, an ethnic group that was forcibly 
displaced by the construction of the Merowe dam. On 25 December 2011, a sit-in 
to protest the 22 December violence also met with the excessive use of force by the 
police. Police forces reportedly used teargas and batons and further injured 
numerous demonstrators. 70 students were reportedly arrested during the 25 
December sit-in. On 30 December 2011, Mr. Taj Alsir Jaafar, a student activist, 
was arrested by security forces in Khartoum, presumably for participating in 
student protests from mid-December 2011 into January 2012. On 25 January 2012, 
six members of the student-led movement Girifna were arrested after taking part in 
a public forum on human rights.

<p>Alleged threats against and harassment of a human rights defender and her

of the Human Rights Alliance of Uzbekistan, has been subjected to threats and 
harassment, including alleged irregularities in judicial proceedings against her, 
since appearing on a Russian television programme on 24 April 2011 in which she 
spoke about the harsh living conditions of pensioners and disabled persons in 
Uzbekistan. In connection with the alleged unfair trials, she has been ordered to 
pay several fines, as a result of which she has been forced to sell her house, and she 
has  reportedly had a travel ban imposed on her. Furthermore, it is reported that 
some of her family members have left the country due to the harassment which 
they faced, and other relatives have also allegedly been subjected to harassment.

Democratic Party (MDP). According to the information received, on 7 and 8 
February 2012, following the resignation of Mr. Mohamed Nasheed as President of 
the Maldives, supporters of his party demonstrated in protest. Law enforcement 
authorities reportedly used excessive force to quash such protests. Several 
demonstrators were injured, and a number were detained. At the time of drafting 
the urgent appeal, several individuals remained in detention or under house arrest.

<p>Alleged police harassment of two human rights defenders and confiscation of 
strictly confidential information on alleged human rights violations. According to 
the information received, Messrs. Anton Ryhzov and Igor Kalyapin are both 
affiliated with the Interregional Committee against Torture and the Joint Mobile 
Group, a coalition of human rights defenders who travel to Chechnya on a rotating 
basis in order to investigate allegations of torture and enforced disappearances. On 
21 January 2012, Mr. Anton Ryzhov was reportedly detained for several hours by 
the Nizhny Novgorod transport police. During his detention, it is alleged that he 
was questioned about his human rights work and photographed. Strictly 
confidential information on alleged human rights violations was confiscated. On 18 
January 2012, Mr. Igor Kalyapin was reportedly informed that the Chechen special 
police forces had submitted a request to the Chechen investigative authorities for a 
criminal case to be opened against him for the alleged disclosure of State secrets.

<p>Alleged arrest and deportation of a journalist. According to the information 
received, on 9 February 2012, Mr. Hamza Kashgari was arrested at Kuala Lumpur 
International Airport following the issue of an arrest warrant by the Saudi Arabian 
authorities. Mr. Kashgari is a journalist for Al-Belad (The Country), a newspaper 
owned by the Saudi Arabian Government, and a blogger. He was allegedly held in 
detention in the Travel Control Section in the Bukit Aman area of Kuala Lumpur. 
Prior to his arrest he had reportedly fled Saudi Arabia after accusations of apostasy 
were made against him in relation to an online post he had made concerning the 
Prophet Mohammed. On 12 February 2012, he was allegedly deported from 
Malaysia to Saudi Arabia and has since remained in detention in Riyadh. Despite 
publicly repenting and declaring himself a Muslim, Mr. Kashgari is reportedly at 
serious risk of being charged with blasphemy and consequently receiving a death 
sentence as a result of his post on Twitter.

<p>Alleged threat to the enjoyment of human rights by Australia&#8223;s indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities, in particular the right to equality and non-discrimination, following 
the proposed adoption of the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2012. 
According to information received, the Bill (third reading) extends the uniform 
alcohol bans and alcohol management regimes within so-called &#8220;alcohol protected 
areas&#8221; within Northern Territory communities (Sections 27).  The Social Security 
bill extends measures enabling compulsory income management of Centrelink 
recipients in certain circumstances (Schedule 1). The bill also extends the 
Government&#8223;s Improving School Enrolment and Attendance through Welfare 
Reform Measure (SEAM) initiative, which allows for the suspension or 
cancellation of certain categories of Centrelink payments for lack of compliance 
with a notice relating to the school enrolment or attendance. The Stronger Futures 
Bill introduces &#8220;special measures&#8221; to allow the Commonwealth to amend Northern 
Territory legislation regarding leasing in Aboriginal community living areas and 
town camps (Part 3). In addition, there have reportedly been insufficient 
consultations with affected indigenous communities throughout the process of 
drafting the Stronger Futures Bills.

<p>Alleged religion and ethnicity based violence by Boko Haram in northern Nigeria. 
According to the information received, Boko Haram had engaged in a series of 
attacks and bombings targeted on churches, Christians and the security forces since 
Christmas Day 2011. Boko Haram also allegedly imposed on the Christians and 
southerners a three-day deadline to leave the north on 1 January 2012. After the 
deadline, Boko Haram continued to launch attacks and showed a total disregard for 
human life in different parts of northern Nigeria. At least 185 people died in an 
attack in Kano on 20 January 2012. The latest attack on 26 February 2012, at Jos 
headquarters of the Church of Christ in Nigeria denomination (COCIN) reportedly 
killed three people and injured 37.

Alleged declining health of detained human rights defender on hunger strike. 
According to the information received, Mr. Abdulhadi Alkhawaja, former 
Protection Coordinator of Front Line, the International Organization for the 
Protection of Human Rights Defenders, as well as the former President of the 
Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), currently detained at the central prison 
of Bahrain, has begun a hunger strike on 8 February 2012. His health is reportedly 
rapidly declining. Mr. Alkhawaja does not receive intravenous therapy IV fluids 
anymore due to the actual weakness of his veins, and finds himself in a life 
threatening situation.  Mr. Alkhawaja was the subject of previous communications 
(see A/HRC/19/44, case no. BHR 17/2011 and BHR 18/2011; A/HRC/18/51, case 
no. BHR 4/2011, BHR 5/2011 and BHR 9/2011).

<p>Allegation that new media laws still limit the rights to freedom of opinion and 
expression. According to the information received, despite some of the positive 
changes, such as the rulings of the Constitutional Court of the Republic Hungary 
on the media legislation, adopted on 19 December 2011, and the amendments, 
made by the Parliament of the Republic of Hungary on 7 March 2011, the Law on 
the Freedom of the Press and the Fundamental Rules on Media Content (Act CIV 
of 2010) and the Media Services and Mass Media Act (Act CLXXXV of 2010) 
(the &#8220;Media Law&#8221;) reportedly remain problematic with regard to the press freedom 
and the right to freedom of expression and opinion in Hungary due to certain 
issues, such as inadequate safeguards for the independence and impartiality of the 
regulatory authority, legal uncertainty, as well as disproportionate and unnecessary 
regulatory interventions and sanctions.
