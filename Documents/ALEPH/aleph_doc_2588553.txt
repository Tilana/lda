NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1.      Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
   
Organization and Principles of Consolidation
     
We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and
production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Our operations are focused
primarily on large scale, onshore liquids-rich resource plays in the United States. Our principal
areas of operation are the Anadarko and Arkoma basins of Oklahoma, the Williston Basin of
North Dakota, the Uinta Basin of Utah and the Maverick and Gulf Coast basins of Texas. In
addition, we have oil developments offshore China.
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Newfield Exploration Company, a
Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. We proportionately consolidate our interests in oil and
natural gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships in accordance with industry
practice. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unless
otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, all references in these notes to “Newfield,”
“we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” are to Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries.
These unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect, in the opinion of our management, all
adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly state our
financial position as of, and results of operations, for the periods presented. These financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and, therefore,
do not include all disclosures required for financial statements prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP). Interim
period results are not necessarily indicative of results of operations or cash flows for a full year.
These consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with our
audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
  
Risks and Uncertainties
As an independent oil and natural gas producer, our revenue, profitability and future rate of
growth are substantially dependent on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs.
Historically, the energy markets have been very volatile, and there can be no assurance that
commodity prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. A substantial or extended
decline in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results
of operations, cash flows, access to capital and on the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL
reserves that we can economically produce. Other risks and uncertainties that could affect us in
the current commodity price environment include, but are not limited to, counterparty credit risk for
our receivables, responsibility for decommissioning liabilities for offshore interests we no longer
own, access to credit markets, regulatory risks and ability to meet financial ratios and covenants
in our financing agreements.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires our management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities;
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period; and the quantities and values of
proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves used in calculating depletion and assessing
impairment of our oil and gas properties. Actual results could differ significantly from these
estimates. Our most significant estimates are associated with the quantities of proved oil, natural
gas and NGL reserves, the timing and amount of transfers of our unevaluated properties into our
amortizable full cost pool, the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and the fair value of our
derivative contracts.
Restructuring Costs
Restructuring costs include severance and related benefit costs, costs associated with
abandoned office space, employee relocation costs and other associated costs. Employee
severance and related benefit costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the required
service period, if any. Employee relocation costs are expensed as incurred. On the date a leased
property ceases to be used, a liability for non-cancellable office-lease costs associated with
restructuring is recognized and measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. Fair
value estimates include assumptions regarding estimated future sublease

(Unaudited)
payments. These estimates could materially differ from actual results and may require revision to
initial estimates of the liability. See Note 15, "Restructuring Costs," for additional disclosures.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years' reported amounts in order to conform to
the current year presentation. These reclassifications did not impact our net income (loss),
stockholders' equity or cash flows.
Restricted Cash
We have restricted cash of $20 million included in "Other assets" on our consolidated balance
sheet at June 30, 2016, as compared to $13 million at December 31, 2015, which represent
amounts held in escrow accounts to satisfy future plug and abandonment obligations for our
China operations. These amounts are restricted as to their current use and will be released as we
plug and abandon wells and facilities in China. Consistent with our other plug and abandonment
activities, changes in restricted cash are included in cash flows from operating activities in our
consolidated statement of cash flows.
New Accounting Requirements
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance regarding the
simplification of employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the
statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance in the second
quarter of 2016 as permitted by the guidance. Adoption of this guidance did not impact our
financial statements, except for the simplification in accounting for income taxes using a modified
retrospective approach. Recognition of previously unrecognized excess tax benefits related to
stock-based compensation created a deferred tax asset of $37 million. As we consider it more
likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, we recorded a full valuation
allowance of $37 million. We elected to continue our current policy of estimating forfeitures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance regarding the accounting for leases. The guidance
requires recognition of most leases on the balance sheet. The guidance requires lessees and
lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using
a modified retrospective approach. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on
our financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance regarding several broad topics related to the
recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. The guidance is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the
impact of this guidance on our financial statements.
In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding disclosures of uncertainties about an
entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The guidance applies prospectively to all entities,
requiring management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the
aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern
and disclose certain information when substantial doubt exists. We will adopt this guidance for
the annual period ending December 31, 2016.
In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding the accounting for revenue from contracts with
customers. In April and May 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance, addressed
implementation issues and provided technical corrections. The guidance may be applied
retrospectively or using a modified retrospective approach to adjust retained earnings (deficit).
The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15,
2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.

3.      Inventories
     
Inventories primarily consist of tubular goods and well equipment held for use in our oil and
natural gas operations and oil produced but not sold in our China operations. At June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the crude oil inventory from our China operations consisted of
approximately 7,000 and 335,000 barrels of crude oil, respectively.
4.      Derivative Financial Instruments
     
Commodity Derivative Instruments
     
We utilize derivative strategies that consist of either a single derivative instrument or a
combination of instruments to manage the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted
sale of our future domestic oil and natural gas production. While the use of derivative instruments
may limit or partially reduce the downside risk of adverse commodity price movements, their use
also may limit future income from favorable commodity price movements.
In addition to the derivative strategies outlined in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, we also utilize swaptions from time to time. A swaption is an option to
exercise a swap where the buyer (counterparty) of the swaption purchases the right from the
seller (Newfield), but not the obligation, to enter into a fixed-price swap with the seller on a
predetermined date (expiration date). The swap price is a fixed price determined at the time of the
swaption contract. If the swaption is exercised, the contract will become a swap treated consistent
with our other fixed-price swaps.
Our oil and gas derivative contracts are settled based upon reported prices on the NYMEX. The
estimated fair value of these contracts is based upon various factors, including closing exchange
prices on the NYMEX, over-the-counter quotations, estimated volatility, non-performance risk
adjustments using credit default swaps and time to maturity. The calculation of the fair value of
options requires the use of an option-pricing model. See Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements.”

For the volumes with sold puts, if the market prices remain below our sold puts at contract
settlement, we will receive the market price plus the following:
•the difference between our floors and our sold puts for collars with sold puts; or
•the difference between our swaps and our sold puts for fixed-price swaps with sold puts.
We have effectively locked in the spreads noted above (less the deferred call premium) for a
portion of the volumes with sold puts through the use of purchased calls.

We deferred the premiums related to the purchased calls until contract settlement. At June 30,
2016, the deferred premiums totaled $19 million.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)
(Unaudited)
The use of derivative transactions involves the risk that the counterparties, which generally are
financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. Our
derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual
counterparty, and we have netting arrangements with all of our counterparties that provide for
offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative instruments with that
counterparty. At June 30, 2016, 10 of our 16 counterparties accounted for approximately 85% of
our contracted volumes, with the largest counterparty accounting for approximately 12%.
At June 30, 2016, approximately 85% of our volumes subject to derivative instruments are with
lenders under our credit facility. Our credit facility, senior notes and substantially all of our
derivative instruments contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those
debt and derivative instruments in certain situations.
5.      Fair Value Measurements
     
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The
authoritative guidance requires disclosure of the framework for measuring fair value and requires
that fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
Level
1:
Level
2:
Level
3:
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for
identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. We consider active markets as those in which
transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide
pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or
indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. This category includes those
derivative instruments that we value using observable market data. Substantially all of these
inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the derivative
instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at
which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category include
non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter commodity fixed-price swaps
and certain investments.
Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to
the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e., supported by
little or no market activity). Level 3 instruments primarily include derivative instruments, such
as commodity options (i.e., price collars, sold puts, purchased calls or swaptions) and other
financial investments.
•
Our valuation models for derivative contracts are primarily industry-standard models (i.e., Black-
Scholes) that consider various inputs including: (a) forward prices for commodities, (b) time
value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual
prices for the underlying instruments.
•
Our valuation model for the Stockholder Value Appreciation Program (SVAP) was a Monte Carlo
simulation that was based on a probability model and considers various inputs including: (a) the
measurement date stock price, (b) time value and (c) historical and implied volatility.
Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair
value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and
liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
The determination of the fair values of our derivative contracts incorporates various factors, which
include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit
standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash
deposits, letters of credit and priority interests), if any. We utilize credit default swap values to
assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to, and receivables
from, counterparties.

During the second quarter of 2016, we transferred $46 million of derivative option contracts out
of the Level 3 hierarchy. The transfer was the result of our Level 3 swaptions being exercised
by the counterparties as swaps in June 2016.
Qualitative Disclosures about Unobservable Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measurements
Derivatives.  Our valuation models for Level 3 derivative contracts are primarily industry-standard
models that consider various factors, including certain significant unobservable inputs such as
volatility factors and counterparty credit risk. The calculation of the fair value of our option
contracts requires the use of an option-pricing model. The estimated future prices are compared
to the strike prices fixed by our derivative contracts, and the resulting estimated future cash
inflows or outflows over the contractual life are discounted to calculate the fair value. These
pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future
price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates. Significant increases (decreases) in
the quoted forward prices for commodities generally lead to corresponding decreases (increases)
in the fair value measurement of our oil and gas derivative contracts. Significant changes in the
volatility factors utilized in our option-pricing model can cause significant changes in the fair
value measurement of our oil and gas derivative contracts. Historically, we have not experienced
significant changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts resulting from changes in
counterparty credit risk as the counterparties for all of our derivative transactions have an
“investment grade” credit rating. See Note 4, "Derivative Financial Instruments," for additional
discussion of our derivative instruments.
 
Stock-Based Compensation. The calculation of the fair value of the SVAP liability required the
use of a probability-based Monte Carlo simulation, which included unobservable inputs. The
simulation predicted multiple scenarios of future stock returns over the performance period, which
were discounted to calculate the fair value. The fair value was recognized over a service period
derived from the simulation. The SVAP performance period and program ended December 31,
2015.

At June 30, 2016, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of
$43.14 per barrel for oil and $2.24 per MMBtu for natural gas, adjusted for market differentials.
Using these prices, our ceiling for the U.S. did not exceed the net capitalized costs of oil and gas
properties resulting in a ceiling test impairment. Our U.S. ceiling test impairment was
approximately $501 million ($501 million after tax due to a full valuation allowance on related
deferred tax assets) for the three months ended June 30, 2016. For the six months ended
June 30, 2016, we recorded U.S. ceiling test impairments of approximately $962 million ($962
million after tax due to a full valuation allowance on related deferred tax assets).
Using SEC pricing, our ceiling for China at June 30, 2016 did not exceed the net capitalized
costs of oil and gas properties, resulting in a ceiling test impairment for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 of approximately $21 million ($21 million after tax due to a full valuation allowance
on related deferred tax assets). For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded China
ceiling test impairments of approximately $66 million ($66 million after tax due to a full valuation
allowance on related deferred tax assets).
Further declines in SEC pricing or downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves could
result in additional ceiling test impairments of our oil and gas properties in subsequent periods.
Anadarko Basin Acquisition
On June 30, 2016, we acquired additional properties in the Anadarko Basin STACK play for an
adjusted cash purchase price of $490 million. The purchase price is subject to customary post-
close adjustments and is pending the outcome of pre-acquisition contingencies associated with
title matters. We also assumed asset retirement obligations of $8 million. At June 30, 2016,
approximately $460 million was allocated to unproved properties and wells in progress and $38
million was allocated to proved oil and gas properties.

Due to the ceiling test impairments of our oil and gas properties in 2015, we moved from a

the continuation of current commodity price levels, we consider it more likely than not that the
related tax benefits will not be realized and therefore, we have a valuation allowance on

our domestic and China deferred tax assets. These valuation allowances recorded in 2016
significantly reduced our effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30,

As of June 30, 2016, we did not have a liability for uncertain tax positions, and as such, we did
not accrue related interest or penalties. The tax years 2011 through 2015 remain open to

Credit Arrangements
     
In March 2016, we entered into the fifth amendment to our Credit Agreement. This amendment
changed certain definitions related to our financial covenants and decreased our interest rate
coverage ratio from 3.0:1.0 to 2.5:1.0. Our borrowing capacity remains at $1.8 billion and the
facility maturity date remains June 2020. We incurred approximately $3 million of financing costs
related to this amendment, which were included in "Interest expense" on our consolidated
statement of operations. As of June 30, 2016, the largest individual loan commitment by any
lender was 12% of total commitments.

NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)
(Unaudited)
During the first quarter of 2016, our debt rating was downgraded by rating agencies, and as a
result, our borrowing costs under the credit facility increased by 50 basis points. In addition, our
available borrowing capacity (before any amounts drawn) under our money market lines of credit
with various institutions, the availability of which is at the discretion of those financial institutions,
was reduced from $195 million at December 31, 2015 to $160 million at March 31, 2016. Our
available borrowing capacity related to our money market lines of credit was further reduced to
$135 million during the second quarter of 2016. This borrowing capacity is subject to compliance
with restrictive covenants in our credit facility.
Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, equal to (a) a rate per annum equal to
the higher of the prime rate announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or the
weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the
Federal Reserve System during the last preceding business day plus 50 basis points, plus a
margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating (125 basis points per annum at June 30, 2016) or
(b) the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating
(225 basis points per annum at June 30, 2016).
Under our credit facility, we pay commitment fees on available but undrawn amounts based on a
grid of our debt rating (42.5 basis points per annum at June 30, 2016). We incurred aggregate
commitment fees under our credit facility of approximately $2 million and $4 million for the three
and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, which were recorded in “Interest
expense” on our consolidated statement of operations. For the three and six months ended June
30, 2015,
we incurred commitment fees under our credit facility of approximately $1 million and $2 million,
respectively.
Our credit facility has restrictive financial covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total
debt to book capitalization not to exceed 0.6 to 1.0 and the maintenance of a ratio of earnings
before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes and noncash
items (such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, unrealized gains and losses on
commodity derivatives and ceiling test impairments) to interest expense of at least 2.5 to 1.0. At
June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
As of June 30, 2016, we had no letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility. Letters of
credit are subject to a fronting fee of 20 basis points and annual fees based on a grid of our debt
rating (225 basis points at June 30, 2016).     
 
The credit facility includes events of default relating to customary matters, including, among other
things, nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts; violation of covenants; inaccuracy of
representations and warranties in any material respect when made; a change of control; or
certain other material adverse changes in our business. Our senior notes also contain standard
events of default. If any of the foregoing defaults were to occur, our lenders under the credit facility
could terminate future lending commitments, and our lenders under both the credit facility and our
notes could declare the outstanding borrowings due and payable. In addition, our credit facility,
senior notes and substantially all of our derivative arrangements contain provisions that provide
for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and derivative instruments in certain situations.
Senior Subordinated Notes
In April 2015, we redeemed our $700 million aggregate principal amount of 6⅞% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2020. In connection with the redemption, we paid a premium of $24
million. The premium was recorded under the caption "Other income (expense) — Other, net" on
our consolidated statement of operations. In addition, associated unamortized offering costs and
discounts of approximately $8 million were charged to interest expense during the second quarter
of 2015 as a result of the redemption.
11.    Commitments and Contingencies
In May 2015, a lawsuit was filed against the Company alleging certain plugging and
abandonment predecessor-in-interest liabilities related to offshore assets sold by the Company in
2010. The lawsuit alleges damages of approximately $23 million. The Company has responded
to the petition, denied the allegations and is vigorously defending the case. The court has held
that the Company must bear a "portion" of the plugging and abandonment costs, but the "exact
percentage" of such costs should be determined in arbitration. The court case is stayed pending
arbitration. An estimate of reasonably possible losses, if any, cannot be made at this time.
We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other
disputes, all arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as (a) claims from royalty owners
for disputed royalty payments, (b) commercial disputes, (c) personal injury claims and (d) property
damage claims. Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be

predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
12.      Stockholders' Equity Activity
     
During the first quarter of 2016, we issued 34.5 million additional shares of common stock
through a public equity offering. We received net proceeds of approximately $776 million, a
portion of which was used to repay borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of
credit. The remainder was used for other corporate purposes, which included the acquisition of
additional properties in the Anadarko Basin STACK play.
During the first quarter of 2015, we issued 25.3 million additional shares of common stock
through a public equity offering. We received net proceeds of approximately $815 million, which
were used primarily to repay all borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of
credit that were outstanding at that time.

The effect of unvested restricted stock awards or restricted stock units and stock options has
not been included in the calculation of shares outstanding for diluted EPS for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Had we
recognized net income for the quarter, incremental shares attributable to the assumed vesting
of unvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units and the assumed exercise of
outstanding stock options would have increased diluted weighted-average shares outstanding
by 1.6 million and 1.3 million shares for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
respectively, and 1.5 million and 1.4 million shares for the three and six months ended
(1)
June 30, 2015, respectively.

As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately $63 million of total unrecognized stock-based
compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation awards that vest within
four years. On June 30, 2016, the last reported sales price of our common stock on the New York
Stock Exchange was $44.18 per share.
Equity Awards
Equity awards consist of service-based and performance- or market-based restricted stock
awards and restricted stock units, stock options and stock purchase options under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). At June 30, 2016, we had approximately (1) 5.7 million shares
available for issuance under our 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan, as amended (2011 Plan), if all future
awards are stock options, or (2) 3 million shares available for issuance under our 2011 Plan if all
future awards are restricted stock awards or restricted stock units.

In February 2016, we granted approximately 436,000 shares of restricted stock units, which
based on achievement of certain performance criteria, could vest within a range of 0% to 200%
of shares granted.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. During the first six months of 2016, options to purchase
approximately 60,000 shares of our common stock were issued under our ESPP. The fair value
of each option was $9.20 per share. The fair value of the options granted was determined using
the Black-Scholes option valuation method assuming no dividends, a risk-free interest rate of
0.47%, an expected life of six months and weighted-average volatility of 47.9%.
Stock Options. As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately 190,000 stock options outstanding
and exercisable. No stock options have been granted since 2008, except for ESPP options as
discussed above.

Liability Awards
Liability awards consist of performance awards that are settled in cash instead of shares, as
discussed below.
Cash-Settled Restricted Stock Units. The value of the cash-settled restricted stock units, and the
associated stock-based compensation expense, is based on the Company's stock price at the
end of each period. As of June 30, 2016, we had a liability of $22 million for future cash
settlement upon vesting of awards. The following table provides information about cash-settled

15. Restructuring Costs
In May 2016, we announced plans to consolidate and reorganize domestic operating functions to
our headquarters in The Woodlands, Texas, which will result in a significant reduction of
employees located in the Tulsa, Oklahoma office. Our decision to restructure the organization
was primarily in response to the current oil and gas commodity price environment. Substantially
all restructuring-related costs are expected to be incurred by the end of 2016. We will abandon
our Tulsa, Oklahoma office space during the fourth quarter of 2016 and record a liability for the
remaining contracted payments net of expected sublease income.
In April 2015, we announced plans to combine our onshore Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain
business units into our newly created Western Region, which is managed from The Woodlands,
Texas. Our decision to restructure the organization, which only affected our domestic business,
was primarily in response to the oil and gas commodity price environment. Substantially all
restructuring-related costs were incurred by December 31, 2015. We abandoned our Denver,
Colorado office space during the third quarter of 2015 and recorded a loss for the remaining
contracted payments net of expected sublease income. We closed our North Houston
(Greenspoint area) office in the first quarter of 2016.
Restructuring costs recorded in our consolidated statement of operations are set forth below.

16.Segment Information
While we only have operations in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, we are
organizationally structured along geographic operating segments. Our current operating
segments are the United States and China. The accounting policies of our operating segments
are the same as those described in Note 1, “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
The following tables provide the geographic operating segment information for the three and six-
month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Income tax allocations have been determined
based on statutory rates in the applicable geographic segment. Our income tax allocation of our
China operations is based on the combined statutory rates for China and the United States.

On August 2, 2016, we entered into agreements with two separate purchasers to divest
substantially all of our assets in Texas for combined cash proceeds of approximately $390
million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The sales of our Texas assets will not
significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, and as such,
all proceeds will be recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool with no gain or loss
recognized. We expect both transactions to close in the third quarter of 2016.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
     
We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and
production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Our operations are focused primarily
on large scale, onshore liquids-rich resource plays in the United States. Our principal areas of
operation are the Anadarko and Arkoma basins of Oklahoma, the Williston Basin of North
Dakota, the Uinta Basin of Utah and the Maverick and Gulf Coast basins of Texas. In addition, we
have oil developments offshore China.
Significant second quarter 2016 highlights include:
•
additional properties acquired in the Anadarko Basin STACK play for an adjusted purchase
price of $490 million;
•
consolidation of our Tulsa regional office to our headquarters in The Woodlands, Texas
announced in an effort to improve business and cost efficiencies;
•
total consolidated production increased 9% to 15.1 MMBOE compared to the second quarter of
2015, and total domestic production increased 11% to 13.5 MMBOE compared to the second
quarter of 2015;
•
Anadarko Basin production was 7.6 MMBOE in the second quarter of 2016, up 53% over the
same period of 2015 and 7% over the first quarter of 2016. Anadarko Basin crude oil production
increased 64% over the second quarter of 2015;
•
domestic lease operating expense was $3.42 per BOE, a 25% improvement compared to the
second quarter of 2015; and
•
crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts generated realized income of $64 million for the
second quarter of 2016.
All consolidated and domestic BOE calculations above exclude natural gas produced and
consumed in operations of 1.3 Bcf for the second quarter of 2016 and 1.9 Bcf for the second
quarter of 2015.
Results of Operations            
Domestic Revenues and Production. Revenues during the second quarter of 2016 were $61
million lower than the same period of 2015. The lower revenues were primarily attributable to a
25% decrease in average realized prices. We increased our domestic liquids production by 7%
and gas production by 16% compared to the second quarter of 2015, reducing the impact of lower
commodity prices by $2 million and $11 million, respectively. Our increased domestic liquids
production resulted from an increase in NGL production of 41%, partially offset by a decrease in
crude oil production of 5%. Our Anadarko Basin oil, gas and NGL production increased by 64%,
47% and 51%, respectively. Williston Basin production increased by 8% primarily due to the
results of our drilling program and reduced flare volumes. Production in our other domestic basins
declined or remained flat as compared to the second quarter of 2015 due to reduced drilling in
those areas.
Revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $129 million lower than the same
period of 2015. The lower revenues were attributable to a 29% decrease in average realized
prices compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. We increased our domestic liquids
production by 11% and gas production by 18% compared to 2015, reducing the impact of lower
commodity prices by $33 million and $26 million, respectively. Our Anadarko Basin oil, gas and
NGL production increased by 67%, 47% and 43%, respectively. Williston Basin production
increased by 14% primarily due to the results of our drilling program and reduced flare volumes.
Production in our other domestic basins declined or remained flat as compared to 2015 due to
reduced drilling in those areas.
China Revenues and Production/Liftings. Revenues during the second quarter of 2016 were $27
million lower than the same quarter of 2015 primarily due to a 27% decrease in the realized crude
oil price. Lifted volumes remained flat period over period.
Revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $24 million lower than the same
period of 2015, primarily due to a 35% decrease in the realized crude oil price. China liftings for
the first six months of 2016 were 723 MBbls higher than the comparable period of 2015 primarily
due to six months of production in 2016 from the Pearl field, which achieved peak production
levels in May 2015.

Domestic Operations. The primary components within our operating expenses are as follows:
•
Lease operating expense decreased 17% despite an 11% increase in total production. On a per
BOE basis, lease operating expense was 25% lower due to our focused growth in the Anadarko
Basin, which has significantly lower operating costs than our other basins. Additionally, there
was a reduction of lease operating expense per BOE across all basins due to our focus on cost-
reduction initiatives combined with downward service cost pressures in the industry as a result
of a lower commodity price environment.
•
Transportation and processing expense per BOE increased 15% primarily due to increased
natural gas and NGL volumes in our SCOOP and STACK plays. Second quarter 2016 gas
production from these two plays increased 47% compared to the second quarter of 2015, while
NGL production increased 51%. Additionally, oil transportation costs increased in the Williston
Basin due to new pipeline marketing agreements in the second half of 2015. These pipeline
agreements allow us to transport oil to more favorable markets and thus receive a higher net
price.
•
Production and other taxes decreased 39% per BOE due to lower revenue. As a percent of total
revenue, production and other taxes were 3.6% and 4.4% for the three months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. Our 2016 rate is lower as our development has been focused in
areas with lower taxes due to horizontal well credits.
27
•
Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) decreased 45% on a per BOE basis primarily
due to the impact of non-cash ceiling test impairments during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.
We expect a further decrease in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of the impairment recorded
in the second quarter of 2016.
General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased 14% during the second quarter of 2016
compared to the second quarter of 2015. Severance and related benefit costs associated with
our reduction in workforce and restructuring were $12 million during the three months ended
June 30, 2016 as compared to $5 million during the same period of 2015. Stock-based
compensation expense was higher during the second quarter of 2016, due to a fair value
decrease for awards under our Stockholder Value Appreciation Program during the second
•
quarter of 2015. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we capitalized $19 million of direct
internal costs as compared to $17 million during the comparable quarter of 2015. This increase
in capitalization of costs is primarily due to the increase in stock-based compensation.
•
During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a ceiling test impairment of $501 million due to
a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves. The primary reason for the
change in value was a 7% decrease in both crude oil and natural gas SEC pricing since March
31, 2016. These commodity price decreases were partially offset by the impact of current service
cost reductions in reserve estimates. During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a ceiling
test impairment of $1.5 billion due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved
reserves. The primary reason for the change in value was a 13% decrease in both crude oil and
natural gas SEC pricing since March 31, 2015, partially offset by the impact of service cost
reductions in reserve estimates.
China Operations. The primary components within our operating expenses are as follows:
•
On a per BOE basis, lease operating expense was 10% lower primarily related to Pearl field cost
reductions from renegotiated contracts, combined with lower production handling fees resulting
from lower crude oil prices.
•
DD&A expense per BOE decreased by 18% primarily due to the impact of non-cash ceiling test
impairments during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.
•
During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a non-cash ceiling test impairment of $21
million due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves. The primary reason
for the change in value was a 7% decrease in crude oil SEC pricing since March 31, 2016.

gas production from these two plays increased 47% compared to the same period of 2015, while
NGL production increased 43%. Additionally, oil transportation costs increased in the Williston
Basin due to new pipeline marketing agreements initiated in the second half of 2015. These
pipeline agreements allow us to transport oil to more favorable markets and thus receive a
higher net price.
•
Production and other taxes decreased 39% per BOE due to lower total revenues. As a percent of
total revenue, production and other taxes were 3.8% and 4.4% for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The lower rate in 2016 was due to development in areas with
lower production taxes due to horizontal well credits.
29
•
Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased 46% on a per BOE basis primarily due to
the impact of non-cash ceiling test impairments during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. We
expect a further decrease in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of the impairment recorded in
the second quarter of 2016.
•
General and administrative expenses decreased 10% during the first six months of 2016
compared to the first six months of 2015. Employee-related expenses were approximately $13
million lower due to a reduction of headcount and lower severance costs as compared to the six
months ended June 30, 2015. In addition, stock-based compensation expense decreased due to
a reduction of the number of awards outstanding. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we
capitalized $36 million of direct internal costs as compared to $42 million during the comparable
period of 2015. This decrease in capitalization of costs is consistent with the decrease in stock-
based compensation and lower development activity in 2016.
•
During the first six months of 2016, we recorded non-cash ceiling test impairments of $962
million due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves. The decrease
primarily resulted from a 14% decrease in both crude oil and natural gas SEC pricing since
December 31, 2015. These commodity price decreases were partially offset by the impact of
current service cost reductions in reserve estimates. During the first six months of 2015, we
recorded a non-cash ceiling test impairment of $2.3 billion due to a net decrease in the
discounted value of our proved reserves. The decrease in 2015 primarily resulted from a 25%
decrease in crude oil SEC pricing and a 22% decrease in natural gas SEC pricing since
December 31, 2014. These commodity price decreases were partially offset by the impact of
service cost reductions in reserve estimates. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2015, we
recorded a $4 million rig impairment associated with our decision to indefinitely lay down both of
our company-owned drilling rigs in the Uinta Basin.
China Operations. The primary components within our operating expenses are as follows:
•
On a per BOE basis, lease operating expense was 12% lower primarily due to higher production
volumes, cost reductions in our Pearl field from renegotiated contracts and lower production
handling fees resulting from lower crude oil prices.
•
DD&A expense per BOE decreased by 9% primarily due to the impact of the non-cash ceiling
test impairments during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.
•
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded non-cash ceiling test impairments of
$66 million due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves. The primary
reason for the change in value was a 14% decrease in crude oil SEC pricing since December
31, 2015.

Gross interest expense decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, as
compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to the redemption of
our 6⅞% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 in April 2015. This decrease was partially offset
by the additional interest expense associated with our $700 million 5⅜% Senior Notes due 2026
issued in March 2015 and $3 million of financing costs related to the fifth amendment to our
Credit Agreement in 2016.
Capitalized interest increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to
the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, due to an increase in the average amount of
unproved oil and gas properties.

Commodity Derivative Income (Expense). The fluctuations in commodity derivative income
(expense) from period to period are due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and changes
in our outstanding derivative instruments during these periods. The amount of unrealized gain
(loss) on derivatives is the result of the change in the total fair value of our derivative positions
from the prior period.
Three months ended June 30, 2016
The $133 million loss recognized in “Commodity derivative income (expense)” in our
consolidated statement of operations related to our derivative financial instruments is comprised
of a $64 million realized gain and a $197 million unrealized loss. The components of the change

Taxes. The effective tax rates for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were (1.4)%
and 36.7%, respectively. Our effective tax rate for both periods was different than the federal
statutory rate of 35% due to the change in valuation allowances, non-deductible expenses, state
income taxes, the differences between international and U.S. federal statutory rates, and the
impact of our China earnings being taxed both in the U.S. and China. Our future effective tax
rates may also be impacted by additional ceiling test impairments or other items which generate
deferred tax assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and/or reversal of such valuation
allowances. The following table summarizes our tax activity that derives our effective tax rate for

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, crude oil prices declined significantly primarily due to
global supply and demand imbalances. Crude oil prices continued to decline in 2015 and
remained depressed in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to periods prior to the fourth
quarter of 2014. Given the future uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of an eventual
recovery of crude oil prices, our planned capital spending for 2016 was reduced from 2015 levels
to reduce deficit spending and preserve long-term liquidity.
During the first six months of 2016, as a part of our strategy to optimize long-term liquidity, we
issued 34.5 million additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering and
received net proceeds of approximately $776 million. A portion was used to repay borrowings
under our credit facility and money market lines of credit. The remainder was used for general
corporate purposes, which included the acquisition of additional properties in the Anadarko Basin
STACK play. We use cash flows from operations to fund our capital budget.
Our updated 2016 capital budget, excluding estimated capitalized interest and direct internal
costs of approximately $100 million, is expected to be approximately $700 million - $750 million.
Actual capital expenditure levels may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling
results; oil, natural gas and NGL prices; industry conditions; the prices and availability of goods
and services; and the extent to which properties are acquired or non-strategic assets are sold. We
continue to screen for attractive
32
acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable. We
believe we have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our capital expenditures to
changes in circumstances or fluctuations in our cash flows.
We continuously monitor our liquidity needs, coordinate our capital expenditure program with our
expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluate our available
alternative sources of liquidity, including selling non-strategic assets or potentially accessing debt
and equity capital markets in light of current and expected economic conditions. We believe that
our liquidity position and ability to generate cash flows from our operations will be adequate to
fund 2016 operations and continue to meet our other obligations. We may from time to time seek
to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other
debt or equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or
otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions,
our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may
be material.
Credit Arrangements and Other Financing Activities. In March 2016, we entered into the fifth
amendment to our Credit Agreement. This amendment changed certain definitions related to our
financial covenants and decreased our interest rate coverage ratio from 3.0:1.0 to 2.5:1.0. Our
borrowing capacity remains at $1.8 billion and the facility maturity date remains June 2020. We
incurred approximately $3 million of financing costs related to this amendment, which were
included in "Interest expense" on our consolidated statement of operations. At June 30, 2016, we
had available borrowing capacity (before any amounts drawn) under our money market lines of
credit of $135 million, which was reduced from $195 million at December 31, 2015 due to the
downgrading of our debt rating by rating agencies during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
At June 30, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding under our money market lines of credit, no
borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and no letters of credit outstanding
under our credit facility.
We have no scheduled maturities of senior notes until 2022. For a more detailed description of
the terms of our credit arrangements and senior notes, see Note 10, “Debt,” to our consolidated
financial statements appearing earlier in this report.
As of July 28, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings and available borrowing capacity of $1.8
billion under our revolving credit facility, and cash and cash equivalents of $174 million. As of
July 28, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings under our money market lines of credit and
available capacity of $135 million.
Working Capital. Our working capital balance fluctuates primarily as a result of the timing and
amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements, changes in the fair value of
our outstanding commodity derivative instruments as well as the timing of receiving
reimbursement of amounts paid by us for the benefit of joint venture partners. Without the effects
of commodity derivative instruments, we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively
small amount of positive working capital. At June 30, 2016, we had negative working capital of
$19 million compared to negative working capital of $22 million at December 31, 2015.
Cash Flows from Operations. Our primary source of capital and liquidity is cash flows from
operations, which are primarily affected by the sale of our oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as
commodity prices, net of the effects of derivative contract settlements and changes in working
capital.
Our net cash flows from operations were $378 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
which decreased compared to net cash flows from operations of $577 million for the same period
in 2015. The primary driver of lower operating cash flows was lower revenues as a result of lower
commodity prices.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 was $945 million compared to $898 million for the same period in 2015.
Cash used for capital expenditures in the first six months of 2016 was approximately $49 million
higher than the same period in 2015. This increase is due to our Anadarko Basin acquisition,
offset by our planned reductions in 2016 capital spending due to the current economic
environment for our industry. For a more detailed description of the Anadarko Basin acquisition,
see Note 6, “Oil and Gas Properties,” to our consolidated financial statements appearing earlier in
this report.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 was $727 million compared to $349 million for the same period in 2015.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we issued 34.5 million additional shares of common
stock through a public equity offering and received net proceeds of approximately $776 million, a
portion of which was used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and money
market lines of credit. The remainder was used for general corporate purposes, which included
the acquisition of additional properties in the Anadarko Basin STACK play.
33
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we received net proceeds of $815 million through
the issuance of 25.3 million additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering,
which were used to repay all borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit.
In addition, we received proceeds of $691 million through the issuance of senior notes, which we
used to redeem $700 million of senior subordinated notes.
Capital Expenditures. Our capital investments for the first six months of 2016 increased 28%
compared to the same period of 2015. The table below summarizes our capital investments.

Ceiling Test Impairment
We recorded non-cash ceiling test impairments for the first and second quarters of 2016 for both
the U.S. and China due to the ceiling not exceeding the net capitalized costs of oil and gas
properties. At June 30, 2016, the ceiling value for our reserves was calculated based upon SEC
pricing of $43.14 per barrel of oil and $2.24 per MMBtu for natural gas, adjusted for market
differentials. It is difficult to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of expected future
impairments given the many factors impacting the ceiling test calculation including, but not limited
to, future pricing, operating and development costs, upward or downward reserve revisions,
reserve adds, and tax attributes. Subject to these numerous factors and inherent limitations, we
believe that impairments in the third quarter of 2016 could exceed $100 million based on the
current forward strip pricing for crude oil and natural gas. Once recorded, a ceiling test impairment
is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase. Further declines in SEC
pricing or downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves could result in additional ceiling
test impairments of our oil and gas properties in subsequent periods.
Restructuring
In April 2015 and May 2016, we announced plans to restructure our organization primarily in
response to the current commodity price environment and to improve margins, processes and
cost efficiencies in operations. See Note 15, "Restructuring Costs," to our consolidated financial
statements in Item 8 of this report for additional details regarding our restructuring activities.
Contractual Obligations
We have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations. For further
information, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations - Contractual Obligations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes to the disclosure since year-end
2015.
Commitments under Joint Operating Agreements. Most of our properties are operated through
joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements. Typically, the operator under a joint
operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint
venture partners. Through the joint operating agreement, the non-operators reimburse, and in
some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the
operator. These obligations are typically shared on a “working interest” basis. The joint operating
agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non-operator does not satisfy its share of the
contractual obligations. Occasionally, the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement
to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the
non-operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses, frequently without any
identification as to the long-term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses.
Oil and Gas Derivatives
     
We use derivative contracts to manage the variability in cash flows caused by commodity price
fluctuations associated with our anticipated oil and gas production for the next 24 to 36 months.
As of June 30, 2016, we had no outstanding derivative contracts related to our NGL production.
We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes.
34
For a further discussion of our derivative activities, see "Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices" in Item
3 of this report. See the discussion and tables in Note 4, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” and
Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” to our consolidated financial statements appearing earlier in
this report for additional information regarding the accounting applicable to our oil and gas
derivative contracts, a listing of open contracts and the estimated fair market value of those
contracts as of June 30, 2016.
Between July 1, 2016 and July 28, 2016, we entered into additional natural gas derivative
contracts. A listing of all our natural gas derivative contracts as of July 28, 2016 follows:

During the third quarter of 2016, we sold natural gas swaption contracts that, if exercised on
their expiration date in the fourth quarter of 2016, would protect 4,530 MMMBtus of November
2016 through March 2017 production from future commodity price volatility. These contracts
give the counterparties the option to enter into swap contracts with us at $3.75 per MMBtu for
production in the above period.
Accounting for Derivative Activities. As our derivative contracts are not designated for hedge
accounting, they are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. We have in the past experienced,
and are likely in the future to experience non-cash volatility in our reported earnings during
periods of commodity price volatility. As of June 30, 2016, we had net derivative assets of $71
million, of which 52%, based on total contracted volumes, was measured based upon a modified
Black-Scholes valuation model and, as such, were classified as a Level 3 fair value
measurement. The model considers various inputs including the following:
•forward prices for commodities;
•time value;
•volatility factors;
•counterparty credit risk; and
•current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments.
As a result, the value of these contracts at their respective settlement dates could be significantly
different than their fair value as of June 30, 2016. We use credit default swap values to assess the
impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from
counterparties. See “— Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Commodity Derivative
Activities” in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
and Note 4, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” and Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” to our
consolidated financial statements appearing earlier in this report for additional discussion of the
accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts.

New Accounting Requirements
See Note 1, “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated
financial statements in Item 1 of this report for a discussion of new accounting requirements.
Forward-Looking Information
This report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (Exchange Act). All statements, other than statements of historical facts included in this
report, are forward-looking, including information relating to anticipated future events or results,
such as planned capital expenditures, the availability and sources of capital resources to fund
capital expenditures, estimates of reserves, projected production, estimates of operating costs,
planned exploratory or developed drilling, projected cash flows and liquidity, business strategy
and other plans and objectives for future operations. Forward-looking statements are typically
identified by use of terms such as “may,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,”
“project,” “target,” “goal,” “plan,” “should,” “will,” “predict,” “potential” and similar expressions that
convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Although we believe that the expectations
reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, this information is based upon
assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks. Actual
results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including but not limited
to, the following:
•oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices;
•environmental liabilities that are not covered by an effective indemnity or insurance;
•legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity;
•the timing and our success in discovering, producing and estimating reserves;
•sustained decline in commodity prices resulting in impairments of assets;
•
•
•
•ability to develop existing reserves or acquire new reserves;
•the availability and volatility of the securities, capital or credit markets and the cost of capital;
•maintaining sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and business strategies;
the accuracy of and fluctuations in our reserves estimates due to sustained low commodity
prices, incorrect assumptions and other causes;
•operating hazards inherent in the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas;
•general economic, financial, industry or business trends or conditions;
the impact of, and changes in, legislation, law and governmental regulations, including those
related to hydraulic fracturing, climate change, seismicity and over-the-counter derivatives;
•land, legal, regulatory, and ownership complexities inherent in the U.S. oil and gas industry;
•the impact of regulatory approvals;
the ability and willingness of current or potential lenders, derivative contract counterparties,
customers and working interest owners to fulfill their obligations to us or to enter into transactions
with us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us;
the prices and quantities of commodities reflected in our commodity derivative arrangements as
compared to the actual prices or quantities of commodities we produce or use;
the volatility, instrument terms and liquidity in the commodity futures and commodity and
financial derivatives markets;
•drilling risks and results;
•the prices and availability of goods and services;
•
•
36
•the cost and availability of drilling rigs and other support services;
•global events that may impact our domestic and international operating contracts, markets and
•
prices;
our ability to monetize non-strategic assets, repay or refinance our existing indebtedness and the
impact of changes in our investment ratings;
•labor conditions;
•weather conditions;
•competitive conditions;
•terrorism or civil or political unrest in a region or country;
•electronic, cyber or physical security breaches;
•changes in tax rates;
•inflation rates;
•the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures;
•the price and availability of, and demand for, competing energy sources;

the other factors affecting our business described under the caption “Risk Factors” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
•
Should one or more of the risks described above occur, or should underlying assumptions prove
incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-
looking statements.
All forward-looking statements in this report, as well as all other written and oral forward-looking
statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their
entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this section and elsewhere in this report. These
factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could affect us. Use caution and
common sense when considering these forward-looking statements. Unless securities laws
require us to do so, we do not undertake any obligation to publicly correct or update any forward-
looking statements whether as a result of changes in internal estimates or expectations, new
information, subsequent events or circumstances or otherwise.
Commonly Used Oil and Gas Terms
Below are explanations of some commonly used terms in the oil and gas business and in this
report.
Barrel or Bbl.    One stock tank barrel or 42 U.S. gallons of liquid volume.
Basis risk.    The risk associated with the sales point price for oil or gas production varying from
the reference (or settlement) price for a particular derivative transaction.
Bcf.    Billion cubic feet.
BOE.    One barrel of oil equivalent determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one
barrel of crude oil or condensate, or 42 gallons for NGLs.
Btu.    British thermal unit, which is the heat required to raise the temperature of a one-pound
mass of water from 58.5 to 59.5 degrees Fahrenheit.
Development well.    A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of
a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
37
Exploration well.    A well drilled to find a new field or new reservoir. Generally, an exploratory
well is any well that is not a development well, an extension well, a service well or a stratigraphic
test well.
Field.    An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to
the same individual geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition.
Liquids. Crude oil and NGLs.
Liquids-rich.    Formations that contain crude oil or NGLs instead of, or as well as, natural gas.
MBbls.    One thousand barrels of crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons.
MBOE.    One thousand barrels of oil equivalent.
Mcf.    One thousand cubic feet of natural gas.
MMBOE.    One million barrels of oil equivalent.
MMBtu.    One million Btus.
MMMBtu.    One billion Btus.
NGL.    Natural gas liquid. Hydrocarbons which can be extracted from wet natural gas and

consist primarily of ethane, propane, butane and natural gasolines.
NYMEX.    The New York Mercantile Exchange.
Proved reserves.    Those quantities of oil and natural gas, which by analysis of geoscience and
engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible –
from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions,
operating methods and government regulations — prior to the time at which contracts providing
the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain,
regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The
project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably
certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
SCOOP.    South-Central Oklahoma Oil Province. A field in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma in
which we operate.
SEC pricing.    The unweighted average first-day-of-the-month commodity price for crude oil
(WTI) or natural gas (NYMEX) for the prior 12 months. The SEC provides a complete definition of
the pricing methodology in their guidance “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting.”

Oklahoma in which we operate.
Working interest.    The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and
conduct operating activities on the property and a share of production, and requires the owner to
pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations.
WTI.    West Texas Intermediate, a grade of crude oil commonly used as a benchmark in oil
pricing.
38
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices, interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below.
Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices
     
Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to enter into derivative contracts is
based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. While the use of derivative
contracts can limit or reduce the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may
limit future benefits from favorable price movements. In addition, the use of derivative contracts
may involve basis risk. All of our derivative transactions have been carried out in the over-the-
counter market. The use of derivative contracts also involves the risk that the counterparties,
which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such
transactions. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to
any individual counterparty. At June 30, 2016, 10 of our 16 counterparties accounted for
approximately 85% of our contracted volumes with the largest counterparty accounting for
approximately 12%.
As of June 30, 2016, of our remaining expected 2016 crude oil production, 14,352 MBbls were
protected against price volatility using collars and swaps, over 52% of which have associated
sold puts. The sold puts limit our downward price protection below the weighted average of our
sold puts of $74.63 per barrel. If the market price remains below $74.63 per barrel, we receive the
market price for our associated production plus the difference between our sold puts and the
associated floors or fixed-price swaps, which averages $15.35 per barrel. For 7,544 MBbls of our
2016 volumes, we have locked in an average minimum premium of $14.15 over the market price
using purchased calls. The weighted average strike price of the purchased calls approximates
the weighted average strike price of the sold puts, thereby effectively locking in the value. As of
June 30, 2016, of our expected 2017 crude oil production, 12,753 MBbls were protected against
price volatility using collars and swaps, over 51% of which have associated sold puts. The sold
puts limit our downward price protection below the weighted average price of our sold puts of
$73.83 per barrel. If the market price remains below $73.83 per barrel, we receive the market
price for our associated production plus the difference between our sold puts and the associated
floors or fixed-price swaps, which averages $15.06 per barrel. For 6,548 MBbls of our 2017
volumes, we have locked in an average minimum premium of $13.54 over the market price using
purchased calls.
For a further discussion of our derivative activities, see the discussion and tables in Note 4,
“Derivative Financial Instruments,” and Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” to our consolidated
financial statements appearing earlier in this report. For further discussion of the types of
derivative positions, refer to Note 4, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” within Item 8 of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Interest Rates
We consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because 100% of our obligations were at
fixed rates as of June 30, 2016. A 10% increase in LIBOR would not impact our interest costs on
debt outstanding as of June 30, 2016, but would decrease the fair value of our outstanding debt,
as well as increase interest costs associated with future debt issuances or borrowings under our
revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
     
The functional currency for our China operations is the U.S. dollar. To the extent that business
transactions in a foreign country are not denominated in the U.S. dollar, we are exposed to
foreign currency exchange risk. We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate
movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial. We did not have any open derivative
contracts related to foreign currencies at June 30, 2016.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
     
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-
15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Our disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to ensure that the information required to
be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
39
communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based
upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
     
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, of our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred
during the second quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based upon our evaluation, there
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
PART II
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other
disputes, all arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as (a) claims from royalty owners
for disputed royalty payments, (b) commercial disputes, (c) personal injury claims and (d) property
damage claims. Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with
certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, cash flows or results of operations.
In addition, from time to time we receive notices of violation from governmental and regulatory
authorities in areas in which we operate related to alleged violations of environmental statutes or
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. We cannot predict with certainty whether these
notices of violation will result in fines or penalties, or if such fines or penalties are imposed, that
they would individually or in the aggregate exceed $100,000. If any fines or penalties are in fact
imposed that are greater than $100,000, or we expect to be greater than $100,000, then we will
disclose such fact in our subsequent filings. For a further discussion of our legal proceedings, see
Note 11, "Commitments and Contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements appearing
earlier in this report.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
The following risk factor updates, and should be considered in addition to, the risk factors
previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Other than the risk factor discussed below, there have been no material changes with respect to
the risk factors previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity in Oklahoma and
elsewhere could increase our costs of compliance or lead to operational delays, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We
dispose of large volumes of water produced alongside oil and natural gas “produced water” in
connection with our drilling and production operations, pursuant to permits issued to us by
governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued
under existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change, which could
result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting
requirements, owing to, among other things, concerns of the public or governmental authorities
regarding such gathering or disposal activities.
There exists a growing concern that the injection of produced water into belowground disposal
wells triggers seismic events in certain areas, including Oklahoma and Texas, where we operate.
In response to these concerns, regulators in some states are pursuing initiatives designed to
impose additional requirements in the permitting and operating of produced water disposal wells
or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For
example, Oklahoma has taken numerous regulatory actions in response to concerns related to
the operation of produced water disposal wells and induced seismicity. Oklahoma has adopted a
“traffic light” system, wherein the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) reviews new or
existing disposal wells for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in
determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or
not permitted. In September 2014, the OCC adopted rules for operators of produced water
disposal wells in certain seismically-active areas, or Areas of Interest, requiring operators to
monitor and record well pressure and injected volume on a daily basis and further requiring
operators of wells permitted for disposal of 20,000 barrels per day or more of produced water to
conduct more frequent mechanical integrity testing. On March 25, 2015, the Oklahoma
Corporation Commission’s Oil and Gas Conservation Division (OGCD) issued a directive,
expanding the Areas of Interest for induced seismicity. Under the new directive, operators of 347
disposal wells located within the expanded Areas of Interest of the Arbuckle formation were given
until April 2015 to demonstrate that their wells were not disposing into or in communication with
40
the crystalline basement rock. Operators of wells in contact or communication with the basement
rock were required to reduce the depth of, or “plug back,” those wells or, alternatively, to reduce
disposal volume by 50 percent. On July 17, 2015, the OGCD issued another directive, further
expanding the covered area to include an additional 211 disposal wells. Under this second
directive, operators were given until August 2015 to prove that they were not injecting below the
Arbuckle formation or, as necessary, to plug back those wells in contact or communication with
the crystalline basement rock, without the option of reducing disposal volume by 50 percent. The
OGCD imposed further reductions on oil and natural gas wastewater disposal well volume in a
prescribed area of northern Oklahoma County and southern Logan County in August 2015,
requiring operators to reduce disposal volumes for affected wells by approximately 38 percent
below 2014 reported volumes, within a specified 60-day period. OGCD imposed additional
restrictions on wells in Fairview County in January 2016, requiring that all disposal wells located
within 3.5 miles of a seismic event’s epicenter reduce injection volumes by 50 percent and 25
percent for wells within 10 miles of the event’s epicenter. The OGCD has also begun imposing
additional testing requirements on wells located within 15 miles of an event’s epicenter.
Additional regulatory action in this area is likely, and the Oklahoma legislature has introduced
new legislation to expand the OCC’s authority to address concerns related to disposal wells and
induced seismicity. Furthermore, following increased seismic activity in February 2016, the
OGCD released a wastewater volume reduction plan. The plan calls for the operators of over 240
injection wells to reduce underground wastewater injections. The plan covers more than 5,200
square miles in northwest Oklahoma, which is near our operations, and seeks reductions of more
than 500,000 barrels of wastewater per day. Implementation of the plan will be phased in during
2016. Additionally, in recent years there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged
potential for hydraulic fracturing to induce seismic events, among other allegations. For example,
in July 2016, the OCC announced an investigation of all oil and gas activity, not solely injection
or disposal wells, in the Blanchard, Oklahoma area in response to recent seismic activity there.
In Texas, in 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission (TRC) published a new rule governing
permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that would require, among other things, the
submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal
well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal
area in question. If a permittee or a prospective permittee fails to demonstrate that the produced
water or other fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a
disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the TRC may
deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that
well.
Restriction on the volumes permissible for injection or a lack of alternative waste disposal sites,
or curtailment or restrictions on oil and gas activity generally, could cause us to delay, curb or
discontinue our exploration and development plans. Increased costs associated with restrictions
on hydraulic fracturing or the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of
complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal or hydraulic fracturing, such as
mandated produced water recycling in some portion or all of our operations or prohibitions on
performing hydraulic fracturing in certain areas, may reduce our profitability. These developments
may result in additional levels of regulation, or increased complexity and costs with respect to
existing regulations, that could lead to operational delays or increased operating and compliance
costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash
flows or financial condition.
