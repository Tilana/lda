<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 11/1 of 17 June 2009 on the Open-
ended Working Group on an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
to provide a communications procedure,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> General Assembly resolution 64/146 of 18 December 2009 on the 
rights of the child,  
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 33 (p) of General Assembly resolution 64/146, in which 
the Assembly called upon States to ensure that child-sensitive procedures were made 
available to children and their representatives so that children had access to means of 
facilitating effective remedies for any breaches of any of their rights arising from the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child through independent advice, advocacy and complaint 
procedures, including justice mechanisms, and that their views were heard when they were 
involved or their interests were concerned in judicial or administrative procedures in a 
manner consistent with the procedural rules of national law,  
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with interest</i> general comment No. 5 (2003) of the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, in which the Committee emphasized that children&#8217;s special and dependent 
status creates real difficulties for them in pursuing remedies for breaches of their rights, and 
general comment No. 12 (2009), in which the Committee stated that the right of all children

<p><b>2</b> GE.10-12214 
</p>
<p>to be heard and taken seriously constitutes one of the fundamental values of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the view of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, expressed by its 
Chairperson in her oral report to the General Assembly at its sixty-third session, that the 
development of a communications procedure for the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
would significantly contribute to the overall protection of children&#8217;s rights, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Takes note</i> of the report on its first session, held in Geneva from 16 to 18 
December 2009, of the Open-ended Working Group established under Human Rights 
Council resolution 11/1 to explore the possibility of elaborating an optional protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child to provide a communications procedure 
complementary to the reporting procedure under the Convention (A/HRC/13/43); 
 2. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Open-ended Working Group until the 
seventeenth session of the Council, and also decides that the Open-ended Working Group 
shall meet for up to 10 working days and report to the Council not later than at its 
seventeenth session;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also decides</i> to mandate the Open-ended Working Group to elaborate an 
optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to provide a communications 
procedure and, in this regard, requests the Chairperson of the Open-ended Working Group 
to prepare a proposal for a draft optional protocol, taking into account the views expressed 
and inputs provided during the first session of the Working Group in December 2009 and 
giving due regard to the views of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and, where 
appropriate, to the views of relevant United Nations special procedures and other experts, to 
be circulated by September 2010 in all the official languages of the United Nations, so that 
the draft may be used as a basis for the forthcoming negotiations; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Further decides</i> to invite a representative of the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child to attend the meetings of the Open-ended Working Group as a resource person 
and, where appropriate, relevant United Nations special procedures and other relevant 
independent experts; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to update and publish the report of the Secretary-General on the comparative 
summary of existing communications and inquiry procedures and practices under 
international human rights instruments and under the United Nations system, published on 
22 November 2004 (E/CN.4/2005/WG.23/2), and to present that report to the Council at its 
fifteenth session;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General and the Office of the High Commissioner to 
continue to provide the Open-ended Working Group with the assistance necessary for the 
fulfilment of its mandate, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 64/245 of 24 
December 2009 on special subjects relating to the proposed programme budget for the 
biennium 2010&#8211;2011.
