<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 8/13, the Human Rights Council requested the Advisory Committee 
to formulate a draft set of principles and guidelines for the elimination of discrimination 
against persons affected by leprosy and their family members. The Council also requested 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to hold 
a meeting to exchange views among relevant actors, including Governments, observers of 
the United Nations, relevant United Nations bodies, specialized agencies and programmes, 
non-governmental organizations, scientists, medical experts, as well as representatives of 
persons affected by leprosy and their family members, on measures to eliminate 
discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members.  
</p>
<p>2. At its first session, the Advisory Committee designated Shigeki Sakamoto to 
formulate the draft set of principles and guidelines. Mr. Sakamoto was invited to participate 
in the meeting organized by OHCHR on 15 January 2009.  
</p>
<p>3. At its third session, the Advisory Committee endorsed the draft set of principles and 
guidelines prepared by Mr. Sakamoto, taking into account the report of OHCHR on the 
above-mentioned meeting (A/HRC/10/62), and submitted it to the Council for consideration 
at its twelfth session.  
</p>
<p>4. In its resolution 12/7, the Council requested OHCHR to collect the views on the 
draft set of principles and guidelines of relevant actors, including Governments, observers 
of the United Nations, relevant United Nations bodies, specialized agencies and 
programmes, non-governmental organizations, scientists and medical experts, as well as 
representatives of persons affected by leprosy and their family members, and to make those 
views available to the Advisory Committee. It also requested the Committee to finalize the 
draft set of principles and guidelines for submission to the Council by its fifteenth session, 
taking into full consideration the views of the above-mentioned relevant actors.  
</p>
<p>5. The revised draft set of principles and guidelines for the elimination of 
discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members 
(A/HRC/AC/5/2) was presented by Mr. Sakamoto to the Advisory Committee at its fifth 
session. At the same session, taking into account the comments received from Committee 
members and other participants during the debate, the draft set of principles and guidelines 
was endorsed by the Committee, as orally revised, and annexed to recommendation 5/3. It is 
submitted to the Council, as an annex to the present document, for consideration by the 
Council at its fifteenth session. </p>


<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Principles and guidelines for the elimination of 
discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their 
family members 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Principles 
</b></p>
<p>1. Persons affected by leprosy and their family members should be treated as people 
with dignity and are entitled, on an equal basis with others, to all the human rights and 
fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as 
in other relevant international human rights instruments to which their respective States are 
parties, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities.   
</p>
<p>2. Persons affected by leprosy and their family members should not be discriminated 
against on the grounds of having or having had leprosy.  
</p>
<p>3. Persons affected by leprosy and their family members should have the same rights as 
everyone else with respect to marriage, family and parenthood. To this end: 
</p>
<p> (a) No one should be denied the right to marry on the grounds of leprosy; 
</p>
<p> (b) Leprosy should not constitute a ground for divorce; 
</p>
<p> (c) A child should not be separated from his or her parents on the grounds of 
leprosy. 
</p>
<p>4. Persons affected by leprosy and their family members should have the same rights as 
everyone else in relation to full citizenship and obtaining identity documents. 
</p>
<p>5. Persons affected by leprosy and their family members should have the right to serve 
the public, on an equal basis with others, including the right to stand for elections and to 
hold office at all levels of government. 
</p>
<p>6. Persons affected by leprosy and their family members should have the right to work 
in an environment that is inclusive and to be treated on an equal basis with others in all 
policies and processes related to recruitment, hiring, promotion, salary, continuance of 
employment and career advancement. 
</p>
<p>7. Persons affected by leprosy and their family members should not be denied 
admission to or be expelled from schools or training programmes on the grounds of leprosy. 
</p>
<p>8. Persons affected by leprosy and their family members are entitled to develop their

</p>
<p>9. Persons affected by leprosy and their family members have the right to be, and 
should be, actively involved in decision-making processes regarding policies and 
programmes that directly concern their lives. </p>


<p><b> II. Guidelines 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. General 
</b></p>
<p>1.1 States should promote, protect and ensure the full realization of all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all persons affected by leprosy and their family members without 
discrimination on the grounds of leprosy. To this end, States should: 
</p>
<p> (a) Take all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures to modify, 
repeal or abolish existing laws, regulations, policies, customs and practices that 
discriminate directly or indirectly against persons affected by leprosy and their family 
members, or that forcefully or compulsorily segregate and isolate persons on the grounds of 
leprosy in the context of such discrimination; 
</p>
<p> (b) Ensure that all authorities and institutions take measures to eliminate 
discrimination on the grounds of leprosy by any person, organization or private enterprise. 
</p>
<p>1.2 States should take all appropriate measures to achieve for persons affected by 
leprosy and their family members the full realization of all the rights enshrined in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights instruments to 
which they are party, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>1.3 In the development and implementation of legislation and policies and in other 
decision-making processes concerning issues relating to persons affected by leprosy and 
their family members, States should consult closely with and actively involve persons 
affected by leprosy and their family members, individually or through their respective local 
and national organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Equality and non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>2.1 States should recognize that all persons are equal before and under the law and are 
entitled, without any discrimination, to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law. 
</p>
<p>2.2 States should prohibit all discrimination on the grounds of a person having or having 
had leprosy, and should guarantee equal and effective legal protection to persons affected 
by leprosy and their family members. 
</p>
<p>2.3 Specific measures which are necessary to achieve de facto equality of persons 
affected by leprosy and their family members shall not be considered as discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Women, children and other vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>3.1 In many societies, leprosy has a significantly adverse impact on women, children 
and other vulnerable groups. States should therefore pay special attention to the promotion 
and protection of the human rights of women, children and members of other vulnerable 
groups who have or have had leprosy, as well as their family members. 
</p>
<p>3.2 States should promote the full development, advancement and empowerment of 
women, children and members of other vulnerable groups who have or have had leprosy, as 
well as their family members. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Home and family 
</b></p>
<p> States should, where possible, support the reunification of families separated in the 
past as a result of policies and practices relating to persons diagnosed with leprosy. </p>


<p><b> 5. Living in the community and housing  
</b></p>
<p>5.1 States should promote the enjoyment of the same rights for persons affected by 
leprosy and their family members as for everyone else, allowing their full inclusion and 
participation in the community. 
</p>
<p>5.2 States should identify persons affected by leprosy and their family members living 
in isolation or segregated from their community because of<b> </b>their disease, and should give 
them social support. 
</p>
<p>5.3 States should enable persons affected by leprosy and their family members to choose 
their place of residence and should ensure that they are not obliged to accept a particular 
living arrangement because of their disease. 
</p>
<p>5.4 States should allow any persons affected by leprosy and their family members who 
were once forcibly isolated by State policies in effect at the time to continue to live in the 
leprosariums and hospitals that have become their homes, if they so desire. In the event that 
relocation is unavoidable, the residents of these places should be active participants in 
decisions concerning their future. States should, however, improve living conditions in 
those leprosariums and hospitals. With due regard to the wishes of the persons affected by 
leprosy and their family members, and with their full participation, States should also 
design, promote and implement plans for the gradual integration of the residents of such 
places in the community and for the gradual phasing out of such leprosariums and hospitals.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Participation in political life 
</b></p>
<p> States should ensure that persons affected by leprosy, and their family members, 
enjoy voting rights, the right to stand for election and the right to hold public office at all 
levels of government, on an equal basis with others. Voting procedures must be accessible, 
easy to use and adapted to accommodate any individuals physically affected by leprosy. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Occupation 
</b></p>
<p> States should encourage and support opportunities for self-employment, the 
formation of cooperatives and vocational training for persons affected by leprosy and their 
family members, as well as their employment in regular labour markets. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. Education 
</b></p>
<p> States should promote equal access to education for persons affected by leprosy and 
their family members. 
</p>
<p><b> 9. Discriminatory language 
</b></p>
<p> States should remove discriminatory language, including the derogatory use of the 
term &#8220;leper&#8221; or its  equivalent in any language or dialect, from governmental publications 
and should revise expeditiously, where possible, existing publications containing such 
language. 
</p>
<p><b> 10. Participation in public, cultural and recreational activities 
</b></p>
<p>10.1 States should promote the equal enjoyment of the rights and freedoms of persons 
affected by leprosy and their family members, as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the international human rights instruments to which they are party, 
including, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. </p>


<p>10.2 States should promote access on an equal basis with others to public places, 
including hotels, restaurants and buses, trains and other forms of public transport for 
persons affected by leprosy and their family members. 
</p>
<p>10.3 States should promote access on an equal basis with others to cultural and 
recreational facilities for persons affected by leprosy and their family members. 
</p>
<p>10.4 States should promote access on an equal basis with others to places of worship for 
persons affected by leprosy and their family members. 
</p>
<p><b> 11. Health care 
</b></p>
<p>11.1 States should provide persons affected by leprosy at least with the same range, 
quality and standard of free or affordable health care as that provided for persons with other 
diseases. In addition, States should provide for early detection programmes and ensure 
prompt treatment of leprosy, including treatment for any reactions and nerve damage that 
may occur, in order to prevent the development of stigmatic consequences. 
</p>
<p>11.2 States should include psychological and social counselling as standard care offered 
to persons affected by leprosy who are undergoing diagnosis and treatment, and as needed 
after the completion of treatment.  
</p>
<p>11.3 States should ensure that persons affected by leprosy have access to free medication 
for leprosy, as well as appropriate health care. 
</p>
<p><b> 12. Standard of living 
</b></p>
<p>12.1 States should recognize the right of persons affected by leprosy and their family 
members to an adequate standard of living, and should take appropriate steps to safeguard 
and promote that right, without discrimination on the grounds of leprosy, with regard to 
food, clothing, housing, drinking water, sewage systems and other living conditions. States 
should: 
</p>
<p> (a) Promote collaborative programmes involving the Government, civil society 
and private institutions to raise funds and develop programmes to improve the standard of 
living;  
</p>
<p> (b) Provide or ensure the provision of education to children whose families are 
living in poverty by means of scholarships and other programmes sponsored by the 
Government and/or civil society; 
</p>
<p> (c) Ensure that persons living in poverty have access to vocational training 
programmes, microcredit and other means to improve their standard of living. 
</p>
<p>12.2 States should promote the realization of this right through financial measures, such 
as the following: 
</p>
<p> (a) Persons affected by leprosy and their family members who are not able to 
work because of their age, illness or disability should be provided with a government 
pension; 
</p>
<p> (b) Persons affected by leprosy and their family members who are living in 
poverty should be provided with financial assistance for housing and health care. 
</p>
<p><b> 13. Awareness-raising  
</b></p>
<p> States, working with human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations, 
civil society and the media, should formulate policies and plans of action to raise awareness 
throughout society and to foster respect for the rights and dignity of persons affected by </p>


<p>leprosy and their family members. These policies and plans of action may include the 
following goals: 
</p>
<p> (a) To provide information about leprosy at all levels of the education system, 
beginning with early childhood education affirming, inter alia, that leprosy is curable and 
should not be used as grounds for discrimination against persons who have or have had 
leprosy and their families;  
</p>
<p> (b) To promote the production and dissemination of &#8220;know your rights&#8221; material 
to give to all persons recently diagnosed with leprosy; 
</p>
<p> (c) To encourage the media to portray persons affected by leprosy and their 
family members with dignified images and terminology; 
</p>
<p> (d) To recognize the skills, merits and abilities of persons affected by leprosy 
and their contribution to society and, where possible, to<b> </b>support exhibitions of their artistic, 
cultural and scientific talents;  
</p>
<p> (e) To encourage creative persons, including artists, poets, musicians and 
writers, particularly those who have personally faced the challenges of leprosy, to make a 
contribution to awareness-raising through their specific talents;  
</p>
<p> (f) To provide information to social leaders, including religious leaders, on how 
addressing leprosy in their teachings or written materials may contribute to the elimination 
of discrimination against persons affected by the disease and their family members; 
</p>
<p> (g) To encourage higher education institutions, including medical schools and 
nursing schools, to include information about leprosy in their curricula, and to develop and 
implement a &#8220;train the trainer&#8221; programme and targeted educational materials; 
</p>
<p> (h) To promote implementation of the World Programme for Human Rights 
Education and to incorporate the human rights of persons affected by leprosy and their 
family members into the national human rights education programme of each State; 
</p>
<p> (i) To identify ways to recognize, honour and learn from the lives of individuals 
forcibly isolated by their Governments for having been diagnosed with leprosy, including 
oral history programmes, museums, monuments and publications; 
</p>
<p> (j) To support grass-roots awareness efforts to reach communities without 
access to traditional media. 
</p>
<p><b> 14. Development, implementation and follow-up to States&#8217; activities  
</b></p>
<p>14.1 States should consider creating or designating a committee to address activities 
relating to the human rights of persons affected by leprosy and their family members. The 
committee should ideally include individuals affected by leprosy and their family members, 
representatives of organizations of persons affected by leprosy, human rights experts, 
representatives from the human rights field and related fields, and representatives of 
government. 
</p>
<p>14.2 States are encouraged to include in their State party reports to the relevant treaty 
bodies the policies and measures that they have adopted and/or implemented with regard to 
the elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family 
members.
