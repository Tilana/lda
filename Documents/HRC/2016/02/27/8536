<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its ninth session from 1 to 12 November 
</p><p>2010.  The review of Lebanon was held at the 15th meeting on 10 November 2010. The 
delegation of Lebanon was headed by Ambassador William Habib, Secretary-General of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  At its 17th meeting held on 12 November 2010, the 
Working Group adopted the report on Lebanon. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Lebanon: Chile, Malaysia and Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Lebanon: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/LBN/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/LBN/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/LBN/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, 
Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Lebanon through the troika. These 
questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p>5. During the interactive dialogue, 49 delegations made statements.  A number of 
delegations thanked Lebanon for its constructive participation, openness and willingness to 
cooperate in the universal periodic review process and acknowledged Lebanon&#8217;s efforts in 
the promotion and protection of human rights and challenges the country faced. Active 
dialogue with civil society during the preparation of the national report was positively 
noted. Additional statements which could not be delivered during the interactive dialogue 
owing to time constraints are posted on the Extranet of the universal periodic review when 
available1 Recommendations made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the 
present report.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>6. In his opening remarks the head of delegation noted Lebanon&#8217;s commitment in the 
Constitution to the UDHR and its contribution to the drafting of this instrument.  He stated 
that the UPR was an effective tool to promote human rights globally.  At the national level, 
it stimulated efforts to develop conditions on the ground as well as self- criticism. 
</p>
<p>7. In preparing the national report, Lebanon had adopted an inclusive and consultative 
approach. It had been produced with contributions from focal points in all Ministries and 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Argentina, Chad, China, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Denmark, Ghana, Holy See, 
</p>
<p>Indonesia, Latvia, Mauritania, Nepal, Nigeria, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Slovenia, Sweden. </p>


<p>relevant bodies, compiled by a committee created by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The 
parliamentary committee for human rights and civil society was included in this process, 
reflecting Lebanon&#8217;s belief in partnerships with NGOs in promoting and protecting human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>8. Lebanon had a unique social and political composition reflecting its religious and 
cultural variety. Pope John Paul II had thus described it as more than a nation, indeed a 
message and a mission. This variety had been a source of wealth for Lebanon and 
represented the coexistence between different religions and cultures. Since independence in 
1943, Lebanon had a democratic parliamentary system with an active political life, where 
each element of the social fabric had its role in an atmosphere of liberty and freedom. 
</p>
<p>9. The pluralistic social reality had its challenges and difficulties. Lebanon had 
undergone many crises, leaving a difficult legacy. In addition to hosting numerous 
Palestinian refugees, it had been subject to a series of invasions and aggressions by Israel, 
which continued to impede the recovery of stability and made it difficult for the 
Government to fulfil its human rights obligations. This had resulted in a budget deficit and 
record public debt, resulting in high unemployment rates and the emigration of large 
numbers of Lebanese citizens. It did not however halt efforts to protect human rights and its 
accession to all core human rights treaties and several regional instruments. 
</p>
<p>10. Lebanon was currently at a critical stage. A National Action Plan for Human Rights 
was being elaborated by the parliamentary committee on human rights with the contribution 
of relevant Ministries, civil society and international organizations. Other efforts to develop 
effective and competent mechanisms to ensure the application of human rights standards 
and the provisions of the Action Plan included: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The establishment of a NHRI in line with the Paris Principles: A draft bill was under 
consideration by the Ministry of Justice. It included mechanisms for the prevention 
of terrorism in line with the provisions of OP-CAT. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The creation of an Ombudsman: A bill had been issued in 2005 and the Government 
was taking steps for an appointment. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The creation of an office of human rights in the Ministry of Interior and 
Municipalities, the Directorate General of the Internal Security Forces, and 
considerations concerning a department of human rights in the Ministry of Interior. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The establishment of a directorate general of human rights and public liberties in the 
Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The development of relations with international organizations, particularly OHCHR 
and its mechanisms. Lebanon had recently facilitated the visit of the Sub-Committee 
on the Prevention of Torture and was consulting with the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of slavery on a possible visit. 
</p>
<p>11. In response to advance questions, the head of delegation recalled that Lebanon had 
undergone many wars, the latest in June 2006, which had been the subject of a Council 
decision resulting in a report by the High-Level Commission of Inquiry. These wars had 
destabilized the country, damaged the infrastructure and led to involuntary disappearances, 
which had yet to be addressed. 
</p>
<p>12. Lebanon was determined to eradicate and prevent torture. It had acceded to OP-
CAT. Draft laws for the prevention of torture and the establishment of an independent 
national mechanism were under discussion. The Internal Security Forces had issued a 
memorandum for the establishment of a special commission for the monitoring of torture 
and detention centres. </p>


<p>13. As regards the jurisdiction of military courts, this had been expanded as a result of 
the prevailing security situation. 
</p>
<p>14. A Lebanese-Palestinian Dialogue Committee had been created to improve refugees&#8217; 
conditions and find solutions in areas such as employment and education. In cooperation 
with UNRWA, two laws had been enacted on specific benefits for Palestinians at the 
termination of service or in the case of accidents. The right to work was granted to 
Palestinians residing in Lebanon. However, humanitarian assistance, in terms of education, 
living condition and health, were primarily to be shouldered by the international community 
through UNRWA. In accordance with the fundamental objective of the return of refugees to 
their homeland and in light of Lebanon&#8217;s delicate demographic composition, the 
Constitution provided that Lebanon would not allow settlement of Palestinian on its lands. 
</p>
<p>15. Concerning the overcrowding of prisons, Lebanon was in need of further assistance. 
It was applying the law on the reduction of sentences and preparing a draft law on 
alternative punishment. The administration of prisons had been moved from the Ministry of 
Interior to the Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p>16. In conclusion, the head of delegation reconfirmed the Government&#8217;s commitment 
and full respect of international standards of human rights and its commitment to 
cooperation with international mechanisms and civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>17. Algeria noted that the ratification by Lebanon of most international human rights 
instruments was proof of its commitment to human rights.  It further noted that the issue of 
the foreign workforce in Lebanon posed challenges.  Algeria appreciated efforts to improve 
the situation of Palestinian refugees, including with regard to improved access to the labour 
market. Algeria wished Lebanon success in its endeavours, in spite of existing threats to its 
security and sovereignty.  Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>18. Qatar noted that the political and legal system guaranteed respect for basic freedoms, 
social justice and equality of rights without discrimination.  While repeated aggressions and 
resulting political and social crises had hampered development and the enjoyment of human 
rights, Lebanon had made efforts to overcome the difficulties and improve living 
conditions, particularly for vulnerable groups, and to revive its economy.  Qatar made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>19. Sudan expressed understanding for challenges faced by Lebanon due to the Israeli 
occupation of Palestinian and other Arab lands, but valued the achievements made in the 
area of human rights. Sudan expressed appreciation for the draft law by the Ministry of 
Labour on retirement and social protection and old age and inquired about the main 
provisions.  Sudan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>20. Oman noted that Lebanon was party to the major human rights instruments, which 
demonstrated its commitment to human rights and to complying with its international 
obligations. Oman expressed its conviction that the promotion and protection of human 
rights was a strategic choice for Lebanon on the path towards progress and stability, and 
noted that fundamental rights were guaranteed by the Constitution.  Oman made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>21. Saudi Arabia noted that the Lebanese Constitution contained a section dedicated to 
human rights and that the Government had made progress at the legal and institutional 
level, in spite of difficulties related to economic and security aspects. Saudi Arabia further 
commended the excellent cooperation by Lebanon with United Nations mechanisms, </p>


<p>particularly OHCHR, whose regional office it hosted, and with special procedures, among 
others.  Saudi Arabia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>22. Bahrain noted that Lebanon had taken a number of measures for the promotion and 
protection of human rights, in particular with regard to human trafficking and women&#8217;s 
rights, and appreciated the launching of a project and national committee to prevent and 
fight trafficking.  Bahrain further commended the appointment of women to high-level 
governmental and judicial positions as well as efforts taken on an action plan and draft law 
to combat violence against women, and draft legislation to fight trafficking.  Bahrain 
requested additional information on measures to combat violence against women and made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>23. Greece noted with appreciation the fact that Lebanon was a party to the core human 
rights treaties. It underscored the Government&#8217;s efforts to solve the issue of missing 
persons. Greece acknowledged Lebanon&#8217;s efforts to combat human trafficking and 
requested that Lebanon shared its experience in addressing this issue. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. Palestine noted that instability in Lebanon resulting from wars and destruction to 
which it had been exposed had hampered developments in the area of human rights. 
Furthermore, Palestinian refugees had been deprived of their rights, including the right to 
return confirmed by GA resolution 194, and the right to self-determination, due to the 
occupation of their land and other Arab lands by Israel. Palestine commended recent 
amendment in Lebanese labour law, which gave Palestinians partial access to the labour 
market.  Palestine made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela noted that despite the negative impact of the 
military aggressions by Israel, resulting in a high number of deaths and injuries as well as 
massive destruction of infrastructure, Lebanon demonstrated commitment to human rights 
and hosted an OHCHR regional office.  Venezuela acknowledged the progress achieved in 
the areas of education, in particular basic education and health.  Venezuela made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>26. Cuba recognized Lebanon&#8217;s efforts to achieve socio-economic development which 
had been hampered by invasions and aggressions causing loss of life and property on a 
large scale.  Nevertheless, there were achievements in the area of human rights, such as 
compulsory basic education, the initiative <i>Education for All</i> and programs to combat 
illiteracy.  Vulnerable groups, particularly children, women and persons with disabilities, 
had benefited from positive developments.  Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Mexico noted progress in preventing torture and in working conditions, despite the 
instability that had prevailed in Lebanon. The establishment of a national human rights 
institution would contribute to improvement in the human rights situation.  Mexico made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Tunisia noted that Lebanon&#8217;s commitment to human rights manifested itself in the 
political will of the government as well as its dynamic institutions, and observed that it also 
hosted the OHCHR regional office.  Lebanon was implementing a national plan for human 
rights in line with the recommendations of the Vienna Conference.  Tunisia noted that 
Lebanon remained a model of coexistence and the integration of different confessional 
communities in spite of repeated aggressions by Israel. Tunisia made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>29. Iraq noted that Lebanon had made considerable progress in the human rights 
protection. With its diverse society, it had adopted a consensual type of government that 
was considered a model in the Arab world and which persisted in spite of the many crises 
with which Lebanon had been faced. Human rights and fundamental freedoms were 
protected by the Constitution, and Lebanon also adhered to the main international human </p>


<p>rights instruments. Iraq inquired about measures taken to rebuild schools and orphanages 
destroyed by the occupying power during the 2006 aggression on Beirut and southern 
Lebanon. 
</p>
<p>30. Brazil noted that the assessment of Lebanon&#8217;s human rights situation should take 
into account the recent history of armed conflict, foreign occupation and intervention. It 
recognized the recent progress, including in the areas of women&#8217;s rights, poverty reduction, 
prevention of child labour and improvements in living conditions of Palestinian refugees. It 
also acknowledged the existence of a vibrant civil society. Brazil made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>31. Jordan noted that Lebanon paid special attention to the promotion of human rights 
and particularly commended efforts taken to strengthen the freedom of opinion and 
expression. Jordan welcomed efforts to promote the rights to education and health and the 
advancement of women, including their participation in political life and decision-making.  
Jordan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Armenia appreciated the historic role of Lebanon as a sanctuary for victims of grave 
human rights violations, who turned genocide survivors into an equal part of its consensual 
family, and referred to Lebanon&#8217;s achievements in constructing a democratic society. 
Armenia welcomed Lebanon&#8217;s intention to ban the death penalty and encouraged Lebanon 
to maintain its tolerant approach towards all religious groups. Armenia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. India took positive note of the establishment of the Parliamentary Committee on 
Human Rights, the Office of the Directorate-General of Human Rights and the National 
Commission to Combat Trafficking. It appreciated also the establishment of an inter-
ministerial committee to develop the National Social Development Strategy. India 
requested information about the measures that were taken to secure the right of its citizens 
to adequate and decent housing.  
</p>
<p>34. Israel put on record its strong objection to the inappropriate and abusive language 
used to reference the country in paragraph 2 of Lebanon&#8217;s national report.  It stated that the 
existence of a dominant terrorist organization, Hizbullah, and political tensions had created 
a grave human right situation for the Lebanese people.2 In this regard, it cited unlawful 
killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, torture and discrimination, among 
others, and made recommendations. It noted that it looked forward to the day when Israel 
and a free and sovereign Lebanon would enjoy peaceful and friendly relations. 
</p>
<p>35. Malaysia, noted improved stability as well as challenges in promoting human rights 
in result of a prolonged war, foreign intervention and partial occupation, among others. It 
noted that Lebanon hosted a large number of Palestinian and other refugees residing and 
acknowledged the steps that were taken by Lebanon in cooperation with UN agencies to 
ensure a decent life for the refugees. Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Bangladesh noted with appreciation the fact that: Lebanon was a party to the 
majority of human rights treaties; it had a vibrant civil society; and made a decision to 
establish an independent human rights institution. It expressed concern at some instances of 
poor working conditions and violations of the rights of migrant workers. Bangladesh 
appreciated Lebanon&#8217;s efforts to protect human rights despite the challenges resulting from 
war. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>  
 2 Lebanon objected that the statement was not in line with the procedures of the UPR and that the 
</p>
<p>language used was inadequate for the august Council. It called for these expressions to be deleted 
from the record. If there were no Israeli occupation there would be no resistance.  Resistance against 
foreign occupation is a legitimate right enshrined in international instruments. </p>


<p>37.  Morocco appreciated measures taken to ensure the right to education for all citizens, 
and particularly the national plan for education 2003-2015.  Morocco requested information 
on efforts to spread a culture of human rights through school education as well as training 
for government, judicial and security personnel. It valued legal protections of the freedoms 
of opinion, association and the media. 
</p>
<p>38. Pakistan noted with satisfaction that, despite cultural and religious diversity, no 
group was excluded or discriminated in their daily lives. It noted that the aggression by 
Israel had hampered the Government&#8217;s capacity to promote and protect human rights. 
Pakistan stated that Lebanon&#8217;s commitment to human rights was evident through its 
accession to most of the international human rights instruments. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. The Islamic Republic of Iran noted that despite many constraints, Lebanon had 
reached progress and achievements in the field of human rights. It commended Lebanon for 
its efforts in the protection of human rights, namely improvements in the institutional and 
legislative area, rights of children, women and refugees. Iran made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. In responding to statements made, the head of delegation noted that the preparation 
of the national report was the responsibility of the country and reflected its vision and 
position. It was not up to the judgment of any other party in terms of language used. He 
also noted that instability was the result of repeated Israeli attacks<b> </b>and that the best way to 
solving this problem was to address its root-causes, namely the foreign occupation of parts 
of the Lebanese territory and the lack of a just and durable solution to the Palestinian 
question.3 4 
</p>
<p>41. Concerning the citizenship law, an amendment was under consideration so as to 
correct the current discrimination between men and women in acquiring citizenship. Free 
courtesy residence was granted for three years to the husband and children of a Lebanese 
woman married to a foreigner. Society was still divided on the conditions to grant 
citizenship, due to the unique composition of Lebanese society. This made it difficult to 
withdraw the relevant reservation to CEDAW. Concerning personal status laws, the reasons 
for discrimination were due to a lack of a unified personal status law. Individual were 
governed by their own respective religious laws. While the government had previously 
prepared a draft law for civil marriage, this had not been adopted, as all religious groups 
had rejected it. 
</p>
<p>42. Concerning gender equality in social security, the National Commission for Women 
had requested parliament to submit a draft law concerning the equal allotment of social 
security particularly for sickness, health and family allowances. A draft law on domestic 
violence had been recently adopted and was in the final stages of adoption in the Cabinet. 
Concerning political participation, a law to specify a gender quota was also under 
discussion in Parliament. 
</p>
<p>43. Lebanon had adopted a law on persons with disabilities establishing a National 
Committee for the Disabled and providing a number of services for people with special 
needs.  The ratification of the Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities was now 
</p>
<p>  
 3 Israel noted that the meeting was supposed to discuss the human rights situation in Lebanon, which 
</p>
<p>was under the responsibility of the Government of Lebanon. It stated that remarks made felt outside 
the scope of the UPR and requesting that those remarks regarding Israel be struck from the report of 
this working group. 
</p>
<p> 4 In response, Lebanon noted that the delegation did not wish to provoke any person in the room, but 
observed that one statement referred to internal affairs in Lebanon in a manner that was unsuitable 
within the United Nations. It called for the deletion of all language that was not in line with the 
terminology used in the United Nations. The head of delegation noted that he was simply exercising 
his right of reply to what was said in the Council. </p>


<p>before Parliament.  The Ministry of Education focused on the integration of children with 
special needs, inter alia by ensuring that buildings and premises were adapted and that an 
enabling environment for these children was created to ensure their integration into 
mainstream education. 
</p>
<p>44. Concerning the submission of treaty body reports, the head of delegation 
acknowledged certain delays attributable to the difficult situation in Lebanon. The Minister 
of Foreign Affairs would act as coordinator in the near future. 
</p>
<p>45. The Netherlands welcomed steps that were taken by Lebanon to establish 
independent national mechanism for the prevention of torture and it encouraged the 
Government to take further action to prevent torture. It also welcomed the newly amended 
national legislation on registered Palestinian refugees. The Netherlands made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Egypt noted that conflicts had had a negative effect on the internal situation in 
Lebanon, which continued to suffer occupation of some of its territories and related attacks, 
which constituted violations, had negatively affected the internal situation and the 
enjoyment of human rights. Nevertheless it had demonstrated political will in protecting 
human rights. Egypt valued efforts taken to fight human trafficking, and to protect the 
rights of women and children and to raise awareness in this regard.  Egypt called on the 
international community to ease Lebanon&#8217;s burden in hosting refugees. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. Poland appreciated the progress made by Lebanon in improving human rights 
situation. It referred to the concerns expressed by the UN bodies about the phenomenon of 
the child labour and the legitimacy of corporal punishment. It asked about the steps 
Lebanon intended to take to ensure the implementations of procedures and mechanisms 
concerning children&#8217;s rights. Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Thailand noted Lebanon&#8217;s efforts in the promotion of freedom of association and 
freedom of speech and implementation of the CRC&#8217;s principles and provisions. It noted the 
burden of hosting refugees by Lebanon for a long period. Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Canada expressed concern by the situation of migrant workers in Lebanon, in 
particular domestic workers who arrive through a sponsorship system prone to abuse by 
employers.  It highlighted the moratorium on the death penalty but noted that there have 
been new convictions to the capital punishment and called Lebanon not to execute these 
penalties.  It referred to the reports on the use of torture.  Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Russian Federation supported the measures that were taken by Lebanon and aimed 
at strengthening state institutions, further stabilising political situation and ensuring full 
control by the Government over its entire territory. It also noted a decision adopted on the 
removal of the limitations on the professional activities of the political refugees. Russian 
Federation made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>51. Yemen noted that Lebanon was a tribune for freedom and that Beirut hosted a 
number of international human rights activities on human rights, although Lebanon had 
suffered from the Israeli occupation and the resulting refugee problem as well as wars, the 
last of which was in 2006. Lebanon had played a leading role in the region in adopting 
legislation on human rights, such as the Labour Law, as amended in 2010. Yemen was 
convinced that Lebanon would take further efforts to ensure a decent life for Palestinian 
refugees. 
</p>
<p>52. Syria welcomed Lebanon's commitment to respect all the international Human 
Rights instruments in a way to preserve human dignity, equality and social justice, and to 
improve living conditions and foster stability. Unfortunately, the establishment of Israel and 
its forceful displacement of millions of Palestinians from their lands, depriving them of </p>


<p>their right of return,5 and the recurring aggression and horrific massacres by Israel, have led 
to a large number of deaths and injuries, in addition to the grave destruction in the 
infrastructure, and the spread of 2 million Israeli cluster bombs in Lebanese lands. All this 
led to depriving the Lebanese citizens of their rights to life, housing and food. The United 
Nations described these aggressions as a flagrant violation of human rights.678 
</p>
<p>53. Slovakia acknowledged Lebanon&#8217;s efforts to improve the human rights situation. It 
welcomed a de facto moratorium on executions since 2004 and acknowledged the recent 
efforts towards the abolishment of the death penalty. Slovakia referred to concerns 
expressed by the UN bodies about the reported ill-treatment and practices of torture as well 
as about a low minimum age of criminal responsibility. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Belgium remarked that the situation of human rights had progressively improved in 
the last five years.  It regretted that the death penalty was still in force despite a moratorium 
and asked about the situation of the bill introduced to abolish the death penalty.  Belgium 
remained concerned by the persistence of acts of torture as well as for the situation of 
refugees.  It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. The United States recognised measures taken by Lebanon to improve its human 
rights situation. It welcomed Lebanon&#8217;s efforts, including the intention to establish an 
independent national human rights institution. It remained concerned that Lebanese women 
were inequitably represented in the government and that refugees lacked basic rights to 
move freely within the country. It noted that some forms of torture were not criminalised. It 
expressed disappointment that the Lebanese report unfairly criticized Israel and referred to 
it in inappropriate language. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Kuwait welcomed Lebanon&#8217;s achievements in protecting human rights in spite of the 
crises and repeated Israeli aggressions.  Kuwait noted that Lebanon had made efforts to 
protect human rights by respecting the rights enshrined in its Constitution, in national 
legislation and in international instruments.  Kuwait made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Australia, while recognising the current moratorium on the use of the death penalty, 
was concerned that the death penalty remained in law. It remained also concerned by 
reports of a high number of working children. Australia called for the prompt passing of a 
new Family Violence Bill which would strengthen reporting on, and investigations of, 
incidents of family violence and increase protections for victims. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. The United Arab Emirates appreciated the Constitution&#8217;s provisions, which ensure 
respect for human rights and freedoms in line with international human rights instruments. 
It commended measures taken in the area of social, economic and cultural rights, in 
particular through the 2007 reform programme, which contained ambitious goals for 
</p>
<p>  
 5 Israel noted that the issue under discussion at this meeting was the human rights situation in Lebanon 
</p>
<p>and not the state of Israel. Therefore Israel requested that the comments of the Syrian representative 
just made be struck from the working group report. 
</p>
<p> 6 Israel reiterated its objection and stated that if the representative of Syria insisted on talking about 
occupation, they would be interested to learn about the Syrian occupation in Lebanon. 
</p>
<p> 7 The United States noted that the UPR was a mechanism to evaluate the human rights situations in 
given countries and that unfortunately the discussion had moved into a different direction. It took 
great issue with delegations using this forum to question the status of Israel or to bring any outside 
issues that were not relevant to the UPR of Lebanon, and requested that discussion follow along those 
lines. 
</p>
<p> 8 Lebanon also took the floor and noted that what was being discussed in terms of the impact of the 
Israeli aggression against Lebanon was closely related to the exercise of human rights in Lebanon in 
terms of the victims and killings resulting from this aggression. Therefore, those who would like to 
speak about the Israeli aggression should not be prevented from taking the floor. </p>


<p>economic growth and the creation of employment opportunities, protection of vulnerable 
groups, improvement in education and health services and achieving greater equality 
among different regions.  UAE made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Italy commended Lebanon for undertaking measures to improve the human rights 
situation despite prolonged political instability. Italy appreciated that Lebanon had applied 
a de facto moratorium on executions, but noted that the draft law to abolish the death 
penalty had not been approved yet. Italy encouraged Lebanon to amend discriminatory 
provisions in personal status laws to ensure that women are treated equally in issues related 
to child custody, inheritance and divorce. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>60. Sri Lanka welcomed measures taken by Lebanon to address problems related to 
migrant workers, inter alia through the Aliens Act and mandatory employment contracts, 
and efforts to a unified insurance contract to protect foreign labour. Sri Lanka also noted 
that Lebanon was in the process to provide free education up to the age of 12 and to extend 
the age of compulsory schooling to 15. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Finland took note of the amendments of the Labour Law which aimed to enlarge the 
rights of the Palestinian refugees to work and encouraged Lebanon to carry out further 
reforms to improve the situation of Palestinian refugees in enjoying their right to work. 
Finland asked about the measures that were taken to enhance the prerequisites of the 
Palestinian refugees to increase their standard of living. Finland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Ireland noted the important progress in human rights area, including the de facto 
moratorium on the use of the death penalty. Ireland noted that the legislation did not 
criminalize all forms of torture and asked if Lebanon consider reviewing the definition of 
torture of the Penal Code and enacting legislation for stricter sentences for the act of 
torture. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Referring to the situation of undocumented Palestinian refugees, the head of 
delegation noted that many had had no documents at the time they entered the territory after 
the 1970ies. Lebanon had received ten percent of all Palestinian refugees and could not bear 
the burden of an increased number of refugees alone, but would seek to address this 
problem in a humanitarian fashion.  Pressure was being exerted to permit Palestinian 
refugees to return to Lebanon if they applied for European refugee status.  
</p>
<p>64.<b> </b>The definition of torture would be brought in line with international standards and 
sentences for the crime of torture be increased accordingly. The Ministry of Justice had 
drafted a law to establish an independent national mechanism for the prevention of torture. 
The new criminal procedure code enshrines rights for accused and convicted persons, who 
were for instance entitled to medical attention after 24 hours of detention.   
</p>
<p>65. Concerning torture in arrest and detention centres, recommendations had been made 
based on those of the Sub-Committee on the Prevention of Torture, in order to guarantee 
the rights of persons arrested and detained and in order to monitor and prevent any 
violations. Access to detention facilities had been granted to delegates of the ICRC and the 
Sub-Committee during its recent visit in May 2010. Training was provided to the military, 
and a department for the monitoring of violations of international humanitarian law by the 
armed forced had been created. 
</p>
<p>66. The Internal Security Forces were an official law enforcement agency. A Code of 
Conduct was in the final stage of approval. Lebanon benefited from the experience of other 
countries and from direct cooperation with OHCHR in Beirut, as well as from consultations 
with civil society organizations. Human rights were taught to all police academy students. 
Recently, a Committee had been created, which included many officers of the Internal 
Security Forces, to monitor torture in all detention centres, conduct visits and prepare for </p>


<p>the creation of a national mechanism for the prevention of torture in line with article 17 of 
OPCAT. 
</p>
<p>67. Until today, 2,000 identification documents had been granted to Palestinian 
refugees, although some possessed refugee documents issued by other Arab countries. 
Lebanon was currently examining another 1,500 requests. The identity documents provided 
refugees with freedom of movement within Lebanon. In exceptional cases travel documents 
were issued.  
</p>
<p>68. In 2005, Lebanon acceded to the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children and adopted the necessary 
legislation to prosecute those crimes. A National Committee headed by a judge from the 
Ministry of Justice had been established to prevent trafficking. A draft law on trafficking in 
persons was before Parliament. Training seminars for law enforcement officers were 
organized and Lebanon participated at trainings at the regional and international level. 
</p>
<p>69. Regarding domestic workers, it was noted that their number exceeded a hundred 
thousand. A committee under the supervision of the Ministry of Labour with the 
participation of the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Internal Security Forces and the Ministry 
of Justice had been established. Unified contracts for domestic workers had also been 
issued. One holiday per week was applied and medical insurance coverage was mandatory. 
The Minister of Labour was in the process of laying down a new framework for 
employment agencies and a law for domestic workers, prescribing the number of working 
hours and weekly holidays, amongst other conditions. In March 2010, certain restrictions 
had been imposed on employment agencies to prevent abuse of foreign workers, and 
awareness raising campaigns had bee launched. 
</p>
<p>70. France recognized the courageous debate that has taken place in Lebanon regarding 
the abolition of the death penalty.  It expressed concerns at the situation of refugees, 
domestic workers and Lebanon&#8217;s obligations to prevent torture.  France made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>71. Nicaragua stated that Lebanon had suffered for decades from invasions and 
aggressions by Israel, involving indiscriminate use of force, which had produced political, 
social and economic instability.  Despite this situation, Lebanon had achieved a high level 
of democratization and representation of all religious communities in political life.  
Nicaragua recognized the progress achieved in the area of human rights and the Lebanon&#8217;s 
cooperation with the UN human rights system.  It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>72. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland encouraged Lebanon to 
fully involve civil society in the follow-up to the review and in the development of the 
National Strategic Plan on human rights. It welcomed the draft law on the abolition of the 
death penalty, but was concerned that it had not yet passed. The United Kingdom 
welcomed human rights training for security forces but expressed concern about continued 
allegations of torture. It raised concern about the situation of Palestinian refugees. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Turkey noted with satisfaction the fact that Lebanon was a party to international 
human rights treaties and their protocols. It positively noted Lebanon&#8217;s efforts that were 
undertaken to establish the National Commission on Lebanese women, High Council on the 
Rights of the Child and the Commission on the persons with disabilities.  Turkey asked for 
more information on the Commission on the education for children with special needs. It 
welcomed the existence of a dynamic civil society and the initiative to establish an 
independent national human rights institution. Turkey made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>74. Spain noted Lebanon&#8217;s commitment to democracy and human rights, evidenced by 
the ratification of the majority of the core international conventions and the establishment </p>


<p>of a legal and institutional framework for their protection and promotion.  It also remarked 
the Government&#8217;s will to establish a national human rights institution and the fact that 
Lebanon was the first country in the region to ratify OP-CAT.  Spain made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75. Norway acknowledged Lebanon&#8217;s efforts to improve the human rights situation. 
Norway noted that migrant workers did not fall under the protection of the Labour Law, 
and were vulnerable to poor working conditions. Norway commended Lebanon for the draft 
law which would allow Lebanese women to pass on their nationality to their children and 
foreign spouses.  Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76. Germany enquired about the establishment of a prevention mechanism as required 
by OP-CAT and number of investigation on cases of enforced disappearances and torture. 
Germany also asked for information on the implementation of CRC&#8217;s recommendation to 
ensure that Lebanese mothers have the right to confer Lebanese citizenship to their 
children. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>77. Cote d&#8217;Ivoire noted with appreciation Lebanon&#8217;s initiatives to protect human rights 
and dignity.  It called for the strengthening of the national institutions charged with human 
rights and encouraged Lebanon to ratify those instruments to which it is not yet a party.  It 
also encouraged Lebanon to call for the assistance of the international community to better 
comply with its international human rights commitments.  Cote d&#8217;Ivoire made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>78. In concluding remarks, the head of the delegation stated that Lebanon alone could 
not provide solutions to improve the conditions of Palestinian refugees and that it could not 
replace UNRWA. He called on all delegations to consider the possibility to strengthen their 
support to UNRWA and recalled that the fundamental objective was the return of the 
Palestinian refugees to their homeland. 
</p>
<p>79. Lebanon was at the cross-roads between East and West and aimed to build bridges 
and be a model of development in the region for the better promotion and protection of 
human rights while maintaining its specificities. 
</p>
