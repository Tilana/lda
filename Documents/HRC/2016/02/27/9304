<p><b>ANNUAL REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER 
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND REPORTS OF THE OFFICE OF THE 
           HIGH COMMISSIONER AND THE SECRETARY-GENERAL 
</b></p>
<p><b>Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights on the human rights situation in the 
           Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Note by the Secretariat 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present note has been prepared further to Human Rights Council decision 2/102 
requesting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue with the 
fulfilment of her activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the 
Commission on Human Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies. The Commission 
on Human Rights, in paragraph 9 of its resolution 2005/11, requested the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to continue her efforts to engage in a comprehensive dialogue with the authorities 
of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea with a view to establishing technical cooperation 
programmes in the field of human rights and to submit her findings and recommendations to the 
Commission. 
</p>
<p>2. In line with standard policy and practice developed pursuant to General Assembly 
resolution 926 (X) of 14 December 1955, which established the United Nations programme of 
advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights, various forms of 
assistance in the area of human rights are at the disposal of Member States upon their request. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*<b>  </b>The present report was submitted late to reflect the most recent information.<b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>3. With a view to exploring ways of initiating technical cooperation between the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea, the High Commissioner invited the Permanent Representative of the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to the United Nations Office at Geneva to meet and 
explore avenues of future cooperation. 
</p>
<p>4. During the meeting held on 11 February 2008, the High Commissioner welcomed the 
recent submission of the combined third and fourth periodic report of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea to the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC/C/PRK/4) and encouraged 
continued activities in relation to reporting to the treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>5. The High Commissioner proposed discussions on a future technical assistance programme 
that could be offered to the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, 
particularly in light of the forthcoming review of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
under the Human Rights Council&#8217;s Universal Periodic Review mechanism (scheduled to take 
place in 2009). Such a programme could for example offer assistance in the areas of treaty body 
reporting and ratification of core human rights treaties. The High Commissioner suggested that 
an OHCHR assessment mission could visit the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea with a 
view to exploring such possibilities with relevant officials on the ground. 
</p>
<p>6. The Permanent Representative of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea reiterated 
that his Government does not recognize the resolutions adopted by the Human Rights Council 
and the General Assembly on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
of Korea. The Government considers these resolutions as selective, politicized and reflecting 
double-standards. The Permanent Representative stated that his Government was therefore 
unable to accept the High Commissioner&#8217;s offer. He nonetheless stated that he had taken note of 
the High Commissioner&#8217;s willingness to offer technical assistance and that his Government 
would continue to respect its treaty obligations and cooperate with the treaty bodies. Since the 
11 February meeting, no further response has been received from the Government on this matter.
