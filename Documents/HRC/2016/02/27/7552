<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> *
 The annexes to the present report are reproduced as received, in the language of submission only. 
</p>

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 22/2, requested the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit a comprehensive and updated report to the 
Council at its twenty-seventh session, in accordance with its annual programme of work, 
following the structure and scope of her report and with a special focus on further measures 
to correct the imbalance in geographical composition of the staff of the Office of the High 
Commissioner (OHCHR). The present report addresses the composition of the staff of the 
Office as at 31 December 2013. 
</p>
<p>2. Chapter II of the present report includes data on staff members in regular budget 
posts subject to geographical distribution, as well as data on staff in temporary posts funded 
from general temporary assistance and extrabudgetary resources or in technical cooperation 
project posts, neither of which are included in the definition of posts subject to geographical 
distribution. 
</p>
<p>3. Chapter III contains a description of the measures for improvement taken by the 
High Commissioner bearing in mind the issues identified by the Human Rights Council in 
resolution 22/2, while fully observing United Nations Secretariat human resources policies, 
in particular, its recruitment and contractual policies. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Composition of the staff of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b>4. The recruitment of staff members to posts subject to geographical distribution is 
governed by the system of desirable ranges at the Secretariat level. For that purpose, 
Member States are grouped into four categories: unrepresented, underrepresented, within 
range and overrepresented. A Member State is considered unrepresented when none of its 
nationals, throughout the entire Secretariat, is serving in a post subject to geographical 
distribution and filled in accordance with the established selection process. It is 
underrepresented when the number of its nationals appointed to such posts throughout the 
entire Secretariat is below the lower limit of the desirable range. It is within range when the 
number of its nationals appointed to such posts is between the upper and lower limits of the 
desirable range, and it is overrepresented when the number of its nationals appointed to 
such posts within the entire Secretariat exceeds the upper limit of the desirable range. The 
representation status of Member States is affected by many factors, in particular the 
turnover of staff and changes in the scale of assessments. 
</p>
<p>5. The official report on the composition of the Secretariat is submitted annually by the 
Secretary-General to the General Assembly in accordance with a number of resolutions, the 
most recent being Assembly resolutions 59/266, 60/238, 61/244, 63/250, 65/247, 66/234, 
67/255 and 68/252. 
</p>
<p>6. The latest report of the Secretary-General on the composition of the Secretariat 
(A/68/356) covers the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013. OHCHR is part of the 
Secretariat and the breakdown of its geographical composition has to be seen against the 
breakdown of the overall distribution within the Secretariat. 
</p>
<p>7.  As stated in the report of the Secretary-General, paragraphs 4 to 7, in August 2011, 
the Office of Human Resources Management launched an online reporting tool, &#8220;HR 
Insight&#8221;, available to all permanent missions. The tool is based on the human resources data 
warehouse and enables users to retrieve information from other human resources systems. 
The first release of the tool provided permanent missions with reports on desirable ranges, a 
staff list and staff details for their respective nationals, such as composition by sex or type </p>


<p>of appointment. Those online reports are updated on a monthly basis (with an approximate 
three-month time delay) and may be downloaded; permanent missions thus have 
convenient, instant access to often-requested data or reports. The full list of staff of the 
Secretariat is now available exclusively on this platform. Since the first release of the tool, 
the Office of Human Resources Management has made a number of enhancements, such as 
adding reports that show Member States the separations, appointments and forecasted 
retirement of their nationals, as well as the forecasted retirement of all P-5 to D-2 staff 
members. Pursuant to the request of the General Assembly contained in paragraph 48 of its 
resolution 67/255, a new table showing data on representation of developing countries for 
geographical staff per quarter has been published online. With HR Insight, Member States 
therefore have access to information similar to that contained in a Secretariat report (or in 
the present one), but at the level of staff members, unlike composition reports, which show 
the information at the aggregated level and are only issued annually. At the time of 
preparation of the latest report of the Secretary-General on the composition of the 
Secretariat, there were more than 300 users in permanent missions who, in the reporting 
period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013, had used the tool to produce nearly 4,500 reports. 
</p>
<p>8. The table in annex I provides a breakdown of all OHCHR staff members in the 
Professional category and above who have been selected through the established 
recruitment process (&#8220;regular&#8221; staff) against both regular budget posts subject to 
geographical distribution and extrabudgetary posts, by nationality, grade and sex as at 
31 December 2013. 
</p>
<p>9. The table in annex II provides a breakdown of the following categories of additional 
OHCHR staff in the Professional category and above not included in the table in annex I by 
nationality, grade and sex as at 31 December 2013: 
</p>
<p> (a) Staff holding appointments of less than one year; 
 (b) Staff charged to general temporary assistance funds;  
 (c) Staff employed as technical cooperation project personnel. 
</p><p>10. It should be recalled that, in paragraph 14, section IX, of its resolution 63/250, the 
General Assembly re-emphasized that the system of geographical ranges was designed to 
apply to countries rather than to regions or groups. This principle was recently reiterated by 
the Joint Inspection Unit in a comparative analysis and benchmarking framework on staff 
recruitment in United Nations system organizations, focusing on gender balance and 
geographical distribution (JIU/NOTE/2012/3). The data in the present report are therefore 
provided by country and listed in alphabetical order.  
</p>
<p>11. As at 31 December 2013, OHCHR had a total of 579 staff members in the 
Professional category and above, of whom 503 are considered regular staff.  
</p>
<p>12. Nationals from 117 countries are represented in the Professional and above 
workforce, in both geographical and non-geographical posts. The latter comprise 
extrabudgetary posts that are not included under the system of desirable ranges (see 
paragraph 4 above). Of these 117 nationalities, 14 are underrepresented,1 81 are considered 
within range,2 while 22 nationalities are overrepresented3 in the Secretariat. OHCHR also 
has nationals from the State of Palestine on staff.

 Underrepresented at 31 December 2013: Afghanistan, Brazil, Chad, China, Czech Republic, 
</p>
<p>Indonesia, Iraq, Japan, Latvia, Norway, Paraguay, Poland, Turkey and the United States of America.

Cambodia, Central African Republic, Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Croatia, Cyprus, 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>13. Despite the confirmation made by the General Assembly that the system of 
geographical ranges to be applied to the Secretariat is based on individual countries rather 
than regions, the Human Rights Council has repeatedly requested that statistics on a 
regional basis be provided. The table below complies with that request, showing the 
distribution of OHCHR staff by regional group. It shows a slight change in the percentages 
from the various regions compared with 2012, although the overall trend since 2006 is quite 
clear. This can be explained by the mobile and dynamic nature of OHCHR staff members 
and thus the changes from year to year.

</b></p>
<p>14. Enhancing the geographical diversity of OHCHR staff remains one of the High 
Commissioner&#8217;s priorities. In accordance with that objective, OHCHR has continued to 
vigorously implement the High Commissioner&#8217;s procedures and framework for improving 
geographical diversity, in full compliance with Secretariat human resources policies, which 
were explained in detail to the Commission on Human Rights in February 2006.4 Current 
measures have included expanding the pool of qualified candidates from the widest 
possible range of countries and backgrounds, and developing recruitment outreach activities 
with United Nations country teams, OHCHR field offices, permanent missions in Geneva, 
other United Nations entities and local partners in the field. The 2010 National Competitive 
Recruitment Examination, which included the human rights occupational group, yielded 
another group of candidates from unrepresented and underrepresented Member States from 
which OHCHR was able to recruit. OHCHR has also requested the Office of Human

<p>Resources Management to hold another round of the examination, now called the Young 
Professionals Programme, in 2014. This should also assist in the recruitment of young 
professionals from States that are unrepresented and underrepresented in the Secretariat. 
</p>
<p>15. While seeking to improve further its geographical distribution, OHCHR will 
continue to pay special attention to the issue of balance between female and male staff 
members at all levels, an area in which determination and concerted effort have already 
brought success. As at 31 December 2013, women accounted for 54.6 per cent of all 
Professional and above staff at OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>16. Similarly, OHCHR will continue its commitment to meet the goals and obligations 
placed upon it under the system of desirable ranges mandated by the General Assembly. 
This is reflected in the departmental target relating to the recruitment of nationals from 
unrepresented and underrepresented Member States established in the Secretariat Human 
Resources Scorecard and in the High Commissioner&#8217;s Compact. At the time of submission 
of the present report, the percentage of recruitments from unrepresented and 
underrepresented Member States and Member States at risk of becoming underrepresented 
compared with all geographical appointments in OHCHR, excluding P-2 posts, was 50 per 
cent, which is encouraging, given that the Secretariat target is 20 per cent for such 
recruitments. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusion 
</b>17. <b>The implementation and results to date of the High Commissioner&#8217;s procedures 
and framework to improve geographical diversity reflect the priority that the High 
Commissioner continues to give to this issue. Noticeable and sustained progress has 
been achieved in increasing the geographical diversity of OHCHR staff through these 
measures. The Office remains attentive to the need to maintain emphasis on the 
broadest possible geographical diversity of its staff, and will continue its efforts in this 
regard.</b> </p>
