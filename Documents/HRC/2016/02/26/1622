</b></p>
<p><b>  25/&#8230;  Freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 36/55 of 25 November 1981, by which the 
General Assembly proclaimed the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant human rights 
provisions, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> Human Rights Council resolution 22/20 of 22 March 2013, and 
other resolutions adopted by the Council, the General Assembly and the Commission on 
Human Rights on the freedom of religion or belief or the elimination of all forms of 
intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that States have the primary responsibility to promote and protect human 
rights, including the human rights of persons belonging to religious minorities, including 
their right to exercise their religion or belief freely, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> at continuing acts of intolerance and violence based on religion or 
belief against individuals, including persons belonging to religious communities and 
religious minorities around the world, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> the importance of education in the promotion of tolerance, which 
involves the acceptance by the public of and its respect for diversity, including with regard 
to religious expression, and underlining also the fact that education, in particular at school, 
should contribute in a meaningful way to promoting tolerance and the elimination of 
discrimination based on religion or belief, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Stresses</i> that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and 
religion or belief, which includes the freedom to have or not to have, or to adopt, a religion 
or belief of one&#8217;s choice and the freedom, either alone or in community with others and in 
public or private, and to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and 
observance, including the right to change one&#8217;s religion or belief; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Emphasizes</i> that freedom of religion or belief and freedom of expression are 
interdependent, interrelated and mutually reinforcing, and stresses further the role that these 
rights can play in the fight against all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on 
religion or belief; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Expresses deep concern</i> at emerging obstacles to the enjoyment of the right 
to freedom of religion or belief, as well as instances of religious intolerance, discrimination 
and violence, inter alia: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The increasing number of acts of violence directed against individuals, 
including persons belonging to religious minorities in various parts of the world; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The rise of religious extremism in various parts of the world that affects the 
rights of individuals, including persons belonging to religious minorities; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Incidents of religious hatred, discrimination, intolerance and violence, which 
may be manifested by derogatory stereotyping, negative profiling and the stigmatization of 
individuals on the basis of their religion or belief; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Instances, both in law and in practice, that constitute violations of the 
fundamental right to freedom of religion or belief, including of the individual right to 
publicly express one&#8217;s spiritual and religious beliefs, taking into account the relevant 
articles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as other 
international instruments; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Constitutional and legislative systems that fail to provide adequate and 
effective guarantees of freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief to all, without 
distinction; 
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) Attacks on religious places, sites and shrines, as well as vandalism of 
cemeteries, in violation of international law, in particular international human rights law 
and international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Condemns</i> all forms of violence, intolerance and discrimination based on or 
in the name of religion or belief, and violations of the freedom of thought, conscience, 
religion or belief as well as any advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence, whether it involves the use of print, audiovisual or 
electronic media or any other means; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also condemns</i> violence and acts of terrorism, which are increasing in 
number, targeting individuals, including persons belonging to religious minorities across 
the world; </p>


<p>6. <i>Emphasizes</i> that no religion should be equated with terrorism, as this may 
have adverse consequences on the enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief of 
all members of the religious community concerned; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Also emphasizes</i> that States should exercise due diligence to prevent, 
investigate and punish acts of violence against persons belonging to religious minorities, 
regardless of the perpetrator, and that failure to do so may constitute a human rights 
violation; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Urges</i> States to step up their efforts to promote and protect freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion or belief, and to this end: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To ensure that their constitutional and legislative systems provide adequate 
and effective guarantees of freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief to all, 
without distinction, by, inter alia, the provision of access to justice and effective remedies 
in cases where the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief, or the 
right to freely practise one&#8217;s religion, including the right to change one&#8217;s religion or belief, 
is violated; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To implement all accepted universal periodic review recommendations 
relating to the promotion and protection of freedom of religion or belief;

detention on that account, and to bring to justice all perpetrators of violations of these 
rights;

opportunity to have access, on general terms of equality, to public services in their country, 
without any discrimination on the basis of religion or belief;

ensure that such practices do not limit the right of all individuals to manifest their religion 
or belief, either alone or in community with others and in public or private; 
</p>
<p>(<i>g</i>) To ensure that no official documents are withheld from the individual on the 
grounds of religion or belief and that everyone has the right to refrain from disclosing 
information concerning their religious affiliation in such documents against their will; 
</p>
<p>(<i>h</i>) To ensure, in particular, the right of all individuals to worship, assemble or 
teach in connection with a religion or belief and their right to establish and maintain places 
for these purposes, and the right of all individuals to seek, receive and impart information 
and ideas in these areas; 
</p>

law enforcement bodies, and personnel of detention facilities, the military and educators, in 
the course of fulfilling their official duties, respect freedom of religion or belief and do not </p>

awareness-raising, education or training is provided; 
</p>
<p>(<i>k</i>) To take all necessary and appropriate action, in conformity with international 
human rights obligations, to combat hatred, discrimination, intolerance and acts of violence, 
intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or belief, as well as 
any advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility and 
violence, with particular regard to persons belonging to religious minorities in all parts of 
the world; 
</p>
<p>(<i>l</i>) To promote, through the educational system and other means, mutual 
understanding, tolerance, non-discrimination and respect in all matters relating to freedom 
of religion or belief by encouraging, in society at large, a wider knowledge of different 
religions and beliefs and of the history, traditions, languages and cultures of the various 
religious minorities existing within their jurisdiction; 
</p>
<p>(<i>m</i>) To prevent any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on 
religion or belief that impairs the recognition, enjoyment or exercise of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms on an equal basis, and to detect signs of intolerance that may lead to 
discrimination based on religion or belief;

understanding, and takes note with appreciation of different initiatives in this regard, 
including the Alliance of Civilizations and the programmes led by the United Nations
