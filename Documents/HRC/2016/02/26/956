</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the Convention on the Rights of the Child constitutes the standard 
</p>
<p>in the promotion and protection of the rights of the child, and bearing in mind the 
</p>
<p>importance of the Optional Protocols thereto, as well as other human rights standards,  
</p>

</p>
<p>(<i>j</i>) To strengthen the digital inclusion of children and to ensure that all

</p>
<p>counselling, reporting and complaints mechanisms are accessible to all children, that they 
</p>
<p>pursue the best interests of the child at all times and that they comply with international 
</p>
<p>human rights standards; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Further encourages</i> States to take active measures to restore and protect the 
</p>
<p>right of the child to engage in play and recreational activities in forced displacement, post-
</p>
<p>conflict and disaster situations, with a view to promoting resilience and psychological 
</p>
<p>healing; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Encourages</i> international cooperation in the realization of the right of the 
</p>
<p>child to engage in play and recreational activities through the active engagement of States, 
</p>
<p>United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, civil society organizations and other 
</p>
<p>international, national and local partners; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Recommends</i> that the celebration of the International Day of Sport for 
</p>
<p>Development and Peace emphasize, through specific events, the right of the child to engage 
</p>
<p>in play and recreational activities.
