<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also</i> article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which stipulates that 
everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in that Declaration, without 
distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth or other status, and that no distinction should be made on

 <p></p>
<p><i> Aware</i> of the responsibility of the international community to promote human rights and 
ensure respect for international law,  
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> the particularity of Occupied East Jerusalem in its rich religious and cultural 
heritage, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>relevant Security Council resolutions on Occupied East Jerusalem,  
</p>
<p><i> Affirming</i> the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of 
Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem,  
</p>
<p><i> Deeply</i> <i>concerned </i>at the Israeli actions undermining the sanctity and inviolability of 
religious sites in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,  
</p>
<p><i> Deeply</i> <i>concerned also </i>at the Israeli policy of closures and the severe restrictions, 
including curfews and the permit regime, that continue to be imposed on the movement of 
Palestinians and their free access to their holy sites, including Al Aqsa Mosque,  
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Stresses </i>that all policies and measures taken by Israel, the occupying Power, to limit 
access of Palestinians to their holy sites, particularly in Occupied East Jerusalem, on the basis of 
national origin, religion, birth, sex or any other status are in violation of the provisions of the 
above-mentioned instruments and resolutions and therefore must cease immediately; 
</p>
<p> 2.<i> Calls upon </i>Israel, the occupying Power, to respect the religious and cultural rights 
enumerated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem, and to allow Palestinian worshippers unfettered access to their 
religious sites; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the Council at its 
</p>
<p>next session on the implementation of the present resolution.
