An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. 
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company’s 
preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness 
of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as 
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion.

0:) Segment Reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance ofthe operating segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors review internal management reports on a monthly basis that is consistent with the
information provided in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of
financial position and statement of cash flows. As a result no reconciliation is required, because the
information as presented is used by the Board to make strategic decisions.
Management has determined, based on the reports reviewed by the Board of Directors and used to make
strategic decisions, that the Group has one reportable segment being mineral exploration. The Group‘s
management and administration office is located in Australia.

(c) Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
items included in the ﬁnancial statements of the Group are measured using the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the Group operates I’the functional currency’l. The functional and
presentation currency ofthe Group is Australian dollars.
Translation and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at
the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date are
translated at the exchange rate existing at reporting date. Exchange differences are recognised in proﬁt or
loss in the period in which they arise.
(d) Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair Value of the consideration received or receivable.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that
future economic benefits will flow to the entity and specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s
activities as described below:
Interest
Revenue is recognised as the interest accrues [using the effective interest method, which is the rate that
exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the
net carrying amount ofthe financial assetl.
(e) Income tax
The income tax expense or revenue for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income
based on the applicable tax rate adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to
temporary differences and to unused tax losses.
Deferred tax
Deferred income taxis provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting
nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and lawsl that have been
enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred
income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is
probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax
assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either
to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Current and deferred taxfor the year
Current and deferred tax is recognised as an expense or income in the statement of profit or loss and other
comprehensive income, except when it relates to items credited or debited directly to equity, in which case
the deferred tax is also recognised directly in equity, or where it arises from the initial accounting for a
business combination, in which case it is taken into account in the determination of goodwill or excess.

FlnanCIal Statements ANNUAL REPORT
For the year ended 30 June 2016
(f) Impairment of assets
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are
tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they
might be impaired. Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount
by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher
ofan asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets lcash- generating units). Non-financial
assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at
each reporting date.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at fair
value, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit] is
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment
loss been recognised for the asset lcash-generating unit) in prior periods. A reversal of an impairment loss is
recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at fair value, in which case the
reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
(g) Cash and cash equivalents
For cash flow statement presentation purposes, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits
held at call with financial institutions, other shortrterm, highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an
insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts.
(h) Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 3030 day terms, are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for
impairment.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Debts that are known to be uncollectible
are written off when identified. An allowance for doubtful debts is raised when there is objective evidence
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the impairment allowance is the difference between the asset‘s carrying amount and the
present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash flows
relating to short-term receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial. The amount of
the impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income within
other expenses.

(i) Financial assets
Other ﬁnancial assets only consist of 'loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and
purpose for which the financial assets were acquired and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market.
Recognition and derecognition
Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date * the date on which the Group commits
to purchase or sell the asset. investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all
financial assets not carried at fair value through the profit or loss. Financial assets are derecognised when the
rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group
has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
subsequent measurement
Loans and receivables are subsequently recorded at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less
impairment.
Impairment
The Group has assessed at reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group
of financial assets is impaired.
if there is evidence of impairment for any of the Group’s financial assets carried at amortised cost, the loss is
measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future
cash flow, excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred. The cash flows are discounted at the
financial assets original effective interest rate. The loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and
other comprehensive income.
0) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition ofthe item.
Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis
so as to write down the net cost or fair value of each asset over its expected useful life to its estimated
residual value.
The estimated useful lives, residual Values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each annual
reporting period. The estimated useful life of the property, plant and equipment as at reporting date is 3
years.

(k) Exploration. evaluation and restoration costs
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation expenditure is stated at cost and is accumulated in respect of each identiﬁable
area of interest.
Such costs are only carried forward in respect of areas of interest for which the rights of tenure are current
and where:
lil such costs are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploitation of
the area of interest or, alternatively, by its sale; or
iii) activities in the area have not at the statement of ﬁnancial position date reached a stage which
permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable
reserves and active and significant operations in, or in relation to the area of interest are
continuing.
All other costs which do not meet these criteria are written off immediately to the statement of profit or loss
and other comprehensive income.
A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to
carry forward costs in relation to that area of interest. Where carried forward expenditure does not satisfy
the policy stated above it is written off to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in
the period in which the decision is made to write-off. Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are
written off to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in the period in which the
decision to abandon the area is made.
Rehabilitation, Restoration and Environmental Casts
Longrterm environmental obligations are based on the Group’s environmental management plans, in
compliance with current environmental and regulatory requirements. There are currently no material
rehabilitation obligations.
(I) Trade and other payables
Trade payables and other accounts payable represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group
prior to the end of the financial period which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid
within 30 days of recognition.
in) Rio Tinto Farm-in agreement
Cash received from Rio Tinto pertaining to the Citadel Farm-in agreement is received in advance. Upon
receipt of the funds a liability is recognised for unexpended exploration contributions. As expenditure is
incurred, the liability is decreased. The cash received in advance by Rio Tinto is held by Antipa Minerals
Limited in the capacity as operator, and is classified as restricted cash. Refer note 10 and 16 for further
details.
in) Contributed equity
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
lncremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a
deduction from the proceeds.

(0) Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the proﬁt attributable to equity holders of the Group,
excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding during the ﬁnancial period, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares
issued during the period.
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the ﬁgures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take
into account the after tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential
ordinary shares and the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been
outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
03) Goods and services tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax lssn, except:
lil where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office
(AToi. in these circumstances the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the
asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
iii) receivables and payables, with the exception of accrued expenses and expense provisions, are
stated with the amount of GST included.
The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the no is included as part of receivables or payables
in the statement of financial position.
Cash flows are included in the cash flow statement on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows
arising from investing and financing activities, which are recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO are
classiﬁed as operating cash flows.
(q) Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of Antipa Minerals
Limited I’company' or 'parent entity') as at 30 June 2015 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then
ended. Antipa Minerals Limited and its subsidiaries together are referred to in this financial report as the group
or the consolidated entity.
Subsidiaries are all those entities over which the consolidated entity has control. The consolidated entity
controls an entity when the consolidated entity is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the
activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the
group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the group.
lntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are
eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment
of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the group.
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated
statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement
of ﬁnancial position respectively.
(r) Leases
Leases in which a signiﬁcant portion ofthe risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the group as
lessee are classified as operating leases. Payments made under the operating leases lnet of any incentives
received from the lessor) are charged to proﬁt and loss on a straight line basis over the period ofthe lease.

(5) Employee benefits
Equity Settled Campensutinn
The Gmup operates equity-settled share»based payment employee option schemes and, subject to
shareholder approval, provides options to Directors from time to time. The fair value of the option to which
Directors and employees become entitled is measured at grant date and recognised as an expense over the
vesting period, with a corresponding increase to an equity account. The fair value of options is ascertained
using an appropriate pricing model which incorporates all market vesting conditions. The number of options
expected to vest is reviewed and adjusted at each reporting date such that the amount recognised for
services received as consideration for the options granted shall be based on the number of options that
eventually vest.
Short-term abligatiuns
Liabilities for salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and sick leave expected to be settled
within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are
recognised in respect of employees' services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the
amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.
The liability for annual leave and sick leave is recognised in the provision for employee benefits. All other
short-term employee benefit obligations are presented as payables.
other lung-term employee benefit obligations
The liability far long service leave and annual leave which is not expected to be settled within 12 manths after
the end of the period in which the employees render the related service is recognised in the provision for
employee benefits and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of
services provided by employees up to the end ofthe reporting period using the projected unit credit method.
Consideration is given to the expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and
periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the end of the reporting
period on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible,
the estimated future cash outflows.

3. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety offinanciai risks: market risk iinciuding currency risk, interest rate
risk and price riski, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial
performance ofthe Group. The Group uses different methods to measure different types of risk to which it is
exposed.
Antipa‘s board of directors (Board) performs the duties of a risk management committee in identifying and
evaluating sources of financial and other risks. The Board provides written principles for overall risk
management which balance the potential adverse effects of financial risks on Antipa’s financial performance
and position with the “upside” potential made possible by exposure to these risks and by taking into account
the costs and expected benefits of the various methods available to manage them.
The Group holds the following financial instruments:

b) Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as
credit exposures to customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying amount of the financial assets as
summarised in part a) of this note.
As at 30 June 2016, all cash and cash equivalents were held with National Australia Bank with an A (Standard
and Poor) credit rating.
5) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management involves the maintenance of sufficient cash, committed credit facilities
and access to capital markets. it is the policy of the Board to ensure that the Group is able to meet its
financial obligations and maintain the flexibility to pursue attractive investment opportunities through
keeping committed credit lines available where possible, ensuring the Group has sufficient working capital
and preserving the 15% share issue limit available to the Group under the ASX Listing Rules. The Group
manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.
Contractual maturities affinunciul liabilities
As at the reporting date the Group had total financial liabilities of $540,333 12015 - $480,695) comprised of
nonrinterest-hearing trade creditors and accruals with a maturity of less than 6 months.
:1) Fair value estimation
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be estimated for recognition and measurement
and/or disclosure purposes.
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate
their fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is
estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is
available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
e) Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising
the potential return to shareholders.

4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
ln preparing this ﬁnancial report the Group has been required to make certain estimates and assumptions
concerning future occurrences. There is an inherent risk that the resulting accounting estimates will not
equate exactly with actual events and results.
a) Significant accountingjudgements
ln the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the followingjudgements,
apart from those involving estimations, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in
the financial statements:
Deferred tax assets
The Group has carried forward tax losses which have not been recognised as deferred tax assets as it is not
considered sufficiently probable that these losses will be recouped by means of future profits taxable in the
appropriate jurisdictions.
Cupitolisotian of exploration and evaluation expenditure
The Group has capitalised significant exploration and evaluation expenditure on the basis either that this is
expected to be recouped through future successful development (or alternatively salel of the Areas of
interest concerned or on the basis that it is not yet possible to assess whether it will be recouped.
b) Significant accounting estimates and assumptions
The carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities are often determined based on estimates and
assumptions of future events. The key estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting
period are:
impairment of assets
The future recoverability of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is dependent on a number of
factors, including whether the Group decides to exploit the related lease itself or, if not, whether it
successfully recovers the related exploration and evaluation asset through sale.
Factors that could impact the future recoverability include the level of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources,
future technological changes, costs of drilling and production, production rates, future legal changes
(including changes to environmental restoration obligations) and changes to commodity prices.
As at 30 June 2016, the carrying value of capitalised exploration and evaluation is $12,754,398 [2015 »
$11,990,325).
share based payment transactions
The fair value of any options issued as remuneration is measured using an appropriate model. Measurement
inputs include share price on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based
on weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information (if
anyll, weighted average expected life of the instruments (based on historical experience and general option
holder behaviourl, expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate (based on government bondsl.
5. SEGMENT INFORMATION
Management has determined that the Group has one reportable segment, being mineral exploration. As the
Group is focused on mineral exploration, the Board monitors the Group based on actual versus budgeted
revenues and expenditure incurred by area of interest. This internal reporting framework is the most
relevant to assist the Board with making decisions regarding the Company and its ongoing exploration
activities, while also taking into consideration the results of exploration work that has been performed to
date.

Antipa Minerals Limited and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax
consolidation legislation.
The head entity, Antipa Minerals Limited, and its controlled entities in the tax consolidated group account for
their own current and deferred tax amounts.
The entities have also entered into a tax funding agreement under which the wholly-owned entities fully
compensate Antipa Minerals Limited for any current tax payable assumed and are compensated by Antipa
Minerals Ltd for any current tax receivable and deferred tax assets relating to unused tax losses or unused tax
credits that are transferred to Antipa Minerals Limited under the tax consolidation legislation.
