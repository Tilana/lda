CYPRESS ENERGY PARTNERS, L.P.
Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
1.  Organization and Operations
Cypress Energy Partners, L.P. (the “Partnership”) is a Delaware limited partnership formed
in 2013 to provide independent pipeline inspection and integrity services to producers
and pipeline companies and to provide saltwater disposal (“SWD”) and other water and
environmental services to U.S. onshore oil and natural gas producers and trucking
companies.  Trading of our common units began January 15, 2014 on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol “CELP.” At our Initial Public Offering (“IPO”), 4,312,500 of our
outstanding 5,939,108 common units were made available to the general public. The
remaining common units and 100% of the subordinated units are constructively owned by
affiliates, employees and directors of the Partnership.
Our business is organized into the Pipeline Inspection Services (“PIS”), Integrity Services
(“IS”) and Water and Environmental Services (“W&ES”) reportable segments.  In
conjunction with our acquisition of a 51% interest in Brown Integrity, LLC (see Note 3), we
changed our reportable segments during the second quarter of 2015 by adding the IS
segment (see Note 11). In addition, the Pipeline Inspection and Integrity Services segment
was renamed Pipeline Inspection Services. PIS provides pipeline inspection and other
services to energy exploration and production (“E&P”) and mid-stream companies and
their vendors throughout the United States and Canada.  The inspectors of PIS perform a
variety of inspection services on midstream pipelines, gathering systems and distribution
systems, including data gathering and supervision of third-party construction, inspection,
and maintenance and repair projects.
IS provides independent integrity services to major natural gas and petroleum pipeline
companies, as well as pipeline construction companies located throughout the United
States. Field personnel in this segment primarily perform hydrostatic testing on newly
constructed and existing natural gas and petroleum pipelines.
W&ES provides services to oil and natural gas producers and trucking companies
through its ownership and operation of eight commercial SWD facilities in the Bakken
Shale region of the Williston Basin in North Dakota (two of which have temporarily
suspended operations) and two in the Permian Basin in Texas.  All of the facilities utilize
specialized equipment and remote monitoring to minimize downtime and increase
efficiency for peak utilization.  These facilities also contain oil skimming processes that
remove any remaining oil from water delivered to the sites.  In addition to these SWD
facilities, we provide management and staffing services for a third-party SWD facility
pursuant to a management agreement (see Note 8).  We also own a 25% member interest
in the managed SWD facility.

the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 include our accounts and those
of our controlled subsidiaries. Investments where we do not have the ability to exercise
control, but do have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for using
the equity method of accounting. All significant intercompany transactions and account
balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015 is derived from audited financial statements. We have
made certain reclassifications to the prior period financial statements to conform with
classification methods used in the current fiscal year. These reclassifications have had the
effect of reducing previously reported total assets and total liabilities as the adoption of
required accounting guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
necessitated changes in the presentation of certain assets and liabilities.
The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States (“GAAP”) for interim consolidated financial information and in accordance with the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments considered
necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the
interim periods presented.  Such adjustments consist only of normal recurring items,
unless otherwise disclosed herein.  Accordingly, the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements do not include all the information and notes required by GAAP for
complete consolidated financial statements.  However, we believe that the disclosures
made are adequate to make the information not misleading.  These interim Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with our
audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in
our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The results of
operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for a full year.

Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of the Partnership’s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and
accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant Accounting Policies
Our significant accounting policies are consistent with those disclosed in Note 2 included
in our audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Income Taxes
A publicly-traded partnership is required to generate at least 90% of its gross income (as
defined for federal income tax purposes) from certain qualifying sources.  At least 90% of
our gross income has been qualifying income since our IPO.
As a limited partnership, we generally are not subject to federal, state or local income
taxes.  The tax related to the Partnership’s net income (loss) is generally attributable to the
individual partners.  Net income (loss) for financial statement purposes may differ
significantly from taxable income (loss) of the partners as a result of differences between
the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and the taxable income
allocation requirements under our partnership agreement.  The aggregated difference in
the basis of our net assets for financial and tax reporting purposes cannot be readily
determined because information regarding each partners’ tax attributes in us is not
available to us. The Partnership’s Canadian activity remains taxable in Canada, as well as
the activities of a wholly owned subsidiary, Tulsa Inspection Resources – PUC, LLC (“TIR-
PUC”) and a 51% owned and controlled subsidiary, Brown Integrity – PUC, LLC (“Brown-
PUC”), both of which have elected to be taxed as corporations for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.  Consequently, the Partnership records income tax expense for our Canadian
operations, our U.S. corporate operations and any state income and franchise taxes
specifically applicable to the Partnership
Non-controlling Interest
We have certain consolidated subsidiaries in which outside parties own interests. The
non-controlling interest shown in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements represents the other owners’ share of these entities.
Identifiable Intangible Assets
Our recorded identifiable intangible assets primarily include customer lists, trademarks
and trade names.  Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their
estimated useful lives, which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute
directly or indirectly to our future cash flows.  We have no indefinite-lived intangibles other
than goodwill.  The determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and the
estimated useful lives are based on an analysis of all pertinent factors including (1) the use
of widely-accepted valuation approaches, the income approach, or the cost approach, (2)
our expected use of the asset, (3) the expected useful life of related assets, (4) any legal,
regulatory, or contractual provisions, including renewal or extension periods that would
cause substantial costs or modifications to existing agreements, and (5) the effects of
demand, competition, and other economic factors.  Should any of the underlying
assumptions indicate that the value of the intangible assets might be impaired, we may be
required to reduce the carrying value and subsequent useful life of the asset.  If the
underlying assumptions governing the amortization of an intangible asset were later
determined to have significantly changed, we may be required to adjust the amortization
period of such asset to reflect any new estimate of its useful life.  Any write-down of the
value or unfavorable change in the useful life of an intangible asset would increase
expense at that time.  There were no impairments of identifiable intangible assets during
the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 or 2015.

Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual review on November 1 (or at other
dates if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill
may be impaired) for impairment at a reporting unit level.  The reporting unit or units used
to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the
manner in which the business is managed or operated.  A reporting unit is an operating
segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment.  We have
determined that PIS, IS and W&ES are the appropriate reporting units for testing goodwill
impairment.  The accounting estimate relative to assessing the impairment of goodwill is a
critical accounting estimate for each of our reportable segments. During the second
quarter of 2016, we recorded impairments of goodwill in our IS segment totaling $8.4
million (Note 5). There were no impairments of goodwill during the three and six month
periods ended June 30, 2015.
Impairments of Long-Lived Assets
We assess property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.
Such indicators include, among others, the nature of the asset, the projected future
economic benefit of the asset, changes in regulatory and political environments and
historical and future cash flow and profitability measurements. If the carrying value of an
asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, we recognize
an impairment charge for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair
value. Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves
management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as future commodity prices, the
effects of inflation on operating expenses and the outlook for national or regional market
supply and demand for the services we provide. We recorded impairments of $2.1 million
to long-lived assets in the quarter ended June 30, 2016 (Note 5). There were no recorded
impairments of long-lived assets for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015.
New Accounting Standards
The Partnership has adopted the following new accounting standards issued by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) beginning January 1, 2016:
The FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-17 – Income Taxes in
November 2015. ASU 2015-17 was issued as a part of the FASB’s initiative to reduce
complexity in accounting standards. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2016 with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of
an annual reporting period. The Partnership has elected early application of this guidance
beginning January 1, 2016. The guidance simplifies the presentation of deferred income
taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a
classified consolidated balance sheet. Therefore, the Partnership’s deferred tax assets
and liabilities have been classified as noncurrent in the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods presented.
Business Combinations – ASU 2015-16 was issued by the FASB in September 2015.
Essentially, the amendments in the ASU require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to
provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting
period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This will require the Partnership
to disclose, by line item, current period earnings adjustments to amounts that otherwise
would have been recorded in previous reporting periods as if the adjustment(s) had been
recognized as of the acquisition date beginning with fiscal periods after December 15,
2015. The implementation of this ASU has not affected the Partnership’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.
The FASB issued ASU 2015-06 – Earnings Per Share in April 2015. The amendments in
this update specify that for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit under the
two-class method, the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date of a
dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner. The
amendments should be applied retrospectively for all financial statements presented. The
Partnership adopted this ASU effective for fiscal and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2015. The adoption of this ASU has not materially impacted our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
The FASB issued ASU 2015-05 – Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software
in April 2015 as part of its simplification initiative. The amendments in this ASU provide
guidance to customers for license fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The
effective date for adoption of this ASU for public companies is for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2015. As a result, the Partnership adopted this guidance as
of January 1, 2016 and its adoption has not materially impacted our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.
The FASB issued ASU 2015-03 – Interest – Imputation of Interest in April 2015. This
guidance requires debt issuance costs related to long-term debt be presented on the
balance sheet as a reduction of the carrying amount of the long-term debt. The
Partnership has adopted this guidance beginning January 1, 2016. As a result of the
adoption of this ASU, we have been required to net the Partnership’s debt issuance costs
against long-term debt for all periods presented, moving the debt issuance costs from
noncurrent assets to noncurrent liabilities on the Partnership’s Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods presented.

CYPRESS ENERGY PARTNERS, L.P.
Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Other accounting guidance proposed by the FASB that may have some impact on the
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Partnership, but have not
yet been adopted by the Partnership include:
The FASB issued ASU 2016-09 – Compensation – Stock Compensation in March 2016.
The purpose of the guidance is to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-
based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of
awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The
amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
and all interim periods within that year. Although early adoption is permitted, the
Partnership has not adopted this guidance early. We are currently in the process of
determining the impact this guidance may have on the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements of the Partnership, but do not expect the adoption of
this guidance to materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The FASB issued ASU 2016-02 – Leases in February 2016. This guidance was proposed in
an attempt to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by
recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key
information about leasing arrangements. The main difference between previous GAAP
and this new guidance is the recognition on the balance sheet lease assets and lease
liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We
are currently examining the guidance provided in the ASU and determining the impact this
guidance will have on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
The FASB issued ASU 2014-09 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers in May 2014.
ASU 2014-09 is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and develop a
common standard for recognizing revenue for GAAP and International Financial
Reporting Standards that is applicable to all organizations. The Partnership was originally
required to comply with this ASU beginning in 2017. However, in August 2015, the FASB
issued ASU 2015- 14 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers effectively delaying the
Partnership’s implementation of this standard for one year to periods beginning after
December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the financial impact of this ASU on the
Partnership, but do not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will materially impact our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
3. Acquisitions
Brown Integrity, LLC
In May 2015, the Partnership acquired a 51% interest in Brown Integrity, LLC (“Brown”), a
hydrostatic testing integrity services business for $10.4 million (net of cash acquired)
financed through the Partnership’s credit facilities. The Partnership has the right, but not
the obligation, to acquire the remaining 49% of Brown in any combination of cash and/or
units commencing May 1, 2017 pursuant to a formula prescribed in the purchase
document. The operating results of Brown are included in our Integrity Services segment
which was created during the second quarter of 2015 in conjunction with the Brown
acquisition (Note 11).
TIR Entities
Effective February 1, 2015, the Partnership acquired the remaining 49.9% interest in the
TIR Entities previously held by affiliates of Cypress Energy Holdings, LLC (“Holdings”) for
$52.6 million. We financed this acquisition with borrowings under our acquisition revolving
credit facility (Note 4).

Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
4.  Credit Agreement
The Partnership is party to a credit agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) that
provides up to $200.0 million in borrowing capacity, subject to certain limitations. The
Credit Agreement includes a working capital revolving credit facility (“WCRCF”), which
provides up to $75.0 million in borrowing capacity to fund working capital needs and an
acquisition revolving credit facility (“ARCF”), which provides up to $125.0 million in
borrowing capacity to fund acquisitions and expansion projects. In addition, the Credit
Agreement provides for an accordion feature that allows us to increase the availability
under the facilities by an additional $125.0 million. The Credit Agreement matures
December 24, 2018.
Outstanding borrowings at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 under the Credit
Agreement were as follows:
Working Capital Revolving Credit Facility
Acquisition Revolving Credit Facility
Total borrowings
Debt issuance costs
Long-term debt

      88,900
      140,900
)     (1,771
    $139,129
)
The carrying value of the partnership’s long-term debt approximates fair value as the
borrowings under the Credit Agreement are considered to be priced at market for debt
instruments having similar terms and conditions (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).
Borrowings under the WCRCF are limited by a monthly borrowing base calculation as
defined in the Credit Agreement. If, at any time, outstanding borrowings under the WCRCF
exceed the Partnership’s calculated borrowing base, principal in the amount of the excess
is due upon submission of the borrowing base calculation. Available borrowings under
the ARCF may be limited by certain financial covenant ratios as defined in the Credit
Agreement. The obligations under our Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien
on substantially all assets of the Partnership.
All borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, on a leveraged
based grid pricing at (i) a base rate plus a margin of 1.25% to 2.75% per annum (“Base
Rate Borrowing”) or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.25% to 3.75% per annum
(“LIBOR Borrowings”). The applicable margin is determined based on the leverage ratio of
the Partnership, as defined in the Credit Agreement. Generally, the interest rate on Credit
Agreement borrowings ranged between 3.54% and 4.22% for the six months ended June
30, 2016 and 2.68% and 4.04% for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Interest on Base
Rate Borrowings is payable monthly. Interest on LIBOR Borrowings is paid upon maturity
of the underlying LIBOR contract, but no less often than quarterly. Commitment fees are
charged at a rate of 0.50% on any unused credit and are payable quarterly. Interest paid
during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.4 million and $1.1 million,
respectively, including commitment fees. Interest paid during the six months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015 was $2.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively, including commitment
fees.
Our Credit Agreement contains various customary affirmative and negative covenants and
restrictive provisions. It also requires maintenance of certain financial covenants,
including a combined total adjusted leverage ratio (as defined in our Credit Agreement) of
not more than 4.0 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio (as defined in our Credit
Agreement) of not less than 3.0 to 1.0. At June 30, 2016, our total adjusted leverage ratio
was 3.33 to 1.0 and our interest coverage ratio was 3.80 to 1.0, pursuant to the Credit
Agreement. Without Holding's reimbursement of Partnership operating expenses and
temporary waiver of the administrative fee, our adjusted leverage ratio would have been
higher. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, subject to
the terms and conditions of our Credit Agreement, the lenders may declare any
outstanding principal of our Credit Agreement debt, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, to be immediately due and payable and may exercise the other remedies set forth
or referred to in our Credit Agreement. With continued support from Holdings, we expect
to remain in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants throughout the next twelve
months.
In addition, our Credit Agreement restricts our ability to make distributions on, or redeem
or repurchase, our equity interests. However, we may make distributions of available cash
so long as, both at the time of the distribution and after giving effect to the distribution, no
default exists under our Credit Agreement, the borrowers and the guarantors are in
compliance with the financial covenants, the borrowing base (which includes 100% of
cash on hand) exceeds the amount of outstanding credit extensions under the WCRCF by
at least $5.0 million and at least $5.0 million in lender commitments are available to be
drawn under the WCRCF.

5. Impairments
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership recorded goodwill
impairments in our IS segment totaling $8.4 million and property and equipment
impairments at one of our SWD facilities in our W&ES segment totaling $2.1 million.
In the IS segment, we have experienced declining revenues that accelerated in the second
quarter of 2016 due to the overall depressed energy economy, including decreased new
infrastructure construction, postponement of inspection and integrity activity by our E&P
customers and reduced revenues and margins on completed contracts due to increased
competition, among other things. The Partnership is forecasting that volumes of work and
revenue will not recover to historical levels in the foreseeable future and has taken action
in the second quarter of 2016 to adjust its cost structure through a reduction of personnel
and the closing of an office location. Given these indicators of impairment in the second
quarter of 2016, we determined a triggering event occurred and thus, performed an interim
impairment assessment of the approximately $10.0 million of goodwill related to our IS
segment. The IS segment is considered to be a stand-alone reporting unit for purposes of
evaluating goodwill. We estimated the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing the income
approach (discounted cash flows) valuation method, which is a Level 3 input as defined in
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. Significant inputs in the valuation included projections
of future revenues, anticipated operating costs and appropriate discount rates. To
estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and the implied fair value of goodwill under a
hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit, we assumed a tax structure where a buyer
would obtain a step-up in the tax basis of the net assets acquired. Significant assumptions
used in valuing the reporting unit included revenue growth rates ranging from 2% to 5%
annually and a discount rate of 17.5%. In our assessment as of June 30, 2016, the carrying
value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeded its estimated fair value. We then
determined through our hypothetical acquisition analysis that the fair value of goodwill
was impaired. As a result, the Partnership recorded an impairment loss of $8.4 million in
our IS segment and reduced the value of recorded goodwill to $1.6 million in the second
quarter of 2016. This impairment is included in impairments on the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
In the W&ES segment, the Partnership has experienced declining disposal volumes and
revenues at certain facilities due to reduced drilling activity in the areas we service, lower
commodity pricing and increasing competition. The Partnership is forecasting that
volumes and revenues will not recover to historical levels in the foreseeable future. Given
these indicators of impairment, the Partnership compared its estimate of undiscounted
future cash flows from individual facilities, and determined that its recorded value on one
facility was no longer recoverable, and was therefore impaired. The Partnership wrote the
SWD facility assets down from its net carrying value of $2.7 million to $0.6 million and
recognized impairments of the facility of $2.1 million – included in impairments on the
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016. The following table shows the impaired assets by category (in
thousands):
Land
 $771  
Facilities, well and equipment   1,287 
   305  
Other depreciable assets
 
   2,363 
   (289 )
Accumulated depreciation
Impairment of facility
 $2,075
Fair value was determined using expected future cash flows using the income approach
(discounted cash flow) valuation method, which is a Level 3 input as defined in ASC 820,
Fair Value Measurement. The cash flows are those expected to be generated by market
participants, discounted for a risk adjusted estimated fair market cost of capital of 15.5%.
Cash flows were determined based on various assumptions including estimates of future
volumes, prices, cost structure, capital maintenance requirements and salvage value.
Because of the uncertainties surrounding the facilities and the market conditions,
including the Partnership’s ability to generate and maintain sufficient revenues to operate
its segments profitably, our estimate of expected future cash flows may change in the near
term resulting in the need to record additional impairment related to our W&ES segment
property and equipment.
6. Income Taxes
Income tax expense reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for
the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 differs from an expected
statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the non-taxable nature of partnership earnings for
both U.S. federal and, in most cases, state income tax purposes, offset by the corporate
income taxes of TIR-PUC and Brown-PUC, the income taxes related to our Canadian
operations and any applicable state income and franchise taxes.

7.  Equity Compensation
Our General Partner adopted a long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) that authorized the
issuance of up to 1,182,600 common units.  Certain directors and employees of the
Partnership have been awarded Phantom Restricted Units (“Units”) under the terms of the
LTIP.  The fair value of the awards issued is determined based on the quoted market value
of the publically traded common units at each grant date, adjusted for a forfeiture rate, and
other discounts attributable to the awarded units.  This valuation is considered a Level 3
valuation under the fair value measurement hierarchy.  Compensation expense is
amortized over the vesting period of the grant. For the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, compensation expense of $0.5 million was recorded under the LTIP.  The
following table sets forth the LTIP Unit activity for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015:

Outstanding Units issued to directors vest ratably over a three-year period from the date of
grant.  Units granted to employees vest over either a five-year, three-year or eighteen
month period from the date of grant. For the five year awards, one third vests at the end of
the third year, one third at the end of the fourth year and one third at the end of the fifth
year. The eighteen month awards vest 100% at the end of the vesting period. Some awards
vest in full upon the occurrence of certain events as defined in the LTIP agreement.
Certain phantom profits interest units issued under a previous LTIP were exchanged for
44,250 Units under the Partnership’s LTIP. Vesting under all of the exchanged awards was
retroactive to the initial grant date. The awards are considered for all purposes to have
been granted under the Partnership’s LTIP. Certain profits interest units previously issued
were converted into 44,451 subordinated units of the Partnership outside of the LTIP. 
Vesting for the subordinated units is retroactive to the initial grant date.  Compensation
expense associated with these subordinated units was $0.1 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

8.  Related-Party Transactions
Transactions with SBG Energy Services, LLC (SBG Energy) and Subsidiary
SBG Energy was a business partner in our SWD operations in which a former board
member had an ownership and management interest. This former board member resigned
effective March 31, 2016. Effective June 1, 2015, an affiliate of SBG Energy assigned and
transferred its 49% membership interest in Cypress Energy Services, LLC (“CES LLC”) to
the Partnership for one dollar (the “CES Transaction”). As a result, the Partnership now
owns 100% of CES LLC.
Omnibus Agreement and Other Support from Holdings
Effective as of the closing of the IPO, we entered into an omnibus agreement with Holdings
and other related parties. The omnibus agreement, as amended in February 2015, governs
the following matters, among other things:
●
our payment of a quarterly administrative fee in the amount of $1.0 million to Holdings for
providing certain partnership overhead services, including certain executive management
services by certain officers of our General Partner, and payroll services for substantially all
employees required to manage and operate our businesses. This fee also includes the
incremental general and administrative expenses we incur as a result of being a publicly
traded partnership. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, Holdings has provided
sponsor support to the Partnership by waiving payment of the quarterly administrative fee. The
waiving of the administrative fee will likely continue through the end of 2016 or such earlier
time that our business results improve, as determined by Holdings;
●our right of first offer on Holdings’ and its subsidiaries’ assets used in, and entities primarily
engaged in, providing SWD and other water and environmental services; and
●
indemnification of us by Holdings for certain environmental and other liabilities, including
events and conditions associated with the operation of assets that occurred prior to the closing
of the IPO and our obligation to indemnify Holdings for events and conditions associated with
the operation of our assets that occur after the closing of the IPO and for environmental
liabilities related to our assets to the extent Holdings is not required to indemnify us.
So long as Holdings controls our General Partner, the omnibus agreement will remain in
full force and effect, unless we and Holdings agree to terminate it sooner.  If Holdings
ceases to control our General Partner, either party may terminate the omnibus agreement,
provided that the indemnification obligations will remain in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.  We and Holdings may agree to amend the omnibus
agreement; however, amendments will also require the approval of the Conflicts
Committee of our Board of Directors.
The amount charged by Holdings under the Omnibus Agreement for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2015 was $1.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively. These
amounts are reflected in general and administrative in the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were no payments made under the
omnibus agreement for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
To the extent that Holdings incurs expenses on behalf of the Partnership in excess of
administrative expense amounts paid under the omnibus agreement, the excess is
allocated to the Partnership as a non-cash allocated cost. The non-cash allocated
amounts are reflected as general and administrative expenses in the Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and as a contribution attributable to
general partner in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Owners’ Equity.
These costs are included as a component of net loss attributable to general partner in the
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. Non-cash allocated costs
reflected in the Partnership’s financial statements were $0.9 million and $1.9 million,
respectively, for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016. Non-cash allocated
expenses were $0.2 million for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015.
In addition to funding certain general and administrative expenses on our behalf, during
the second quarter of 2016, Holdings contributed $2.0 million in cash attributable to the
General Partner as a reimbursement of certain expenditures previously incurred by the
Partnership. This payment is reflected as a contribution attributable to general partner in
the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Owners’ Equity and as a component
of the net loss attributable to the general partner in the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and six month periods ended June 30,

Other Related Party Transactions
A former board member had ownership interests in entities with which the Partnership
transacts business – Creek Energy Services, LLC (“Creek,” formerly Rud Transportation,
LLC) and SBG Pipeline SW 3903, LLC (“3903”).  Total revenue recognized by the
Partnership from Creek while it was considered a related party was $0.4 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2015 and $0.1 million and $0.8 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Accounts receivable from Creek was $0.1
million at December 31, 2015 and is included in trade accounts receivable, net in the
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total revenue recognized by the
Partnership from 3903 while it was considered a related party was $0.3 million for the three
months and $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 prior to the sale of the
ownership interest to an unrelated third party effective June 30, 2015. CES LLC
outsources staffing and payroll services to an unconsolidated affiliated entity, Cypress
Energy Management – Bakken Operations, LLC (“CEM-BO”). CEM-BO was owned 49% by
SBG Energy. Effective June 1, 2015, Holdings acquired the 49% ownership interest of
CEM-BO and now owns 100% of CEM-BO. Total employee related costs paid to CEM-BO
was $0.4 million for the three months and $1.1 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015.
The Partnership provides management services to a 25% owned investee company, Alati
Arnegard, LLC (“Arnegard”).  Management fee revenue earned from Arnegard totaled $0.1
million for the three months and $0.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
respectively and $0.2 million for the three months and $0.3 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015, respectively.  Accounts receivable from Arnegard were $0.1 million
at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and are included in trade accounts receivable,
net in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
9.  Earnings per Unit and Cash Distributions
Net income (loss) per unit applicable to limited partners (including subordinated
unitholders) is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to limited partners,
after deducting the General Partner’s incentive distributions, if any, by the weighted-
average number of outstanding common and subordinated units.  Diluted net income
(loss) per common unit includes the dilutive impact of unvested Units granted under the
LTIP.  Our net income (loss) attributable to limited partners is allocated to the common and
subordinated unitholders in accordance with their respective partnership percentages,
after giving effect to priority income allocations for incentive distributions and other
adjustments, if any, to our General Partner, pursuant to our partnership agreement. See
Note 8 for a description of net loss attributable to general partner. The excess or shortfall
of earnings relative to distributions is allocated to the limited partners based on their
respective ownership interests.  Payments made to our unitholders are determined in
relation to actual distributions declared and are not based on the net income allocations
used in the calculation of net income (loss) per unit.  The following table outlines the
weighted average number of shares outstanding for the three and six months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015:

Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
In addition to the common and subordinated units, we have also identified incentive
distribution rights as participating securities and use the two-class method when
calculating the net income per unit applicable to limited partners, which is based on the
weighted-average number of units outstanding during the period.
Our partnership agreement calls for minimum quarterly cash distributions.  The following

10.  Commitments and Contingencies
Letters of Credit
The Partnership has various performance obligations which are secured with short-term
security deposits of $0.5 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, included in
prepaid expenses and other on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Employment Contract Commitments
The Partnership has employment agreements with certain of its executives.  The executive
employment agreements are effective for a term of two-to-five years from the
commencement date, after which time they will continue on an “at-will” basis.  These
agreements provide for minimum annual compensation, adjusted for annual increases as
authorized by the Board of Directors.  Certain agreements provide for severance
payments in the event of specified termination of employment.  At June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the aggregate commitment for future compensation and severance
was approximately $1.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively.
Compliance Audit Contingencies
Certain customer master service agreements (“MSA’s”) offer our customers the
opportunity to perform periodic compliance audits, which include the examination of the
accuracy of our invoices.  Should our invoices be determined to be inconsistent with the
MSA, or inaccurate, the MSA’s may provide the customer the right to receive a credit or
refund for any overcharges identified.  At any given time, we may have multiple audits
underway.  Several multi-year audits concluded in 2015 without adjustment to the
Partnership. At December 31, 2015, the Partnership had an estimated liability of $0.1
million recorded for a specific compliance audit that was settled in the first quarter of 2016.
This 2015 liability is reflected in accrued payroll and other on the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Management Service Contracts
The Partnership has historically provided management services for non-owned SWD
facilities under contractual arrangements. Principals of two of these management services
contract customers (under common control) approached the Partnership about selling
their interest in the managed SWD facilities to the Partnership. Due to a number of factors,
including the depressed energy economy and the proposed asking price for these
facilities, the Partnership was unwilling to enter into a purchase agreement for the
facilities. Subsequently, in May 2015, the Partnership was notified by these principals that
they were terminating the management contracts related to these two facilities. While
management of the Partnership believes that the parties do not have the right to terminate
the agreements pursuant to the terms of the agreements, the termination of these
agreements has resulted in a reduction of management fee revenue and corresponding
labor costs associated with staffing the facilities. Management fee revenues related to
these contracts totaled $0.3 million for the six month period ended June 30, 2015. The
Partnership did not record any revenue related to these contracts during the six months
ended June 30, 2016. The Partnership has commenced litigation and settlement
discussions regarding the improper termination of the agreements. (See Legal
Proceedings.)
Legal Proceedings
On July 3, 2014, a group of former minority shareholders of Tulsa Inspection Resources,
Inc. (“TIR Inc.”, the predecessor of the TIR Entities), formerly an Oklahoma corporation,
filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma
against TIR LLC, members of TIR LLC, and certain affiliates of TIR LLC’s members. TIR
LLC is the successor in interest to TIR Inc., resulting from a merger between the entities
that closed in December 2013 (the “TIR Merger”). The former shareholders of TIR Inc.
claim that they did not receive sufficient value for their shares in the TIR Merger and are
seeking rescission of the TIR Merger or, alternatively, compensatory and punitive
damages. The Partnership is not named as a defendant in this civil action. TIR LLC and the
other defendants have been advised by counsel that the action lacks merit. We believe
that the possibility of the Partnership incurring material losses as a result of this action is
remote. In addition, the Partnership anticipates no disruption in its business operations
related to this action.
20
Table Of Contents
CYPRESS ENERGY PARTNERS, L.P.
Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
In September 2015, Flatland Resources I, LLC and Flatland Resources II, LLC, two of our
management services customers (under common ownership) initiated a civil action in the
District Court for the McKenzie County District of the State of North Dakota against CES
LLC. The customers claim that CES LLC breached the management agreements and
interfered with their business relationships, and seek to rescind the management
agreements and recover any damages. The customers initiated this lawsuit upon
dismissal from federal court due to lack of jurisdiction of CES LLC’s lawsuit against the
customers seeking to enforce the management agreements. CES LLC subsequently filed
an answer and counterclaims, as well as a third party complaint against the principal of the
customers seeking to enforce the management agreements and other injunctive relief, as
well as monetary damages. The court subsequently granted CES’s motion to transfer
venue to the Grand Forks County District Court. We believe that the possibility of the
Partnership incurring material losses as a result of this action is remote.
Internal Revenue Service Audits
In January 2016, the Partnership received notices from the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) that conveyed its intent to audit the consolidated income tax return of TIR Inc. for
the 2012 tax year and audit payroll and payroll tax filings of TIR Inc. for the 2013 tax year.
Currently, the IRS is analyzing provided information in order to complete their audit
procedures. To date, the Partnership has not been informed of any potential adjustments
related to these audits. Based on the terms of the Partnership’s omnibus agreement with
Holdings, Holdings would indemnify the Partnership for certain liabilities (including
income tax liabilities) associated with the operation of assets that occurred prior to the
closing of our IPO should any liabilities arise as a result of these audits. Because of this,
the Partnership believes that the possibility of incurring material losses as a result of these
IRS audits is remote.
11.  Reportable Segments
The Partnership’s operations consist of three reportable segments: (i) Pipeline Inspection
Services (“PIS”), (ii) Integrity Services (“IS”) and (iii) Water and Environmental Services
(“W&ES”).  In conjunction with the Brown acquisition (Note 3) in the second quarter of
2015, we created the IS segment. The economic characteristics of Brown were sufficiently
dissimilar from our existing Pipeline Inspection and Integrity Services segment to result in
the creation of a new segment. The Pipeline Inspection and Integrity Services segment
was renamed Pipeline Inspection Services.
PIS – This segment represents our pipeline inspection services operations.  We aggregate
these operating entities for reporting purposes as they have similar economic
characteristics, including centralized management and processing.  This segment
provides independent inspection services to various energy, public utility and pipeline
companies.  The inspectors in this segment perform a variety of inspection services on
midstream pipelines, gathering systems and distribution systems, including data
gathering and supervision of third-party construction, inspection and maintenance and
repair projects.  Our results in this segment are driven primarily by the number and type of
inspectors performing services for customers and the fees charged for those services,
which depend on the nature and duration of the project.
IS – This segment includes the acquired operations of Brown Integrity, LLC (Note 3). This
segment provides independent integrity services to major natural gas and petroleum
pipeline companies, as well as pipeline construction companies located throughout the
United States. Field personnel in this segment primarily perform hydrostatic testing on
newly constructed and existing natural gas and petroleum pipelines. Results in this
segment are driven primarily by field personnel performing services for customers and the
fees charged for those services, which depend on the nature, scope and duration of the
project.
W&ES – This segment includes the operations of ten SWD facilities (two of which have
temporarily suspended operations), fees related to the management of third party SWD
facilities, as well as an equity ownership in one managed facility.  We aggregate these
operating entities for reporting purposes as they have similar economic characteristics
and have centralized management and processing.  Segment results are driven primarily
by the volumes of produced water and flowback water we inject into our SWD facilities and
the fees we charge for our services.  These fees are charged on a per barrel basis and vary
based on the quantity and type of saltwater disposed, competitive dynamics and
operating costs.  In addition, for minimal marginal cost, we generate revenue by selling
residual oil we recover from the disposed water.
Other – These amounts represent corporate and overhead items not specifically allocable
to the other reportable segments.

12. Condensed Consolidating Financial Information
The following financial information reflects consolidating financial information of the
Partnership and its wholly owned guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries
for the periods indicated. The information is presented in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 3-10 under the SEC’s Regulation S-X. The financial information may
not necessarily be indicative of financial position, results of operations or cash flows had
the guarantor subsidiaries or non-guarantor subsidiaries operated as independent
entities. The Partnership has not presented separate financial and narrative information
for each of the guarantor subsidiaries or non-guarantor subsidiaries because it believes
such financial and narrative information would not provide any additional information that
would be material in evaluating the sufficiency of the guarantor subsidiaries and non-
guarantor subsidiaries. The Partnership anticipates issuing debt securities that will be
fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the guarantor subsidiaries. These debt securities
will be jointly and severally guaranteed by the guarantor subsidiaries. There are no
restrictions on the Partnership’s ability to obtain cash dividends or other distributions of
funds from the guarantor subsidiaries.
The presentation of our Condensed Consolidating Balance Sheet as of December 31,
2015, our Condensed Consolidating Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and our Condensed Consolidating Statement
of Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2015 have been updated to reflect
adjustments between the Guarantors and Eliminations. These adjustments have (i)
reduced the Guarantors’ notes receivable – affiliates and total partners’ capital and the
Parent’s investment in the Guarantors and the total partners’ capital by $1.0 million with
the offset to Eliminations on the Condensed Consolidating Balance Sheet; (ii) reduced the
Guarantors’ comprehensive income by less than $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three
and six month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively, with the offset to Eliminations
on the Condensed Consolidating Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss); and (iii)
adjusted various offsetting items in working capital for the Guarantors and Eliminations in
the Condensed Consolidating Statement of Cash Flows. These changes have had no
impact on the consolidated results as previously reported.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion   and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future
plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance.  The forward-looking statements are
dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control, including
among other things, the risk factors discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q.  Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these
forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences
include, but are not limited to, market prices for oil and natural gas, production volumes,
capital expenditures, weather, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes
and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, all of which are difficult to predict.  In light of these risks,
uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur.  See
“Cautionary Remarks Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in the front of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations contains a discussion of our business, including a general overview of our
properties, our results of operations, our liquidity and capital resources, and our
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk broken down into three
segments: (1) our Pipeline Inspection Services (“PIS segment”)(formerly the Pipeline
Inspection and Integrity Services (“PI&IS”) segment) comprised of our investment in the
TIR Entities – a 50.1% ownership interest in the TIR Entities through February 1, 2015, and
a 100% ownership interest thereafter; (2) our Integrity Services (“IS”) segment, made up of
our 51% ownership interest in Brown Integrity, LLC acquired May 1, 2015 and: (3) our
Water and Environmental Services (“W&ES”) segment, comprised of our wholly-owned
investments in various salt water disposal (“SWD”) facilities and activities related thereto.
The financial information for PIS, IS and W&ES included in “Item 2 – Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” should be
read in conjunction with the interim financial statements and related notes included
elsewhere in this report and prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and our Consolidated Financial Statements for
the year ended December 31, 2015.
Overview
We are a growth-oriented master limited partnership formed in September 2013 to provide
services to the oil and gas industry.  We provide independent pipeline inspection and
integrity services to various energy exploration and production (“E&P”) companies,
public utility companies, and midstream companies and their vendors in our PIS and IS
segments throughout the United States and Canada.  The PIS segment is comprised of
the operations of the TIR Entities and the IS segment is comprised of the operations of
Brown.  The economic characteristics of Brown are sufficiently dissimilar from our
Pipeline Inspection Services segment resulting in a different, distinct segment. As such,
the previous Pipeline Inspection and Integrity Services segment was renamed Pipeline
Inspection Services and the Integrity Services segment was created upon the acquisition
of Brown in May 2015. We also provide SWD and other water and environmental services
to U.S. onshore oil and natural gas producers and trucking companies through our W&ES
segment.  The W&ES segment is comprised of the historical operations of CEP LLC that
were contributed to us.  We own ten SWD facilities, eight of which are in the Bakken Shale
region of the Williston Basin in North Dakota and two of which are in the Permian Basin in
west Texas.  We also have management agreements in place to provide staffing and
management services to third party SWD facilities in the Bakken Shale region.  W&ES
customers are oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and trucking
companies operating in the regions that we serve.  In all of our business segments, we
work closely with our customers to help them comply with increasingly complex and strict
environmental and safety rules and regulations applicable to production and pipeline
operations, assisting in reducing their operating costs.
Ownership
As of June 30, 2016, Holdings owns approximately 58.7% of the Partnership, while
affiliates of Holdings own approximately 5.7% of the Partnership, for a total ownership
percentage of the Partnership of approximately 64.4% by Holdings and its affiliates.
Affiliates of Holdings also own 100% of the General Partner and the incentive distribution
rights (“IDR’s”).

Table Of Contents
Omnibus Agreement
We are party to an omnibus agreement with Holdings and other related parties. The
omnibus agreement, as amended in February 2015, governs the following matters, among
other things:
●
our payment of a quarterly administrative fee in the amount of $1.0 million to Holdings for
providing certain partnership overhead services, including certain executive management
services by certain officers of our General Partner, and payroll services for substantially all
employees required to manage and operate our businesses. This fee also includes the
incremental general and administrative expenses we incur as a result of being a publicly
traded partnership. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, Holdings has provided
sponsor support to the Partnership by waiving payment of the quarterly administrative fee. The
waiving of the administrative fee will likely continue through the end of 2016 or such earlier
time that our business results improve, as determined by Holdings;
●our right of first offer on Holdings’ and its subsidiaries’ assets used in, and entities primarily
engaged in, providing SWD and other water and environmental services; and
indemnification of us by Holdings for certain environmental and other liabilities, including
indemnification of us by Holdings for certain environmental and other liabilities, including
events and conditions associated with the operation of assets that occurred prior to the closing
of the IPO and our obligation to indemnify Holdings for events and conditions associated with
the operation of our assets that occur after the closing of the IPO and for environmental
liabilities related to our assets to the extent Holdings is not required to indemnify us.
●
So long as Holdings controls our General Partner, the omnibus agreement will remain in
full force and effect, unless we and Holdings agree to terminate it sooner.  If Holdings
ceases to control our General Partner, either party may terminate the omnibus agreement,
provided that the indemnification obligations will remain in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.  We and Holdings may agree to amend the omnibus
agreement; however, amendments will also require the approval of the conflicts
committee.
Pipeline Inspection Services
We generate revenue in the PIS segment primarily by providing inspection services on
midstream pipelines, gathering systems and distribution systems, including data
gathering and supervision of third-party construction, inspection, and maintenance and
repair projects.  Our results in this segment are driven primarily by the number of
inspectors that perform services for our customers and the fees that we charge for those
services, which depend on the type and number of inspectors used on a particular project,
the nature of the project and the duration of the project.  The number of inspectors
engaged on projects is driven by the type of project, prevailing market rates, the age and
condition of customers’ midstream pipelines, gathering systems and distribution systems
and the legal and regulatory requirements relating to the inspection and maintenance of
those assets.  We charge our customers on a per project basis, including per diem
charges, mileage and other reimbursement items.
Integrity Services
We generate revenue in our IS segment primarily by providing hydrostatic testing services
to major natural gas and petroleum companies and pipeline construction companies of
newly constructed and existing natural gas and petroleum pipelines. We generally charge
our customers in this segment on a fixed bid basis depending on the size and length of
the pipeline being inspected, the complexity of services provided and the utilization of our
work force and equipment. Our results in this segment are driven primarily by the number
of field personnel that perform services for our customers and the fees that we charge for
those services, which depend on the type and number of field personnel used on a
particular project, the type of equipment used and the fees charged for the utilization of
that equipment, the nature and the duration of the project.
Water and Environmental Services
We generate revenue in the W&ES segment primarily by treating flowback and produced
water and injecting the saltwater into our SWD facilities.  Our results in W&ES are driven
primarily by the volumes of produced water and flowback water we inject into our SWD
facilities and the fees we charge for our services.  These fees are charged on a per barrel
basis under contracts that are short-term in nature and vary based on the quantity and
type of saltwater disposed, competitive dynamics and operating costs.  In addition, for
minimal marginal cost, we generate revenue by selling residual oil we recover from the
flowback and produced water.  We also generate revenue managing SWD facilities for a
fee.  Revenues in this segment are recognized when the service is performed and
collectability of fees is reasonably assured.
The volumes of saltwater disposed at our SWD facilities are driven by water volumes
generated from existing oil and natural gas wells during their useful lives and development
drilling and production volumes from the wells located near our facilities.  Producers’
willingness to engage in new drilling is determined by a number of factors, the most
important of which are the prevailing and projected prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs, the
cost to drill and operate a well, the availability and cost of capital and environmental and
governmental regulations.  We generally expect the level of drilling to positively correlate
with long-term trends in prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs.  Similarly, oil and natural gas
production levels nationally and regionally generally tend to positively correlate with
drilling activity.
36
Table Of Contents
We also generate revenues from the sales of residual oil recovered during the saltwater
treatment process.  Our ability to recover residual oil is dependent upon the residual oil
content in the saltwater we treat, which is, among other things, a function of water type,
chemistry, source and temperature.  Generally, where outside temperatures are lower,
there is less residual oil content and separation is more difficult.  Thus, our residual oil
recovery during the winter season is usually lower than our recovery during the summer
season in North Dakota.  Additionally, residual oil content will decrease if, among other
things, producers begin recovering higher levels of residual oil in saltwater prior to
delivering such saltwater to us for treatment.
Outlook
Overall
Our 2016 second quarter operating performance was effectively flat as compared to the
first quarter of 2016. Fortunately, the Partnership’s businesses do not require substantial
capital expenditures. We finished the quarter with a strong balance sheet and $23.6 million
of cash and continue to have ample liquidity under our credit facility. Additionally, the
subordinated nature of approximately 50% of our limited partner units protects common
unitholders who will have the right to receive available cash distributions up to the
minimum quarterly distributions before the subordinated unitholders during the
subordination period. Pursuant to our Partnership Agreement, the subordination period
will extend at least through the payment of our distribution for the period ending
December 31, 2016.
Our sponsor and its affiliates are aligned with our common unitholders, with an
approximate 64.4% total ownership interest in us. Because of this ownership alignment,
Holdings has committed its support to the unitholders by contributing $2.0 million to the
Partnership for the reimbursement of certain Partnership operating expenses and
providing temporary relief of the administrative fee paid to our sponsor pursuant to the
Omnibus Agreement, which would have charged $1.0 million to us this quarter. Temporary
relief of the administrative fee paid to Holdings pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement will
likely continue throughout 2016 or such earlier time that our business results improve, as
determined by Holdings. Holdings has not committed to support the Partnership beyond
2016 regardless of whether the energy industry rebounds or not and will continue to
evaluate this relief of the administrative fee. Without Holding’s reimbursement of such
Partnership operating expenses and temporary waiver of the administrative fee, we would
not have sustained our distribution level in the second quarter of 2016.
During the second quarter of 2016, we initiated the implementation of various cost cutting
measures (more fully described in the March 31, 2016 Form 10-Q filed May 16, 2016)
intended to reduce our expenses and improve our overall operating performance in an
attempt to right-size our businesses and protect our current liquidity and our future
distributions to unitholders. These cost savings initiatives should save us approximately
$5.0 million annually. These actions contributed to some of the sequential improvement in
the second quarter of 2016 and should continue to benefit the remainder of 2016 and
beyond.
Recently, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) proposed rulemaking to revise the pipeline safety
regulations for onshore gas transmission and gathering pipelines. Essentially, the
proposal would broaden the scope of monitoring, testing and repairing pipes, as well as
the types of assets subject to protocols. In addition to expanding the coverage to
gathering pipelines, PHMSA is also proposing to delete the “grandfather clause” and
require all gas transmission pipelines constructed before 1970 be subjected to a
hydrostatic spike pressure test. Currently, pipes built before 1970 are exempted from
certain pipeline safety regulations, e.g., a requirement to pressure test the pipeline and
verify its integrity to establish maximum allowable operating pressure (“MAOP”). This
could result in a significant increase in testing, as approximately 60% of total U.S. natural
gas pipelines were installed prior to 1970 according to a study commissioned by The
INGAA Foundation, Inc. Additionally, PHMSA would like to expand protocols to include
pipelines located in areas of medium population density or Moderate Consequence Area
(“MCA”). If passed, this would likely require integrity management, material documentation
verification, as well as MAOP verification for pipes in these areas. PHMSA estimates that
approximately 41,000 miles of MCA pipe would require an assessment within 15 years
under this proposed rule. Pipeline inspection and integrity services are federally
mandated to protect our nation’s critical energy infrastructure. These new proposed rules
could materially benefit our PIS and IS businesses if enacted.
Pipeline Inspection Services
Subsequent to the end of the second quarter of 2016, our average weekly inspector
headcounts have increased, with July average headcounts exceeding 1,200. We have
seen significant growth in our technician headcounts in our non-destructive examination
service offering, which provides stronger margins than our typical inspection business
and we also have seen growth in our inline inspection service offering. We also continue
to renew several sizeable existing contracts.
Integrity Services
In the first half of 2016, our IS results were quite soft through mid-June when we saw an
increase in activity and utilization of our field personnel in this segment. We have lowered
our bid margins in this segment to support our customers and make us more fiscally
competitive. Our backlog remains solid heading into the third quarter and we continue to
bid on a substantial amount of new work.
Water and Environmental Services
We continue to work collaboratively with our customers to help them address the
downturn in commodity prices and their need to reduce operating expenses until prices
recover. We also continue to carefully evaluate market pricing on a facility-by-facility basis.
In response to these conditions, we have temporarily closed an additional facility in the
Bakken and have automated our remaining facilities. These cost savings steps, in addition
to those previously discussed, should yield an additional $0.5 million of savings on an
annualized basis. A substantial number of drilled and uncompleted wells (“DUC’s”) exist
around our various SWD facilities. As oil and gas commodity prices improve, we expect to
benefit materially from the completion of these DUC’s.

Table Of Contents
Results of Operations
Factors Impacting Comparability
The historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable,
either to each other or to our future results of operations, for the reasons described below:
●
●
The quarterly administrative fee assessed by Holdings to the Partnership pursuant to the
Omnibus Agreement for the first half of 2016 has been waived by Holdings. In addition, the
General Partner provided $2.0 million of cash support to the Partnership in the second quarter
of 2016. As a result, the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 reflect a net (loss) attributable to general partner
related to the waived administrative fee and the cash support.
Depreciation expense is not comparable from year to year as the Partnership recorded
impairment of long-lived assets in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 totaling $6.6 million,
thus reducing the depreciable cost base of the property and equipment. The Partnership also
recorded impairments in property and equipment of $2.1 million and impairments of goodwill of
$8.4 million in the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016. There were no
impairments recorded in the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015.
The Partnership has historically provided management services for non-owned SWD facilities
under contractual arrangements.  In May 2015, the Partnership was notified by principals of two
of our management services customers (under common ownership) that they were terminating
●
the management contracts.  The management contracts did not have termination rights and the
Partnership is pursuing its legal remedies.  Revenues (and the costs related to these revenues)
that were included in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements related to
these contractual arrangements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 have not
been included in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements after the
customer’s termination of the contract.
●
●
Effective May 1, 2015, the Partnership acquired a 51% controlling interest in Brown, a
hydrostatic integrity services business.  The Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements will include Brown in the IS segment from this date forward, including a 49% non-
controlling interest.
Effective February 1, 2015, the Partnership acquired the 49.9% non-controlling ownership
interest of the TIR Entities from affiliated parties.  Accordingly, the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 reflect a
non-controlling interest of 49.9% of the TIR Entities from January 1, 2015 through January 31,
2015 related to the TIR Entities (less certain amounts charged directly to the non-controlling
interests in both periods).

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, a $1.0 million administrative fee per
quarter was paid to Holdings for providing certain partnership overhead services. For the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016, this quarterly $1.0 million administrative fee was waived
by Holdings and actual costs for Partnership overhead services are reflected in general and
administrative - corporate.
See the detailed discussion of revenues, cost of services, gross margin, general and

segment below.  The following is a discussion of significant changes in the non-segment
related corporate other income and expenses during the respective periods.

$1.3 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. This is primarily due to
our Sponsor's decision to waive the quarterly administrative fee of $1.0 million and cost
cutting measures implemented by the Partnership beginning in the second quarter of 2016
in response to the continued depressed energy economy. The savings related to the
waiver of the administrative fee by our Sponsor and the implemented cost cutting
measures is offset by a $0.3 million and $1.3 million increase of general and administrative
expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, attributable to
the IS segment, which was not acquired until May 2015.
General and administrative – corporate. General and administrative-corporate increased
$0.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to
increased non-cash allocated expenses from our General Partner in 2016 related to actual
costs for Partnership overhead services that were previously covered by the
administrative fee.
Interest expense. Interest expense primarily consists of interest on borrowings under our
credit agreement, as well as amortization of debt issuance costs and unused commitment
fees.  Interest expense increased from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to an increase in the
average borrowings in 2016 and an increase in borrowing interest rates. Average debt
outstanding during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $136.9 million
and $136.7 million, respectively, and $137.7 million and $118.6 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in average borrowings is
primarily related to amounts borrowed to fund the $52.6 million February 2015 acquisition
of the remaining 49.9% ownership interest in the TIR Entities and $10.7 million in May 2015
to acquire a 51% ownership interest in Brown.  The average interest rate on our
borrowings has increased approximately 0.72% from 3.33% in the six months ended June
30, 2015 to 4.05% in the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Income tax expense.  Income tax expense includes income taxes related to two taxable
corporate subsidiaries in the United States and two taxable corporate subsidiaries in
Canada in our PIS and IS segments, as well as business activity, gross margin, and
franchise taxes incurred in certain states. The decrease in income tax expense for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 generally reflects reduced income and revenues of the
Partnership, and therefore, corresponding reductions in federal, foreign and state income
taxes and Texas franchise taxes.

Table Of Contents
Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests.  Non-controlling interests
primarily relates to the 49.9% interest in each of the TIR Entities within PIS owned by
Holdings and its affiliates for one month in 2015 prior to the acquisition of this non-
controlling interest on February 1, 2015, a 49% interest in CES LLC within W&ES, prior to
the acquisition of its remaining 49% as of June 1, 2015 and the 49% non-controlling
ownership interest in Brown originating as of May 1, 2015, the acquisition date of Brown. 
The non-controlling interest holders of the TIR Entities within PIS were charged directly for
certain financing expenses of the Partnership.  These charges are reflected as a direct
reduction of their proportionate share of net income (loss).
Net loss attributable to general partner. Net loss attributable to the General Partner
includes $2 million of cash support provided by the General Partner in the three and six
month periods ending June 30, 2016, as well as allocated expenses related to the waiving
of the administrative fee pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement. The $0.2 million reflected for
the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015 is comprised of allocated expenses
in excess of the paid administrative fee pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement.

Revenues. Revenues decreased approximately $15.9 million primarily due to a decrease in
the average number of inspectors ($13.9 million) and a decrease in the average weekly
revenue generated by inspectors ($2.0 million). The average inspector count with each
customer fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to changes in customer spending
budgets, project completions and new projects starting, among other factors. The average
revenue per inspector per week has declined from period to period due primarily to pricing
pressures exerted by our customers as they react and respond to the current sluggish
energy economy. We have seen delays in the start-up of new projects with our existing
customers as a result of the downturn in the energy market. As existing projects are
completed, the delay in new projects negatively impacts our average number of inspectors
in the field.
Costs of services. Costs of services are driven primarily by the payroll costs and other
expenses associated with inspectors employed during the period, including reimbursable
expenses associated with the inspectors (per diem, travel and other expenses) and
equipment costs. Costs of services declined approximately $14.3 million from 2015 to 2016
commensurate with the associated reduction in revenues.
Gross margin. Gross margin decreased $1.6 million from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to the
changes in revenues and costs of services outlined above.  There was a slight decrease in
the gross margin as a percentage of revenue between periods due primarily to pricing
pressures exerted by our customers.
General and administrative. General and administrative expenses declined $1.2 million
from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to the our Sponsor's decision to waive the quarterly
administrative fee, as well as cost cutting measures which were accelerated by the
Partnership in the second quarter of 2016 in response to the continued depressed energy
economy.
Operating income. Operating income declined $0.4 million from 2015 to 2016 due to the
decrease in the gross margin, offset, in part by the decrease in general and administrative
expenses.

Revenues.  Revenues decreased approximately $39.0 million primarily due to a decrease
in the average number of inspectors ($32.7 million) and a decrease in the average weekly
revenue generated by inspectors ($6.3 million). The average inspector count with each
customer fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to changes in customer spending
budgets, project completions and new projects starting, among other factors. The average
revenue per inspector per week has declined from period to period due primarily to pricing
pressures exerted by our customers as they react and respond to the current sluggish
energy economy. We continue to see delays in the start-up of new projects with our
existing customers as a result of the downturn in the energy market. As existing projects
complete, the delay in new projects negatively impacts our average number of inspectors
in the field.
Costs of services. Costs of services are driven primarily by the payroll costs and other
expenses associated with inspectors employed during the period including reimbursable
expenses associated with the inspectors (per diem, travel and other expenses) and
equipment costs. Costs of services declined approximately $35.3 million from 2015 to 2016
commensurate with the associated reduction in revenues.
Gross margin. Gross margin decreased $3.7 million, primarily related to the decline in
revenues discussed above.  Gross margin, as a percentage of revenue, remained
relatively consistent between periods.
General and administrative. General and administrative expenses declined $2.1 million
from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to the our Sponsor's decision to waive the quarterly
administrative fee, as well as cost cutting measures which were accelerated by the
Partnership in the second quarter of 2016 in response to the continued depressed energy
economy.
Operating income. Operating income declined $1.6 million from 2015 to 2016 due to the
decrease in the gross margin, offset, in part by the decrease in general and administrative
expenses.

(a)  represents activity from effective date of acquisition (May 1, 2015).
Revenue.   Although the revenue above for the three months ended June 30, 2016 reflects
a full three months of revenue and the revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2015
reflects revenue for two months (the IS segment was acquired May 1, 2015), revenues are
down from 2015 to 2016 due to a decline in the average number of field personnel (15) and
a decline in the average revenue per field personnel per week.
Costs of services. Costs of services decreased $0.4 million and represent labor,
equipment, supplies and other costs necessary to perform the contracted hydrostatic
tests.
Gross margin.  The gross margin decreased $0.5 million from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to
our decreased revenue and cost activity, which, in turn, is directly related to the depressed
oil and gas economy.
General and administrative. General and administrative costs increased $0.3 million from
2015 to 2016 and generally represent the difference between three and two months of
activity since the segment was acquired May 1, 2015.
Impairments. Due to the continued depressed energy economy and its resulting impact on
our IS segment, goodwill impairments of $8.4 million were recognized in the second
quarter of 2016.
Operating income (loss). The decrease in operating income (loss) from period to period is
primarily attributable to goodwill impairments recognized in the second quarter of 2016.

(a)  represents activity from effective date of acquisition (May 1, 2015).
Revenue.   Revenues for the IS segment increased $3.3 million from 2015 to 2016 primarily
due to the fact that the 2016 revenues reflect activity for six months whereas the 2015
revenues reflect activity for two months (segment acquired May 1, 2015).
Costs of services. Costs of services also increased $3.3 million from 2015 to primarily due
to the fact that the 2016 costs of services reflect activity for six months whereas the 2015
costs of services reflect activity for two months (segment acquired May 1, 2015).
Gross margin.  The gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased from 2015 to 2016
due to pricing pressures and trimmed bidding margins as a direct result of the depressed
energy economy.
General and administrative. General and administrative costs primarily composed of
salaries and general office expenditures. The increase in general and administrative costs
is primarily attributable to six months of activity in 2016 as compared to two months of
activity in 2015 (since the May 1, 2015 date of acquisition).
Impairments. Due to the continued depressed energy economy and its resulting impact on
our IS segment, goodwill impairments of $8.4 million were recognized in the second
quarter of 2016.
Operating income (loss). The decrease in operating income (loss) from period to period is
primarily attributable to goodwill impairments recognized in the second quarter of 2016.

(a)  Average revenue per barrel disposed is calculated by dividing revenues (which
includes disposal revenues, residual oil sales and management fees) by the total barrels
of saltwater disposed.
Revenues.   The $1.8 million decrease in revenues is due to a $1.4 million decline related
to the number of barrels of saltwater disposed and a $0.4 million decrease related to the
average price per barrel disposed. Average revenue per barrel disposed decreased
primarily due to lower skim oil revenues and lower average pricing for our disposal
services. The lower skim oil revenues are attributable to a decline in the number of barrels
recovered and sold as well as a continuing decline in oil prices from year to year. The
decline in oil barrels sold is impacted by reduced drilling activity in the areas in which we
operate. The decline in prices for disposal services is also attributable to our decision to
lower prices for disposal services in response to competitive and customer pressures
associated with the general economic downturn in the energy market.
Costs of services.   Costs of services declined due primarily to $0.1 million lower employee
related costs and $0.3 million lower repairs and maintenance costs. The lower employee
costs are directly attributable to the cost cutting measures implemented by the
Partnership beginning in the second quarter of 2016 in response to the continued
depressed energy economy. Repairs and maintenance costs can fluctuate from period to
period depending on numerous factors.
Gross margin.   The decrease in gross margin from 2015 to 2016 is mainly caused by
decreased revenues, partially offset by decreased costs of services, both discussed
above. The gross margin percentage also declined due primarily to a reduction in the
average revenue per barrel charged for barrels of saltwater disposed and a general
reduction in revenues from period to period.
General and administrative expense. General and administrative expenses decreased from
year to year due primarily to the reallocation of certain segment administrative charges
pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement in 2015 that were reallocated to corporate general
and administrative expenses in 2016 and cost reduction measures implemented in the
second quarter of 2016.
Depreciation, amortization and accretion. The decline in depreciation, amortization and
accretion is attributable to a reduction in the cost basis of our fixed assets associated with
impairment charges recorded in the third and fourth quarter of 2015.
Impairments. Due to the continued depressed energy economy and its resulting impact
on our W&ES segment, property and equipment impairments of $2.1 million were
recognized in the second quarter of 2016.
Operating income.   The decline in segment operating income of $2.8 million is primarily a
function of impairments and reduced revenues, partially offset by reduced other
expenses.

(a)  Average revenue per barrel disposed is calculated by dividing revenues (which
includes disposal revenues, residual oil sales and management fees) by the total barrels
of saltwater disposed.
Revenues.   The $3.6 million decrease in revenues is due to a $2.4 million decline related to
the number of barrels of saltwater disposed and a $1.2 million decrease related to the
average price per barrel disposed. Average revenue per barrel disposed decreased
primarily due to lower skim oil revenues and lower average pricing for our disposal
services. The lower skim oil revenues are attributable to a decline in the number of barrels
recovered and sold as well as a continuing decline in oil prices from year to year. The
decline in oil barrels sold is impacted by reduced drilling activity in the areas in which we
operate. The decline in prices for disposal services is also attributable to our decision to
lower prices for disposal services in response to competitive and customer pressures
associated with the general economic downturn in the energy market.
Costs of services.   Costs of services declined due primarily to $0.4 million lower employee
related costs and $0.5 million lower repairs and maintenance costs. The lower employee
costs are directly attributable to the cost cutting measures implemented by the
Partnership beginning in the second quarter of 2016 in response to the continued
depressed energy economy. Repairs and maintenance costs can fluctuate from period to
period depending on numerous factors.
Gross margin.   The decrease in gross margin from 2015 to 2016 is mainly caused by
decreased revenues, partially offset by decreased costs of services, both discussed
above. The gross margin percentage also declined due primarily to a reduction in the
average revenue per barrel charged for barrels of saltwater disposed and a general
reduction in revenues from period to period.
General and administrative expense. General and administrative expenses decreased
from year to year due primarily to the reallocation of certain segment administrative
charges pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement in 2015 that were reallocated to corporate
general and administrative expenses in 2016 and cost reduction measures implemented in
the second quarter of 2016.
Depreciation, amortization and accretion. The decline in depreciation, amortization and
accretion is attributable to a reduction in the cost basis of our fixed assets associated with
impairment charges recorded in the third and fourth quarter of 2015.
Impairments. Due to the continued depressed energy economy and its resulting impact
on our W&ES segment, property and equipment impairments of $2.1 million were
recognized in the second quarter of 2016.
Operating income.   The decline in segment operating income of $3.5 million is primarily a
function of impairments and reduced revenues, partially offset by reduced other
expenses.

Distributable Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA attributable to limited partners excluding
cash interest paid, cash income taxes paid and maintenance capital expenditures.
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to limited partners and Distributable
Cash Flow are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external
users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:
•
the financial performance of our assets without regard to the impact of financing methods,
capital structure or historical cost basis of our assets;
•
the viability of capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative
investment opportunities;
•our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures;
•
the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make debt payments and to make
distributions; and
•
our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in our industry without
regard to the impact of financing methods and capital structure.
We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures will provide useful
information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. 
The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
attributable to limited partners and Distributable Cash Flow are net income (loss) and cash
flow from operating activities, respectively. These non-GAAP measures should not be
considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Each
of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect the
most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
attributable to limited partners and Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered an
alternative to net income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, net income (loss)
attributable limited partners, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of
financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, as those items are used to
measure operating performance, liquidity, or the ability to service debt obligations.
Because Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA attributable to limited Partners and
Distributable Cash Flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry,
our definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA attributable to limited partners and
Distributable Cash Flow may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other
companies, thereby diminishing their utility.
The following tables present a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, a
reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to limited partners to Adjusted EBITDA and
Distributable Cash Flow attributable to limited partners and a reconciliation of net cash
provided by operating activities to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Liquidity
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At June 30, 2016, our sources of liquidity included:
●cash generated from operations, which resulted in $23.6 million in cash on the balance sheet
at June 30, 2016;
●
available borrowings under our Credit Agreement of $63.1 million at June 30, 2016 that are
limited by certain borrowing base computations and financial covenant ratios as outlined in the
agreement; and
●
issuance of equity and/or debt securities.  The Partnership filed a Securities Registration
Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 8, 2015 to register $1.0
billion in securities, which the Partnership may issue in any combination of equity or debt
securities from time to time in one or more offerings.
In addition to these sources of liquidity, we have implemented cost savings initiatives
beginning in the second quarter of 2016 that are expected to save up to $5.0 million
annually. In addition to these cost savings initiatives, our W&ES segment temporarily shut
down one additional facility in the second quarter of 2016 and spent approximately $0.2
million automating the remaining SWD facilities. The automation of these facilities should
yield another $0.5 million of cost savings in this segment of our business.
We anticipate that we may make significant growth capital expenditures in the future,
including acquiring other inspection and integrity companies, acquiring new SWD
facilities, pipelines and new lines of business covered under our Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) private letter ruling, or expanding our existing assets and offerings in our current
business segments.  In addition, as we continue to grow, the substantial working capital
needs of PIS and IS could require us to seek additional financing that we may not be able
to obtain on satisfactory terms, or at all.  Consequently, our ability to develop and maintain
sources of funds to meet our capital requirements is critical to our ability to meet our
growth objectives.  We expect that our future growth capital expenditures will be funded
by borrowings under our credit agreement and the issuance of debt and equity securities. 
However, we may not be able to raise additional funds on desired or favorable terms or at
all.
Our partnership agreement requires that, within 45 days after the end of each quarter, we
distribute all of our available cash to unitholders of record on the applicable record date.
Available cash, for any quarter, consists of all cash and cash equivalents on hand at the
end of that quarter:
●less , the amount of cash reserves established by our General Partner at the date of
determination of available cash for the quarter to:
o
provide for the proper conduct of our business, which could include, but is not limited to,
amounts reserved for capital expenditures, working capital and operating expenses;
ocomply with applicable law, and of our debt instruments or other agreements; or
o
provide funds for distributions to our unitholders (including our General Partner) for any one or
more of the next four quarters (provided that our General Partner may not establish cash
reserves for the payment of future distributions unless it determines that the establishment of
reserves will not prevent us from distributing the minimum quarterly distribution on all common
units and any cumulative arrearages on such common units for such quarter);
●
plus , if our General Partner so determines, all or a portion of cash on hand on the date of
determination of available cash for the quarter, including cash on hand resulting from working
capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter.

Table Of Contents
We believe that the cash generated from our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient

agreement, working capital requirements and capital expenditures for the foreseeable
future.  The following table summarizes the distributions declared since our IPO:

Our Credit Agreement
The Partnership is party to a credit agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) that
provides up to $200.0 million in borrowing capacity, subject to certain limitations. The
Credit Agreement includes a working capital revolving credit facility (“WCRCF”), which
provides up to $75.0 million in borrowing capacity to fund working capital needs and an
acquisition revolving credit facility (“ARCF”), which provides up to $125.0 million in
borrowing capacity to fund acquisitions and expansion projects. In addition, the Credit
Agreement provides for an accordion feature that allows us to increase the availability
under the facilities by an additional $125.0 million. The Credit Agreement matures
December 24, 2018.
Outstanding borrowings at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 under the Credit
Agreement were as follows:

)
Long-term debt
The carrying value of the partnership’s long-term debt approximates fair value as the
borrowings under the Credit Agreement are considered to be priced at market for debt
instruments having similar terms and conditions (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).
Borrowings under the WCRCF are limited by a monthly borrowing base calculation as
defined in the Credit Agreement. If, at any time, outstanding borrowings under the WCRCF
exceed the Partnership’s calculated borrowing base, principal in the amount of the excess
is due upon submission of the borrowing base calculation. Available borrowings under
the ARCF may be limited by certain financial covenant ratios as defined in the Credit
Agreement. The obligations under our Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien
on substantially all assets of the Partnership.
All borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, on a leveraged
based grid pricing at (i) a base rate plus a margin of 1.25% to 2.75% per annum (“Base
Rate Borrowing”) or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.25% to 3.75% per annum
(“LIBOR Borrowings”). The applicable margin is determined based on the leverage ratio of
the Partnership, as defined in the Credit Agreement. Generally, the interest rate on Credit
Agreement borrowings ranged between 3.54% and 4.22% for the six months ended June
30, 2016 and 2.68% and 4.04% for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Interest on Base
Rate Borrowings is payable monthly. Interest on LIBOR Borrowings is paid upon maturity
of the underlying LIBOR contract, but no less often than quarterly. Commitment fees are
charged at a rate of 0.50% on any unused credit and are payable quarterly. Interest paid
during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.4 million and $1.1 million,
respectively, including commitment fees. Interest paid during the six months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015 was $2.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively, including commitment
fees.
Our Credit Agreement contains various customary affirmative and negative covenants and
restrictive provisions. It also requires maintenance of certain financial covenants,
including a combined total adjusted leverage ratio (as defined in our Credit Agreement) of
not more than 4.0 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio (as defined in our Credit
Agreement) of not less than 3.0 to 1.0. At June 30, 2016, our total adjusted leverage ratio
was 3.33 to 1.0 and our interest coverage ratio was 3.80 to 1.0, pursuant to the Credit
Agreement. Without Holding’s reimbursement of Partnership operating expenses and
temporary waiver of the administrative fee, our adjusted leverage ratio would have been
higher. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, subject to
the terms and conditions of our Credit Agreement, the lenders may declare any
outstanding principal of our Credit Agreement debt, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, to be immediately due and payable and may exercise the other remedies set forth
or referred to in our Credit Agreement. With continued support from Holdings, we expect
to remain in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants throughout the next twelve
months.
In addition, our Credit Agreement restricts our ability to make distributions on, or redeem
or repurchase, our equity interests. However, we may make distributions of available cash
so long as, both at the time of the distribution and after giving effect to the distribution, no
default exists under our Credit Agreement, the borrowers and the guarantors are in
compliance with the financial covenants, the borrowing base (which includes 100% of
cash on hand) exceeds the amount of outstanding credit extensions under the WCRCF by
at least $5.0 million and at least $5.0 million in lender commitments are available to be
drawn under the WCRCF.

2015
Net cash provided by operating activities.   The decrease of $9.0 million from 2015 to 2016
is primarily attributable to unfavorable changes in working capital of $3.7 million (mostly
trade accounts receivable) and a decrease in net income (loss) of $17.7 million, partially
offset by $10.5 million of impairments of goodwill and property and equipment and $1.8
million of non-cash allocated expenses.
Net cash (used in) investing activities.   Investing activity for 2015 is primarily attributable
to the acquisition of the 49.9% interest in the TIR Entities not previously held by the
Partnership of $52.6 million effective February 1, 2015, the acquisition of Brown for $10.7
million effective May 1, 2015 and $1.3 million for the acquisition of property and equipment.
Investing activity for 2016 is primarily attributable to the acquisition of property and
equipment.
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities.   Net cash provided by financing
activities in 2015 relates to borrowings under our Credit Facility of $63.3 million to fund the
acquisition of the remaining 49.9% ownership interest in the TIR Entities and the
acquisition of the 51% ownership interest in Brown, partially offset by partnership
distributions totaling $11.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities for 2016 include
partnership distributions of $10.0 million and repayment of $4.0 million of the working
capital revolving credit facility, partially offset by $2.0 million of contributions attributable
to the General Partner.
Capital Expenditures
W&ES has capital needs requiring investment for the maintenance of existing SWD
facilities and the acquisition or construction and development of new SWD facilities.  IS
has capital needs for heavy equipment in order for it to perform hydrostatic testing
procedures. PIS requires limited capital expenditures; primarily purchases of office
equipment and small amounts of field equipment.  Our partnership agreement requires
that we categorize our capital expenditures as either maintenance capital expenditures or
expansion capital expenditures.
●
Maintenance capital expenditures are those cash expenditures that will enable us to maintain
our operating capacity or operating income over the long-term.  Maintenance capital
expenditures include tankage, work overs, pumps and other improvement of existing capital
assets, and the construction or development of new capital assets to replace our existing SWD
systems as they become obsolete.  Other examples of maintenance capital expenditures are
expenditures to repair, refurbish and replace downhole tubing and packers on the SWD
facilities to maintain equipment reliability, integrity and safety, as well as to comply with
environmental laws and regulations. Maintenance capital expenditures for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
Expansion capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that we expect will increase our
operating capacity or operating income over the long-term.  Expansion capital expenditures
include the acquisition of assets or businesses from Holdings or third-parties, the construction
or development of additional SWD facility capacity or pipelines, to the extent such expenditures
are expected to expand our long-term operating capacity or operating income and additional
equipment that may be required to expand our PIS or IS pipeline inspection and integrity
businesses.  Expansion capital expenditures include interest payments (and related fees) on
debt incurred to finance all or a portion of expansion capital expenditures in respect of the
period from the date that we enter into a binding obligation to commence the construction,
development, replacement, improvement, automation or expansion of a capital asset and
ending on the earlier to occur of that date that such capital improvement commences
commercial service and the date that such capital improvement is abandoned or disposed.
 Expansion capital expenditures for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were $0.1
million and $0.4 million, respectively. Expansion capital expenditures for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2015 were $53.3 million and $63.8 million, respectively (including the
acquisition of the remainder of the TIR Entities for $52.6 million in the first quarter of 2015 and
the acquisition of 51% of Brown for $10.5 million in the second quarter of 2015).
●
Future expansion capital expenditures may vary significantly from period to period based
on the investment opportunities available.  We expect to fund future capital expenditures
from cash flows generated from our operations, borrowings under our Credit Agreement,
the issuance of additional partnership units or debt offerings.

Contractual Obligations
Borrowings under our Credit Agreement previously disclosed in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 have decreased $4.0 million to $136.9
million reflecting the generation of additional cash to pay down on the Credit Agreement.
Additionally, the Partnership has long-term office and other lease obligations totaling $1.8
million, payable through calendar year 2042.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or any hedging arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies
There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies since
December 31, 2015.  Please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 for a summary of these policies.
Recent Accounting Standards
The Partnership has adopted the following new accounting standards issued by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) beginning January 1, 2016:
The FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-17 – Income Taxes in
November 2015. ASU 2015-17 was issued as a part of the FASB’s initiative to reduce
complexity in accounting standards. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2016 with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of
an annual reporting period. The Partnership has elected early application of this guidance
beginning January 1, 2016. The guidance simplifies the presentation of deferred income
taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a
classified consolidated balance sheet. Therefore, the Partnership’s deferred tax assets
and liabilities have been classified as noncurrent in the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods presented.
Business Combinations – ASU 2015-16 was issued by the FASB in September 2015.
Essentially, the amendments in the ASU require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to
provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting
period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This will require the Partnership
to disclose, by line item, current period earnings adjustments to amounts that otherwise
would have been recorded in previous reporting periods as if the adjustment(s) had been
recognized as of the acquisition date beginning with fiscal periods after December 15,
2015. The implementation of this ASU has not affected the Partnership’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.
The FASB issued ASU 2015-06 – Earnings Per Share in April 2015. The amendments in
this update specify that for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit under the
two-class method, the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date of a
dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner. The
amendments should be applied retrospectively for all financial statements presented. The
Partnership adopted this ASU effective for fiscal and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2015. The adoption of this ASU has not materially impacted our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
The FASB issued ASU 2015-05 – Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software
in April 2015 as part of its simplification initiative. The amendments in this ASU provide
guidance to customers for license fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The
effective date for adoption of this ASU for public companies is for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2015. As a result, the Partnership adopted this guidance as
of January 1, 2016 and its adoption has not materially impacted our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.
The FASB issued ASU 2015-03 – Interest – Imputation of Interest in April 2015. This
guidance requires debt issuance costs related to long-term debt be presented on the
balance sheet as a reduction of the carrying amount of the long-term debt. The
Partnership has adopted this guidance beginning January 1, 2016. As a result of the
adoption of this ASU, we have been required to net the Partnership’s debt issuance costs
against long-term debt for all periods presented, moving the debt issuance costs from
noncurrent assets to noncurrent liabilities on the Partnership’s Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods presented.
52
Table Of Contents
Other accounting guidance proposed by the FASB that may have some impact on the
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Partnership, but have not
yet been adopted by the Partnership include:
The FASB issued ASU 2016-09 – Compensation – Stock Compensation in March 2016.
The purpose of the guidance is to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-
based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of
awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The
amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
and all interim periods within that year. Although early adoption is permitted, the
Partnership has not adopted this guidance early. We are currently in the process of
determining the impact this guidance may have on the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements of the Partnership, but do not expect the adoption of
this guidance to materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The FASB issued ASU 2016-02 – Leases in February 2016. This guidance was proposed in
an attempt to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by
recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key
information about leasing arrangements. The main difference between previous GAAP
and this new guidance is the recognition on the balance sheet lease assets and lease
liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We
are currently examining the guidance provided in the ASU and determining the impact this
guidance will have on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
The FASB issued ASU 2014-09 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers in May 2014.
ASU 2014-09 is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and develop a
common standard for recognizing revenue for GAAP and International Financial
Reporting Standards that is applicable to all organizations. The Partnership was originally
required to comply with this ASU beginning in 2017. However, in August 2015, the FASB
issued ASU 2015- 14 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers effectively delaying the
Partnership’s implementation of this standard for one year to periods beginning after
December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the financial impact of this ASU on the
Partnership, but do not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will materially impact our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Item
3.
Quantitative and   Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
There have been no material changes to the Partnership's exposure to market risk since
December 31, 2015.
Item 4.Controls and   Procedures
Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered
by this report, the Partnership carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Partnership’s disclosure controls and procedures.  This evaluation
was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Accounting Officer,
as well as others involved in the accounting and reporting functions.
Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that
the information required to be disclosed in Partnership reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. 
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Partnership reports
filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
including the Partnership’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based upon that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report,
the Partnership’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable
assurance that financial information was processed, recorded and reported accurately.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the three months ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
Beginning January 1, 2016, the Partnership initiated implementation of a new enterprise
resource planning (“ERP”) accounting and reporting system designed to improve the
timeliness and quality of information (including financial information) to all appropriate
levels of Partnership personnel. This new ERP was not implemented in response to any
identified deficiency or material weakness in the Partnership’s internal control over
financial reporting. The implementation is expected to occur in phases during 2016. The
implementation of the ERP system will likely affect the processes that constitute our
internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness. As with
any new information technology application we implement, this application, along with the
internal controls over financial reporting included in this process, was appropriately
considered within the testing for effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these
instances. The adoption of this new ERP system has not materially affected our internal
controls over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.    Legal Proceedings
On July 3, 2014, a group of former minority shareholders of TIR Inc., formerly an Oklahoma
corporation, filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Oklahoma against TIR LLC, members of TIR LLC, and certain affiliates of TIR LLC’s
members. TIR LLC is the successor in interest to TIR Inc., resulting from a merger between
the entities that closed in December 2013 (the “TIR Merger”). The former shareholders in
TIR Inc. claim that they did not receive sufficient value for their shares in the TIR Merger
and are seeking rescission of the TIR Merger or, alternatively, compensatory and punitive
damages. The Partnership is not named as a defendant in this civil action. TIR LLC and the
other defendants have been advised by counsel that the action lacks merit. In addition, the
Partnership anticipates no disruption in its business operations or those of TIR LLC
related to this action.
In September 2015, Flatland Resources I, LLC and Flatland Resources II, LLC, two of our
management services customers (under common ownership) initiated a civil action in the
District Court for the McKenzie County District of the State of North Dakota against CES
LLC. The customers claim that CES LLC breached the management agreements and
interfered with their business relationships, and seek to rescind the management
agreements and recover any damages. The customers initiated this lawsuit upon
dismissal from federal court due to lack of jurisdiction of CES LLC’s lawsuit against the
customers seeking to enforce the management agreements. CES LLC subsequently filed
an answer and counterclaims, as well as a third party complaint against the principal of the
customers seeking to enforce the management agreements and other injunctive relief, as
well as monetary damages. The court subsequently granted CES’s motion to transfer
venue to the Grand Forks County District Court. We believe that the possibility of the
Partnership incurring material losses as a result of this action is remote.
Like other partnerships, our operations are subject to extensive and rapidly changing
federal and state environmental, health and safety and other laws and regulations
governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and solid and hazardous waste
management activities. From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims
that arise in the ordinary course of business. We believe that proceedings and/or claims
that arise in the ordinary course of business would be incidental to our business and
would not have a material impact on our financial results.
