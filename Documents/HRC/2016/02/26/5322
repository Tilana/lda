<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations,  
</p>
<p><i> Guided also </i>by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,  
</p>
<p><i> Guided further </i>by the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which reaffirms, 
inter alia, the solemn commitment of all States to fulfil their obligations to promote universal 
respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all 
in accordance with the Charter, other instruments relating to human rights, and international law, 
and that the universal nature of these rights is beyond question,  
</p>

<p>*  Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Reiterating</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and 
mutually reinforcing, and that all human rights must be treated in a fair and equal manner, on the 
same footing and with the same emphasis, and that, while the significance of national and 
regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne 
in mind, all States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, have the duty to 
promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that all cultures and civilizations in their traditions, customs, religions and 
beliefs share a common set of values that belong to humankind in its entirety, and that those 
values have made an important contribution to the development of human rights, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Requests </i>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene, 
within existing resources, in 2010, a workshop for an exchange of views on how a better 
understanding of traditional values of humankind in conformity with international human rights 
law can contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
with the participation of representatives from all interested States Members of the 
United Nations, regional organizations, national human rights institutions and civil society, as 
well as experts selected with due consideration given to the appropriate representation of 
different civilizations and legal systems; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Requests </i>the Office of the High Commissioner to present to the Council a summary 
</p>
<p>of the discussions held at the workshop in conformity with the programme of work of the 
Council.
