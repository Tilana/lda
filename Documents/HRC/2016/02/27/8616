</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i>This report was prepared by the fact-finding mission established by the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council in resolution 14/1 of 2 June 2010 to investigate violations of international 
law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law, resulting from the 
interception by Israeli forces of the humanitarian aid flotilla bound for Gaza on 31 May 
2010 during which nine people were killed and many others injured. 
</p>
<p>The report sets out background information relating to the interception of the flotilla 
as well as the applicable international law. 
</p>
<p>The fact-finding mission conducted interviews with more than 100 witnesses in 
Geneva, London, Istanbul and Amman. On the basis of this testimony and other 
information received, the Mission was able to reconstruct a picture of the circumstances 
surrounding the interception on 31 May 2010 and its aftermath. The report presents a 
factual description of the events leading up to the interception, the interception of each of 
the six ships in the flotilla as well as a seventh ship subsequently intercepted on 6 June 
2010, the deaths of nine passengers and wounding of many others and the detention of 
passengers in Israel and their deportation. 
</p>
<p>The report contains a legal analysis of facts as determined by the Mission with a 
view to determining whether violations of international law, including international 
humanitarian and human rights law, took place. 
</p>
<p> The fact-finding mission concluded that a series of violations of international law, 
including international humanitarian and human rights law, were committed by the Israeli 
forces during the interception of the flotilla and during the detention of passengers in Israel 
prior to deportation. 
</p>

<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Mandate 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 2 June 2010 the Human Rights Council, in resolution 14/1, decided &#8220;to dispatch 
an independent international fact-finding mission to investigate violations of international 
law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law, resulting from the 
Israeli attacks on the flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian assistance&#8221; to Gaza. The same 
resolution authorized the President of the Council to appoint the members of this Mission 
and called for the independent international fact-finding mission, hereinafter referred to as 
&#8220;the Mission&#8221;, to report its findings to the fifteenth session of the Council.1 
</p>
<p>2. Seven weeks later, on 23 July 2010, the President of the Human Rights Council 
appointed Judge Karl T. Hudson-Phillips, Q.C., retired Judge of the International Criminal 
Court and former Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago, to be Chairman and to head 
the Mission.  The other appointed members were Sir Desmond de Silva, Q.C. of the United 
Kingdom, former Chief Prosecutor of the United Nations-backed Special Court for Sierra 
Leone and Ms. Mary Shanthi Dairiam of Malaysia, founding member of the Board of 
Directors of the International Women&#8217;s Rights Action Watch Asia Pacific and former 
member of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with common practice, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) established a secretariat to support the 
Mission. The experts were also assisted by external specialists in forensic pathology, 
military issues, firearms, the law of the sea and international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>4. The Mission considered that its task was directed to investigating the facts and 
circumstances surrounding the boarding by Israeli military personnel of a flotilla of ships 
bound for Gaza and to determine whether in the process violations occurred of international 
law, including international humanitarian and human rights law. 
</p>
<p>5. The Council, in its resolution, decided to dispatch a mission to investigate 
&#8220;violations&#8221; of international law, international humanitarian and human rights law, 
resulting from the Israeli &#8220;attacks&#8221; on the flotilla carrying humanitarian assistance. This 
appeared to determine that &#8220;violations&#8221; of international law, including international 
humanitarian and human rights law had in fact occurred prior to any investigation. The 
resolution also appeared to find as a fact that there had been Israeli attacks on the flotilla of 
ships and that the ships were carrying humanitarian assistance.  
</p>
<p>6. The Mission did not interpret its task as proceeding on any such assumptions. It 
could not determine what its position was until the Mission came to its conclusion on the 
facts. The same can be said of the alleged actions by the Israeli forces.  
</p>
<p>7. It was not generally contested that there was an interception by Israeli forces of a 
flotilla of ships and that the ships were carrying cargoes of a humanitarian nature. That 
apart, the Mission considered that its mandate required it to ascertain the sequence of the 
facts and events as they occurred and to examine the reasons and justification in law, if any, 
for the above. 
</p>
<p>8. The Mission convened in Geneva to officially commence its work on 9 August 
</p><p>2010. Shortly prior thereto, on 2 August 2010, the Secretary-General of the United Nations 
announced the setting-up of a Panel of Inquiry on the flotilla incident of 31 May. The 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Resolution 14/1 was adopted by a recorded vote of 32 to 3, with 9 abstentions.  </p>


<p>Secretary-General, without indicating what specific area of inquiry the Panel was to 
undertake, expressed the hope that the panel &#8220;will fulfil its mandate based on the 
Presidential Statement of the Security Council&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>9. The Panel of Inquiry was given the mandate to receive and review the reports of the 
national investigations with a view to recommending ways of avoiding similar incidents in 
the future.2 
</p>
<p>10. Both Israel and Turkey announced the setting-up of national inquiries, on 15 July 
and 10 August 2010 respectively. 
</p>
<p>11.  In the opinion of the Mission, the remit of the Panel appointed by the Secretary-
General is quite different and distinct from that of the Mission as its ultimate goal is to 
&#8220;positively affect the relationship between Turkey and Israel, as well as the overall situation 
in the Middle East&#8221; .3 
</p>
<p>12. At the time of writing this report, the Mission was made aware of sittings of the 
Israeli inquiry under Judge Turkel.4 Both from the Internet and other sources, the Mission 
was able to secure transcripts of some of the evidence given by witnesses to that enquiry. It 
appears that evidence was given partly in closed sessions, the transcripts of which have not 
been made available to the Mission. As far as the Mission is aware, the inquiry announced 
by the Government of Turkey submitted a preliminary report to the Secretary-General&#8217;s 
Panel on 1 September 2010.  
</p>
<p>13. The Mission decided that its task required it to seek the cooperation of as wide a 
cross section of relevant interests as possible and in particular that of the Governments of 
Turkey and Israel. The Mission was greatly assisted by having discussions in Geneva with 
the Permanent Representatives of Israel, Jordan, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the 
United States of America, as well as with the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to 
the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>14. The Mission wishes to place on record its appreciation for the assistance provided by 
the Governments of Turkey and Jordan in facilitating its visits to Istanbul, Ankara and 
Amman and providing relevant information, in the case of Turkey at an official level.    
</p>
<p>15. The Mission also wishes to thank the Office of the United Nations Resident 
Coordinators and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ankara and 
Amman for the cooperation provided. Particular mention is also to be made of the 
collaboration provided by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory (OCHA oPt), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency 
for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and the Office of the Special 
Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO) for briefing the Mission on the 
situation in the Gaza Strip.  
</p>
<p>16. The Mission expresses its profound regret that, notwithstanding a most cordial 
meeting on 18 August 2010, the Permanent Representative of Israel advised in writing at 
the end of the meeting that the position of his Government was one of non-recognition of, 
and non-cooperation with, the Mission. In the hope that this position would change before 
the conclusion of its work, the Mission left the Permanent Representative a list of requests 
for information.5

 5 See annex II. </p>


<p>17. Not having heard from the Permanent Representative of Israel, the Mission wrote to 
the Permanent Representative, by letter dated 7 September 2010, renewing its request for 
information. The Permanent Representative replied by letter dated 13 September 2010 
requesting the Mission to delay delivering its report to the Council on the ground that it 
should await the report of the Commission under Judge Turkel in Israel and the Panel 
appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The Mission replied advising the 
Permanent Representative that the request should be made to the Council. Regrettably to 
date, no information has been given to the Mission by or on behalf of the Government of 
Israel. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>18. Following its official establishment, the Mission redrafted its Terms of Reference so 
as to reflect its approach to the mandate given. The Mission then established its working 
methodology, including the criteria to select witnesses who had participated in the flotilla.  
</p>
<p>19. Different sources of information were made available to the Mission, including the 
evidence of eyewitnesses, forensic reports and interviews with medical and forensic 
personnel in Turkey, as well as written statements, video film footage and other 
photographic material relating to the incident.  
</p>
<p>20. In ascertaining the facts surrounding the Israeli interception of the Gaza-bound 
flotilla, the Mission gave particular weight to the direct evidence received from interviews 
with eyewitnesses and crew, as well as the forensic evidence and interviews with 
government officials. In light of the seizure of cameras, CCTV footage and digital media 
storage devices and the subsequent disclosure of only a selected and minute quantity of it, 
the Mission was obliged to treat with extreme caution the versions released by the Israeli 
authorities where those versions did not coincide with the evidence of eyewitnesses who 
appeared before it. 
</p>
<p>21. Taking into consideration the resources and limited time available, the Mission 
travelled to Istanbul, Ankara and Iskenderun in Turkey, Amman in Jordan and London in 
the United Kingdom in order to interview witnesses, hold meetings with government 
officials and conduct an inspection of the ship <i>Mavi Marmara</i>, in which nine passengers 
died on 31 May 2010. The Mission was able to contact several persons with information 
bearing on the matters under enquiry. A total of 112 witnesses6 were interviewed by the 
Mission, either by all of its members at the same time or by individual members. In 
addition written statements were received from several persons through their attorneys.  
</p>
<p>22. The Mission wishes to record its appreciation for the assistance given by various 
firms of attorneys for facilitating the appearance before it of persons involved in the 
incident7 and represented by them. Meetings were also held with different non-
governmental organizations in Geneva, Istanbul and Amman.  
</p>
<p>23. The Mission is of the opinion that evidence from a sufficient number and range of 
witnesses was taken to afford it a comprehensive picture of the events as they occurred on 
31 May 2010. In addition to the information received directly, the Mission took into 
consideration information from a variety of sources, subject to verification of authenticity.  
</p>
<p>  
 6 Witnesses were interviewed at the following locations: London; Geneva; Istanbul; Amman. The 
</p>
<p>Mission is grateful to the International Maritime Organization for its assistance in providing a venue 
for the interviews in London. 
</p>
<p> 7 Law firms in London, Istanbul and Athens assisted the Mission. </p>


<p>24. In assessing the evidence and information available to it, the Mission paid particular 
attention to the content of the evidence and demeanour of the persons appearing before it in 
deciding whether, and if so, what part of the information provided should be accepted. 
More weight of necessity was accorded to such evidence if believed than to information 
from other sources. In addition, with respect to information in the nature of hearsay 
evidence, due regard was paid, giving to it such weight as the circumstances merited. 
Matters were decided on the basis of the preponderance and quality of the evidence so as to 
satisfy all the members of the Mission in order that they felt sure of their conclusions.  
</p>
<p>25. In the preparation of the report, the Mission first of all reviewed the factual 
contextual background to the incident and came to its conclusions on the facts, which are 
set out in this report. The Mission expressed its opinion on the relevant principles of 
international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law on the basis of 
the facts it found. A segmented approach is taken to the analysis. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Context 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The blockade of the Gaza Strip 
</b></p>
<p><i>Pre-existing restrictions of maritime access to the Gaza Strip 
</i></p>
<p>26. Israel implemented a complete military occupation of the Gaza Strip from June 1967 
until its first disengagement from parts of the Gaza Strip starting  from May 1994 as part of 
the peace process. A series of peace agreements between 1993 and 1995 concluded 
between the State of Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization with international 
backing were intended, within a transitional period of five years, to regulate Israel&#8217;s 
disengagement from the West Bank and Gaza Strip leading up to the conclusion of a 
permanent status agreement which would establish an independent Palestinian state 
alongside Israel. These agreements, often collectively referred to as the Oslo Accords, 
provided the basis for, amongst other matters, the establishment of the Palestinian 
Authority and Council and put in place interim arrangements for security cooperation 
between the Israeli and Palestinian police, including the policing of borders, maritime 
waters and airspace. 
</p>
<p>27. Under the Oslo Accords, it was agreed that the territorial waters off Gaza would be 
included in the territorial jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority (PA).8 However, the 
external security of the Gaza Strip was specifically excluded from the PA&#8217;s functional 
jurisdiction;9 responsibility for external security was retained by Israel until the final status 
agreement.10<b> </b>Article VIII of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement specifically states that &#8220;Israel 
shall continue to carry the responsibility &#8230; for defense against external threats from the sea 
and from the air &#8230; and will have all the powers to take the steps necessary to meet this 
responsibility.&#8221; The agreed security arrangements and coordination mechanisms establish 
three maritime activity zones: a central zone extending twenty nautical miles out to sea, 
bounded by two one-nautical mile-wide strips of water at the Egyptian end and Israeli end 
of the Gaza Strip, both of which are closed military areas under Israeli control. The central 
zone, under joint Palestinian-Israeli control, was designated as open for fishing up to the 
twenty nautical miles limit and for recreational boats up to three nautical miles. Foreign 
</p>
<p>  
 8 Article 5, para. 1(a), Gaza-Jericho Agreement. 
 9 Article 5, para. 1(b), Gaza-Jericho Agreement. 
 10 Article 5, para. 3, Gaza-Jericho Agreement. </p>


<p>vessels entering the central zone were not allowed to approach closer than twenty nautical 
miles from the coast pending agreement on construction of a sea port for Gaza. Even 
though there was a breakdown in security cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians in 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip following the breakdown of bilateral peace negotiations in 
2002, significant aspects of the Oslo Accords remain in force, including provisions related 
to the territorial waters off Gaza. 
</p>
<p>28. During the 1990s, following the contours of the peace negotiations, Israeli forces 
imposed periodic &#8220;closures&#8221; of the Palestinian areas, usually in response to suicide 
bombings inside Israel. These closures would last for a matter of weeks or months. Prior to 
the first peace accords, it was estimated that as many as 20,000 Gazans left the strip each 
day to work inside Israel, returning each evening. Closures impacted on the many families 
dependent on the wages earned by these workers. 
</p>
<p><i>Restrictions imposed on Gaza following the Hamas election victory 
</i></p>
<p>29. Since the beginning of the Second Intifada in 2000, a progressive restriction of the 
access for Gaza fishermen to the sea has taken place. According to OCHA the latest 
expansion of the restricted sea areas can be dated to late 2008, on the eve of the &#8220;Cast 
Lead&#8221; offensive.11 Along most of Gaza&#8217;s coast, the restricted areas begin at three nautical 
miles from shore. Overall, OCHA states that Palestinians are barred access to 85 per cent of 
the sea areas on which they are entitled to carry out maritime activities and that Palestinian 
fishermen entering the restricted sea areas are regularly exposed to warning fire by Israeli 
naval forces and in some cases, directly targeted and that fishing boats are often intercepted 
by the Israeli military and confiscated. 
</p>
<p>30. Economic and political measures started to be imposed against the Gaza Strip in 
February 2006 following the Hamas election victory in the legislative elections, 
accompanied by the withholding of financial resources on the part of donor countries. The 
closure on the Gaza Strip was imposed by Israel after Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip 
in June 2007. In September 2007, Israel declared the Gaza Strip &#8220;hostile territory&#8221; and that 
the movement of goods into and out of Gaza would be restricted for security concerns as 
well as in order to apply pressure on the Hamas government &#8220;as part of the State of Israel&#8217;s 
operations against continuous terrorism.&#8221;12 Harsher fuel restrictions came into effect since 
October 2007. 
</p>
<p>31. In a petition to the Israeli Supreme Court,13 the legality of the decision by the 
Government of Israel to reduce the supply of electricity and fuel was challenged based on 
the argument that such cuts were inconsistent with the obligations of Israel under the Fourth 
Geneva Convention relating to the protection of civilians. In its response, the State

</p>
<p>(OCHA-oPt), <i>Between the Fence and a Hard Place</i>, (August 2010) 
 12 &#8220;Hamas is a terrorist organization that has taken control of the Gaza Strip and turned it into hostile 
</p>
<p>territory. This organization engages in hostile activity against the State of Israel and its citizens and 
bears responsibility for this activity. In light of the foregoing, it has been decided to adopt the 
recommendations that have been presented by the security establishment, including the continuation 
of military and counter-terrorist operations against the terrorist organizations. Additional sanctions 
will be placed on the Hamas regime in order to restrict the passage of various goods to the Gaza Strip 
and reduce the supply of fuel and electricity. Restrictions will also be placed on the movement of 
people to and from the Gaza Strip. The sanctions will be enacted following a legal examination, while 
taking into account both the humanitarian aspects relevant to the Gaza Strip and the intention to avoid 
a humanitarian crisis.&#8221;

<p> 13 Israeli Supreme Court, case HCJ 9132/07 &#8211; <i>Al Bassiouni vs. Prime Minister</i>. </p>


<p>Attorney&#8217;s Office submitted, inter alia, that harming the economy itself is a legitimate 
means of warfare and a relevant consideration even when deciding on allowing in relief 
consignments.14 
</p>
<p>32. From mid-2008, in response to the Free Gaza Movement&#8217;s attempts to enter Gaza by 
sea, the Israeli Government took a series of steps aimed initially at deterring shipping from 
travelling to the area. A Notice to Mariners was issued15 stating that all ships entering the 
central zone of the Gaza Maritime Area would be &#8220;subject to supervision and inspection.&#8221; 
Then, in August 2008, a second Notice to Mariners was issued stating that a maritime zone 
extends 20 miles to seaward from the Gaza Strip. In accordance with the agreements 
between Israel and the PA, entry by foreign vessels to this zone is prohibited.16 
</p>
<p><i>Imposition of the naval blockade 
</i></p>
<p>33. In his testimony to the Turkel Committee, Chief of General Staff Gabi Ashkenazi 
accepted that the &#8220;phenomenon of the flotillas&#8221; in mid-2008 represented the trigger for the 
imposition of the maritime closure, although he outlines that it was done for security 
purposes.17  Israeli Chief Military Advocate General, Avichai Mandelblit also stated that 
the justification for a naval blockade was on security grounds only. However, plans for a 
full naval blockade were initially not approved at the political level &#8220;on grounds of 
legitimacy&#8221; and the possibility of what Mandelblit describes as &#8220;severe criticism&#8221; at the 
international level.18 
</p>
<p>34. Shortly prior to the initiation of Operation Cast Lead at the end of 2008, a 
recommendation for the initiation of a closure was made by the Military Advocate General 
to the Defence Minister, who directed the imposition of a maritime closure on the Gaza 
Strip until further notice.19 The naval blockade of the Gaza Strip was established by Israel 
on 3 January 2009 and announced by the Israeli Navy on 6 January. The advisory states that 
&#8220;the Gaza maritime area is closed to all maritime traffic and is under blockade imposed by 
[the] Israeli Navy until further notice.&#8221;20 This advisory was publicized inter alia in a further 
Notice to Mariners (NTM)  and through other channels. It was also publicized twice daily 
on the NAVTEX broadcast system, regularly updating shipping according to location via a 
direct-printing service.21 Chief Military Advocate General Mandelblit stated that this

pp. 18f. </p>


<p>blockade was approved at ministry level by the State Attorney without involving military 
legal advice.22 
</p>
<p>35. Senior Israeli officials have stated that the legal basis for the blockade was (1) the 
San Remo Manual, (2) the London Declaration and (3) customary law23 and the existence 
of an armed conflict between Hamas and Israel that had continued after Operation Cast 
Lead.24 
</p>
<p>36. A military closure order was signed by the Commander of the Israeli Navy on 28 
May 2010,25 prohibiting persons from entering a specified &#8220;closed area&#8221; referred to as 
&#8220;Area A&#8221; and advising all ships and persons to stay away from a &#8220;dangerous area&#8221; referred 
to as &#8220;Area B&#8221;26 but, according to testimony received by the Mission, not gazetted. The 
order announcing the blockade was presented by the representative of the State in a hearing 
on the extension of detention of four Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel as the provision on 
the basis of which the Israeli forces entered international waters. The application to extend 
the arrest of the 4 individuals concerned was based on the argument that there had been a 
violation of the above mentioned order. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip 
</b></p>
<p>37. The humanitarian situation in Gaza resulting from the imposition of the blockade on 
the Gaza Strip since June 2007 has been a matter of increasing concern for the international 
community, including the Security Council. Following the Flotilla incident, the Security 
Council qualified the situation in Gaza as &#8220;not sustainable&#8221;, stressing the full 
implementation of Resolutions 1850 (2008) and 1860 (2009), in which it, inter alia, 
expressed &#8220;grave concern [...] at the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza&#8221;, emphasized 
&#8220;the need to ensure sustained and regular flow of goods and people through the Gaza 
crossings&#8221; and called  for the &#8220;unimpeded provision and distribution throughout Gaza of

</p>
<p>expressed &#8220;grave concern ...at the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza&#8221; and emphasized &#8220;the need 
to ensure sustained and regular flow of goods and people through the Gaza crossings.  It called for the 
&#8220;unimpeded provision and distribution throughout Gaza of humanitarian assistance, including food, 
fuel and medical treatment&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 28 Statement by the representative of the United States of American to the Human Rights Council, 
Geneva, 1 June 2010. </p>


<p>Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) 
emphasized that &#8220;such tragedies are entirely avoidable if Israel heeds the repeated calls of 
the international community to end its counterproductive and unacceptable blockade of 
Gaza.&#8221; In a public statement issued on 14 June 2010, the International Committee of the 
Red Cross (ICRC) described the impact of the closure on the situation in Gaza as 
&#8220;devastating&#8221; for the 1.5 million people living there, emphasizing that &#8220;the closure 
constitutes a collective punishment imposed in clear violation of Israel&#8217;s obligations under 
international humanitarian law&#8221;, saying the only sustainable solution was a lifting of the 
closure.  
</p>
<p>39. Similarly, the Human Rights Committee, in its concluding observations of 3 
September 2010, expressed its concern at the &#8220;effects of the blockade on the civilian 
population in the Gaza Strip, including restrictions to their freedom of movement, some of 
which led to deaths of patients in need of urgent medical care, as well as restrictions on the 
access to sufficient drinking water and adequate sanitation.&#8221;  It recommended that Israel lift 
the military blockade of Gaza, insofar as it adversely affects the civilian population.29 
</p>
<p>40. According to information provided to the Mission by the United Nations Office for 
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territory, the 
blockade exacerbated the already existing difficulties of the population in Gaza in terms of 
livelihoods and brought to new peaks the severe human dignity crisis resulting from the 
deteriorated public services, widespread poverty, food insecurity, over 40 per cent 
unemployment and 80 per cent aid dependence (i.e. some 80 per cent of the population 
receives humanitarian assistance, mainly food). People&#8217;s lives were reduced to a daily 
struggle in an attempt to secure the most basic needs. 
</p>
<p>41. &#8220;Abject poverty&quot; among refugees has tripled since the imposition of the blockade 
from 100,000 to 300,000 and 61 per cent of households are food insecure. There has been a 
shift in diet (from protein rich to low cost and high carbohydrate foods), triggering concerns 
over mineral and vitamin deficiencies. Moreover, Gaza has been affected by a protracted 
energy crisis, with the power plant operating at 30 per cent of its capacity, scheduled cuts of 
8-12 hours per day, leaving households with partial food refrigeration. Services and utilities 
are forced to rely on generators and UPS units vulnerable due to inconsistent supply of 
spare parts.  
</p>
<p>42. Water and sanitation services have deteriorated and resulted in over 40 per cent of 
water loss due to leakages. On a daily basis, eighty million litres of untreated and partially 
treated sewage is discharged into the environment. Polluted sea water has led to increased 
health risks and as a result of sewage infiltrating into the aquifer only between five and ten 
per cent of the extracted water is safe. Challenges to the health system include the 
impossibility of ensuring that medical equipment is available and properly maintained, 
while referral abroad is subject to long and arduous permit processing and medical staff are 
prevented from upgrading knowledge and skills.  
</p>
<p>43. On 20 June 2010, the Security Cabinet of the Government of Israel decided on 
several steps to implement a new Governmental policy towards Gaza, seeking to keep 
weapons and war material out of Gaza while liberalizing the system by which civilian 
goods enter Gaza.30 In July, the United Nations and international relief agencies cautiously 
welcomed the easing of import restrictions on the blockade, but emphasized that only a 
complete lifting of the blockade can address the humanitarian crisis, highlighting that this

<p>would also mean bringing exports out of Gaza in order to rebuild the economy destroyed by 
the blockade.31 
</p>
<p>44. At the end of August, OCHA reported that despite the easing of the restrictions and 
an increase of imports into the Gaza Strip for some weeks, ongoing restrictions on the entry 
of construction materials, as well as on exports, continued to impede major reconstruction 
and development, noting that the truckloads of goods entering Gaza during the week of 18 
to 24 August constituted only 37 per cent of the weekly average of truckloads that entered 
during the first five months of 2007, prior to the imposition of the blockade. In the same 
report, OCHA also highlights the continuing fuel shortage and electricity crisis in the Gaza 
Strip.32  The impact of the power cuts in terms of putting people&#8217;s lives at risk, for instance 
those people in need of medical treatment (i.e. dialysis patients), was also highlighted by 
the ICRC in a press release on 7 September 2010. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Information on recent armed hostilities 
</b></p>
<p>45. According to OCHA, in 2010, 41 Palestinians (including 14 civilians), 3 Israeli 
soldiers and one foreign national have been killed in the context of the Palestinian-Israeli 
conflict in the Gaza Strip and southern Israel, with another 178 Palestinians (including 154 
civilians) and 8 Israeli soldiers having been injured.33 According to the Israeli Defense 
Forces, a total of 120 rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip into Israel from 1 January to 
31 July 2010.34 This figure does not include failed attempts or firing directly at Israeli 
forces. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Applicable law 
</b></p>
<p>46. At the outset it should be noted that a State is responsible for the conduct of its 
officials, including its armed forces, when acting either in their official capacity or when 
acting under the authority of, and using means put at their disposal by, the State, even if 
exceeding their authority or contravening instructions.35 In the course of enforcement 
actions carried out by a State, certain fundamental, minimum obligations are applicable at 
all times, whether an operation is governed by the laws of armed conflict (LOAC) or the 
laws of international human rights law. The content of those obligations is not affected by 
the legality or otherwise of a State&#8217;s claim to exercise authority over individuals or 
property.  
</p>
<p>47. However, acting in an official capacity does not relieve a State agent of individual 
criminal responsibility. It is possible that individual criminal liability and State 
responsibility may arise from the same act. The fact that the State bears international 
responsibility does not mean that individuals cannot also bear individual criminal liability.

<p><b> 1. The law of naval warfare and the question of the blockade 
</b></p>
<p>48. Considering the issues raised by the mandate given to the Mission which involved 
issues of law relating to naval warfare and the matter of a naval blockade imposed by Israel, 
the Mission views those matters as follows. 
</p>
<p>49. According to applicable international law, unless an exception applies, a vessel on 
the high seas is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of its flag State. Under the international 
law of the sea such exceptions are usually limited to suspicion of certain activities (piracy, 
the slave trade, unauthorized high seas broadcasting), ships suspected of lacking nationality 
(i.e. stateless vessels) and cases where permission to board and inspect have been given 
either ad hoc or by treaty (e.g. those related to narcotics smuggling).36 Other exceptions 
would include acts of self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter against 
vessels which posed an immediate and overwhelming threat to the boarding State and 
lawful acts under LOAC. 
</p>
<p>50. It has been suggested that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 
(UNCLOS), by reserving the use of the high seas for peaceful purposes,37 has effectively 
outlawed acts of naval warfare on the high seas. First, it should be noted that Israel is not a 
party to the Convention. Second, there was no consensus on this position during the 
negotiation of the Convention and it was certainly not accepted by the major naval powers 
at the time. Indeed, the military manuals of many States (both UNCLOS parties and non-
parties) continue to include provisions on the law of naval warfare and blockade.38 Further, 
a report of the United Nations Secretary General found that these UNCLOS provisions did 
not affect action that was lawful either under the law of self-defence under Article 51 of the 
Charter of the United Nations (the <i>jus ad bellum</i>) or acts justified by the law of armed 
conflict (LOAC) once an armed conflict has commenced (the <i>jus in bello</i>).39<b> </b>The majority 
of scholarly opinion would also support the view that the law of naval warfare continues to 
be potentially applicable on the high seas. One attempt at codifying this law was the 
independent expert study, the San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed 
Conflicts at Sea (SRM).40<b> </b>While not authoritative, its codification effort has had a 
significant impact on the formulation of military manuals and it has been expressly relied 
upon by Israel.

<p>to enforce that blockade on the high seas.41<b> </b>A blockade must satisfy a number of legal 
requirements, including: notification, effective and impartial enforcement and 
proportionality.42<b> </b>In particular a blockade is illegal if: 
</p>
<p>(a) it has the sole purpose of starving the civilian population or denying it other 
objects essential for its survival; or 
</p>
<p>(b) the damage to the civilian population is, or may be expected to be, excessive 
in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated from the blockade.43 
</p>
<p>52. A blockade may not continue to be enforced where it inflicts disproportionate 
damage on the civilian population. The usual meaning of &#8220;damage to the civilian 
population&#8221; in the law of armed conflict refers to deaths, injuries and property damage. 
Here the damage may be thought of as the destruction of the civilian economy and 
prevention of reconstruction further to damage. One might also note, insofar as many in 
Gaza face a shortage of food or the means to buy it, that the ordinary meaning of 
&#8220;starvation&#8221; under the law of armed conflict is simply to cause hunger.44 
</p>
<p>53. In evaluating the evidence submitted to the Mission, including by OCHA oPt, 
confirming the severe humanitarian situation in Gaza, the destruction of the economy and 
the prevention of reconstruction (as detailed above), the Mission is satisfied that the 
blockade was inflicting disproportionate damage upon the civilian population in the Gaza 
strip and that as such the interception could not be justified and therefore has to be 
considered illegal. 
</p>
<p>54. Moreover, the Mission emphasizes that according to article 33 of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention, collective punishment of civilians under occupation is prohibited. &#8220;No 
protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed. 
Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are 
prohibited.&#8221; The Mission considers that one of the principal motives behind the imposition 
of the blockade was a desire to punish the people of the Gaza Strip for having elected 
Hamas. The combination of this motive and the effect of the restrictions on the Gaza Strip 
leave no doubt that Israel&#8217;s actions and policies amount to collective punishment as defined 
by international law. In this connection, the Mission supports the findings of the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 
1967, Richard Falk,45 the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza 
Conflict46 and most recently the ICRC47 that the blockade amounts to collective punishment 
in violation of Israel&#8217;s obligations under international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>55. It might be suggested that a belligerent in an armed conflict has a right to visit, 
inspect and control the destinations of neutral vessels on the high seas, irrespective of any

</p>
<p>inflicted by the Government of Israel on the people of Gaza&#8221;; A/HRC/12/48, para. 1878. 
 47 In its statement of 14 June 2010, the ICRC maintained that &#8220;the whole of Gaza's civilian population is 
</p>
<p>being punished for acts for which they bear no responsibility. The closure therefore constitutes a 
collective punishment imposed in clear violation of Israel's obligations under international

<p>declared blockade. Whilst there is some controversy on this issue,<b> </b>the San Remo Manual 
and a number of military manuals take the view that the right may only be exercised upon 
reasonable suspicion that a vessel is engaged in activities which support the enemy.48 The 
Mission takes the view that a right of interference with third States&#8217; freedom of navigation 
should not lightly be presumed. 
</p>
<p>56. Thus, if there is no lawful blockade, the only lawful basis for intercepting the vessel 
would be a reasonable suspicion that it: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; was making an effective contribution to the opposing forces&#8217; war effort, such as by 
carrying weaponry or was otherwise closely integrated into the enemy war effort 
(belligerent right of capture);49 or 
</p>
<p>&#8226; posed an imminent and overwhelming threat to Israel and there was no alternative 
but to use force to prevent it (self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations 
Charter). 
</p>
<p>In view of the information available, the Mission is satisfied that the interception of the 
flotilla and related preparatory planning by Israel was not purely motivated by concerns as 
to the vessels&#8217; contribution to the war effort. Evidence attributed to the Chief of General 
Staff, Gabi Ashkenazi, who testified that he did not believe that the Foundation for Human 
Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief (IHH), one of the coalition members 
organizing the flotilla, was a &#8220;terrorist organization&#8221;.50 The evidence of Prime Minister 
Netanyahu to the Turkel Committee indicates that the decision to stop the flotilla was not 
taken because the vessels in themselves posed any immediate security threat. In any event, 
no such right of belligerent interdiction or wider claim of self-defence against the Flotilla 
has been asserted by Israel. 
</p>
<p>57. Therefore the Mission is satisfied not only that the flotilla presented no imminent 
threat but that the interception was motivated by concerns about the possible propaganda 
victory that might be claimed by the organizers of the flotilla. 
</p>
<p>58. Given the evidence at the Turkel Committee, it is clear that there was no reasonable 
suspicion that the Flotilla posed any military risk of itself. As a result, no case could be 
made for intercepting the vessels in the exercise of belligerent rights or Article 51 self-
defence. Thus, no case can be made for the legality of the interception and the Mission 
therefore finds that the interception was illegal. 
</p>
<p>59. The Mission finds that the policy of blockade or closure regime, including the naval 
blockade imposed by Israel on Gaza was inflicting disproportionate civilian damage. The 
Mission considers that the naval blockade was implemented in support of the overall 
closure regime. As such it was part of a single disproportionate measure of armed conflict 
and as such cannot itself be found proportionate. 
</p>
<p>60. Furthermore, the closure regime is considered by the Mission to constitute collective 
punishment of the people living in the Gaza Strip and thus to be illegal and contrary to 
article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

</p>
<p>Number 4, 11 August 2010, responding to a question by Professor Deutch; see http://www.turkel-
committee.gov.il/files/wordocs/07790ga.doc. The Mission notes that a German-based organization 
called &#8220;Internationale Humanitaere Hilfsorganisation&#8221; that shares the same abbreviation but has no 
connection with the Turkish organization, is under investigation in Germany for alleged &#8220;terrorist&#8221; 
links.  </p>


<p>61. The Mission considers that the enforcement of an illegal blockade does not only 
constitute a violation of the laws of war, but also a violation of the laws of neutrality giving 
rise to State responsibility. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. International humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>62. The relevant international humanitarian law standards binding on Israel as the 
occupying power in the occupied Palestinian territory are set out in the Fourth Geneva 
Convention of 1949 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. In 
addition, Israel is bound by customary rules of international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>63. As the occupying power, Israel has certain obligations imposed on it by international 
law. The International Court of Justice has concluded that the Fourth Geneva Convention is 
applicable in the occupied Palestinian territories which before the 1967 conflict lay to the 
east of the Green Line and which during the conflict were occupied by Israel.51 This is also 
the case for the Gaza strip, despite the unilateral withdrawal by Israel of the forces from the 
Gaza Strip in 2005, as the occupation has been confirmed repeatedly since then by the 
General Assembly and the Security Council.52  In this context, the Mission notes that 
occupation continues to the extent to which the occupying power retains effective control.  
</p>
<p>64. The Mission agrees with the assessment presented in the Goldstone Report as 
follows: 
</p>
<p>Given the specific geopolitical configuration of the Gaza Strip, the powers that Israel 
exercises from the borders enable it to determine the conditions of life within the 
Gaza Strip. Israel controls the border crossings (including to a significant degree the 
Rafah crossing to Egypt, under the terms of the Agreement on Movement and 
Access) and decides what and who gets in or out of the Gaza Strip. It also controls 
the territorial sea adjacent to the Gaza Strip and has declared a virtual blockade and 
limits to the fishing zone, thereby regulating economic activity in that zone. It also 
keeps complete control of the airspace of the Gaza Strip, inter alia, through 
continuous surveillance by aircraft and unmanned aviation vehicles (UAVs) or 
drones. It makes military incursions and from time to time hit[s] targets within the 
Gaza Strip. No-go areas are declared within the Gaza Strip near the border where 
Israeli settlements used to be and enforced by the Israeli armed forces. Furthermore, 
Israel regulates the local monetary market based on the Israeli currency (the new 
sheqel) and controls taxes and custom duties.53 
</p>
<p>The Mission is satisfied that these circumstances continued to prevail at the time of the 
incident under investigation. 
</p>
<p>65. Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, individuals may not be killed, tortured, ill-
treated or suffer humiliating and degrading treatment and there may not be destruction of 
property unless absolutely necessary for the military operation. Article 147 of the Fourth 
Geneva Convention spells out a list of &#8220;grave breaches&#8221; of international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>66. Flotilla passengers were civilians and in the context of the interception of the vessels 
must be considered protected persons. Under article 4 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, 
protected persons &#8220;are those who, at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find 
themselves &#8230; in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are

<p>not nationals&#8221;. In a situation of armed conflict, military force can only be used against a 
combatant or against civilians participating actively and directly in combat activities, which 
cannot be said of the civilians on the <i>Mavi Marmara</i>. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. International human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>67. Israel is party to the core human rights treaties relevant to the situation under 
consideration.54 The vessels in the flotilla whilst in international waters were also subject to 
the jurisdiction of the flag states, namely Cambodia (<i>Rachel Corrie</i>), Comoros (<i>Mavi 
Marmara</i>), Greece (<i>Eleftheri Mesogios</i>), Kiribati (<i>Defne Y</i>), Togo (<i>Sfendoni</i>), Turkey 
(<i>Gazze 1</i>) and the United States of America (<i>Challenger 1</i>), The international human rights 
treaties accepted by each of these States at the time of the incident under investigation were 
applicable on the relevant vessels. 
</p>
<p>68. Human rights law in its entirety continues to apply in situations of armed conflict, 
except for derogations in accordance with treaty provisions relating to times of 
emergencies. In this respect the Mission notes the recent reiteration by the Human Rights 
Committee of its view that &#8220;the applicability of the regime of international humanitarian 
law during an armed conflict, as well as in a situation of occupation, does not preclude the 
application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, except by operation 
of article 4, whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national 
emergency.&#8221;55 In its General Comment 29, the Human Rights Committee specified that the 
Covenant continues to apply in situations of armed conflict to which the rules of 
international humanitarian law are applicable. &#8220;While, in respect of certain Covenant rights, 
more specific rules of international humanitarian law may be especially relevant for the 
purposes of the interpretation of Covenant rights, both spheres of law are complementary, 
not mutually exclusive.&#8221;56 
</p>
<p>69. Moreover, in the <i>Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion</i> (1996) the ICJ affirmed the 
applicability of the Covenant during armed conflict, stating that &#8220;In principle, the right not 
arbitrarily to be deprived of one&#8217;s life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an 
arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable <i>lex 
specialis</i>, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the 
conduct of hostilities. Thus whether a particular loss of life, through the use of a certain 
weapon in warfare, is to be considered an arbitrary deprivation of life contrary to Article 6 
of the Covenant can only be decided by reference to the law applicable in armed conflict 
and not deduced from the terms of the Covenant itself.&#8221;57 
</p>
<p>70. In its <i>Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory</i>, the Court considered that &quot;the protection offered by the 
human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect 
of provisions for derogation of any kind to be found in Article 4 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As regards the relationship between international 
humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights 
may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively

<p>matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of 
international law.&quot;58 
</p>
<p>71. The Mission is of the view that the conduct of the IDF on board the Mavi Marmara 
as well as the conduct of the authorities in the aftermath of the operation is not limited 
strictly to the law of armed conflict, but is subject also to human rights law. Indeed human 
rights law and international humanitarian law are not mutually exclusive but rather should 
be regarded as complementary and mutually reinforcing to ensure the fullest protection to 
the persons concerned. 
</p>
<p>72. The International Covenant contains several articles which cannot be derogated from 
even &#8220;in times of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation (art. 4).&#8221; Non-
derogable rights include the right to life and the right not to be subjected to torture or to 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of punishment. Israel has made a notification under 
article 4(3) of the International Covenant &#8211; states of emergency, dated 3 October 1991, 
specifically relevant to article 9 regarding liberty and security of person.59<b> </b> In this 
connection, the Human Rights Committee extends in its General Comment No. 29 the list 
of non-derogable provisions as provided for by article 4 (2), emphasizing that States parties 
to the Covenant &#8220;may in no circumstances invoke article 4 of the Covenant as a justification 
for acting in violation of humanitarian law or peremptory norms of international law, for 
instance by taking hostages, by imposing collective punishments, through arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty or by deviating from fundamental principles of fair trial, including the 
presumption of innocence.&#8221;60 
</p>
<p>73. Article 2 of the International Covenant obliges each State party to respect and to 
ensure to all individuals &#8220;within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction&#8221; the rights 
recognized within it. The extra-territorial applicability was elaborated by the Human Rights 
Committee in its general comment 31: &#8220;A State party must respect and ensure the rights 
laid down in the Covenant to anyone with the power or effective control of that State party, 
even if not situated within the territory of the State party.&#8221;61 The applicability of the ICCPR 
&#8220;in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own 
territory&#8221; was confirmed by the ICJ in its 2004 Advisory Opinion on the Wall.62 The

 59 &quot;Since its establishment, the State of Israel has been the victim of continuous threats and attacks on its 
</p>
<p>very existence as well as on the life and property of its citizens. 
&quot;These have taken the form of threats of war, of actual armed attacks and campaigns of terrorism 
resulting in the murder of and injury to human beings. 
&quot;In view of the above, the State of Emergency which was proclaimed in May 1948 has remained in 
force ever since.  This situation constitutes a public emergency within the meaning of article 4 (1) of 
the Covenant. 
&quot;The Government of Israel has therefore found it necessary, in accordance with the said article 4, to 
take measures to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, for the defence of the 
State and for the protection of life and property, including the exercise of powers of arrest and 
detention. 
&quot;In so far as any of these measures are inconsistent with article 9 of the Covenant, Israel thereby 
derogates from its obligations under that provision.&quot;

aftermath 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Organization of the Gaza flotilla and the response of the Government of 
Israel 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Factual description and findings 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Mission found the facts set out below to have been established to its 
satisfaction. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) The aims of the Free Gaza Movement and the Gaza flotilla of May 2010 
</i></p>
<p>76. The Free Gaza Movement, a human rights organization registered as a charity in 
Cyprus, organized five successful boat voyages to Gaza between August and December 
2008 using on each occasion one or two small boats. The self-declared purpose of the 
voyages was to break the blockade on Gaza. The boats were not intercepted by the Israeli 
authorities at the time, although some threatening messages were received by the organizers 
from the Israeli authorities. A sixth mission in December 2008 was obliged to divert to 
</p>
<p>  
 63 CCPR/ISR/CO/3, para.5: &#8220;The Committee reiterates its view, previously noted in paragraph 11 of its 
</p>
<p>concluding observations on the State party&#8217;s second periodic report (CCPR/CO/78/ISR) and 
paragraph 10 of its concluding observations on the State party&#8217;s initial report (CCPR/C/79/Add.93), 
that the applicability of the regime of international humanitarian law during an armed conflict, as well 
as in a situation of occupation, does not preclude the application of the Covenant, except by operation 
of article 4, whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency. The 
Committee&#8217;s position has been endorsed, unanimously, by the International Court of Justice in its 
<i>Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory</i> (Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 2004, p. 136), according to which the 
Covenant is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own 
territory. Furthermore, the applicability of the regime of international humanitarian law does not 
preclude accountability of States parties under article 2, paragraph 1, of the Covenant for the actions 
of their authorities or agents outside their own territories, including in occupied territories. The 
Committee therefore reiterates and underscores that, contrary to the State party&#8217;s position, in the 
current circumstances, the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the 
occupied territories, including in the Gaza Strip, for all conduct by the State party&#8217;s authorities or 
agents in those territories affecting the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant (arts. 2 and 40). 
</p>
<p>  The State party should ensure the full application of the Covenant in Israel as well as in the occupied 
territories, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the occupied Syrian Golan 
Heights. In accordance with the Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 31, the State party should ensure 
that all persons under its jurisdiction and effective control are afforded the full enjoyment of the rights 
enshrined in the Covenant.&#8221; </p>


<p>Lebanon after the boat was rammed and severely damaged by the Israeli Navy and a 
seventh mission in January 2009 was aborted after fears it too would be rammed.  
</p>
<p>77. On 29 June 2009, approximately 20 nautical miles from the coast of Gaza, the Israeli 
Navy intercepted a boat called the &#8220;Spirit of Humanity&#8221; owned by the Free Gaza 
Movement, carrying 21 passengers and a cargo of humanitarian aid to Gaza. After Israeli 
requests to turn around were refused, the boat was boarded and taken to Ashdod where the 
passengers were arrested and detained.  
</p>
<p>78. After these unsuccessful attempts, the Free Gaza Movement sought wider 
collaboration with other organizations with a view to increasing the number of boats on 
future missions. The Movement established contact with a number of organizations 
including a Turkish humanitarian organization called the Foundation for Human Rights and 
Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief (IHH) which enjoys consultative status with the 
Economic and Social Council. IHH, which has been active in over 120 countries and 
territories including the Gaza Strip, had been planning its own mission to Gaza and 
committed to joining the flotilla with two cargo vessels and a newly-purchased passenger 
boat with a total carrying capacity of over six hundred passengers. A number of other 
organizations, including Ship to Gaza (Sweden), Ship to Gaza (Greece) and the European 
Campaign to Break the Siege on Gaza, also agreed to join what became known as the 
&#8220;Gaza Freedom Flotilla&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>79. The stated aims of the Flotilla, as testified by the leaders of the Free Gaza 
Movement and IHH, were threefold: (a) to draw international public attention to the 
situation in the Gaza Strip and the effect the blockade; (b) to break the blockade; and (c) to 
deliver humanitarian assistance and supplies to Gaza. All participants interviewed by the 
Mission shared their aims, although most placed emphasis on the delivery of humanitarian 
aid.  
</p>
<p>80. The Mission notes a certain tension between the political objectives of the flotilla 
and its humanitarian objectives. This comes to light the moment that the Government of 
Israel made offers to allow the humanitarian aid to be delivered via Israeli ports but under 
the supervision of a neutral organization. The Mission also notes that the Gaza Strip does 
not possess a deep sea port designed to receive the kind of cargo vessels included in the 
flotilla, raising practical logistical questions about the plan to deliver large quantities of aid 
by the route chosen. Whilst the Mission is satisfied that the flotilla constituted a serious 
attempt to bring essential humanitarian supplies into Gaza, it seems clear that the primary 
objective was political, as indeed demonstrated by the decision of those on board the 
<i>Rachel Corrie</i> to reject a Government  of Ireland-sponsored proposal that the cargo in that 
ship to be allowed through Ashdod intact.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Composition of the flotilla 
</i></p>
<p>81. The flotilla was composed initially of eight vessels carrying a total of 748 persons 
(see table in annexes):  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>M.V. Mavi Marmara</i> &#8211; a passenger ship registered in the Comoros64<b> </b>and owned by 
IHH; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>M.V. Defne Y</i> &#8211; a cargo boat registered in Kiribati and owned by IHH; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>M.V. Gazze 1<b> </b></i>&#8211; a  cargo boat registered in Turkey and owned by IHH;  
</p>
<p>  
 64 The ship was bought by IHH early in 2010 with funds raised by members and was registered with the 
</p>
<p>Comoros just a few days before it set sail for Gaza. </p>


<p>&#8226; <i>M.V. Sfendoni or Sfendonh</i> &#8211; a passenger boat registered in Togo and owned by 
Sfendonh S.A. based in the Marshall Islands. The boat was given an alternative 
name, &#8220;Boat 8000&#8221;, just before it joined the flotilla which was used in official Israeli 
accounts;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>M.V. Eleftheri Mesogios or Sofia<b> </b></i>&#8211; a cargo boat registered in Greece and owned by 
the Eleftheri Mesogios Marine Company based in Athens. The Greek name of the 
ship translates as &#8220;Free Mediterranean&#8221; and an alternative name &#8220;Sofia&#8221; is also used 
in some accounts;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Challenger 1</i> &#8211; a pleasure boat registered in the United States of America and owned 
by the Free Gaza Movement;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Challenger 2</i> &#8211; a pleasure boat registered in the United States of America and owned 
by Free Gaza Movement; and  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>M.V. Rachel Corrie<b> </b></i>&#8211; a cargo ship registered in Cambodia and owned by the Free 
Gaza Movement.  
</p>
<p>The participating organizations were obliged to purchase their own vessels since 
commercial shipping companies were reluctant to allow their vessels to be chartered for the 
planned flotilla. The services of the crew of the IHH-owned cargo ships were procured 
through an agency in Istanbul. 
</p>
<p>82. The <i>Challenger 2</i> withdrew from the flotilla when it developed engine problems. Its 
passengers were transferred to the <i>Challenger 1</i> and the <i>Mavi Marmara</i> in international 
waters. The departure of the <i>Rachel Corrie</i> from Ireland was delayed and it therefore was 
unable to join the flotilla on 31 May. Since it was intercepted by the Israeli Navy on 6 June 
in international waters and its passengers went through the same detention and deportation 
process, the Mission has included this vessel in its investigation.  
</p>
<p>83. In line with practice during previous trips, some passengers planned to board certain 
ships in international waters after being ferried from Cyprus. However, at the last moment, 
the Cypriot authorities refused to allow these passengers to embark. After a series of failed 
attempts to embark from ports in the south of the island, some passengers were able to 
embark from the port of Famagusta. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Preparation of the flotilla 
</i></p>
<p>84. The participating organizations in the flotilla were loosely bound together by a nine-
point agreement, entitled &#8220;Points of Unity&#8221;, delineating the points of common purpose 
shared by all participants, including their commitment to resist interception only through 
the use of non-violent means. According to the Free Gaza Movement, a steering committee, 
made of representatives of the participant organizations, was set up in each vessel.  
</p>
<p>85. Individuals with some 40 different nationalities joined the flotilla. Each organization 
applied its own criteria in selecting who should join the various vessels. There was no 
unified protocol across all participating organizations to register prospective passengers 
using a single signed form, although individual organizations did require applications to be 
filled out and a screening and selection process took place. Many of the participants 
interviewed did not have specific skills or qualifications for humanitarian work. Some 
organizations said that they selected participants on the basis of their qualifications (for 
example, medical doctors), status as people of influence (parliamentarians, authors) as well 
as their ability to resist provocation. Some organizers expressed a preference for people 
who were known to them. 
</p>
<p>86. The mission&#8217;s attention was drawn to allegations that one of the passengers on the 
ship, who had logistical responsibilities with regard to the cargo on the <i>Mavi Marmara</i>, was </p>


<p>convicted and had served a term of imprisonment for his involvement in the 1996 hijacking 
of a Russian ferry boat. The hijackers were demanding the release of Chechen prisoners at 
the time.65 
</p>
<p>87. Participants raised money within their communities for the trip and also solicited 
cash donations which would be given directly to the population of Gaza.  
</p>
<p>88. There was stringent security surrounding the <i>Mavi Mamara </i>in the port of Antalya 
and all items taken on board were checked. Passengers and their luggage were subjected to 
security checks similar to those found in airports before boarding, including body searches 
The passengers who were transferred from the <i>Challenger 1</i> onto the <i>Mavi Marmara</i> on the 
ocean were subjected to the same security checks.  
</p>
<p>89. Similar meticulous security checks were carried out on passengers onboard the 
<i>Eleftheri Mesogios</i> at the port in Greece. The <i>Sfendoni</i> was primarily carrying passengers 
but also had on board a few medical items, including an ultra-sound machine, which had 
been donated. The boat&#8217;s captain personally checked the machine and the boat to confirm 
that there were no weapons or similar items on board. Witnesses also said that the cargo on 
board the<i> Rachel Corrie </i>was checked by three independent authorities and sealed before it 
left Ireland. The seals remained intact when the ship was boarded by the Israelis.  
</p>
<p>90. Testimony did not show a clear logistical plan as to how the large amounts of 
humanitarian aid being carried by the cargo ships in the flotilla would be unloaded in Gaza 
given the limited port facilities in Gaza. One witness said that he understood that IHH 
workers already in Gaza were preparing cranes to off-load the cargo into smaller boats. 
Another witness confirmed this plan and said that the <i>Eleftheri Mesogios</i> itself had a crane. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Planned course and destination of the flotilla 
</i></p>
<p>91. The vessels participating in the flotilla to Gaza departed from different ports at 
different dates, as shown below and made for an agreed rendezvous point in international 
waters, approximately 40 nautical miles south of Cyprus. The following vessels proceeded 
to the rendezvous as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 14 May 2010, <i>Gazze 1</i> departs from Istanbul to Iskenderun 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 18 May, <i>Rachel Corrie</i> departs Greenore Port, Ireland, bound for Malta. It had 
initially left Dundalk on 14 May but stopped for repairs. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 22 May, <i>Mavi Marmara</i> departs from Istanbul to Antalya, Turkey 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 22 May, <i>Gazze 1</i> departs Iskenderun towards Gaza 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 24 May, <i>Defne Y</i> departs from Istanbul  
</p>
<p>&#8226; 24 May, <i>Elftheri Mesogios</i> departs Piraeus, Greece 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 25 May, <i>Mavi Marmara</i> arrives in Antalya, Turkey 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 25 May, <i>Sfendoni</i> departs Piraeus, Greece (then makes an intermediary stop in 
Rhodes). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 28 May,  <i>Mavi Marmara</i> departs Antalya, Turkey. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 29 May, <i>Challenger 1</i> and <i>Challenger 2</i> depart from Crete; the <i>Rachel Corrie</i> 
arrives in Malta.

<p>&#8226; 30 May, the six vessels congregate at a meeting point to the south of Cyprus; the 
<i>Rachel Corrie</i> departs Malta. 
</p>
<p>92. Embarkation documents for the vessels leaving Turkey gave Gaza as the official 
destination, although customs documents stated the destination as Lebanon since the 
computer system did not include Gaza as a designated port of entry. Some crew members 
interviewed from certain boats said that they understood the intention to be to sail first to 
Egypt and then enter Gaza waters from the west. 
</p>
<p>93. The flotilla commenced its journey towards Gaza at 1554 hours on 30 May 2010 
from the position approximately 65 nautical miles west of the coast of Lebanon.  
</p>
<p><i> (e) Israeli advance plans to intercept the flotilla 
</i></p>
<p>94. According to the Israel Defense Force Chief of Staff, the Israeli authorities learned 
of the planned flotilla in early February 2010 and understood that its intention was to break 
the blockade. Diplomatic efforts began immediately to prevent the flotilla from sailing and 
contingency plans began to be formulated. Formal initial orders to undertake preparations 
to intercept the flotilla were issued in mid-April and by 12 May a mission plan had been 
developed which was approved by the Israeli Chief of General Staff on 13 May 2010.  
</p>
<p>95. On 13 May 2010, the Israeli Chief of General Staff sent a letter to the Defence 
Minister and Prime Minister setting out options for dealing with the flotilla, including the 
military option of commandeering and impounding the ships and detaining the passengers. 
A further evaluation was made on 26 May and the Defense Minister formally authorized 
the operation. Extensive training and planning was undertaken, including the setting up of a 
processing centre for detainees at the Port of Ashdod. 
</p>
<p>96. According to information available to the Mission, the Israeli forces deployed to 
intercept the flotilla included a number of corvettes and missile boats, helicopters, zodiacs, 
surveillance aircraft and possibly two submarines. Soldiers from the &#8220;Shayetet 13&#8221; special 
naval forces unit took part in the operation. The operation was given the code name 
&#8220;Operation Sea Breeze&#8221; or &#8220;Operation Sky Winds&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>97. Advanced identification and surveillance of specific passengers by Israeli 
intelligence forces took place, as indicated by a laminated booklet, recovered from the 
possessions of one of the captured Israeli soldiers which contained the names and 
photographs of specific high-profile individuals on each of the six vessels as well as 
photographs of each vessel. One passenger was able to confirm that the photograph of her 
included in the booklet was taken just a few days before the flotilla sailed. Advance 
surveillance is confirmed by evidence attributed to Defence Minister Ehud Barak before the 
Turkel Committee which indicated that specific orders were taken &#8220;to continue intelligence 
tracking of the flotilla organizers, with an emphasis on the possibility that amongst the 
passengers in the flotilla there would be terror elements who would attempt to harm Israeli 
forces&#8221;.66 
</p>
<p><i> (f) Preparations to defend the vessels in the event of an attempt to board 
</i></p>
<p>98. It is clear to the Mission that, as the flotilla was assembling off Cyprus, participants 
became aware of the full extent of Israeli plans to intercept, board and commandeer the 
ships. Details of the Israeli plans had been published in an Israeli newspaper. Many 
passengers said that, prior to this point, they believed that the Israelis would try to block the 
path of the flotilla and force it to divert, but they did not imagine that they would seek to 
</p>
<p>  
 66 Testimony of Ehud Barak, Minister of Defence, Turkel Committee: Public Commission of Inquiry. </p>


<p>board the vessels by force. This belief persisted among many less-experienced passengers 
right up to the moment of the interception, notwithstanding the precedent of the <i>Spirit of 
Humanity</i> in 2009. Many passengers told the Mission that they did not really believe that 
the Israelis would attempt to board until the first boats approached the <i>Mavi Marmara</i> on 
the morning of 31 May. 
</p>
<p><i>  Preparation and planning on the Mavi Marmara 
</i></p>
<p>99. The full realization that the Israelis were serious about commandeering the flotilla 
spread through the passengers on the <i>Mavi Marmara</i> during the course of 30 May. There is 
clear evidence that some people on board the <i>Mavi Marmara</i>, including senior IHH leaders, 
were prepared actively to defend the ship against any boarding attempt. Video evidence 
shows a meeting of about 50 to 100 passengers on the ship on 30 May at which the IHH 
President and a number of other prominent passengers spoke with some bravado about 
preventing an Israeli takeover of the ship. The pressure of the water hoses was seen being 
tested on the decks the day before the interception. 
</p>
<p>100. Following radio communication with the Israeli Navy and the sightings of the Israeli 
vessels, it became apparent that a boarding of the ship was an imminent reality. Passengers 
were instructed to put on their life jackets. Although there does not seem to have been a 
coordinated plan involving all passengers, some individuals grouped together with the 
intention of defending the ship. There is little evidence of any unified command to 
coordinate the defence of the ship. 
</p>
<p>101. During the night of 30 to 31 May, some passengers took electric tools from the 
ship&#8217;s workshop, which was not kept locked and sawed sections of railings into lengths of 
approximately one and a half metres, apparently for use as weapons. Lengths of metal 
chains from between the railings were also removed. When the ship&#8217;s crew discovered this, 
the tools were confiscated and locked in the radio room on the bridge. A number of the 
passengers were also provided with gas masks to counter the effects of tear gas. However, 
the Mission notes that the ship&#8217;s standard fire-fighting equipment would have included 
breathing apparatus. Furthermore, the fact that some passengers engaged in last minute 
efforts to fashion rudimentary weapons shortly prior to the interception confirms the 
findings of the Mission that no weapons were brought on board the ship. 
</p>
<p><i>  Preparation and planning on the Challenger 1, Sfendoni, Eleftheri Mesogios and the 
Rachel Corrie 
</i></p>
<p>102. Passengers and crew on the <i>Challenger 1 </i>underwent training in passive resistance 
techniques, non-violence and what to do if detained in Israel (including contacting a lawyer 
before embarkation). Witnesses said discussions took place in advance amongst the 
passengers on how to respond to an Israeli attempt to board the ship during which the crew 
had insisted that there should be no attempts to repel boarders with physical force. The 
captain and crew opposed a suggestion that access to the bridge should be blocked, as it 
was feared this would incense the soldiers. The intention, according to witnesses, was to 
show a symbolic resistance to the soldiers sufficient to demonstrate that the boarding was 
unwanted. The planned response to a boarding of the <i>Challenger 1</i> was in part informed by 
the experience of some of the passengers on previous boats which had been intercepted by 
the Israelis. 
</p>
<p>103. Witnesses aboard the <i>Svendoni</i> and the <i>Eleftheri Mesogios</i> confirmed similar 
discussions aboard their vessels. On the <i>Eleftheri Mesogios</i>, it was also decided that water 
hoses could be misconstrued as weapons and hence should not be used. On the<i> Sfendoni,</i> 
passengers intended to sit on the decks and slow down any attempt to take control of the 
bridge through passive resistance. </p>


<p>104. The passengers on board the <i>Rachel Corrie</i> agreed and notified the Israelis before 
boarding that no resistance would be offered to the Israeli forces. 
</p>
<p><i>  Preparation and planning on the Gazze 1 and Defne Y 
</i></p>
<p>105. There is no information to suggest that any specific preparations were made by the 
crew or passengers of <i>Gazze1</i> and <i>Defne Y</i> to defend against a possible boarding. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The interception of the Gaza flotilla by the Israeli Navy on 31 May 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Factual description and findings 
</b></p>
<p>106. The Mission found the following facts to have been established to its satisfaction. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Contacts between the Israeli Navy and the vessels of the flotilla 
</i></p>
<p>107. The flotilla left the rendezvous point at 1554 hours on 30 May 2010 and proceeded 
in a south-westerly direction on course 222 degrees. This course was altered to 185 degrees, 
approximately due south, at 2330 hours upon drawing level with the coast of Israel and in 
order to maintain a course roughly parallel to the coast. The flotilla maintained a distance of 
70 nautical miles from the coast since a NAVTEX (Navigational Telex) advisory had 
warned that the Israeli military were conducting exercises up to 68 nautical miles from the 
coast.  
</p>
<p>108. The first radio contact with the Israeli Navy was at approximately 2230 hours. Each 
vessel was contacted by the Israeli Navy, one after the other, on Channel 16 and requested 
to switch to an alternative channel. Each vessel refused to switch in order that the 
conversation could be monitored by all shipping. The Israeli Navy requested each vessel to 
identify itself and state its destination. It then warned each vessel, with some variations, it 
was approaching an area of hostilities which is under a naval blockade, that the Gaza 
maritime area is closed to all vessels and that they must change course to deliver their 
supplies to the Port of Ashdod in Israel. In some of the messages, the captain of each vessel 
was warned that he would be held personally responsible for any consequences of a failure 
to comply with the Israeli request. The Israeli Navy&#8217;s contacts were similar to those in 
relation to previous Free Gaza Movement efforts to enter Gaza by sea.  
</p>
<p>109. In response, the captains of the various vessels stated that their destination was Gaza 
and the purpose was to deliver humanitarian aid. They also asserted that the Israeli forces 
did not have the right to order the vessels to change course and that the blockade referred to 
was illegal. A representative of the Free Gaza Movement spoke to the Israelis on behalf of 
the whole flotilla, reiterating that the passengers were unarmed civilians delivering 
humanitarian aid and that none of the ships that should be considered as any form of threat 
to Israel. At no stage was a request made by the Israeli Navy for the cargo to be inspected. 
Contacts with the Israeli Navy continued until around 0200 hours when communication 
equipment was jammed by the Israeli forces, cutting them off to all external 
communications. However, the vessels in the flotilla were able to maintain contact with one 
another via handheld two-way radios. 
</p>
<p>110. In early June 2010, audio recordings were released by the Israeli authorities of 
apparent exchanges between the Israeli Navy and the <i>Defne Y</i> which included insulting 
references by unknown persons referring to &#8220;Auschwitz&#8221; and the 11 September 2001 attack 
on the World Trade Centre in New York. However, the Mission is not satisfied that these 
recordings are authentic, nor has the Government of Israel made this material available to 
the Mission for appropriate examination. The Mission was given positive evidence that no 
such statements were made by anyone involved in communications on the flotilla. </p>


<p>111. The crew and passengers of the six vessels became visually aware of the presence of 
Israeli naval vessels some time after the initial communications, between 2300 hours and 
midnight, both through sightings and two-way radio communication between the vessels. 
The larger Israeli ships and helicopters came into view of the crew of the vessels at 
approximately 0100 hours on 31 May. Similar sightings were made by other vessels in the 
flotilla at around the same time.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Events on board the M.V. Mavi Marmara67 
</i></p>
<p> (i) Initial attempt to board the Mavi Marmara from the sea 
</p>
<p>112. Israeli zodiac boats made a first attempt to board the <i>Mavi Marmara</i> from the sea 
shortly before 0430 hours. Several zodiac boats approached the ship at the stern from both 
the port and starboard sides. The approach was accompanied by the firing of non-lethal 
weaponry onto the ship, including smoke and stun grenades, tear-gas and paintballs. Plastic 
bullets may also have been used at this stage: however, despite some claims that live 
ammunition was also fired from the zodiac boats, the Mission is not satisfied that this was 
the case. The smoke and tear gas were not effective due to the strong sea breeze and later 
due to the downdraft from helicopters.  
</p>
<p>113. The Israeli forces attempted to board the ship through attaching ladders to the hull. 
Passengers engaged in efforts to repel the attempted boarding using the ship&#8217;s water hoses68 
and the throwing of various items at the boats including chairs, sticks, a box of plates and 
other objects that were readily to hand. This initial attempt to board the ship proved 
unsuccessful. It is the view of the Mission that the Israeli forces should have re-evaluated 
their plans when it became obvious that putting their soldiers on board the ship may lead to 
civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p> (ii) Landing of soldiers from helicopters onto the Mavi Marmara 
</p>
<p>114. Just minutes after soldiers from the zodiac boats had made initial unsuccessful 
attempts to board, the first helicopter approached the ship at approximately 0430 hours, 
hovering above the top deck. At this point between 10 and 20 passengers were located in 
the central area of the top deck, although this number increased as other passengers learned 
of events on the top deck. The Israeli forces used smoke and stun grenades in an attempt to 
clear an area for the landing of soldiers. The first rope that was let down from the helicopter 
was taken by passengers and tied it to a part of the top deck and thereby rendered 
ineffective for the purpose of soldiers&#8217; descent. A second rope was then let down from the 
</p>
<p>  
 67 For the purposes of this report, the following terms are used to describe the various decks of the <i>Mavi 
</i></p>
<p><i>Marmara</i>: top deck &#8211; the roof of the ship where the satellite tower and funnel are located, bridge deck 
&#8211; the deck below the top deck which gives access to the bridge, bow deck &#8211; lowest open deck with 
access to the front of the ship. live television broadcasts were made from an open deck area at the 
back of the bridge deck. 
</p>
<p> 68 It is worth noting that in accordance with the International Maritime Organization&#8217;s  circular 
&#8220;Guidance to ship owners and ship operators, shipmasters and crews on preventing and suppressing 
acts of piracy and armed robbery against ships&#8221; of June 2009, the use of water hoses is recommended 
as a means to prevent an attempted boarding by pirates and armed robbers. IMO Circular 
Msc.1/Circ.1334, date 23 June 2009, Annex, para. 57 states as follows:  &#8220;The use of water hoses 
should also be considered though they may be difficult to train if evasive manoeuvring is also taking 
place. Water pressures of 80 lb per square inch and above have deterred and repulsed attackers. Not 
only does the attacker have to fight against the jet of water but the flow may swamp his/her boat and 
damage engines and electrical systems. Special fittings for training hoses could be considered which 
would also provide protection for the hose operator. A number of spare fire hoses could be rigged and 
tied down to be pressurized at short notice if a potential attack is detected&#8221;. </p>


<p>helicopter and the first group of soldiers descended. The Mission does not find it plausible 
that soldiers were holding their weapons and firing as they descended on the rope. 
However, it has concluded that live ammunition was used from the helicopter onto the top 
deck prior to the descent of the soldiers. 
</p>
<p>115. With the available evidence it is difficult to delineate the exact course of events on 
the top deck between the time of the first soldier descending and the Israeli forces securing 
control of the deck. A fight ensued between passengers and the first soldiers to descend 
onto the top deck that resulted in at least two soldiers being pushed down onto the bridge 
deck below, where they were involved in struggles with groups of passengers who 
attempted to take their weapons. The equipment jacket of at least one soldier was removed 
as he was pushed over the side of the deck. A number of weapons were taken from the 
soldiers by passengers and thrown into the sea: one weapon, a 9-mm pistol, was unloaded 
by a passenger, a former U.S. Marine, in front of witnesses and then hidden in another part 
of the ship in an attempt to retain evidence. 
</p>
<p>116. A number of the passengers on the top deck fought with the soldiers using their fists, 
sticks, metal rods and knives.69 At least one of the soldiers was stabbed with a knife or other 
sharp object. Witnesses informed the Mission that their objective was to subdue and disarm 
the soldiers so that they could not harm anyone. The Mission is satisfied on the evidence 
that at least two passengers on the bridge deck also used handheld catapults to propel small 
projectiles at the helicopters. The Mission has found no evidence to suggest that any of the 
passengers used firearms or that any firearms were taken on board the ship. Despite 
requests, the Mission has not received any medical records or other substantiated 
information from the Israeli authorities regarding any firearm injuries sustained by soldiers 
participating in the raid. Doctors examined the three soldiers taken below decks and no 
firearm injuries were noted. Further, the Mission finds that the Israeli accounts so 
inconsistent and contradictory with regard to evidence of alleged firearms injuries to Israeli 
soldiers that it has to reject it.70 
</p>
<p> (iii) Deaths of 9 passengers and wounding of at least 50 other passengers 
</p>
<p>117. During the operation to secure control of the top deck, the Israeli forces landed 
soldiers from three helicopters over a 15-minute period.71 The Israeli forces used paintballs, 
plastic bullets and live ammunition, fired by soldiers from the helicopter above and soldiers 
who had landed on the top deck. The use of live ammunition during this period resulted in 
fatal injuries to four passengers,72 and injuries to at least 19 others, 14 with gunshot 
wounds. Escape points to the bridge deck from the top deck were narrow and restricted and 
as such it was very difficult for passengers in this area to avoid being hit by live rounds. At 
</p>
<p>  
 69 The Mission has found no evidence of knives being taken on board by passengers except for one 
</p>
<p>traditional ceremonial knife. However, the <i>Mavi Marmara</i> had six kitchens, each of which was 
stocked with usual culinary knives. 
</p>
<p> 70 In his testimony to the Turkel Committee, held in Israel on 11 August 2010, Chief of General Staff 
Ashkenazi refers to one soldier being &#8220;shot in his abdomen by one of the activists&#8221; and that &#8220;in the 
course of the battle, five soldiers [were] wounded by stabbings, blows and shooting&#8221;. However, at the 
urgent debate of the Human Rights Council held during its fourteenth session, on 1 June 2010, the 
Permanent Representative of Israel stated that passengers &#8220;shot two Israeli soldiers&#8221;. In contrast, in 
the State&#8217;s response at the habeas corpus hearing, held on 2 June 2010 (petition HCJ 4913/10 before 
the Supreme Court in Jerusalem, sitting as the High Court of Justice; unofficial translation), no 
specific reference was made to any Israeli soldiers being shot. 
</p>
<p> 71 In his testimony to the Turkel Committee on 11 August 2010, Chief of General Staff Ashkenazi stated 
that the first helicopter carried 15 soldiers, the second carried 12 soldiers and the third carried 14 
soldiers. 
</p>
<p> 72 Fahri Yaldiz, Furkan Do&#287;an, &#304;brahim Bilgen and Ali Haydar Bengi. </p>


<p>least one of those killed was using a video camera and not involved in any of the fighting 
with the soldiers. The majority of gunshot wounds received by passengers were to their 
upper torsos in the head, thorax, abdomen and back. Given the relatively small number of 
passengers on the top deck during the incident, the Mission is driven to the conclusion that 
the vast majority were in receipt of gunshot wounds.  
</p>
<p>118. Israeli soldiers continued shooting at passengers who had already been wounded, 
with live ammunition, soft baton charges (beanbags) and plastic bullets. Forensic analysis 
demonstrates that two of the passengers killed on the top deck received wounds compatible 
with being shot at close range while lying on the ground: Furkan Do&#287;an received a bullet in 
the face and &#304;brahim Bilgen received a fatal wound from a soft baton round (beanbag) fired 
at such close proximity to his head that parts such as wadding penetrated his skull and 
entered his brain. Furthermore, some of the wounded were subjected to further violence,  
including being hit with the butt of a weapon, being kicked in the head, chest and back and 
being verbally abused. A number of the wounded passengers were handcuffed and then left 
unattended for some time before being dragged to the front of the deck by their arms or 
legs. 
</p>
<p>119. Once the Israeli forces had secured control of the top deck they undertook measures 
to move down to the bridge deck below in order to take over the ship&#8217;s bridge and thus take 
control of the ship. In relation to this operation, a series of shooting incidents occurred 
centred on the portside doorway which gives access to the main stairwell on the bridge 
deck. This door is near to the hatch and ladder, which allows access from the top deck to 
the bridge deck. 
</p>
<p>120. Israeli soldiers fired live ammunition both from the top deck at passengers on the 
bridge deck below, and after they had moved down to the bridge deck. At least four 
passengers were killed,73 and at least nine injured (five with firearms injuries) during this 
phase. None of the four passengers who were killed, including a photographer who at the 
time of being shot was engaged in taking photographs and was shot by an Israeli soldier 
positioned on the top deck above, posed any threat to the Israeli forces. There was 
considerable live fire from Israeli soldiers on the top deck and a number of passengers were 
injured or killed whilst trying to take refuge inside the door or assisting other to do so. 
Wounded passengers were brought into the ship through the stairwell and through the 
ship&#8217;s bridge room and were helped downstairs where they could be given some form of 
medical treatment by doctors and others on board. 
</p>
<p>121. One witness described the circumstances in which one passenger was killed on the 
bridge deck: 
</p>
<p>I saw two soldiers on top of the roof standing there holding their guns down at 
something on the roof that I couldn&#8217;t see. There were two guys hidden underneath a 
walkway of the ship to the right hand side and I was screaming at them not to move. 
The two passengers were below the soldiers. They could not see the soldiers and the 
soldiers could not see them while they were hidden under the walkway. Then the 
guys moved out, making themselves visible as they tried to run towards the metal 
door. One man made it to open the door and got inside. The other man must have 
been shot. I think he was shot in the head from the way he looked, he wasn&#8217;t moving 
at all. He was 20 or 30 metres away from me. When the second man got shot, the 
first man opened the door and using it as a shield tried to reach out for the second 
man. He managed to reach him and was pulling him by his right arm. I couldn&#8217;t see 
any blood, but he wasn&#8217;t moving at all. 
</p>
<p>  
 73 Cevdet Kili&#231;lar, Cengiz Song&#252;r, Cengiz Aky&#252;z and &#199;etin Top&#231;uo&#287;lu. </p>


<p>122. A group of up to 20 passengers, some holding sticks and rods and wearing gas 
masks, were located on or around the stairwell inside the ship. One passenger standing just 
inside the door was shot through the broken porthole in the door by a soldier standing a few 
metres away on the bridge deck outside. 
</p>
<p>123. During the shootings on the bridge deck and as it became apparent that a large 
number of passengers had become injured, Bulent Yildirim, the President of IHH and one 
of principal organizers of the flotilla, removed his white shirt which was then used as a 
white flag to indicate a surrender. This does not appear to have had any effect and live 
firing continued on the ship. 
</p>
<p>124. Israeli forces moved down to the bridge deck and moved rapidly to take over the 
bridge room towards the front of the ship. The doorway and windows of the bridge room 
came under fire and the captain ordered that the ship&#8217;s engines be cut. Israeli soldiers 
entered the bridge room through the door and broken window. The crew were made to lie 
on the ground at gunpoint. The captain remained standing but was held at gunpoint. 
</p>
<p> (iv) Shootings at the bow deck, the release of the Israeli soldiers and end of the operation 
</p>
<p>125. During the initial fighting on the top deck three Israeli soldiers were taken under 
control and brought inside the ship. While some passengers wished to harm the soldiers, 
other passengers ensured that they were protected and able to receive rudimentary medical 
treatment from doctors on board. Two of the soldiers had received wounds to the abdomen. 
One of the soldiers had a superficial wound to the abdomen, caused by a sharp object, 
which penetrated to the subcutaneous tissue. None of the three soldiers had received 
gunshot injuries, according to doctors who examined them. All three soldiers were in a state 
of shock and were suffering from cuts, bruises and blunt force trauma. 
</p>
<p>126. As the seriousness of incidents on the outer decks became apparent, there was 
growing concern among some of the flotilla organisers that holding the captured Israeli 
soldiers may have serious implications for the security of all passengers on board.74 It was 
decided that the soldiers should be released and they were taken to the bow of the lower 
deck. Once on the bow deck two of the soldiers jumped into the sea and were picked up by 
Israeli boats. The third soldier did not jump and was rapidly joined by Israeli soldiers who 
came down from the top deck.  
</p>
<p>127. At least four passengers were injured on the bow of the ship, both before and around 
the time that the Israeli soldiers were released. At least two passengers received wounds 
from live ammunition, while others received injuries from soft baton charges, including one 
doctor who was tending to injured passengers.  
</p>
<p>128. The Israeli forces stated that the active phase of the Israeli forces operation 
concluded at 0517 hours,75 once the ship was under their control and the three soldiers were 
released. During the 45-50 minute operation, nine passengers were killed, more than 24 
passengers had received serious injuries caused by live ammunition and a large number of 
other passengers had received injuries caused by plastic rounds, soft baton charges (bean-
bags) and other means. 
</p>
<p>  
 74 It also appears that the Israeli forces were planning to enter the ship&#8217;s cabins in order to locate the 
</p>
<p>three soldiers: In his testimony to the Turkel Committee on 11 August 2010, COGS Ashkenazi stated 
that at the time when the Israeli forces spotted the three soldiers on the bow deck: &#8220;The force 
commander [was preparing] to rush the passengers&#8217; area in order to locate the missing soldiers.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 75 As stated by COGS Ashkenazi in his testimony to the Turkel Committee on 11 August 2010. </p>


<p><b>Table - Deaths of flotilla participants  
</b></p>
<p><i>Deaths occurring on the top deck (roof) 
</i></p>
<p><i>Furkan Do</i>&#287;<i>an 
</i></p>
<p>Furkan Do&#287;an, a 19-year-old with dual Turkish and United States citizenship, was on the 
central area of the top deck filming with a small video camera when he was first hit with 
live fire. It appears that he was lying on the deck in a conscious, or semi-conscious, state 
for some time. In total Furkan received five bullet wounds, to the face, head, back thorax, 
left leg and foot. All of the entry wounds were on the back of his body, except for the face 
wound which entered to the right of his nose. According to forensic analysis, tattooing 
around the wound in his face indicates that the shot was delivered at point blank range. 
Furthermore, the trajectory of the wound, from bottom to top, together with a vital abrasion 
to the left shoulder that could be consistent with the bullet exit point, is compatible with the 
shot being received while he was lying on the ground on his back. The other wounds were 
not the result of firing in contact, near contact or close range, but it is not otherwise possible 
to determine the exact firing range. The wounds to the leg and foot were most likely 
received in a standing position. 
</p>
<p>&#304;<i>brahim Bilgen 
</i></p>
<p>&#304;brahim Bilgen, a 60-year-old Turkish citizen, from Siirt in Turkey, was on the top deck 
and was one of the first passengers to be shot. He received a bullet wound to the chest, the 
trajectory of which was from above and not at close range. He had a further two bullet 
wounds to the right side of the back and right buttock, both back to front. These wounds 
would not have caused instant death, but he would have bled to death within a short time 
without medical attention. Forensic evidence shows that he was shot in the side of the head 
with a soft baton round at such close proximity and that an entire bean bag and its wadding 
penetrated the skull and lodged in the brain. He had a further bruise on the right flank 
consistent with another beanbag wound. The wounds are consistent with the deceased 
initially being shot from soldiers on board the helicopter above and receiving a further 
wound to the head while lying on the ground, already wounded. 
</p>
<p><i>Fahri Yaldiz</i> 
</p>
<p>Fahri Yaldiz, a 42-year-old Turkish citizen from Adiyaman, received five bullet wounds, 
one to the chest, one to the left leg and three to the right leg. The chest wound was caused 
by a bullet that entered near the left nipple and hit the heart and lungs before exiting from 
the shoulder. This injury would have caused rapid death. 
</p>
<p><i>Ali Heyder Bengi 
</i></p>
<p>According to the pathology report, Ali Heyder Bengi, a 38-year-old Turkish citizen from 
Diyarbakir, received six bullet wounds (one in the chest, one in the abdomen, one in the 
right arm, one in the right thigh and two in the left hand). One bullet lodged in the chest 
area. None of the wounds would have been instantly fatal, but damage to the liver caused 
bleeding which would have been fatal if not stemmed. There are several witness accounts 
which suggest that Israeli soldiers shot the deceased in the back and chest at close range 
while he was lying on the deck as a consequence of initial bullet wounds. 
</p>
<p><i>Deaths occurring on the bridge deck, portside</i> 
</p>
<p><i>Cevdet Kili&#231;lar</i> 
</p>
<p>Cevdet Kili&#231;lar, a 38-year-old Turkish citizen from Istanbul, was on the <i>Mavi Marmara</i>, in 
his capacity as a photographer employed by IHH. At the moment he was shot he was 
standing on the bridge deck on the port side of the ship near to the door leading to the main 
stairwell and was attempting to photograph Israeli soldiers on the top deck. According to </p>


<p>the pathology reports, he received a single bullet to his forehead between the eyes. The 
bullet followed a horizontal trajectory which crossed the middle of the brain from front to 
back. He would have died instantly. 
</p>
<p><i>Cengiz Aky&#252;z and Cengiz Song&#252;r</i> 
</p>
<p>Cengiz Aky&#252;z, 41, from Hatay and Cengiz Song&#252;r, 46,  from Izmir, both Turkish citizens, 
were injured on the bridge deck in close succession by live fire from above. They had been 
sheltering and were shot as they attempted to move inside the door leading to the stairwell. 
Cengiz Aky&#252;z received a shot to the head and it is probable that he died instantly. 
</p>
<p>The pathology report shows four wounds: to the neck, face, chest and thigh. Cengiz Song&#252;r 
received a single bullet to the upper central thorax below the neck, shot from a high angle, 
which lodged in the right thoracic cavity injuring the heart and aorta. Unsuccessful efforts 
were made by doctors inside the ship to resuscitate him through heart massage. 
</p>
<p><i>&#199;etin Top&#231;uo</i>&#287;<i>lu 
</i></p>
<p>&#199;etin Top&#231;uo&#287;lu, a 54-year-old Turkish citizen from Adana had been involved in helping to 
bring injured passengers inside the ship to be treated. He was also shot close to the door on 
the bridge deck. He did not die instantly and his wife, who was also on board the ship, was 
with him when he died. He was shot by three bullets. One bullet entered from the top the 
soft tissues of the right side of the back of the head, exited from the neck and then re-
entered into the thorax. Another bullet entered the left buttock and lodged in the right 
pelvis. The third entered the right groin and exited from the lower back. There are 
indications that the victim may have been in a crouching or bending position when this 
wound was sustained. 
</p>
<p><i>Deaths and seriously wounded occurring in unknown locations</i> 
</p>
<p><i>Necdet Yildirim</i> 
</p>
<p>The location and circumstances of the shooting and death of Necdet Yildirim, a 31-year-old 
Turkish citizen from Istanbul, remain unclear. He was shot twice in the thorax, once from 
the front and once from the back. The trajectory of both bullets was from top to bottom. He 
also received bruises consistent with plastic bullet impact 
</p>
<p><i>Wounding of U</i>&#287;<i>ur Suleyman S&#246;ylemez (in a coma)</i> 
</p>
<p>The serious nature of wounds to U&#287;ur Suleyman S&#246;ylemez, a 46-year-old Turkish citizen 
from Ankara, which include at least one bullet wound to the head, have left the victim in a 
coma in an Ankara hospital. He remains in a critical condition with a serious head injury. 
</p>
<p> (v) Treatment of injured on the Mavi Marmara 
</p>
<p>129. Whilst the Israeli operation was still under way, efforts were made to tend to 
wounded passengers inside the ship by other passengers, amongst whom were around 15 
doctors, nurses and others with medical training, including an ophthalmologist and 
orthopaedic specialist. Prior to the attack, the doctors had met and agreed to use the ship&#8217;s 
small medical room, but there was no anticipated or preparation for the nature of injuries 
that transpired. The limited medicines and lack of appropriate equipment made it very 
difficult to properly treat wounded persons, particularly those who had received live fire 
injuries and required immediate surgery. By the end of the Israeli operation more than thirty 
persons were being treated inside the cabins, primarily in the lower deck in makeshift 
surgery areas, twenty of whom were in a critical condition. 
</p>
<p>130. The flotilla organizers and other passengers engaged in efforts to request the Israeli 
forces to provide the necessary treatment to the wounded persons. One organiser used the 
ship&#8217;s intercom to request assistance in Hebrew and persons also communicated directly </p>


<p>through the cabin windows or by placing signs, written in English and Hebrew, in the 
ship&#8217;s windows. These attempts proved unsuccessful and it was up to two hours before the 
Israeli forces took out the wounded persons. However, the wounded were required to leave 
the cabins themselves, or taken outside in a rough manner, without apparent concern for the 
nature of their injuries and the discomfort that this would cause.  
</p>
<p>131. The wounded passengers were taken to the front of the top deck where they joined 
other passengers injured during the operation on the top deck and where the bodies of 
persons killed during the operation had been left. Wounded passengers, including persons 
seriously injured with live fire wounds, were handcuffed with plastic cord handcuffs, which 
were often tied very tightly causing some of the injured to lose sensitivity in their hands. 
These plastic handcuffs cannot be loosened without being cut off, but can be tightened. 
Many were also stripped naked and then had to wait some time, possibly as long as two-
three hours, before receiving medical treatment. Medical treatment was given to a number 
of wounded persons on the top deck by the Israeli forces.76 
</p>
<p>132. Over several hours the wounded passengers were then airlifted by Israeli forces 
helicopters from the ship to hospitals in Israel.77 However, some of the wounded remained 
on board the <i>Mavi Marmara</i>, at least one of whom had injuries caused by live ammunition 
and did not receive appropriate medical treatment until after the ship&#8217;s arrival at the port of 
Ashdod in Israel many hours later. 
</p>
<p> (vi) Search and initial detention of Mavi Marmara passengers 
</p>
<p>133. All other passengers on the <i>Mavi Marmara </i>were taken one by one from the cabin 
areas and onto the external deck areas and were searched. The vast majority of passengers, 
including the ship&#8217;s captain and crew, were then handcuffed with plastic handcuffs and 
forced to kneel on the various decks for some hours. Some women, elderly men and 
persons from Western countries were not handcuffed, or were temporarily handcuffed and 
then uncuffed after a relatively short period of time and were then permitted to sit on the 
benches. Most of those kneeling were drenched by water from the blades of the helicopter 
and were thus also in wet clothing throughout this period and were very cold. Other 
passengers exposed on open decks received serious sun-burn to their skin as a result of 
many hours exposure: medical reports show that at least 13 passengers received first-degree 
burns as a consequence. During the course of the 12-hour journey to the port of Ashdod in 
Israel, the passengers were brought inside the ship and allowed to sit on the available 
seating.  
</p>
<p>134. In the process of being detained, or while kneeling on the outer decks for several 
hours, there was physical abuse of passengers by the Israeli forces, including kicking and 
punching and being hit with the butts of rifles. One foreign correspondent, on board in his 
professional capacity, was thrown on the ground and kicked and beaten before being 
handcuffed. The passengers were not allowed to speak or to move and there were frequent 
instances of verbal abuse, including derogatory sexual remarks about the female 
passengers. Passengers were denied access to toilet facilities or made to wait for lengthy 
periods before being escorted to the toilet and then forced to use the toilet with Israeli 
soldiers watching and while handcuffed. Some passengers were in serious discomfort as a 
result, while others used makeshift receptacles, such as plastic bottles and others still were 
</p>
<p>  
 76 According to the testimony of COGS Ashkenazi to the Turkel Committee on 11 August 2010, field 
</p>
<p>surgeries were performed on14  passengers on board the ship. 
 77 Also according to the above testimony, 31 wounded passengers and 7 wounded Israeli soldiers were 
</p>
<p>airlifted from the ship utilizing &#8220;approximately 40 helicopter evacuations&#8221; and all wounded had been 
evacuated by 1230 hours. </p>


<p>forced to urinate on themselves. The Israeli forces also employed dogs and some 
passengers received dog-bite wounds. Some witnesses who suffer from chronic medical 
conditions, such as diabetes or heart conditions, were not provided access to their required 
medicines, which were taken by Israeli soldiers.  
</p>
<p>135. The manner in which plastic handcuffs were attached to the wrists of passengers 
caused severe pain and discomfort. There was widespread misuse of the handcuffs by the 
Israeli soldiers who tightened the plastic handcuffs to an extent that caused pain, swelling, a 
loss of blood circulation in the hands and the loss of sensitivity in their hands and fingers. 
Most passengers who requested that the handcuffs be loosened were ignored or it resulted 
in the handcuffs being further tightened. A number of passengers are still experiencing 
medical problems related to the handcuffing three months later and forensic reports confirm 
that at least 54 passengers had received injuries, transversal abrasions and bruises, as a 
result of handcuffing on board the<i> Mavi Mamara</i>.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Events aboard the Challenger 1 
</i></p>
<p>136. Passengers and crew on the <i>Challenger 1</i>, the smallest and fastest vessel in the 
flotilla, were able to witness the first moments of the assault on the<i> Mavi Marmara</i>. Once it 
became apparent that the Israelis intended to commandeer the ships, the decision was made 
for the <i>Challenger 1</i> to accelerate out of the formation of the flotilla to allow more time for 
the journalists aboard to transmit news of the assault to the outside world via the boat&#8217;s 
satellite Internet connection, which remained in operation, but also in the hope that at least 
one boat might still be able to reach Gaza. The boat was chased by one of the Israeli 
corvette boats which it was unable to outrun. Eventually the starboard engine lost oil 
pressure and the captain, concerned the Israelis might ram the boat, shut down the engines. 
</p>
<p>137. The boat was intercepted by two Israeli boats and a helicopter. Passengers on the 
board said that at least one stun grenade was launched at the boat by the Israelis before they 
attempted to board. Passengers on the decks had decided in advance to employ passive 
resistance techniques to resist symbolically the Israeli soldiers boarding the boat. The 
passengers stood unarmed side-by-side blocking the path of the soldiers. Soldiers opened 
fire with paintballs and rubber bullets as they boarded, hitting and injuring one woman in 
the face with either a plastic bullet or a paintball. Another woman was bruised on her back 
by from rubber bullets. 
</p>
<p>138. Once on board, the soldiers moved to take control of the fly bridge. Passengers 
obstructing access were forcibly removed. On entering the fly bridge, the soldiers were met 
with no resistance, but a female journalist sustained burns on her arms from an electroshock 
weapon fired by an Israeli soldier. Witnesses said that the primary concern of the soldiers 
seemed to be the confiscation of photographic equipment and media. 
</p>
<p>139. The passive resistance offered by the passengers was met with force. One woman&#8217;s 
head was hit against the deck of the boat and then stepped on by an Israeli soldier. 
Passengers were handcuffed very tightly with plastic ties behind their backs, while the 
woman injured in the face was left unattended. 
</p>
<p>140. Several passengers said that it was clear that the Israeli soldiers knew who was on 
board as they referred to some passengers by name. A plasticized booklet recovered from a 
soldier on the <i>Mavi Marmara,</i> and filmed, identified specific passengers on several boats 
with names and photographs, including on the <i>Challenger 1</i>. 
</p>
<p>141. One crew member observed that the soldiers were very young, seemed frightened 
and that were initially poorly organized. Soldiers behaved aggressively from the outset 
towards the passengers. Passengers were handcuffed with plastic ties and denied access to 
the toilet. One elderly man was obliged to urinate in his clothes because he was refused 
access to the toilet. There was an attempt to forcibly eject one woman from the boat into </p>


<p>one of the zodiacs. Two women had hemp bags placed over their heads for an extended 
period. The woman injured in the face in the initial stage of boarding was left unattended 
for an extended period, even though there was an army medic on board. The physical 
violence was described as &#8220;unwarranted and excessive&#8221;. No distinction was made between 
activists and journalists, despite the presence of several respected international journalists 
on board. 
</p>
<p>142. The boat arrived in Ashdod at around 1100 hours on 31 May. Several passengers 
joined arms to resist disembarkation, protesting that they had been brought to Israel against 
their will from international waters. Two female passengers were handcuffed and forcibly 
removed while a male passenger was threatened with an electroshock weapon at point 
blank range. Passengers were led off the boat one-by-one accompanied by two Israeli 
officers.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Events aboard the Sfendoni 
</i></p>
<p>143. The operation to board the <i>Sfendoni</i> took place simultaneously with the assault on 
the <i>Mavi Marmara</i>. Soldiers were able to climb directly on board in a straightforward 
manner from zodiac boats without the need to use grappling irons or other equipment. Prior 
to boarding a number of stun grenades, plastic bullets and paint balls were fired at the boat 
from soldiers on the zodiacs: at least two passengers were hit, one on the back of the head. 
According to a medical doctor on board, one of stun grenades landed in the confined space 
of the bridge, injuring a number of people and causing damage to the hearing of one man. 
</p>
<p>144. Once aboard, the soldiers proceeded to the bridge of the ship. The passengers had 
planned to sit down on the decks of the boat to show passive resistance, but in the event the 
plan was only partially implemented. Many of the passengers, including the elderly, stayed 
below decks in the main lounge. On deck, passengers linked arms around the bridge. The 
Israelis then proceeded to fire electroshock weapons at the protesting passengers to clear 
access; a medical doctor, who was himself hurt in this way, later treated numerous 
electrical burn injuries to passengers. When two Israeli soldiers entered the bridge, one of 
the crew grabbed the wheel tightly, protesting that the boat was in international waters. A 
soldier hit him with the butt of his gun and in the ensuing scuffle the captain was kicked in 
the back, punched several times in the face and received electric shock burns from an 
electroshock weapon. 
</p>
<p>145. At one point after the boat was taken under control, one passenger was roughly 
treated and restrained at the hands and feet with plastic ties. He screamed in protest and 
because the ties were too tight. At the insistence of a medical doctor, the handcuffs were 
removed. The man then ran and jumped into the sea. The passenger was later picked up by 
another boat. 
</p>
<p>146. The Israeli forces took control of the boat and the passengers were made to sit down. 
Some passengers were restrained with plastic ties for an initial period, but most were not. 
The soldiers attempted to stop a medical doctor from treating the passengers&#8217; injuries, 
saying that the army medical officer on board would treat them. But since he was masked 
and armed like the other soldiers, no passengers would consent to be treated by him. The 
doctor said that they would have to shoot him to prevent him doing his job.  
</p>
<p>147. Passengers were searched one by one and taken to the main salon. Passengers said 
that access to water and to the toilet was only possibly with difficulty after repeated 
requests and not all passengers were granted access. Passengers were allowed to prepare 
food which they refused to eat until an army cameraman ceased filming them for 
propaganda reasons. Witnesses said that the soldiers were always aggressive and shouting 
and pointing their guns, but otherwise no one was ill-treated or restrained. </p>


<p><i> (e) Events aboard the Eleftheri Mesogios 
</i></p>
<p>148. Israeli forces boarded the <i>Eleftheri Mesogios </i>after 0430 hours, concurrently with the 
assault on the <i>Mavi Marmara</i> and <i>Sfendoni</i>. Soldiers boarded from three zodiac boats, using 
grappling irons and rope ladders to climb the sides of the ship. Although barbed wire had 
been placed around the ship, the soldiers were able to board relatively quickly. 
</p>
<p>149. The passengers did not engage in any pro-active resistance to the take-over of the 
ship but used passive resistance methods, blocking access to the bridge with their bodies. 
The Israeli forces used physical force, electroshock weapons, plastic bullets and paint balls 
to clear the area. A number of passengers were injured, including one passenger whose leg 
was fractured. 
</p>
<p>150. All the passengers and crew were handcuffed. Israeli soldiers confiscated their 
passports and subjected them to body searches. Those who refused to cooperate were 
roughly treated. According to a number of witnesses, some people who refused to surrender 
their passports were assaulted, including one woman who was punched in the stomach and 
one man who was wrestled to the ground by two soldiers, kicked and beaten. One passenger 
said that the hand ties were too tight and when he asked for them to be loosened they were 
instead tightened further.  
</p>
<p>151. Witnesses stated that the passengers were almost continuously filmed on video 
cameras by the Israeli forces. One passenger said that he felt this was being done 
deliberately to humiliate the passengers and that this contributed directly to an elderly 
passenger experiencing an anxiety attack. 
</p>
<p><i> (f) Events aboard the M.V. Gazze 1 and M.V. Defne Y 
</i></p>
<p>152. Israeli forces boarded the <i>M.V. Gazze 1 </i>from zodiac boats sometime after 0530 
hours. The crew and passengers on board offered no resistance and the Israeli forces took 
control of the ship without incident. Passengers were ordered onto the deck while the ship 
was searched with dogs and then later taken to the dining hall where they were body-
searched. During the eight-hour journey to Ashdod they were not handcuffed and were 
provided with food.  
</p>
<p>153. Israeli forces boarded the <i>M.V. Defne Y</i> by fast rope from helicopters at 
approximately 0530 hours. The crew and passengers on board offered no resistance and the 
Israeli forces took control of the ship without incident. They were then kept within the 
cabins until they arrived in the port of Ashdod. No crew members or passengers were 
handcuffed and the Israeli soldiers brought food from the kitchens for them to eat. One 
passenger, a cameraman working for the IHH organization, said that he was interrogated for 
a five-hour period and physically assaulted, in relation to a video tape that he had hidden. 
</p>
<p><i> (g) Events aboard the M.V. Rachel Corrie on 5 June 2010 
</i></p>
<p>154. The <i>Rachel Corrie</i> was delayed in departing Ireland and stopped in Malta for 
passengers to embark. The ship therefore was unable to join the rest of the flotilla at the 
meeting point south of Cyprus. Nevertheless, it was intercepted by the Israeli forces and the 
people on board went through similar experiences to those on the other ships. There was a 
total of 9 crew and 11 passengers on board including a number of high-profile public 
figures. 
</p>
<p>155. The passengers aboard the <i>Rachel Corrie</i>, having learned by satellite phone of the 
interception of the flotilla, unanimously decided to proceed to Gaza as planned, as a mark 
of respect for those who had died. The crew were consulted and also agreed to continue. A 
press release was issued confirming the decision to continue. </p>


<p>156. On 3 June, the Government of Ireland engaged in negotiations with the Government 
of Israel to guarantee that the cargo of aid aboard the<i> Rachel Corrie</i> could be delivered to 
Gaza if the ship diverted to the port of Ashdod. The passengers on the ship did not 
participate in these negotiations and decided to reject the offer since their objective was not 
only to deliver the aid but also to break what they considered the illegal siege of Gaza. 
</p>
<p>157. The ship continued its journey towards Gaza. The interception of the vessel followed 
the precedent of the earlier interceptions, but without violence, on 5 June. A number of 
Israeli naval vessels came into view and radio contact commenced at about 0630 hours. The 
captain was informed that Gaza was a closed military zone and that the ship should not 
proceed. The <i>Rachel Corrie</i> responded that it was a civilian ship delivering humanitarian 
aid and that their cargo, which had been checked and sealed by the authorities in Ireland, 
did not constitute a threat to Israel.  
</p>
<p>158. The passengers on the ship noted with irritation that the Israelis continually referred 
to the ship by its former name, the <i>M. V. Linda</i>. The ship had been renamed shortly before 
leaving Ireland to commemorate an American woman, Rachel Corrie, who had been killed 
by an Israeli bulldozer in the Gaza Strip in 2003. 
</p>
<p>159. When the Israelis warned of their intention to board the vessel, the passengers 
rejected Israel&#8217;s right to board since they were in international waters and did not constitute 
a threat but stated that there would be no violent resistance to a boarding. The ship&#8217;s 
communication capability was jammed. The engines were cut by the captain and, at around 
1100 hours, zodiacs approached the ship and soldiers boarded in accordance with an agreed 
procedure. The passengers and crew were gather amidships and sit with their hands 
outstretched, while one man controlled the boat in the wheel house. Around 35 armed 
soldiers, including three women, boarded in full riot gear. The boarding proceeded 
peacefully. According to one witness, the ship was 35 nautical miles from Gaza at this 
point. 
</p>
<p>160. The lead passenger, who had control of the ship just prior to the boarding, was 
handcuffed and made to kneel at the back of the ship for approximately 45 minutes after 
which he was placed with the crew. His wife was not allowed to see him during most of the 
journey to Ashdod. The other passengers had their passports checked, were searched and 
then made to sit in the sun for several hours while the ship was searched. The ship was then 
taken to Ashdod without incident. 
</p>
<p>161. The Israeli Chief of General Staff, testifying before the Turkel Committee, cited the 
<i>Rachel Corrie</i> as an example of a humanitarian ship which had accepted to be diverted to 
Ashdod in order that the aid could be delivered to the Gaza Strip by land. This contradicts 
the assertion by passengers of the ship that they were boarded after protest and were taken 
to Ashdod against their will. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Legal analysis of the use of force in intercepting the Gaza flotilla 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Excessive use of force and the right to life and to physical integrity 
</i></p>
<p>162. Article 6, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
states: 
</p>
<p>Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by 
law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life. 
</p>
<p>This right is non-derogable. 
</p>
<p>163. Insofar as the Israeli interception of the flotilla was unlawful&#8212;and the Mission 
considers that it was unlawful&#8212;the use of force by the Israeli forces in seizing control of 
the <i>Mavi Marmara</i> and other vessels was also <i>prima facie</i> unlawful since there was no legal </p>


<p>basis for the Israeli forces to conduct an assault and interception in international waters. 
Moreover, in undertaking these operations and regardless of the legality of the operation, 
the Israeli forces were obliged to do so in accordance with the law, including Israel&#8217;s 
international human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>164. The Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials prescribes in article 2 that &#8220;in 
the performance of their duty, law enforcement officials shall respect and protect human 
dignity and maintain and uphold the human rights of all persons&#8221;; and article 3 adds that 
&#8220;law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent 
required for the performance of their duty&#8221;. This article clearly determines that the use of 
firearms is considered as an extreme measure and that, whenever the lawful use of force 
and firearms is unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall minimize damage and injury 
and respect and preserve human life.  
</p>
<p>165. In boarding the<i> Mavi Marmara</i>, both from the sea and from the air, the Israeli forces 
met a level of resistance from some of the passengers on board that was significant and, it 
appears, unexpected. However, there is no available evidence to support the claim that any 
of the passengers had or used firearms at any stage. In the initial phases of fighting with the 
Israeli soldiers on the top deck, three Israeli soldiers were disarmed and taken inside the 
ship. At this point, there may have been a justifiable belief of an immediate threat to life or 
serious injury of certain soldiers which would have justified the use of firearms against 
specific passengers.78 
</p>
<p>166. Principle 9 of the Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms by Law Enforcement 
Officials stipulates that &#8220;law enforcement officials shall not use firearms against persons 
except in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious 
injury, to prevent the perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to 
life [&#8230;] and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives. In 
any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in 
order to protect life&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>167. Nevertheless, throughout the operation to seize control of the <i>Mavi Marmara,</i> 
including before the live fire restriction was eased, lethal force was employed by the Israeli 
soldiers in a widespread and arbitrary manner which caused an unnecessarily large number 
of persons to be killed or seriously injured. Less extreme means could have been employed 
in nearly all instances of the Israeli operation, since there was no imminent threat to 
soldiers; for example in relation to the operation to move down to the bridge deck and seize 
control of the ship and the firing of live ammunition at passengers on the bow deck of the 
ship. Even in a situation where three individual soldiers have been injured and detained, the 
objective of freeing these soldiers does not legitimate the use of force outside applicable 
international standards and soldiers must continue to respect and preserve life and to 
minimize injury and damage. 
</p>
<p>168. In such circumstances the use of less extreme means, such as available less-lethal 
weaponry, would have been sufficient to achieve the required objective as required by 
Principle 4 of the Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.79 
</p>
<p>  
 78 The Israeli Defense Chief of Staff is quoted as saying that the rules of engagement of the soldiers 
</p>
<p>made clear that live fire was initially only to be used in life-threatening situations and that this 
restriction was only later eased in order to target protesters deemed to be violent in response to 
unexpected level of violent resistance and the unknown whereabouts of some soldiers. IDF Chief of 
General Staff, Gabi Ashkenazi&#8217;s testimony to the Turkel Committee (Public Commission to Examine 
the Maritime Incident of May 31, 2010, Session Number 4, 11 August 2010). 
</p>
<p> 79 Law enforcement officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent 
means before resorting to the use of force and firearms. They may use force and firearms only if other 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>A well-trained force such as the Israeli Defense Force should have been able to successfully 
contain a relatively small group of passengers armed with sticks and knives and secure 
control of the ship without the loss of life or serious injury to either passengers or soldiers. 
</p>
<p>169. A large number of injured passengers received wounds to critical areas of the body 
containing vital organs &#8211; the abdomen, thorax and head. Furthermore, a number of 
passengers who were clearly not engaged in any activities to resist the boarding by the 
Israeli forces, including a number of journalists and persons who had been sheltering from 
the fire, received injuries, including fatal injuries. It is apparent that no effort was made to 
minimize injuries at certain stages of the operation and that the use of live fire was done in 
an extensive and arbitrary manner. It is difficult not to conclude that, once the order to use 
live fire had been given, no one was safe. Under the circumstances, it seems a matter of 
pure chance that there were not more fatalities as a result. Principle 5 of the Basic 
Principles on the Use of Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials stipulates that &#8220;whenever 
the lawful use of force and firearms is unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall: (a) 
Exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the 
legitimate objective to be achieved; and (b) Minimize damage and injury and respect and 
preserve human life&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>170. The circumstances of the killing of at least six of the passengers were in a manner 
consistent with an extra-legal, arbitrary and summary execution. Furkan Do&#287;an and &#304;brahim 
Bilgen were shot at near range while the victims were lying injured on the top deck. Cevdet 
Kili&#231;lar, Cengiz Aky&#252;z, Cengiz Song&#252;r and &#199;etin Top&#231;uo&#287;lu were shot on the bridge deck 
while not participating in activities that represented a threat to any Israeli soldier. In these 
instances and possibly other killings on the<i> Mavi Marmara</i>, Israeli forces carried out extra-
legal, arbitrary and summary executions prohibited by international human rights law, 
specifically article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.80 
</p>
<p>171. It is apparent that a number of the passengers on the top deck were subjected to 
further mistreatment while lying injured. This included physical and verbal abuse some 
time after the operation to secure control of the deck had concluded. Furthermore, these 
passengers were not provided with medical treatment for two to three hours after the 
cessation of the operation. Similarly injured passengers who were inside the ship at the end 
of the operation of the Israeli forces were denied proper medical treatment for a similar 
length of time despite frequent efforts by other persons on board, including flotilla 
organizers, requesting such assistance to be provided. Other passengers suffering from 
chronic medical conditions were also denied access to their required essential medicines. 
The Israeli forces failed to meet the requirement to provide proper medical treatment to all 
those injured as rapidly as possible.81 Furthermore, the use of firearms should have been 
preceded by clear warnings of the intent to do so.82 While the circumstances of the initial 
stages on the top deck may not have been conducive to the issuance of such warnings, later 
</p>
<p>  
means remain ineffective or without any promise of achieving the intended result. 
</p>
<p> 80 See Principles 1 and 2 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, 
Arbitrary and Summary Executions. 
</p>
<p> 81 As set out in principle 4 (c) of the Basic Principles on the Use of firearms by Law Enforcement 
Officials states that law enforcement officials shall: &#8220;Ensure that assistance and medical aid are 
rendered to any injured or affected persons at the earliest possible moment&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 82 Principle 10 of the Basic Principles on the Use of firearms by Law Enforcement Officials stipulates 
that &#8220;law enforcement officials shall identify themselves as such and give a clear warning of their 
intent to use firearms, with sufficient time for the warning to be observed, unless to do so would 
unduly place the law enforcement officials at risk or would create a risk of death or serious harm to 
other persons, or would be clearly inappropriate or pointless in the circumstances of the incident.&#8221; </p>


<p>stages in the Israeli operation to secure control of the ship certainly were possible and 
necessary. 
</p>
<p>172. The Mission is satisfied that much of the force used by the Israeli soldiers on board 
the <i>Mavi Marmara</i> and from the helicopters was unnecessary, disproportionate, excessive 
and inappropriate and resulted in the wholly avoidable killing and maiming of a large 
number of civilian passengers. On the basis of the forensic and firearm evidence, at least six 
of the killings can be characterized as extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions. As 
such, the conduct of the Israeli forces amounted to violations of the right to life and of the 
right to physical integrity, as stipulated in articles 6 and 7 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>173. The Mission is also concerned with the nature of the force used by the Israeli forces 
in the interception of the three further vessels in the flotilla: <i>Challenger 1, Sfendoni</i> and the 
<i>Eleftheri Mesogios</i>. One each of the vessels some of the passengers merely used passive 
resistance techniques &#8211; placing their bodies in the paths of the Israeli soldiers &#8211; as a 
symbolic gesture in opposition to the respective boarding. However, in securing control of 
these vessels the Israeli forces used significant force, including stun grenades, electroshock 
weapons, soft-baton charges fired at close range, paintballs, plastic bullets and physical 
force. This resulted in a number of injuries to passengers including burns, bruises, 
hematomas and fractures. One passenger who was not participating in passive resistance 
activities, a photo-journalist, received burns from an electroshock weapon. The Mission has 
found that the force used by the Israeli soldiers in intercepting the <i>Challenger 1</i>, the 
<i>Sfendoni</i> and the<i> Eleftheri Mesogios</i> was unnecessary, disproportionate, excessive and 
inappropriate, and amounted to violations of the right to physical integrity, as stipulated in 
article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Right to liberty and security of person and treatment of detainees, including torture and 
other cruel inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment 
</i></p>
<p>174. Article 9, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
states:  
</p>
<p>Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to 
arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such 
grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law. 
</p>
<p>Since the Mission considers the Israeli interception of the flotilla was unlawful, the 
detention of passengers on board each of the vessels was also prima facie unlawful.  
</p>
<p>175. The deprivation of the liberty of the passengers further meets the criteria for being 
arbitrary in nature in accordance with the definitions adopted by the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention. Deprivation of liberty is considered category I arbitrary detention: 
&#8220;When it is clearly impossible to invoke any legal basis justifying the deprivation of 
liberty.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>176. The mass detention of more than 700 passengers and crew on board the six vessels 
had no basis in law, was arbitrary in nature and is a violation of article 9 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>177. Furthermore, no one on board the flotilla was informed of any reason for their 
detention. Article 9, paragraph 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
states:  
</p>
<p>Anyone who is arrested shall be informed, at the time of arrest, of the reasons for his 
arrest and shall be promptly informed of any charges against him. </p>


<p>While detained on board the vessels of the flotilla, a period which lasted up to 12 hours, all 
passengers should have been informed of why they were being subject to detention and the 
natures of the specific charges being brought against them. This was not done and in some 
instances passenger requests for such information were met with verbal abuse or physical 
violence. As such, the concerned Israeli forces violated article 9 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>178. During the period of detention on board the <i>Mavi Marmara</i> the passengers were 
subjected to treatment that was cruel and inhuman in nature and which did not respect the 
inherent dignity of persons who have been deprived of their liberty. This included a large 
number of persons being forced to kneel on the outer decks in harsh conditions for many 
hours, the physical mistreatment and verbal abuse inflicted on many of those detained, the 
widespread unnecessarily tight handcuffing and the denial of access to basic human needs 
such as the use of toilet facilities and provision of food. In addition there was a prevailing 
climate of fear of violence that had a dehumanizing effect on all those detained on board. 
On other vessels in the flotilla there were additional instances of persons being subjected to 
similar severe pain and suffering, including a person being seriously physically abused for 
refusing to provide his passport without a receipt. Principle 1 of the Body of Principles for 
the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment states: &#8220;All 
persons under any form of detention or imprisonment shall be treated in a humane manner 
and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person&#8221;. In addition, Principle 6 
states: &#8220;No person under any form of detention or imprisonment shall be subjected to 
torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. No circumstance 
whatever may be invoked as a justification for torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>179. The Mission is particularly concerned with the widespread use of tight handcuffing 
of passengers on board the <i>Mavi Marmara</i> in particular and to an extent of passengers on 
board the <i>Challenger 1, Sfendoni</i> and the <i>Eleftheri Mesogios</i>. Numerous passengers 
described the pain and suffering caused by being shackled by plastic handcuffs (also known 
as &#8220;&#8216;plasticuffs&#8221;) in an overly tight manner, frequently behind their backs, causing further 
suffering. Many were experiencing neurological damage up to three months after the events 
of the flotilla. As has been highlighted, the manner in which handcuffs were used on 
passengers on board the flotilla is consistent with the systematic use of handcuffs by the 
Israeli forces in a manner that causes pain and injury.83 The Mission is satisfied that the 
</p>
<p>  
 83 In June 2009 the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI) published a report on the use of 
</p>
<p>handcuffs by the Israeli Defence Forces entitled &#8220;Shackling as a form of torture and abuse&#8221;. PCATI 
finds that: &#8220;Soldiers routinely handcuff detainees in a painful and injurious manner from the moment 
of their arrest and through their transfer to the various interrogation facilities. The systematic nature 
of the practice suggests disregard for the suffering caused to detainees and perhaps even deliberate 
intent to cause pain. This treatment often breaks the detainee&#8217;s spirit and &#8220;softens&#8221; them up before 
they arrive for interrogation at the GSS facility. This is particularly true in the case of minors. The 
systemic use of the cuffing position as explained above may also reflect the collective punishment 
and intimidation of security detainees in general. Every month PCATI receives dozens of complaints 
describing this form of shackling. Over the past year alone, PCATI has documented 574 such cases. 
Though this figure is surely only the tip of the iceberg, it may indicate the scope of the phenomenon.&#8221; 
Furthermore, an expert medical opinion by neurological specialist Dr. Hannah-Bettina Steiner-
Birmanns is annexed to the report. Dr. Steiner-Birmanns states that: &#8220;Tight handcuffs &#8211; such as 
narrow and rigid plastic handcuffs tightened so that there is no space between the handcuffs and the 
detainee&#8217;s hands &#8211; press strongly against the wrists. The handcuffs may remain on the detainee&#8217;s 
hands for protracted periods. In such conditions the handcuffs can cause abrasions and damage to soft 
tissues, skin bruises and even bone fractures. The handcuffs also press against the nerves in the palms, 
leading to paralysis and a loss of sensation in the palms. These neurological damages can be transient 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>manner in which the handcuffs were used was clearly unnecessary and deliberately used to 
cause pain and suffering to passengers. 
</p>
<p>180. Torture is prohibited under the non-derogable article 7 of the ICCPR. Furthermore, 
article 1 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment states: 
</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Convention, the term &quot;torture&quot; means any act by which 
severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a 
person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a 
confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is 
suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or 
for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is 
inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public 
official or other person acting in an official capacity. 
</p>
<p>Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Convention emphasizes the absolute prohibition of torture: 
</p>
<p>No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, 
internal political in stability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a 
justification of torture. 
</p>
<p>Insofar as these abuses amounted to the deliberate punishment of the passengers, or were an 
attempt to intimidate or coerce one or more of the passengers for participation in the flotilla 
and/or activities to prevent the interception of the flotilla, the treatment tended towards 
torture. 
</p>
<p>181. The Mission thus determines that the treatment of passengers on board the <i>Mavi 
Marmara</i> and in certain instances on board the <i>Challenger 1, Sfendoni</i> and the <i>Eleftheri 
Mesogios</i>, by the Israeli forces amounted to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and, 
insofar as the treatment was additionally applied as a form of punishment, torture. This 
represents a violation of articles 7 and 10, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Possible violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention and customary international 
humanitarian law 
</i></p>
<p>182. In addition to the international human rights violations set out above, the Mission 
considers that the same factual circumstances provide prima facie evidence that protected 
persons suffered violations of international humanitarian law committed by Israeli forces 
during the interception, including wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment and wilfully 
causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health within the terms of article 147 of 
the Fourth Geneva Convention. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Detention of flotilla passengers in Israel and deportation 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Factual description and findings 
</b></p>
<p>183. The Mission found the facts set out below to have been established to its 
satisfaction. 
</p>
<p>  
but they can also be permanent. From the neurologist&#8217;s perspective tight handcuffs may cause 
transient or irreversible damage to the detainee and, accordingly, the use of loosened handcuffs 
should be considered&#8221;. </p>


<p><i> (a) Processing of the passengers at the port of Ashdod 
</i></p>
<p>184. All of the intercepted vessels in the flotilla were taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod 
where a processing centre had been set up in advance in marquees on the quayside to 
receive the passengers. The <i>Challenger 1</i>, the fastest vessel in the flotilla, arrived around 
1100 hours on 31 May. The last ship to arrive was the <i>Mavi Marmara</i> at around 1800 hours 
on the same day. As a result of the numbers of passengers to be processed, the 
disembarkation process was extremely lengthy. Some passengers from the <i>Mavi Marmara 
</i>said that they had to wait up to 12 hours inside the ship under armed guard after it had 
arrived at the port and some did not disembark until the next morning. 
</p>
<p>185. The vessels were greeted by crowds of soldiers and sometimes civilians, including 
school children, at the quayside, waving flags and cheering the return of the Israeli forces. 
Some passengers said that they were jeered or taunted by the people on the quay. There 
were also television camera crews and journalists recording the disembarkation of the 
passengers. Many passengers said that they found the experience of being &#8220;paraded&#8221; before 
the media and the sometimes hostile crowds unsettling and humiliating.  
</p>
<p>186. Injured passengers who had not been airlifted were diagnosed and sent to nearby 
hospitals for treatment. Some passengers with serious injuries were made to walk off the 
<i>Mavi Marmara</i> unaided. Due to the delay in disembarking and processing all passengers, 
some injured passengers had to wait for considerable periods before they were diagnosed 
and sent to hospital. Others were not diagnosed until they arrived at the prison later. 
</p>
<p>187. During processing, all passengers were presented with official papers to sign. 
Various translations of the papers were in circulation, in English, Turkish and Arabic, but 
most passengers said that they were given a version in Hebrew and that the contents were 
not explained to them. According to those able to understand the papers, they stated that the 
signatory admitted to having entered Israel illegally and consented to deportation and be 
banned from re-entering Israel for a 10-year period. Some passengers were told that signing 
the document would expedite early release from custody and repatriation whereas failure to 
sign would result in a lengthy detention period pending court proceedings. 
</p>
<p>188. Almost all passengers refused to sign the document on the basis that they had been 
brought to Israel from international waters against their will or because they did not want to 
sign a document that they did not understand. There were concerted efforts by some Israeli 
officers to coerce passengers into signing the forms. Some passengers did sign under duress 
having annotated the text to reflect the circumstances of their entry into Israel or stating that 
it was signed &#8220;under protest&#8221;. Some passengers were threatened with physical violence for 
refusing to sign; others were beaten or physically abused for refusing to sign or for advising 
others not to sign. Efforts to persuade passengers to sign the forms continued at the airport 
almost up to the moment of departure. 
</p>
<p>189. Passengers were subjected to a series of meticulous searches, including strip 
searches. Although female officers generally searched the women, some complained that 
they were searched in full or partial view of male officers. Some male passengers said that 
they were subjected to or threatened with internal cavity searches. A number of passengers 
described the process of being searched as being deliberately degrading and humiliating, 
accompanied by taunts, provocative and insulting language and physical abuse. During the 
course of their detention in Israel, many passengers were searched multiple times, long after 
such searches could serve a useful security purpose. 
</p>
<p>190. During processing, passengers were photographed either for official documentation 
or, in some cases, for &#8220;trophy pictures&#8221;. The processing of some passengers was also 
videotaped. Passengers had their fingerprints and in some cases DNA swabs, were taken. 
Whilst some successfully declined to submit to fingerprinting, some had their prints taken 
by force. A victim and witnesses provided a vivid description of the circumstances in which </p>


<p>one passenger, a Greek national, was severely beaten for refusing to provide his fingerprints 
to the Israeli authorities. The passenger was dragged along the ground for some distance 
and then surrounded by a large group of Israeli officials who proceeded to beat him 
severely, including the deliberate fracture of his leg. His cries for help were ignored, and 
one witness noted uniformed officials, both male and female, laughing at him. The 
passenger&#8217;s broken leg was not treated until after he had left Israel. 
</p>
<p>191. Passengers were also given a medical check, although some were able to and did 
refuse. Many passengers considered the medical checks to be cursory and pro forma. The 
medication of some passengers who were following special medical prescriptions for 
existing conditions had been confiscated by soldiers or left behind on the vessels. Requests 
for these medications to be returned were not met promptly although some people did 
receive their medication later after repeated requests.  
</p>
<p>192. In addition to the examples described above, there were other incidents of physical 
violence being perpetrated against individual passengers deemed non-cooperative, which 
resulted in physical injuries and trauma. One passenger, who made a general protest about 
the way the passengers were being treated, was told by an Israeli officer: &#8220;You are in Israel 
now; you have no rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>193. Passengers were not allowed access to a lawyer or to consular services during 
processing at the port. Some passengers said that there were translators available in some 
languages and some officials involved in the processing spoke languages other than 
Hebrew. However, many passengers were unable to understand what was being said to 
them. 
</p>
<p>194. The wife of one of the deceased passengers was treated with complete insensitivity 
to her bereavement. She was not allowed to make a phone call to inform her family of her 
loss. There were examples of members of the same family who were separated and kept in 
complete ignorance of the whereabouts and well-being of their relatives until repatriation. 
This separation added to the distress and anxiety experienced by the passengers. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Detention of passengers and crew at Ella prison near Beersheva 
</i></p>
<p>195. After processing at Ashdod, the majority of passengers were transferred in batches 
to Ella Prison, near Beersheva, a one-to-two-hour journey by road. Passengers were 
transferred in regular prison vehicles with barred windows. Some passengers had to wait in 
the vehicles for several hours. One passenger said that he spent 20 hours waiting in a van 
both at Ashdod and at the prison. Many passengers complained that excessive air-
conditioning made the vans very cold. Others complained that they were locked in the vans 
with closed windows in the sun for long periods so that the atmosphere became suffocating. 
Requests to adjust the temperature or to allow access to the toilet were either ignored or in 
some cases resulted in threats of or actual violence. 
</p>
<p>196. On arrival at the prison, most passengers were placed in cells in groups of up to four 
persons. A number of passengers reported that they were kept in isolation and did not meet 
with other passengers until they left the prison. 
</p>
<p>197. Most witnesses reported that the conditions at the prison were acceptable, although 
some complained that on arrival at the facility they had to clean the cells and the communal 
areas. Some also stated that the toilets did not function properly and some, including 
women, reported discomfort in using the showers due to the presence of surveillance 
cameras. Passengers were generally provided with food and water. Many passengers 
complained that they were prevented from sleeping in the prison due to regular roll-calls, 
noise from the prison guards and other deliberate disturbances. </p>


<p>198. Many passengers were subjected to further interrogations while in detention; some 
said that this was done repeatedly. There were a number of allegations of beatings during 
these interrogations. 
</p>
<p>199. Most witnesses reported that they continued to be denied access to a lawyer and to 
contact with their embassies. Lawyers from one Israeli legal aid NGO said that they made 
repeated attempts to visit the detainees but were denied entry for some time. When they 
were granted access, the lawyers had a very limited time with each detainee and could only 
conduct cursory interviews. Some passengers received a visit from their embassy 
representative but the majority had no such contact. Although there was some access to 
telephones, telephone cards, when distributed, allowed very limited calling time making it 
practically impossible to call abroad.  
</p>
<p>200. No foreign national detained at Beersheva was charged with any offence or brought 
before a judge. One passenger was, however, taken, after he had protested his right to 
appear before a judge, before what he considered to be a &#8220;sham court&#8221; close to the airport 
to have his deportation confirmed. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Ill-treatment of passengers at the airport and repatriation 
</i></p>
<p>201. Depending on their time of arrival, passengers were detained from between 24 and 
72 hours. Jordanians and passengers from certain other countries with no diplomatic 
relations with Israel were released early and transported back to Jordan by road. The 
majority of passengers were taken from the prison to Ben Gurion International Airport in 
Tel Aviv for repatriation by air. Many passengers complained that they had again to wait 
for many hours in the sun inside prison vans both at the prison and on arrival at the airport 
during the deportation phase. One women, overcome by the oppressive conditions in her 
vehicle said that she was refused access to a toilet despite making clear that she was 
menstruating. 
</p>
<p>202. Perhaps the most shocking testimony, after that relating to the violence on the<i> Mavi 
Marmara</i>, provided to the Mission was the consistent accounts of a number of incidents of 
extreme and unprovoked violence perpetrated by uniformed Israeli personnel upon certain 
passengers during the processing procedures inside the terminal at Ben Gurion International 
Airport on the day of deportation. These accounts were so consistent and vivid as to be 
beyond question. An intimidating number of armed soldiers and police were present inside 
the terminal building. Some passengers said that these officers were &#8220;spoiling for a fight&#8221;. 
All passengers had been subjected to multiple searches and were completely under the 
control of the Israelis by this stage. Most passengers were continuing to refuse to sign 
deportation documents and some were determined to make a point about the legality of the 
process by insisting on a court hearing to confirm the deportation. None of the violence 
described seems to have been justified. 
</p>
<p>203. Some passengers in the passport checking area saw an older passenger being 
roughly treated after receiving what appeared to be a beating. When other passengers, 
including Irish and Turkish passengers, protested this treatment, they were charged by 
soldiers using batons. In the foray, around 30 passengers were beaten to the ground, kicked 
and punched in a sustained attack by soldiers. One Irish passenger was seen being 
particularly badly beaten around the head and held in a choke position to the point of near 
suffocation. He identified his attackers as police officers. He was taken to a holding cell.  
</p>
<p>204. One Turkish passenger involved in the fight said that he was subsequently taken by 
soldiers, handcuffed with metal cuffs, picked up by the cuffs, taken to a small room and 
beaten and kicked by five more soldiers while others shielded the scene from outside. The 
police intervened to stop the violence in this case. </p>


<p>205. A number of women were pushed around by soldiers, one of whom was beaten with 
fists. They were also subjected to sexual taunts. 
</p>
<p>206. In a separate incident, a passenger was physically attacked by around 17 officers 
when he refused to sign deportation paper, kicked in the head and threatened at gunpoint. A 
number of passengers had resolved to resist deportation in order to have the opportunity to 
demonstrate their innocence in an Israeli court. This was taken as a provocation by the 
Israelis. 
</p>
<p>207. One medical doctor gave a detailed account of his treatment. On arrival at the 
airport, the officer accompanying him jostled him and tried to trip him up on the stairs. He 
was then subjected to verbal insults as he passed through a check point. An officer slapped 
him on the back of the head and when he protested he was set upon by a group of 
uniformed officers, knocked to the ground and repeatedly punched and kicked. He was then 
dragged out of sight of other passengers where the attacks resumed. Attempts were made to 
break his fingers. He was restrained with metal handcuffs behind his back so tightly that he 
lost feeling to one hand. He was then hoisted up by the cuffs and pushed against a wall. 
When he asked for the cuffs to be loosened, he was told this was the price he had to pay for 
attempting to go to Gaza and that &#8220;it would be good for his health&#8221;. The doctor was 
wearing a jacket which clearly identified him as a medical doctor and said the attacks were 
completely unprovoked. 
</p>
<p>208. There were other incidents of isolated violence against individual passengers who 
were deemed to be uncooperative. One passenger was seen having his arm twisted behind 
his back by police to the point that the arm broke. Another was kicked and hit by some 10  
soldiers, handcuffed and taken by vehicle to another place 10-15 minutes away, where 
soldiers abused him for up to two hours. When he returned to the airport, he was bleeding 
from the head. 
</p>
<p>209. A large number of the military and police personnel at the airport exhibited serious 
and unprofessional lapses of military discipline whilst commanding officers failed in most 
cases to intervene promptly. Much of the behaviour was surely criminal under domestic 
Israeli law. 
</p>
<p>210. The majority of the passengers regardless of nationality were deported from Israel 
aboard aircraft provided by the Government of Turkey. The Jordanian detainees however 
were deported by bus across the land border between Israel and Jordan. The Greek 
passengers were airlifted back to Athens aboard a Greek military aircraft sent by the 
Government of Greece. At least one passenger with dual nationality, including Israeli 
nationality elected not to be deported in order not to jeopardize his Israeli citizenship. He 
was threatened with prosecution but was released in Israel and later left the country without 
hindrance. 
</p>
<p>211. Some passengers were made to wait for many hours on board the aircraft while the 
deportation procedures for the other passengers were being completed. Some passengers 
said that they boarded the plane in the morning but did not take off until after midnight.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Treatment of injured passengers in Israeli hospitals 
</i></p>
<p>212. According to Israeli sources, 31 wounded passengers from the <i>Mavi Marmara</i> were 
air-lifted to various hospitals in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa and other locations. All 
witnesses reported that there were guards, either police or soldiers or both, at the bedside or 
stationed outside their rooms. They remained in the hospitals for between three and five 
days receiving medical treatment and were then transferred to Turkey by aeroplane. Most 
were then taken directly to the Atat&#252;rk Research Hospital in Ankara for further treatment.  </p>


<p>213. Some of the passengers treated in Israeli hospitals acknowledged that they were well 
cared for by the medical personnel, but others reported verbal abuse and taunting by their 
guards. A number of witnesses said that they were unable to sleep properly throughout their 
stay in hospital due, in some cases, to deliberate disturbance by the guards. The patients 
were subjected to the same repeated questioning by police or soldiers and heavy pressure to 
sign documents in Hebrew as other passengers had experienced at Ashdod. Some patients 
were visited by a representative of their embassy or by representatives of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross. 
</p>
<p>214. Many of those treated in the Israeli hospitals reported that they were handcuffed to 
their beds using standard metal handcuffs throughout their stay. Some were also restrained 
at their ankles. These were seriously injured people and the cuffing was done with no 
apparent regard to their injuries. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Legal analysis of the treatment of the passengers in Israel 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Arbitrary or illegal arrest or detention 
</i></p>
<p>215. As stated above, article 9, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights guards against arbitrary arrest or detention. Since the Israeli interception of 
the flotilla was unlawful, the detention of the passengers and crew from the seven vessels at 
Ashdod was also prima facie unlawful since there was no legal basis for the Israeli 
authorities to have detained and transported these people to Israel. The passengers found 
themselves in Israel on the basis of an unlawful act by the State of Israel. The Israeli 
authorities were therefore under an obligation to deal with these people in accordance with 
their international human rights obligations. However, once they arrived in Israel, the 
Israeli authorities attempted to shroud the illegality of the interception in a veil of legality. 
</p>
<p>216. On arrival in Ashdod, attempts were made to get passengers to sign certain 
documents which passengers understood to be a confession of illegal entry into Israel. The 
passengers almost universally refused to sign these documents based on the logic that since 
they had been brought to Israel against their will, they could not themselves be held to have 
illegally entered the country. They objected to the implication that they, as victims of an 
illegal act by the State of Israel, could then be held guilty of the illegal act of entering 
Israel. The Mission shared this objection and is of the view that the continued detention of 
the passengers at Ashdod, Beersheva and at the airport constituted a continuation of their 
unlawful detention initiated by the soldiers on the vessels after the interception 
</p>
<p>217. Some passengers wished to challenge the legality of that detention as a means of 
drawing attention to the illegal acts which had resulted in their arrival in Israel. They 
insisted on their right to appear before a judge and said that they had received summons to 
appear in court to face charges. The Mission did not receive copies of any court documents 
showing that foreign nationals involved in the flotilla were charged with any criminal 
offences in Israel. If they were, then the denial of the right to a fair hearing before an 
independent, impartial and competent tribunal would constitute a violation of their rights 
under article 14 of the International Covenant. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment 
</i></p>
<p>218. At all times, the Israeli authorities were bound to treat the detainees in accordance 
with Israel&#8217;s international human rights obligations and to protect them from harm. The 
Mission considers that, whilst the detention phase purported to proceed within a framework 
of legality, there was pervasive hostility towards the passengers which allowed abuse to 
take place.  </p>


<p>219. Passengers&#8217; testimony included a number of credible allegations of physical 
violence and abuse perpetrated by Israeli officers, soldiers and policemen at the processing 
centre in Ashdod, at the prison and at the airport. In some cases, this violence seemed 
gratuitous; in other cases, it seemed aimed specifically at forcing compliance with 
particular procedures (signing forms, fingerprinting) or punishing individuals for non-
compliance. The Mission considers that acts of torture were committed by Israeli officials 
against passengers during their period of detention in Israel in violation of article 1 of the 
Convention against Torture and articles 7 and 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>220. There were other instances of behaviour by Israeli officials which was aimed at 
humiliating individuals which, if not torture, would constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment under the terms of article 16 of the Convention against Torture. 
Body searches were not always conducted in accordance with accepted procedures aimed at 
protecting the dignity of the person being searched and the frequency of the searches raises 
the suggestion that they served to humiliate and degrade rather than meet security needs. 
The Mission would like to draw particular attention to the treatment received by some 
women by female Israeli officers at the processing centre that fell well short of acceptable 
behaviour. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Parading of detainees 
</i></p>
<p>221. Whilst the passengers and crew arriving at Ashdod cannot be classified as prisoners 
of war, the scene at the quayside described by those interviewed carries the hallmarks of a 
&#8220;triumph&#8221; at which captured prisoners of war are paraded in front of flag-waving crowds. 
Prisoners of war would have been protected against this humiliating spectacle by article 13 
of the Third Geneva Convention which protects them from &#8220;insults and public curiosity&#8221;. 
As civilians, the flotilla passengers should have been entitled to the same basic level of 
protection, which would also fall under general customary law provisions protecting 
civilians from assaults on their dignity. The failure of the Israeli authorities to afford this 
protection may also be construed, inter alia, as a violation of the presumption of innocence 
under article 14, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant comparable to the public 
display of those suspected of criminal offences. Regardless of whether any passengers on 
board the flotilla were suspected of having committed of criminal acts, all passengers 
should have been protected from public curiosity. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Right to security of the person and to human dignity 
</i></p>
<p>222. The serious incidents of physical violence perpetrating by Israeli military and/or 
police officers against the passengers at Ben Gurion International Airport clearly constitute 
grave violations of the protection that should be afforded to detainees under international 
human rights law and international humanitarian law. Article 9 of the International 
Covenant provides for the right to security of person and article 10 guarantees that &#8220;all 
persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the 
inherent dignity of the human person&#8221;. Insofar as the treatment meted out at the airport was 
perpetrated by soldiers and police, sometimes with the acquiescence of their superiors, this 
behaviour can also be considered torture. It seems clear to the Mission that these acts at the 
airport, at a time when the passengers were completely under the control of the authorities, 
constituted an attempt by individual groups of officers to &#8220;give them a bloody nose&#8221; just 
before departure. 
</p>
<p>223. Other reported acts of physical abuse and ill treatment during the detention and 
deportation phase would similarly constitute violations of the right to security of person. 
</p>
<p>224. The Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials sets out some basic obligations 
which should have been followed by all Israeli military and police personnel whilst they </p>


<p>were charged with the care of the passengers. These include the duty to respect and protect 
human dignity and maintain and uphold the human rights of all persons (art. 2), to use force 
only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty 
(art. 3) and not to inflict, instigate or tolerate any act of torture or other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment (article 5). Each of these duties was disregarded by 
certain Israeli officials at certain points during the detention and deportation process.  
</p>
<p><i> (e) Other detention rights  
</i></p>
<p>225. Regardless of the pretended claim to legality of the detention of the flotilla 
participants inside Israel, the State of Israel was bound to afford the detainees certain basic 
rights whilst in detention. In certain instances, the facts as presented to the Mission indicate 
that these rights were not respected. 
</p>
<p>226. Article 10 of the International Covenant provides that all persons deprived of their 
liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human 
person. This provision is supplemented, inter alia, by the Body of Principles for the 
Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment (1988) and the 
Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials (1979). Whilst a system was put in place 
at Ashdod for the processing of the disembarking passengers, it is clear that officers showed 
a hostility towards the passengers under their care which encouraged behaviour which 
violated basic standards of civilized treatment of detainees. 
</p>
<p>227. There were problems with ensuring that all disembarking passengers understood the 
legal processes and procedures to which they were being subjected due to language 
difficulties. Although the Israeli authorities clearly attempted to provide documents in 
languages other than Hebrew and some officers were on hand able to speak English, Arabic 
and Turkish, it is clear that many passengers did not understand what was happening to 
them. Article 9, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant requires that detained persons 
be informed about the reasons for their arrest and detention. Principle 14 of the Body of 
Principles states that a person who does not adequately understand or speak the language 
used by the authorities responsible for the arrest, detention or imprisonment is entitled to 
receive promptly in a language which he understands certain specific information relating 
to his arrest and detention and to have the assistance, free of charge, if necessary, of an 
interpreter in connection with legal proceedings subsequent to arrest. The Mission 
considers that many detainees were not afforded these rights. 
</p>
<p>228. Furthermore, there is evidence that some detainees were specifically misinformed 
about their legal situation by Israeli officers, particular with regard to the deportation papers 
they were asked to sign. In one absurd example, an individual says that he was told that 
refusing to sign the deportation form would incur the death penalty &#8211; an assertion which the 
detainee did not take seriously. Principle 21 of the Body of Principles prohibits taking 
&#8220;undue advantage of the situation of a detained or imprisoned person for the purpose of 
compelling him to confess, to incriminate himself otherwise or to testify against another 
person&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>229. Many of the detainees specifically requested, on numerous occasions, access to legal 
counsel and/or the consular services of their embassies or diplomatic representatives in 
Israel. Although some did eventually receive visits from legal aid lawyers and diplomatic 
consuls, other did not. Principle 17 of the Body of Principles states that &#8220;a detained person 
shall be entitled to have the assistance of a legal counsel. He shall be informed of his right 
by the competent authority promptly after arrest and shall be provided with reasonable 
facilities for exercising it.&#8221; Principle 16 (2) furthermore provides: 
</p>
<p>If a detained person is a foreigner, he shall also be promptly informed of his right to 
communicate by appropriate means with a consular post of the diplomatic mission </p>


<p>of the State of which he is a national or which is otherwise entitled to receive such 
communication in accordance with international law or with the representative of a 
competent international organization, if he is a refugee or is otherwise under the 
protection of an international organization. 
</p>
<p>Any communication under this provision must be made or permitted without delay. Most 
detainees who gained access to a consul were only allowed such access several days after 
they had originally been detained and requested access. 
</p>
<p>230. Principle 18 provides that &#8220;a detained person shall be entitled to communicate and 
consult with his legal counsel [and] shall be allowed adequate time and facilities for 
consultation&#8221;. Israeli legal-aid lawyers who gained access to some of the detainees were 
barely able to spend more than a few minutes with each detainee in the time allocated by 
the authorities for the visit. 
</p>
<p>231. All detainees complained that they were not allowed the means to contact their 
families, who would have been distressed and concerned after hearing from news reports 
about the interception of the flotilla. In one extreme and insensitive example, the wife of 
one of the deceased was not able to call her family to notify them of her bereavement. 
Although telephones were available to some detainees in prison, they could not be used to 
make the numerous international telephone calls necessary for this particular cohort of 
detainees from more than 40 countries. Principle 16 (1) of the Body of Principles states that 
&#8220;promptly after arrest and after each transfer from one place of detention to another, a 
detained person shall be entitled to notify or to require the competent authority to notify 
members of his family or other appropriate persons of his choice of his arrest, detention or 
imprisonment or for the transfer and of the place of detention where he is kept in custody&#8221;. 
There should be no delay in the implementation of this requirement. 
</p>
<p><i> (f) Treatment of injured people in detention 
</i></p>
<p>232. Most passengers were offered a medical examination, albeit perfunctory, in 
accordance with Principle 24 of the Body of Rules, which states that &#8220;a proper medical 
examination shall be offered to a detained or imprisoned person as promptly as possible 
after his admission to the place of detention or imprisonment&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>233. In some instances, passengers who had been injured, including those injured by 
assaults committed by Israeli officials did not receive immediate medical attention. Article 
6 of the Code of Conduct states that &#8220;law enforcement officials shall ensure the full 
protection of the health of persons in their custody and, in particular, shall take immediate 
action to secure medical attention whenever required&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Confiscation and return of property by the Israeli authorities 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Factual description and findings 
</b></p>
<p>234. The Mission found the facts set out below to have been established to its 
satisfaction. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Possessions of passengers confiscated by the Israeli authorities 
</i></p>
<p>235. The Mission received accounts from passengers who were on board all six vessels in 
the flotilla on the confiscation by the Israeli authorities of cash and a wide variety of 
personal belongings, including passports, identification cards, driving licences, mobile 
telephones, laptop computers, audio equipment including MP3 players, photographic and 
video recording equipment, credit cards, documents, books and clothing. These items were 
taken at a number of stages, primarily while on board the vessels (during body searches and </p>


<p>items left in others parts of the vessels that they were not permitted to retrieve) or during 
processing at the Ashdod detention facility. The Mission estimates that many hundreds of 
expensive electronic items remain in the possession of the Israeli authorities. Many 
passengers were carrying considerable amounts of cash donations to be distributed in Gaza, 
in some cases amounting to tens of thousands of dollars. There was inconsistent practice by 
the Israelis with regard to cash: some passengers were allowed to hold on to cash 
throughout their detention, some had cash confiscated and then returned and others had the 
cash taken and it was not returned. 
</p>
<p>236. Furthermore, while most passports were returned to passengers prior to their 
departure from Israel and others have since been returned, some passengers have still not 
received their passports nearly four months after the incident. 
</p>
<p>237. It is clear in the view of the Mission that the Israeli authorities did not put a system 
in place to properly record items that were confiscated and identify personal effects with 
the aim of returning them to the rightful owners. On board the various vessels, the Israeli 
forces conducted extensive searches of the passengers&#8217; luggage that left personal 
possessions strewn across the cabins in a highly disordered state. One witness, who had 
been isolated and beaten, described the surreal experience of sitting handcuffed on a large 
heap of laptops and electronic devices and being &#8220;serenaded&#8221; by mobile telephones 
reconnecting to a network as the ship approached Ashdod.  
</p>
<p>238. Some items were returned to the Turkish authorities and passengers were able to 
retrieve some items of luggage from the forensic office in Istanbul. When the vessels were 
later returned from Israeli custody, some luggage and other items still on board were stored 
at an IHH warehouse in Istanbul. However, passengers who went to the warehouse were 
only able to reclaim a few clothing items or empty suitcases. The mission was informed 
that items belonging to some of the British passengers were also returned to them by post 
via the British Consulate in Israel but that these items were damaged or not actually theirs. 
</p>
<p>239. The mission&#8217;s attention has been drawn to several allegations regarding misuse of 
items confiscated by the Israeli authorities, including laptop computers, credit cards and 
mobile telephones. On 20 August 2010 it was reported in the Israeli media that &#8220;at least 
four&#8221; Israeli soldiers had been detained on suspicion of stealing and selling laptops 
belonging to passengers that were on board the flotilla.84 Furthermore, at least four 
passengers have stated that their personal items, including credit cards and mobile 
telephones, have been subsequently used in Israel. There is an account of a particular 
witness, a journalist, who was on board the <i>Sfendoni </i>and alleged that his credit card was 
used to purchase items in Israel, both while he was detained at the Beersheva prison and 
after he had been released.85 There is another specific account where more than $1,000 was 
spent on a confiscated credit card in Israel.86 
</p>
<p>240. Amongst the items confiscated and not returned by the Israeli authorities is a large 
amount of video and photographic footage that was recorded on electronic and other media 
by passengers, including many professional journalists, on board the vessels of the flotilla. 
This includes a large number of photographic and video material of the Israeli assault and 
interception on the <i>Mavi Marmara</i> and other vessels. The Israeli authorities have

<p>subsequently released a very limited amount of this for public access, in an edited form,87 
but the vast majority has remained in the private control of the Israeli authorities. 
</p>
<p>241. The Mission is satisfied that this represents a deliberate attempt by the Israeli 
authorities to suppress or destroy evidence and other information related to the events of 31 
May on the <i>Mavi Marmara </i>and other vessels of the flotilla.  
</p>
<p>242. Many journalists who were on board the flotilla in their professional capacity have 
subsequently submitted various complaints regarding the confiscation of their data and 
equipment and the non-payment of damages or compensation. An example of this is a letter 
of behalf of the approximately 60 journalists that was sent to request action of the European 
Commission. The mission is aware of formal claims being prepared on behalf of a number 
of passengers whose personal property was taken or confiscated on board the <i>Mavi 
Marmara</i> and other vessels. The Mission estimates the value of such property to be not 
inconsiderable. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Vessels of the flotilla confiscated by the Israeli authorities 
</i></p>
<p>243. The six vessels of the flotilla were held by the Israeli authorities for an extended 
period of time. For example, the <i>Mavi Marmara, Defne Y</i> and <i>Gazze 1</i> ships were only 
taken to the Turkish port of Iskenderun on 7 August, more than two months after arriving at 
the port of Ashdod in Israel. 
</p>
<p>244. The<i> Mavi Marmara</i> was in a state of disrepair on its return to Turkey. The ship&#8217;s 
captain and other crew members confirmed that items damaged had been in full working 
order when the ship was taken under the control of the Israeli authorities on 31 May. The 
Mission&#8217;s own investigations confirmed that equipment had been destroyed or badly 
damaged including two Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) and a gyro-screen, two 
Very High Frequency (VHF) handset radio loud speakers, surveillance and other 
equipment, the VHF radio and VHF DSC Watch Receiver, MF-HF radio and DSC 
equipment, the control panel indicator, the speed log screen, the INMARSAT-C screen, the 
Raytheon Plotter-Radar replacement screen, two mobile Global Positioning Systems (GPS) 
and the fire-alarm control panel. Other items had been removed, including the satellite 
telephone, the ship survey recording computer and its spare equipment and the ship's 
journal and all records, including the ship's certificate file. In the engine room, the control 
room generator and main control dash were destroyed and the gear dash was damaged. 
There was oily water and submergible pumps in the bilge water compartment of the engine 
and the diesel generator spare parts were scattered with some sea water as well as oil leaks 
were present. Furthermore, the engine command and control systems had been tampered 
with. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Legal analysis of the denial of property and right to freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>245. The Mission is concerned that the actions of the Israeli authorities in confiscating, 
withholding, and in some cases destroying the private property of many hundreds of 
passengers on board the various vessels of the flotilla represents both a violation of rights 
related to property ownership and to the freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>246. Article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that &#8220;everyone has 
the right to own property alone as well as in association with others; No one shall be 
arbitrarily deprived of his property&#8221;. Insofar as the Universal Declaration in considered to 
form part of customary international law, no State may arbitrarily deprive someone of their 
</p>
<p>  
 87 For example, footage taken by a passenger on the top deck while Israeli soldiers descended onto the 
</p>
<p>deck: www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6Xm8Irz-so </p>


<p>own property. The Mission considers that the Israeli authorities, in disregarding the rights 
of many hundreds of passengers on board the flotilla to their possessions, fails to meet a 
State&#8217;s obligations in relation to rights to own property.  
</p>
<p>247. In relation to international humanitarian law, Article 97 of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention states: &#8220;Internees shall be permitted to retain articles of personal use. Monies ... 
and valuables in their possession may not be taken from them except in accordance with 
established procedure ... On release or repatriation; internees shall be given all articles, 
monies or other valuables taken from them during internment ... with the exception of any 
articles or amounts withheld by the Detaining Power by virtue of its legislation in force. If 
the property of an internee is so withheld, the owner shall receive a detailed receipt. Family 
or identity documents in the possession of internees may not be taken away without a 
receipt being given&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>248. Furthermore, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has 
established that, as far as the destruction or appropriation of property cannot be justified by 
military necessity, it is unlawful.88 Clearly no military necessity existed to justify the 
confiscation and continuing appropriation of the property of the passengers of the flotilla. 
Furthermore, the Mission has been made aware of communications between the 
Government of Israel and a law firm in the United Kingdom, in which the Government 
admits to retaining property of the passengers, but does not claim reasons of military 
necessity but only that the items are necessary for ongoing investigations within Israel. 
</p>
<p>249. Article 19, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
states that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include 
freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of 
frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media 
of his choice.&#8221; While this right may be subject to certain restrictions, as set out in article 19, 
, paragraph 3, none of these are met in this case that would allow the Israeli authorities to 
restrict the rights of journalists and other passengers to freely utilize and share information 
gathered on board the vessels of the flotilla. Journalists in particular have the right to utilize 
the tools of their trade. The Mission considers that the actions of the Israeli authorities 
represent a continuing violation of the right to freedom of expression for the journalists and 
other passengers on board the flotilla.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Consequences for Israeli citizens of participation in the flotilla 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Factual description and findings 
</b></p>
<p>250. The Mission found the facts set out below to have been established to its 
satisfaction. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Detention and criminal prosecution of Israeli citizens 
</i></p>
<p>251. Passengers with Israeli citizenship were separated from other passengers on arrival 
in Ashdod. After interrogation, they were informed that they would be detained and face 
charges under Israeli law, including attempting to kill a soldier, seizing arms, shooting from 
a soldier&#8217;s gun, organizing violence and being present in a military zone. Although taken to 
a different prison, they had similar experiences to the other passengers, including sleep 
deprivation and denial of access to a lawyer.  
</p>
<p>  
 88 ICTY, Judgment, <i>The Prosecutor v. Dario Kordic and Mario Cerkez</i>, IT-95-14/2-T.  </p>


<p>252. On 1 June 2010, the Ashkelon Magistrate&#8217;s Court remanded in custody four 
Palestinian Israelis: Muhammed Zeidan, Chairman of the High Follow-up Committee for 
Arab Citizens of Israel; Sheikh Raed Salah, the Head of the Islamic Movement of Israel 
(northern branch); Sheikh Hamad Abu Daabe, Head of the Islamic Movement in Israel 
(southern branch) and Lubna Masarwa of the Free Gaza Movement. On 3 June 2010, the 
same court decided to release the group with certain conditions, including a period of house 
arrest until 8 June, prohibition from leaving the country for 45 days and the posting of a 
bond of 150,000 Shekels by a third party. 
</p>
<p>253. The four people have not since been indicted but the file is still open and the charges 
have not been withdrawn.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Reprisals against an elected member of the Knesset 
</i></p>
<p>254. One member of the Israeli Knesset, Haneen Zouabi, was a passenger on the Mavi 
Marmara. Ms. Zouabi was not detained, but was extensively interrogated.  
</p>
<p>255. As a result of her participation in the flotilla, the Knesset voted on 7 June 2010 to 
remove three of parliamentary privileges available to Ms. Zouabi as a Member of the 
Knesset: her privileges in overseas travel; her diplomatic passport; payment of any legal 
fees in case of removal of her parliamentary immunity from criminal prosecution. The 
Knesset held several sessions on the issue of her participation in the flotilla during which 
there were racist and sexist remarks and physical threats made against her. Some 
parliamentarians have also called for her to face criminal prosecution and measures, such as 
revoking her membership in the Knesset, were discussed. The Israeli Minister of Interior 
accused Ms. Zouabi of treason and requested authorization from the Attorney General to 
revoke her citizenship. To date, no criminal proceedings have been initiated against Ms. 
Zouabi. Since her participation in the Gaza flotilla, Ms. Zouabi has received many death 
threats. 
</p>
<p>256. The Inter-Parliamentary Union&#8217;s Committee on the Human Rights of 
Parliamentarians adopted a confidential decision at its 130th session in July 2010,89 holding 
the punishment of Ms. Zouabi for exercising her freedom of speech by expressing her 
political position to be unacceptable and calling on the Knesset to reconsider its decision.  
</p>
<p>257. The Mission refrains from any comment on any domestic legal proceedings which 
may be <i>sub judice</i>. However, the Mission notes that these actions against Israeli citizens 
could give rise to certain violations of Israel&#8217;s international human rights obligations, 
including freedom of expression, political participation rights and rights to due process. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Accountability and effective remedy 
</b></p>
<p>258. The Mission notes that the facts established give rise to a series of violations in law. 
In accordance with the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the victims of such violations have a right to an effective remedy which includes 
judicial remedies as well as the right to reparations which should be proportionate to the 
gravity of the violations.  In cases of torture, victims should in addition be afforded medical 
and psychological care.  Finally, article 9, paragraph 5, of the Covenant provides for a 
specific right to compensation. As far as the grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention are concerned, these may give rise to individual criminal responsibility. 
</p>
<p>  
 89 Case No. IL/04 &#8211; Haneen Zoabi &#8211; Israel </p>


<p>259. In the past, Israel has not honoured its obligations referred to in the preceding 
paragraph. It is hoped that on this occasion the Israeli authorities and those concerned will 
carry out prompt, independent and impartial judicial investigations of violations of 
international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law, with a 
view to bringing the perpetrators to justice.   
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>260. <b>The attack on the flotilla must be viewed in the context of the ongoing problems 
between the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority and people. In 
carrying out its task, the Mission was exposed to the depth of conviction on both sides 
of the correctness of their respective positions. Similar disasters are likely to reoccur 
unless there is a dramatic shift in the existing paradigm. It must be remembered that 
might and strength are enhanced when attended by a sense of justice and fair play. 
Peace and respect have to be earned, not bludgeoned out of any opponent. An unfair 
victory has never been known to bring lasting peace. 
</b></p>
<p>261. <b>The Mission has come to the firm conclusion that a humanitarian crisis existed 
on the 31 May 2010 in Gaza. The preponderance of evidence from impeccable sources 
is too overwhelming to come to a contrary opinion.  Any denial of this cannot be 
supported on any rational grounds. One of the consequences flowing from this is that 
for this reason alone the blockade is unlawful and cannot be sustained in law. This is 
so regardless of the grounds on which one seeks to justify the legality of the blockade. 
</b></p>
<p>262. <b>Certain results flow from this conclusion. Principally, the action of the Israel 
Defense Force in intercepting the <i>Mavi Marmara</i> on the high seas in the circumstances 
and for the reasons given was clearly unlawful. Specifically, the action cannot be 
justified in the circumstances even under Article 51 of the Charter of the United 
Nations. 
</b></p>
<p>263. <b>Israel seeks to justify the blockade on security grounds. The State of Israel is 
entitled to peace and security like any other. The firing of rockets and other munitions 
of war into Israeli territory from Gaza constitutes serious violations of international 
law and of international humanitarian law. But any action in response which 
constitutes collective punishment of the civilian population in Gaza is not lawful in 
any circumstances.  
</b></p>
<p>264. <b>The conduct of the Israeli military and other personnel towards the flotilla 
passengers was not only disproportionate to the occasion but demonstrated levels of 
totally unnecessary and incredible violence. It betrayed an unacceptable level of 
brutality. Such conduct cannot be justified or condoned on security or any other 
grounds. It constituted a grave violation of human rights law and international 
humanitarian law. 
</b></p>
<p>265. <b>The Mission considers that several violations and offences have been 
committed. It is not satisfied that, in the time available, it has been able to compile a 
comprehensive list of all offences. However, there is clear evidence to support 
prosecutions of the following crimes within the terms of article 147 of the Fourth 
Geneva Convention: 
</b></p>
<p><b>&#8226; Wilful killing; 
</b></p>
<p><b>&#8226; Torture or inhuman treatment; 
</b></p>
<p><b>&#8226; Wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health. </b></p>


<p><b>The Mission also considers that a series of violations of Israel&#8217;s obligations under 
international human rights law have taken place, including: 
</b></p>
<p><b>&#8226; Right to life (art. 6, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights); 
</b></p>
<p><b>&#8226; Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (art. 
7, International Covenant; Convention against Torture); 
</b></p>
<p><b>&#8226; Right to liberty and security of the person and freedom from arbitrary arrest 
or detention (art. 9, International Covenant); 
</b></p>
<p><b>&#8226; Right of detainees to be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent 
dignity of the human person (art. 10, International Covenant); 
</b></p>
<p><b>&#8226; Freedom of expression (art. 19, International Covenant). 
</b></p>
<p><b>The right to an effective remedy should be guaranteed to all victims. The mission must 
not be understood to be saying that this is a comprehensive list by any means. 
</b></p>
<p>266. <b>The Mission notes that the retention by the Israeli authorities of unlawfully 
seized property remains a continuing offence and Israel is called upon to return such 
property forthwith. 
</b></p>
<p>267. <b>The perpetrators of the more serious crimes, being masked, cannot be 
identified without the assistance of the Israeli authorities. They reacted in a violent 
manner when they thought that anyone was attempting to identify them. The Mission 
sincerely hopes that there will be cooperation from the Government of Israel to assist 
in their identification with a view to prosecuting the culpable and bringing closure to 
the situation. 
</b></p>
<p>268. <b>The Mission is aware that this is not the first time that the Government of 
Israel has declined to cooperate with an inquiry into events in which its military 
personnel were involved. On this occasion the Mission accepts the assurances of the 
Permanent Representative of Israel that the position which he was directed to defend 
was in no way directed towards the members of the Mission in their personal 
capacities. It is nonetheless regrettable that, on yet another occasion of an enquiry into 
events involving loss of life at the hands of the Israeli military, the Government of 
Israel has declined to cooperate in an inquiry not appointed by it or on which it was 
significantly represented. 
</b></p>
<p>269. <b>The Mission regrets that its requests to the Permanent Mission of Israel for 
information were not entertained. The reason initially given was that the Government 
of Israel had established its own independent panel of distinguished persons to 
investigate the flotilla incident. The Mission was told that for that reason, and also 
because the Secretary-General had announced the establishment of another 
distinguished panel with a similar mandate, that &#8220;an additional Human Rights 
Council initiative in this regard [are] both unnecessary and unproductive&#8221;. 
</b></p>
<p>270. <b>The Mission did not agree with that position and for that reason suggested to 
the Permanent Representative of Israel that he should direct to the Council and not 
the Mission a request that the Mission defer submitting its report to permit other 
enquiries to complete their tasks. The Mission has not received any direction from the 
Council to date and considers that it would have been obligated to respond positively 
to any such directive from the Council. 
</b></p>
<p>271. <b>In the light of the fact that the Turkel Committee and the Secretary-General&#8217;s 
panel have not concluded their sittings, the Mission will refrain from any remarks 
which are capable of being construed as not allowing those bodies to complete their 
tasks &#8220;unfettered by external events&#8221;. The Mission confines itself to the observation </b></p>


<p><b>that public confidence in any investigative process in circumstances such as the 
present is not enhanced when the subject of an investigation either investigates himself 
or plays a pivotal role in the process.  
</b></p>
<p>272. <b>Elsewhere in this report the Mission has referred to the fact that it found it 
necessary to reinterpret its mandate because of the manner in which the resolution 
appointing it was couched. It is important in the drafting of matters of the sort that 
the impression is not given of the appearance of any prejudgment. The Mission took 
particular care at the first opportunity to indicate that it interpreted its mandate as 
requiring it to approach its task without any preconceptions or prejudices. It wishes to 
assure all concerned that it has held to that position scrupulously.        
</b></p>
<p>273. <b>All the passengers on board the ships comprising the flotilla who appeared 
before the Mission impressed the members as persons genuinely committed to the 
spirit of humanitarianism and imbued with a deep and genuine concern for the 
welfare of the inhabitants of Gaza. The Mission can only express the hope that 
differences will be resolved in the short rather than the long term so that peace and 
harmony may exist in the area. 
</b></p>
<p>274. <b>Nine human beings lost their lives and several others suffered serious injuries. 
From the observations of the Mission, deep psychological scars have been inflicted by 
what must have been a very traumatic experience not only for the passengers but also 
the soldiers who received injuries. The members of the Mission sympathize with all 
concerned and in particular with the families of the deceased.  
</b></p>
<p>275. <b>The Mission is not alone in finding that a deplorable situation exists in Gaza.  It 
has been characterized as &#8220;unsustainable&#8221;. This is totally intolerable and 
unacceptable in the twenty-first century. It is amazing that anyone could characterize 
the condition of the people there as satisfying the most basic standards. The parties 
and the international community are urged to find the solution that will address all 
legitimate security concern of both Israel and the people of Palestine, both of whom 
are equally entitled to &#8220;their place under the heavens&#8221;. The apparent dichotomy in 
this case between the competing rights of security and to a decent living can only be 
resolved if old antagonisms are subordinated to a sense of justice and fair play. One 
has to find the strength to pluck rooted sorrows from the memory and to move on. 
</b></p>
<p>276. <b>The Mission has given thought to the position of humanitarian organizations 
who wish to intervene in situations of long-standing humanitarian crisis where the 
international community is unwilling for whatever reason to take positive action. Too 
often they are accused as being meddlesome and at worst as terrorists or enemy 
agents. 
</b></p>
<p>277. <b>A distinction must be made between activities taken to alleviate crises and 
action to address the causes creating the crisis. The latter action is characterized as 
political action and therefore inappropriate for groups that wish to be classified as 
humanitarian. This point is made because of the evidence that, while some of the 
passengers were solely interested in delivering supplies to the people in Gaza, for 
others the main purpose was raising awareness of the blockade with a view to its 
removal, as the only way to solve the crisis. An examination should be made to clearly 
define humanitarianism, as distinct from humanitarian action, so that there can be an 
agreed form of intervention and jurisdiction when humanitarian crises occur. 
</b></p>
<p>278. <b>The Mission sincerely hopes that no impediment will be put in the way of those 
who suffered loss as a result of the unlawful actions of the Israeli military to be 
compensated adequately and promptly. It is hoped that there will be swift action by 
the Government of Israel. This will go a long way to reversing the regrettable 
reputation which that country has for impunity and intransigence in international </b></p>


<p><b>affairs. It will also assist those who genuinely sympathise with their situation to 
support them without being stigmatized.  </b>  </p>


<p><b>Annexes 
</b></p>
<p><b>Annex I 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Human Rights Council international fact-finding mission 
established under resolution 14/1: International Fact-Finding 
Mission on the Gaza Flotilla Incident  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Terms of reference 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Background  
</b></p>
<p>1 On 1 June 2010 at its fourteenth session, the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 
14/1, decided &#8220;to dispatch an independent international fact finding mission to investigate 
violations of international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law, 
resulting from the Israeli attacks on the flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian assistance.&#8221;  </p>
<p>2 On 23 July 2010, the President of the Council, in accordance with paragraph 9 of the 
resolution, appointed three eminent experts to the Mission: Judge Karl Hudson-Philips 
(Chair), Sir Desmond de Silva and Ms. Mary Shanthi Dairiam. The members of the 
Mission formally began their work on 9 August 2010.  
</p>
<p>3 The Fact-Finding Mission is requested in paragraph 9 of the resolution to report its 
findings to the Council at its fifteenth session.  
</p>
<p><b>  Interpretation of the mandate  
</b></p>
<p>4. The members of the Mission have decided to interpret their mandate as ascertaining 
the facts surrounding the Israeli interception of the Gaza-bound flotilla to determine 
whether any violations of international law, including international humanitarian and 
human rights law, took place.  
</p>
<p>5. In carrying out this mandate, the members of the Mission have indicated to the 
Council that they would:  
</p>
<p> (a) Focus on the events that took place in international waters on 31 May 2010 as 
well as the way in which the Israeli authorities dealt with the aftermath of the 
operation and the repatriation of those participating in the flotilla;  
</p>
<p> (b) Seek to travel to, inter alia, Turkey, Gaza, Israel and Jordan in order to meet 
with witnesses, officials and non-governmental organizations;  
</p>
<p> (c) Travel to other countries to interview witnesses as may be necessary; and   
</p>
<p> (d) Make all enquiries it considers relevant to the forgoing in order to discharge 
its mandate.  </p>


<p><b>  Methodology  
</b></p>
<p>6. The members of the Mission intend to conduct their investigation independently and 
impartially and to this end are keen to receive information from any interested parties 
representing all points of view.  
</p>
<p>7. The Mission considers that the standard operating assumptions for a United Nations 
fact-finding mission will apply, including the following:  
</p>
<p> (a) The Mission should enjoy the full cooperation of all States Members of the 
United Nations;   
</p>
<p> (b) Members and staff shall enjoy the privileges and immunities accorded to 
experts on missions and officials under the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and 
Immunities of the United Nations;  
</p>
<p> (c) The Mission should have freedom of movement throughout the relevant 
territories;  
</p>
<p> (d) The Mission should have unhindered access to all places and establishments, 
and freedom to meet and interview representatives of Governmental and local 
authorities, military authorities, community leaders, non-governmental organizations 
and other institutions, and any such person whose testimony and/or expert advice is 
considered necessary for the fulfilment of its mandate;  
</p>
<p> (e) The Mission should have unhindered access to and for individuals and 
organizations wishing to meet with the Mission;  
</p>
<p> (f) The Mission should have free access to all sources of information, including 
documentary material and physical evidence;  
</p>
<p> (g) Protection should be guaranteed of victims and witnesses and all those who 
are in contact with the Mission in connection with the inquiry. No such person shall, 
as a result of such contact, suffer harassment, threats, acts of intimidation, ill-
treatment or reprisals.  
</p>
<p>8. Given the large number of potential witnesses to the incidents and the short 
timeframe, the members of the Mission will determine appropriate criteria for the selection 
and examination of witnesses.  
</p>
<p><b>  Secretariat  
</b></p>
<p>9. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has provided a 
designated staff of five Professional human rights officers, one administrative officer and 
one Security officer to act as the secretariat to support the members of the Mission. 
Additional expert consultants in the fields of pathology, law of the sea and international 
humanitarian and military law will also support the members of the Mission.  
</p>
<p>10. The Mission will be based in the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights in Geneva.  </p>
