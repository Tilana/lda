all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, in particular as 
to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, 
property, birth, or other status, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> previous resolutions of the General Assembly, the Commission on 
Human Rights and the Human Rights Council on the protection of the human rights of 
migrants and the work of various special mechanisms of the Council that have reported on 
the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and 
Development that will be held during the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly, 
which provides a unique opportunity to work towards a global agenda for effective, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>* Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>inclusive migration governance and to identify measures that promote the role of migrants 
as agents of innovation and development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence 
within the borders of each State and the right to leave any country, including his or her 
own, and to return to his or her country, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the valuable economic, social and cultural contributions of migrants to 
the communities of countries of origin and destination, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>that everyone is entitled to all human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
without distinction of any kind, including the right to life, liberty and security of person, 
wherever the person is and regardless of his or her immigration status, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> that States have the obligation to respect the principle of non-
refoulement and the prohibition of collective expulsion, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that States are responsible for promoting and protecting the human 
rights of all persons, including irregular migrants, who are in their territory and subject to 
their jurisdiction, 
 <i>Deeply concerned</i> at the large and growing number of migrants, including women 
and children, who have lost their lives in attempting irregular border crossings, and 
recognizing the obligation of States to protect and respect the human rights of those 
attempting irregular border crossings, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> that policies and initiatives on the issue of migration, including 
those that refer to border control and the orderly management of migration, must be in 
accordance with international human rights obligations in order to uphold the human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its concern</i> at measures that, including in the context of policies aimed at 
reducing irregular migration, treat irregular migration as a criminal rather than an 
administrative offence, where the effect of doing so is to deny migrants the full enjoyment 
of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the importance of 
international, regional and bilateral cooperation, built on a partnership approach, and the 
need to protect the human rights of migrants, particularly at a time in which the increased 
regional and global mobility of persons, the structural changes in the global economy, and 
the current economic crisis generate new opportunities and challenges for countries of 
origin, transit and destination, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that criminalization and restrictive migratory policies increase the irregular 
crossings, may increase vulnerability to organized crime, and may benefit criminal 
organizations, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing concern </i>at the systematic detention of migrants to pursue migration 
policies, the use of prolonged detention of persons without prospect of removal, the 
detention of children and pregnant women, and the absence of alternatives to detention, and 
that return procedures often fail to provide the necessary safeguards, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> <i>the need</i> for States to develop adequate procedures for detention that 
ensure respect for legal, procedural and substantive guarantees and the development and 
use of alternatives to detention, </p>

human rights of migrants,1 and welcomes his work; 
</p>

or acceding to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families as a matter of priority, and requests the Secretary-
General to continue his efforts to promote and raise awareness of the Convention; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses its concern</i> at legislation and measures adopted by some States that 
may restrict the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, and reaffirms that, 
when exercising their sovereign right to enact and implement migration and border security 
measures, States have the duty to comply with their obligations under international law, 
including international human rights law, in order to ensure full respect for the human 
rights of all migrants;

international human rights law, and to pay particular attention to women and girls, who 
may be exposed to sexually-based violence; 
</p>
<p> <i>(c)</i> To prosecute, in conformity with applicable law, any act of violation of the 
human rights of migrants and their families, such as arbitrary detention, torture and 
violations of the right to life, including extrajudicial executions, during their transit from 
their country of origin to the country of destination and vice versa, including their transit 
through national borders; 
</p>
<p> <i>(d)</i> To regularly assess their policies of migratory control and enforcement with 
regard to the risks they may pose for the loss of life of migrants, in order to do their utmost 
to avoid such situations;

<p> <i>(e)</i> To guarantee the full enjoyment of all persons to the right to the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health without distinction of any kind, and to this 
end to provide emergency medical and first-aid attention for migrants who need it,

which individuals and organizations that provide such attention can operate free from 
hindrance and insecurity; 
</p>
<p> <i>(f)</i> To take care that domestic law and administrative provisions and their 
application facilitate the work of humanitarian workers and human rights defenders 
providing humanitarian assistance to and defending the human rights of irregular migrants, 
including by avoiding any criminalization, stigmatization, impediments, obstructions or 
restrictions thereof contrary to international human rights law; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p> <i>(h)</i> To respect the human rights and the inherent dignity of migrants, to put an 
end to arbitrary arrest and detention, to review detention periods in order to avoid excessive 
detention of irregular migrants and to resort to detention only when there are no viable 
alternative measures to detention; 
</p>
<p> <i>(i)</i> To respect in all circumstances the principle of non-refoulement and the 
prohibition of collective expulsion; 
</p>
<p> <i>(j)</i> To put in place, if they have not yet done so, independent oversight 
mechanisms that can easily be applied in order to ensure full compliance with international 
human rights law by all programmes and institutions in the field of migration; 
</p>
<p> <i>(k)</i> To participate in international and regional dialogues on migration that 
include countries of origin, transit and destination; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the actions taken by several special 
procedures of the Human Rights Council and the treaty bodies for the effective prevention 
of violations of the human rights of migrants, including through joint statements and urgent 
appeals, and encourages them to continue their collaborative efforts to this end, within their 
respective mandates; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue to pay attention to the topic of 
the universal enjoyment of human rights for all migrants; 
 7. <i>Encourages</i> States, and regional and international organizations to enhance
