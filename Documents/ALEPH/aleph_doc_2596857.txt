Commenting on the financial results, Silver Lake Managing Director Luke Tonkin said:
“The  strong  results  achieved  across  the  business  in  the  past  12  months  have  been 
extremely  satisfying  and  a  credit  to  the  Silver  Lake  team.  The  strategy  to  focus  on 
increasing  cash  flow  from  our  core  Mount  Monger  Operation  to  both  strengthen  our 
balance  sheet  and  self-fund  future  projects  has  delivered  tangible  success  and 
significant returns for our shareholders in FY2016.
“We intend to maintain our operational discipline in FY2017 with a strong focus on cash 
margins at a time of significant strength in the Australian Dollar gold price. This will 
enable us to make further significant investments in exploration over the next 12 months 
to bring more low cost ounces into our development pipeline, as we did in FY2016 and 
continue to deliver strong returns for all our shareholders.”

Summarised Financial Results 
 
The  Group  recorded  revenue  for  the  year  of  $209.5  million  (2015:  $186.0  million)  and 
generated operating cash flow of $55.0 million (2015: $32.7 million). 
 
Profit after tax for the year was $4.4 million compared with a $94.0 million loss in 2015. 
EBITDA (before significant items)1 increased by 49% to $56.7 million (2015: $38.0 million) 
with the increase attributable to:
•
•
•
an 8% increase in gold production from the Mount Monger Operation primarily due 
to an increase in open pit production following commencement of the Lucky Bay 
and  Santa  Area  open  pit  mines 
in  FY2016  which  together  contributed  
54,907 ounces of gold in the period. Production from these mines replaced lower 
grade  stockpiles  milled  in  FY2015,  resulting  in  a  6%  increase  in  recovered  head 
grade (3.5 g/t compared with 3.3 g/t);   
a  6%  increase  in  the  average  realised  gold  price  (A$1,580/oz  compared  with 
A$1,497/oz);  
a 4% decrease in the all in sustaining cost (A$1,281/oz compared with A$1,331/oz). 
This was primarily as a result of introduction of ore from the Lucky Bay and Santa 
Area open pits replacing lower grade stockpiled ore in the mill feed.
The strategy of focusing production and exploration activity on the Company’s core Mount 
Monger Operation, together with a strong gold price and reducing cost base resulted in a 
68% increase in operating cash flows of $55.0 million (2015: $32.7 million).  
The settlement of $3.4 million of non-core asset sales during the year also contributed to 
an increased cash and bullion balance at year-end of $42.6 million (2015: $29.0 million). 
The increase in cash flow generation from Mount Monger allowed the Company to fund:
the FY2016 exploration program of $15.0 million; 
all bank debt repayments of $6.7 million; and
• 
• 
•  development expenditure relating to the Imperial/Majestic and Maxwells projects
totalling $5.9 million. 
 
Outlook 
 
The Group’s short to medium term strategy is to maximise cash flow and increase operating 
margins from the Mount Monger Operation. This will be achieved by:
relentless drive to reduce costs and increase productivity;  
introduction of new, lower cost ore sources into the production schedule, including 
the Imperial/Majestic open pits and the Maxwells underground in FY2017;
•  executing  the  exploration  strategy  by  directing  expenditure  to  highly  prospective
priority targets in the Mount Monger area; and  
continue to crystalise value from non-core assets.
The strong cash position will continue to fund the development of the Imperial/Majestic 
and Maxwells projects which combined are forecast to have a maximum cash drawdown of 
≈$15 million. This drawdown will result in a decreasing cash balance over the remainder 
of the 2016 calendar  year, after  which both projects commence generating strong cash 
flows.

Sales  guidance  for  FY2017  gold  sales  is  135,000  to  145,000  oz.  The  Randalls  processing 
facility has capacity of 1.2mtpa and in FY2017 will be predominantly fed with ore sourced 
from  the  Daisy  Complex,  Cock-eyed  Bob  and  Maxwells  underground  mines  and  the 
Imperial/Majestic & Santa Area open pit mines. Surface stockpiles from Santa are expected 
to contribute approximately 25% of the mill feed in the first quarter of the year prior to 
the ramp up of Imperial/Majestic and Maxwells in the second quarter. 
 
The  success  of  the  FY2016  exploration  program  has  warranted  Board  approval  of  a  $14 
million exploration budget for FY2017. Exploration will focus on highly prospective, gold 
targets at Mount Monger, proximate to existing mine and processing infrastructure. Of the 
FY2017 budget, 35% will be directed to resource definition to sustain current operations 
and is concentrated at Daisy Complex, Cock-eyed Bob and Maxwells. The remaining 65% 
will be directed to multiple growth exploration targets in the Mount Belches BIF units, Salt 
Creek area and structural corridor to the north and west of Daisy Complex.
