<p><b>  Mission to Malta : comments by the State on the report of the 
Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
</b></p>
<p><b>  The following document represents the views and comments of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government of Malta in respect of the Report of the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, drafted following a 
</b></p>
<p><b>country visit to the Malta from 6-10 December 2014. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  National institutions and policies- (page 7): 
</b></p>
<p>&#61472; &#61472; The Ministry for Education and Employment is responsible for all issues relating to labour 
</p>
<p>market issues and migrants. It also implements policy which allows for certain categories of 
</p>
<p>migrants to apply for an exemption from the payment of tuition fees in state educational 
</p>
<p>institutions.- No comments  
</p>
<p><b>  B. Labour exploitation- (Page 18): 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur received information about the exploitation of irregular 
</p>
<p>migrants, asylum seekers and refugees, by employers in Malta, as they refrain from 
</p>
<p>protesting and mobilising due to their fear of being detected, detained and deported. 
</p>
<p>Migrant workers in an irregular situation are made to work long hours and paid 
</p>
<p>wages that are below the minimum wage in Malta, often in the construction, tourism 
</p>
<p>and care-giving industries. They have to pay taxes but do not all share the same 
</p>
<p>rights as citizens. For example, employers give migrants low wages and do not 
</p>
<p>provide them with safety equipment or insurance.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur learnt that government contractors and sub-constructors are 
</p>
<p>prohibited from exploiting workers, including migrants. Those found exploiting 
</p>
<p>workers are blacklisted and cannot get a government contract for three years. 
</p>
<p>However, the Special Rapporteur observed that sanctions against employers are very 
</p>
<p>rare and the EU Employer Sanction Directive remains unimplemented in Malta, as is 
</p>
<p>the case throughout Europe.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; There are currently twenty labour inspectors who work together with the Migration 
</p>
<p>police. Although labour inspectors are not empowered to check immigration papers, 
</p>
<p>it is not clear whether they conduct operations with the immigration police: this 
</p>
<p>would be a very bad practice, as it would not provide incentives for migrants to call 
</p>
<p>labour inspectors or health and safety inspectors when work conditions are unsafe or 
</p>
<p>in violation of labour laws. There is a need for firewalls between public service and 
</p>
<p>immigration enforcement, so that labour inspections can be carried out without 
</p>
<p>having to divulge anyone&#8217;s immigration status.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Migrant workers are workers, whatever their immigration status, and should be 
</p>
<p>treated equally under labour laws. Furthermore, it is important that Malta 
</p>
<p>acknowledges that it has jobs for which it needs migrant workers, including low-
</p>
<p>wage migrants, and thus open legal channels for migrants of all skill levels to come 
</p>
<p>to Malta.  
</p>
<p><b>  Feedback:  
</b></p>
<p>As an EU Member State, Malta has accepted the freedom of movement rights of EU 
</p>
<p>nationals and their family members/dependents but reserves the right to demand a transitory 
</p>
<p>period for new countries acceding the EU. Malta also abides by any agreements entered 
</p>
<p>into by the European Commission and non-EU Member States concerning freedom of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>movement. EU citizens and citizens agreed by such agreements take precedence over 
</p>
<p>nationals of other countries in taking up employment in Malta. Irregular migrants enjoying 
</p>
<p>subsidiary protection status issued by the Refugee Commissioner in Malta are given 
</p>
<p>immediate rights to work in Malta. Other third country nationals have to go through the 
</p>
<p>security and labour market test channels in order to qualify for the right to work in Malta. 
</p>
<p>The demand by employers for low skilled and low paid individuals should not require the 
</p>
<p>Government of Malta to open the legal channels, as this may give rise to non-adherence to 
</p>
<p>legal framework concerning minimum conditions of employment. Moreover, the 
</p>
<p>Government has a declared policy of steering the Maltese economy towards high-value 
</p>
<p>added services requiring highly qualified and skilled personnel.  
</p>
<p><b>  Furthermore, the report proposes the following recommendations:  
</b></p>
<p>Fully implement its legislation to combat direct or indirect racial discrimination with regard 
</p>
<p>to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by immigrants, in particular 
</p>
<p>refugees and asylum-seekers, including access to private rental housing and the labour 
</p>
<p>market. (page 22) .- No comments
