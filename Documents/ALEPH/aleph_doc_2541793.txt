EXPLANATORY NOTE
Texas Rare Earth Resources Corp. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or “TRER” ) is filing this
Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A (this “Amendment”) to amend our Annual Report on Form 10-
K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014 (the “Form 10-K”), as originally filed with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 12, 2014.  The purpose
of this Amendment is to include Part III information which was to be incorporated by reference
from our definitive proxy statement for our 2015 Annual General Meeting of Stockholders.  This
information was previously omitted from the 10-K in reliance on General Instruction G(3) to Form
10-K, which permits the Part III information to be incorporated in our Form 10-K by reference from
our definitive proxy statement if such statement is filed no later than 120 days after our fiscal year-
end.  We are filing this Amendment to include Part III information in our Form 10-K because a
definitive proxy statement containing such information will not be filed by the Company within
120 days after the end of the fiscal year covered by our Form 10-K.  The reference on the cover to
the Form 10-K to the incorporation by reference to portions of our definitive proxy statement into
Part III of the Form 10-K is hereby deleted.  This Amendment hereby amends and restates the
cover page and Part III, Items 10 through 14 in their entirety.
In accordance with Rule 12b-15 under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended  (the  “Exchange  Act”),  Part  III,  Items  10  through  14  of  our  Form  10-K  are  hereby
amended and restated in their entirety.  In addition, new certifications of our principal executive
officer  and  principal  financial  officer  are  attached,  each  as  of  the  filing  date  of  this
Amendment.  This Amendment does not amend or otherwise update any other information in our
10-K.  Accordingly, this Amendment should be read in conjunction with our Form 10-K and with
our filings with the SEC subsequent to our Form 10-K.

stock  (“10%  Stockholders”),  to  file  reports  of  ownership  and  changes  in  ownership  with  the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Such officers, directors and 10% Stockholders
are also required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms that they file.
 
Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by us, or written representations
from certain reporting persons, the Company believes that during fiscal year ended August 31,
2014, except as set forth below, the filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors and
greater than 10% percent beneficial owners were complied with.

 (1)On December 8, 2013, our Board approved and granted 60,000 options Mr. Gorski. These
options  were  originally  exercisable  at  $0.50  per  share  for  a  period  of  ten  years,  vesting
immediately and at a fair value of $30,000 using the Black-Sholes pricing model. On March 3,
2014, our Board approved the repricing of these 60,000 options to $0.45.  With respect to the
repricing  of  these  options,  the  Black-Scholes  pricing  model  was  used  to  estimate  the  fair
value  of  the  60,000  options,  using  the  assumptions  of  a  risk  free  interest  rate  of  0.39%,  a
dividend yield of 0%, volatility of 290% and an expected life of 9.75 years. The options were
expensed in full during the third quarter 2014 in the amount of approximately $26,400.

Executive Compensation Agreements and Summary of Executive Compensation
 
Report on Executive Compensation
 
During  the  year  ended  August  31,  2014,  the  Board  and  the  Company’s  Compensation
Committee,  was  responsible  for  establishing  a  compensation  policy  and  administering  the
compensation programs of the Company’s executive officers.
 
Salary
 
The amount of compensation paid by the Company to each of the Company’s officers and the
terms  of  those  persons’  employment  is  determined  by  the  Compensation  Committee.  The
Compensation  Committee  evaluates  past  performance  and  considers  future  incentive  and
retention in considering the appropriate compensation for the Company’s officers.  The Company
believes  that  the  compensation  paid  to  the  Company’s  directors  and  officers  is  fair  to  the
Company.
 
Stock Incentive Awards
 
The Compensation Committee believes that the use of direct stock awards is at times appropriate
for employees, and in the future intends to use direct stock awards to reward outstanding service
or  to  attract  and  retain  individuals  with  exceptional  talent  and  credentials.  The  use  of  stock
options and other awards is intended to strengthen the alignment of interests of executive officers
and other key employees with those of our stockholders.
 
In this regard, during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014, Compensation Committee and the
Board did not authorize the issuance of stock option awards to named executive officers.
Executive Compensation Agreements
 
Agreement with Mr. Gorski
 
In May 2011, the Company entered into an at will employment arrangement with Dan Gorski, the
Company’s  chief  operating  officer,  pursuant  to  which  he  will  be  paid  an  annual  salary  of
$110,000. On December 31, 2011, Mr. Gorski resigned as the Company’s chief operating officer.
On August 16, 2012, the Company agreed to pay Mr. Daniel Gorski, in the amount of $120,000
annually in connection with his appointment as Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  The
Company  and  Mr.  Gorski  have  not  entered  into  a  formal  written  employment  agreement  in
relation to Mr. Gorski’s compensation and employment terms as Chief Executive Officer.
Agreement with Mr. McDonald
On June 5, 2013, the Company entered into a consulting agreement, effective May 1, 2013, with
G.W. “Mike” McDonald. The consulting agreement provides for a monthly retainer in the amount
of  $2,000.    In  addition  to  the  retainer,  the  Company  agreed  to  reimburse  Mr.  McDonald  for
reasonable  expenses  incurred  by  Mr.  McDonald  in  performance  of  his  duties  under  the
consulting agreement   The consulting agreement is for an initial term of one year but may be

Compensation of Directors
 
The  Company  has  agreed  to  pay  its  directors  $10,000  annually,  $1,000  for  in  person  board
meetings, $500 for telephonic board meetings and $500 for committee meetings (both in person
and telephonic).  Independent directors will be offered the option to elect to receive any cash
compensation  as  restricted  stock  at  a  20%  discount  to  the  closing  price  on  the  date  of
grant.  Each of our directors are reimbursed reasonable out of pocket expenses associated with
attending our board meetings.
On  October  1,  2013,  we  appointed  Mr.  Jack  Lifton  to  serve  as  a  member  of  our  Board.  In
connection with the appointment of Mr. Jack Lifton to our Board on October 1, 2013, Mr. Lifton
was granted 100,000 options to purchase shares of our common stock, vesting immediately with
a term of 5 years and at an exercise price of $0.50. With respect to these options, the Black-
Scholes pricing model was used to estimate the fair value of the 100,000 options issued during
the period to this director, using the assumptions of a risk free interest rate of 1.10%, dividend
yield of 0%, volatility of 302%, and an expected life of 5 years. These options were immediately
expensed  during  the  current  period  in  the  amount  of  approximately  $47,000.  In  addition,  Mr.
Lifton,  as  a  non-executive  director,  will  receive  $10,000  annually,  $1,000  for  in  person  board
meetings, $500 for telephonic board meetings and $500 for committee meetings (both in person
and telephonic) pursuant to our director compensation program.
On  December  8,  2013,  our  Board  approved  and  granted  240,000  options  to  Mr.  Marchese,
160,000 options to Dr. Pingitore, and 60,000 options each to Mr. Gorski, Dr. Wolfe, Mr. Lifton, Dr.
Goodell, Ms. Lynch and Mr. Wall.  All options to these members are exercisable at $0.50 per
share for a period of ten years, vesting immediately. With respect to these options, the Black-
Scholes pricing model was used to estimate the fair value of the 760,000 options issued during
the period to these directors, using the assumptions of a risk free interest rate of 2.88%, dividend
yield of 0%, volatility of 297%, and an expected life of 10 years. These options were expensed
during  the  quarter  ending  February  28,  2014.  Total  value  expensed  was  approximately
$380,000.
On March 3, 2014, our Board approved the repricing of all outstanding Board options for active
directors to $0.45.  A total of 3.185 million Directors’ options that were outstanding as of March 3,
2014.  With respect to these options, the Black-Scholes pricing model was used to estimate the
fair value of the 3.185 million options outstanding on March 3, 2014, using the assumptions of a
risk free interest rate from 0.39% to 2.6%, a dividend yield of 0%, volatility of 158%, to 883% and
an expected life of 2 to 9.75 years. The options will be expensed in full during the third quarter
2014 in the amount of approximately $43,000.

adopted an amendment to our 2008 Plan (the “Amended 2008 Plan”), which was also approved
by our shareholders in August 2011. The Amended 2008 Plan increased the number of shares
available for grant from 2,000,000 to up to 5,000,000 shares of our common stock for awards to
our  officers,  directors,  employees  and  consultants.    On  February  15,  2012,  our  stockholders
approved an increase of 2,000,000 of shares of common stock available for issuance under the
amended 2008 Stock Option Plan (the “Plan”).  As amended, the Plan provides for 7,000,000
shares of common stock for all awards.  Other provisions of the Amended 2008 Plan remain the

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR
INDEPENDENCE
 
During  the  fiscal  year  ended  August  31,  2014  we  had  no  reportable  transactions  with  related
parties, including named security holders.
 
Except  as  indicated  herein,  no  officer,  director,  promoter,  or  affiliate  of  the  Company  has  or
proposes to have any direct or indirect material interest in any asset acquired or proposed to be
acquired by the Company through security holdings, contracts, options, or otherwise.  
 
Policy for Review of Related Party Transactions
 
The Company has a policy for the review of transactions with related persons as set forth in the
Company’s Audit Committee Charter and internal practices. The policy requires review, approval
or ratification of all transactions in which the Company is a participant and in which any of the
Company's directors, executive officers, significant stockholders or an immediate family member
of  any  of  the  foregoing  persons  has  a  direct  or  indirect  material  interest,  subject  to  certain
categories  of  transactions  that  are  deemed  to  be  pre-approved  under  the  policy  -  including
employment of executive officers, director compensation (in general, where such transactions are
required  to  be  reported  in  the  Company's  proxy  statement  pursuant  to  SEC  compensation
disclosure  requirements),  as  well  as  certain  transactions  where  the  amounts  involved  do  not
exceed specified thresholds.  All related party transactions must be reported for review by the
Audit Committee pursuant to the Audit Committee’s charter and the rules of the NYSE MKT.
Following its review, the Audit Committee determines whether these transactions are in, or not
inconsistent  with,  the  best  interests  of  the  Company  and  its  stockholders,  taking  into
consideration whether they are on terms no less favorable to the Company than those available
with other parties and the related person's interest in the transaction. If a related party transaction
is to be ongoing, the Audit Committee may establish guidelines for the Company's management
to follow in its ongoing dealings with the related person.
 
9
Our policy for review of transactions with related persons was followed in all of the transactions
set forth above and all such transactions were reviewed and approved in accordance with our
policy for review of transactions with related persons.

Policy on Pre-Approval by Audit Committee of Services Performed by Independent Auditors
 
The  Audit  Committee  has  adopted  procedures  requiring  the  Audit  Committee  to  review  and
approve  in  advance,  all  particular  engagements  for  services  provided  by  the  Company’s
independent auditor. Consistent with applicable laws, the procedures permit limited amounts of
services, other than audit, review or attest services, to be approved by one or more members of
the Audit Committee pursuant to authority delegated by the Audit Committee, provided the Audit
Committee is informed of each particular service. All of the engagements and fees for 2014 were
pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews with LBB & Associates Ltd.,
LLP whether the non-audit services to be provided are compatible with maintaining the auditor's
independence.
