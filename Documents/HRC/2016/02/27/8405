<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the situation of human rights in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report provides an update on the human rights situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
since the last report presented by the High Commissioner to the sixteenth session of the 
Human Rights Council (A/HRC/16/79) and covers events from 1 February to 30 May 2011. 
The report is submitted pursuant to resolution 16/25 of the Human Rights Council 
requesting the High Commissioner to present a report on the situation of human rights in 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire at its seventeenth session.  
</p>
<p> Although direct attacks against civilians by the security forces have abated 
somewhat since the arrest of former president Laurent Gbagbo on 11 April 2011, the 
human rights situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire remains precarious, with a pattern of human rights 
violations, including summary executions, excessive use of force, enforced disappearances, 
rape, torture, cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, arbitrary arrests and detentions, and 
looting. In addition, the health, agriculture and education sectors and the economy as a 
whole were severely affected by the post-electoral crisis, leading to the deterioration of the 
humanitarian situation. 
</p>
<p> The western part of the country, where some of the worst human rights violations 
and destruction took place, has been of particular concern. The political stalemate brought 
to the surface past grievances which contributed towards inter-community conflicts 
between the pro-Gbagbo ethnic groups in the region and settler communities, including 
Ivorians from the north and immigrants from neighbouring countries. In addition, the 
armed confrontations between the Forces Nouvelles and the security forces loyal to Mr. 
Gbagbo escalated as the pro-Ouattara forces moved towards Abidjan and resulted in a 
major humanitarian crisis with serious human rights implications. Given the resulting 
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission. 
</p>

<p>insecurity and recent violence, as well as the fear of reprisals, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire could face a 
continued displacement situation.  
</p>
<p> On 17 March, President Ouattara signed a decree creating a new army, the Forces 
R&#233;publicaines de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (FRCI), which merged the Forces Nouvelles (FN) and the 
Forces de D&#233;fense et de S&#233;curit&#233; (FDS). While the presence of the FRCI has to some 
degree contributed to the stabilization of the security situation, there is still a security 
vacuum due to the fact that many members of the police and the gendarmerie had 
abandoned their posts in a number of areas in the west and in Abidjan and many police 
stations were looted and destroyed. Moreover, the arrival of the FRCI in most areas in the 
west and south has also coincided with acts of looting, extortion, confiscation of private 
property, arbitrary arrest and detention as well as summary executions, all implicating 
members of the FRCI. 
</p>
<p> The ongoing processes, both nationally and internationally, to address the issue of 
impunity, will be essential in ensuring justice and reconciliation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. The 
Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission announced by President Ouattara since his 
campaign may play a significant role in this regard.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report provides an update on the human rights situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
since the last report presented by the High Commissioner to the sixteenth session of the 
Human Rights Council (A/HRC/16/79) and covers events from 1 February to 30 May 2011. 
The report is submitted pursuant to resolution 16/25 of the Human Rights Council 
requesting the High Commissioner to present a report on the situation of human rights in 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire at its seventeenth session.  
</p>
<p>2. During the reporting period, OHCHR remained actively engaged in the concerted 
efforts of the United Nations system to enhance the protection of civilians in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire.  
</p>
<p>3. The UNOCI human rights component established a 24-hour hotline through which 
violations could be reported. Since its inception in December 2010, the call centre has 
received more than 12,000 calls, and, in a very restricted security environment, has proven 
to be an essential tool for the collection of information, and a vital link to civilian 
populations. The hotline enabled the human rights component to identify hot spots and 
sensitive zones and, in certain cases, to seek to prevent violations through the immediate 
dispatch of military and police patrols.  
</p>
<p>4. As part of the United Nations coordinated response, OHCHR conducted a mission to 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire from 2 to 9 April, led by Assistant Secretary-General Ivan &#352;imonovi&#263;. The 
mission assessed the human rights situation in the country and reminded all parties of their 
obligation to respect international human rights and humanitarian law, and of the 
importance of bringing perpetrators to justice as a prerequisite for sustainable peace. The 
Assistant Secretary General had the opportunity to meet with President Alassane Ouattara, 
the Minister of Justice and Human Rights, Jeannot Haoussou, and the Minister of Health, 
Alain Kouadio. Mr. &#352;imonovi&#263; also spoke with Alcide Dj&#233;dj&#233;, who had been designated by 
Mr. Gbagbo as his &#8220;Minister of Foreign Affairs.&#8221; On 4 and 5 April, Mr. &#352;imonovi&#263;, 
together with the Emergency Relief Coordinator, Valerie Amos, visited the towns of 
Du&#233;kou&#233; and Man in the south-west of the country, where there had been serious 
allegations of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>5. On 13 April, in New York, the High Commissioner participated in the Security 
Council consultations on the situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. She stressed that, in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
there is a history of human rights violations without any accountability or redress, including 
discrimination. Emphasis was placed on the fact that reconciliation will not be 
accomplished without meaningful accountability, which has been lacking in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
over the past decade. She also recalled that in 2004, an International Commission of Inquiry 
established by the Secretary-General identified alleged perpetrators and recommended 
accountability mechanisms, which, to date, have not been implemented.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>6. The period leading up to 11 April was marked by a serious escalation of violence 
and a deterioration of the human rights situation, which remains of serious concern. On 28 
March, the FRCI launched a military offensive and advanced rapidly towards the southern 
part of the country from both the eastern and western fronts, prompting pro-Gbagbo 
elements of the former Forces de d&#233;fense et de s&#233;curit&#233; (FDS), including the police and 
gendarmerie, to flee in significant numbers, with some joining the ranks of the FRCI or 
surrendering, while others chose to fight to the end.   
</p>
<p>7. On 11 April, former President Gbagbo, his wife and some members of his family 
and staff were captured while many leaders of the security forces loyal to him surrendered </p>


<p>to the Government and pledged allegiance to President Ouattara. A significant number of 
Republican Guard soldiers melted into the population with their weapons, including heavy 
weapons, while militia elements, mercenaries and other pro-Gbagbo elements retreated to 
the Yopougon neighbourhood of Abidjan, where they held out and targeted the civilian 
population. The militias and mercenaries were finally dislodged on 4 May, following which 
they retreated to western C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, where they continued the pattern of targeting the 
civilian population.  
</p>
<p>8. The reporting period also saw infighting linked to disputes over power and 
responsibilities between the so-called &#8220;Commando Invisible&#8221;, an anti-Gbagbo armed group, 
and other pro-Ouattara forces. On 27 April, Ibrahim Coulibaly, Commander of the 
&#8220;Commando Invisible&#8221; was killed, reportedly during the fighting between elements of the 
&#8220;Commando Invisible&#8221; and the FRCI. He was considered to be one of the founders of the 
rebellion in C&#244;te d'Ivoire. His family has reportedly requested an autopsy to confirm the 
exact circumstances surrounding his death. 
</p>
<p>9. The post-electoral crisis led to a serious deterioration of the socio-economic 
situation, partly due to the heavy fighting that paralyzed Abidjan for many days, forcing the 
population to stay at home with little food, water and medicine or to leave the city and find 
refuge in the countryside. This was exacerbated by the closure of some major banks after 
security forces stormed and occupied the offices of the Central Bank of West African States 
in Abidjan. The increase in prices of basic commodities and the civil disobedience 
campaign called for by the Rassemblement des houphou&#235;tistes pour la d&#233;mocratie et la paix 
(RHDP) and widely respected by major transporters limited supplies as well as the ability 
of a segment of the population to purchase foodstuffs. Education and health services were 
severely affected, with classes suspended in most areas in the north and regularly disrupted 
in some parts of the west because of clashes between rival student unions.  
</p>
<p>10. President Ouattara has announced the creation of a Dialogue, Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission and appointed Charles Konan Banny, a former Prime Minister, 
as chairperson of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Some concerns have 
been expressed about the lack of consultation and the attempt to jump-start the process 
through swift appointment of the commissioners without clear terms of reference or a legal 
framework for the operation of the Commission. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Deterioration of the human rights situation  
</b></p>
<p>11. The human rights situation deteriorated considerably in the period leading to the 
arrest of Mr. Gbagbo. There have been reports of excessive and indiscriminate use of force 
against civilians, extrajudicial and summary executions, enforced disappearances, torture, 
arbitrary arrest and detention, extortion, and sexual and gender-based violence, which have 
been investigated by the Human Rights division of UNOCI. The most important findings 
are presented in this report. 
</p>
<p><b> A. The shooting deaths of seven women in Abobo 
</b></p>
<p>12. A typical example of the escalation of the human rights situation is the killing on 3 
March of seven women in Abobo. Witnesses described how on 3 March, more than 3,000 
women gathered at the Abobo Anador roundabout to start a demonstration with the 
intention of marching towards the railway station in order to demand the departure of 
President Laurent Gbagbo. In a peaceful and festive mood and as they waited to commence 
their procession, the women were singing, dancing and waving placards, among them, one 
calling on President Gbagbo to step down. According to reports, elements of the FDS, on </p>


<p>board three 4x4 vehicles and two armoured vehicles, including one belonging to the 
Brigade anti-&#233;meute (BAE) arrived at the scene and, without warning, indiscriminately 
opened fire on the crowd, killing six women on the spot, while the seventh died on the way 
to hospital and several others were wounded.   
</p>
<p>13. The Human Rights Division of UNOCI was able to establish that the women&#8217;s 
demonstration in Abobo was peaceful, making the use of force, in particular lethal force, by 
the elements of the FDS who opened fire without warning a serious violation of the human 
rights to life and freedom of expression and assembly. The team met with the medical 
personnel of Abobo-Sud clinic, where most of the victims received treatment, but could not 
visit the hospital itself due to a refusal by the medical authorities, citing security reasons. 
Video footage of the incident with shocking details on the course of the event was made 
available by a witness and later also posted on the Internet. 
</p>
<p>14. Even though the Gbagbo camp denied the involvement of FDS elements in the 
incident, the investigations confirmed that they were present in the area and had in fact shot 
at the peaceful demonstration. As with previous incidents, no concrete steps were taken by 
the Gbagbo camp to identify and hold the perpetrators accountable. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The shelling of densely populated areas 
</b></p>
<p>15. The period before 11 April was also marked by the indiscriminate shelling of 
densely populated districts of Abidjan such as Abobo, which is considered to be the 
stronghold of President Ouattara. On 11 March 2011, three children, aged 12, 6 and 2 
respectively, were killed by FDS shells during the fighting. Evidence collected in situ 
indicates that the FDS used heavy weapons, including rockets and mortars, to attack the 
&#8220;Commando Invisible&#8221; of armed elements supporting President Ouattara, in the Abobo 
area. On 15 March, the security situation in Abidjan further deteriorated. Sustained gun and 
heavy artillery fire were heard in several neighbourhoods in Abidjan during what were 
believed to be clashes between the elements of the FDS backed by militias and the 
&#8220;Commando Invisible&#8221;<i>, </i>on the one hand, and between FDS elements and supporters of 
RHDP on the other. Preliminary investigation indicated that at least five civilians were 
killed and 40 others wounded during these clashes. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>16. There was also a report of the shelling, on 17 March, of a densely populated area of 
Abobo, including a number of private houses and the local market. This attack resulted in 
the killing of more than 25 civilians with more than 40 wounded. Shelling impacts were 
visible throughout the market and at least three houses were destroyed by the shells in the 
area of SOS village d&#8217;enfants, killing one person who was asleep at the time of the incident. 
The fragments of the shells collected on the scene enabled UNOCI to establish that 81-mm 
mortar shells were used. A crater analysis of the impact of the shells followed by 
concurring statements by witnesses indicated that the shells were fired from Camp 
Commando, an FDS base located just north of the SOS Village d&#8217;Enfants.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Allegations of mass graves  
</b></p>
<p>17. On 14 and 16 March, Human Rights Officers finally gained access to the alleged 
sites in N&#8217;dotr&#233; to investigate the allegations of mass graves after two previous attempts, on 
20 and 28 December, had been impeded by pro-Gbagbo forces.1 The investigating team did 
not find any evidence or traces supporting the allegations. However, the team was informed 
</p>
<p>  
 1 As of 14 March, the area was under the control of the Commando Invisible. </p>


<p>of the presence of at least 250 bullet-ridden corpses in the morgue in Anyama (close to 
N&#8217;dotr&#233;), with the majority brought in during November and December, which coincides 
with the period when the first allegations of the presence of mass graves were brought to 
the attention of the Human Rights Division.  
</p>
<p>18.  The existence of mass graves was verified on 6 May in Yopougon, where the 
Human Rights Division found 10 sites in the Doukour&#233; district, located not far from the 
police station in the 6th arrondissement. Reliable sources, with further corroboration 
provided by the families of some of the victims and additional witnesses, indicated that 68 
bodies were buried in ten different places. Thirty-one and twenty-one bodies were buried at 
each of the two largest sites. The victims, all believed to be male, were reportedly killed by 
pro-Gbagbo militias and mercenaries on 12 April, following the capture of President 
Gbagbo. Sources interviewed by the Human Rights Division indicated that militiamen in 
plain clothes and armed with Kalashnikovs attacked houses in small groups and arrested 
people whom they subsequently summarily executed.  
</p>
<p><b> D. The attacks on the Anonkoua-Kout&#233; village  
</b></p>
<p>19. On 8 March, the Human Rights Division of UNOCI carried out a monitoring 
mission to Anonkoua-Kout&#233; village, Abobo, Abidjan, to investigate reports of an attack on 
the village by armed men, which resulted in at least 15 deaths, several wounded and the 
destruction of property. While the mission could not directly confirm the numbers of 
deaths, it observed that the village had been captured and was now under the control of 
elements of the &#8220;Commando invisible&#8221;, dressed in civilian attire and armed with knives, 
rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. They appeared disciplined and organized, operating 
under a visible chain of command and giving military salutes. The apparent leader of the 
group explained that, following the call of Mr. Gbagbo&#8217;s &#8220;Minister for Youth&#8221; and leader 
of the Jeunes Patriotes, Charles Bl&#233; Goud&#233;, to his militias on 28 February to erect 
roadblocks throughout Abidjan, and monitor the movement of all vehicles, Mr. Bl&#233; 
Goud&#233;&#8217;s ethnic Ebri&#233; supporters responded by setting up roadblocks, attacking ethnic 
Dioula civilians, and denouncing them to the FDS. He stated that, on 5 March, his group 
had intervened to protect the Dioula population from the Ebri&#233;s<i>. </i>   
</p>
<p>20. The mission found that all members of the Ebri&#233; Community had fled the village. 
There were only four elderly sick persons, three men and one woman, who had been left 
behind by their families. Information obtained indicates that the village was violently 
attacked by the members of the Commando Invisible, causing the arbitrary mass 
displacement of about 5,330 villagers. As a result of the attack on the Ebri&#233; ethnic group in 
Anonkoi-Kout&#233;, the youth of the Ebri&#233; village of Blockhauss in Cocody, Abidjan, retaliated 
on 9 March against West African nationals, mainly from Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal, 
by burning down their homes, shops and a local mosque, prompting the population to flee 
the area.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Violations of human rights and international humanitarian 
law in the west </b></p>
<p>21. The human rights situation in the west became a major concern during March and 
April after a pattern of human rights violations and abuses was noted, particularly in 
Du&#233;kou&#233;, Blol&#233;quin, Toul&#233;pleu and Zouan Hounien. The violations reached a climax upon 
the arrival of elements of the FRCI in these areas in March as they marched south towards 
Abidjan. Attacks and counter-attacks by Ivorian and immigrant communities, aided by 
well-constituted militia groups and mercenaries, occasioned a massive loss of lives and 
property with severe humanitarian consequences, in particular for women, children and the </p>


<p>elderly. The subsequent confrontations between FRCI and pro-Gbagbo forces led to mass 
killings and destruction of property.   
</p>
<p>22. In April 2011, a UNOCI investigative mission was deployed to the west for more 
than a month and conducted an exhaustive investigation in the regions of Moyen Cavally 
and Dix-huit Montagnes. The team was able to establish that, from 1 December 2010 to 24 
April 2011, grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law occurred in 
the west of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. The violations &#8211; which include summary executions, enforced 
disappearances, rape, torture, cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, arbitrary arrests and 
detentions, arson, pillaging and looting &#8211; were committed in the Moyen Cavally and Dix-
huit Montagnes regions by both pro-Gbagbo (FDS elements, Young Patriots, Liberian 
mercenaries and Gu&#233;r&#233; vigilante groups) and pro-Ouattara forces (FRCI elements and 
dozos (traditional hunters)).   
</p>
<p>23. The mission found that at least<b> </b>1,012 people, including 103 women and 42 children, 
were killed in the two regions and 46 rape cases, including pregnant women and two 
minors, were documented in connection with the crisis, recurrent intercommunity clashes 
and violent confrontations between FDS elements aided by militiamen and mercenaries and 
FRCI and Dozo combatants. Of the 1,012, 944 were killed in the Moyen Cavally region and 
68 in the Dix-huit Montagnes region. It should be noted that 505 were killed in Du&#233;kou&#233; 
alone. Of the total number of deaths, 341 were Guer&#233;, 159 from Burkina Faso, 100 
Malink&#233;, 68 Malian, 30 Baoul&#233;, 32 Yacouba, 6 Guinean, 5 Beninese, 3 Liberian, 1 
Senegalese and 1 Ghanaian. At least another 586 persons were wounded by bullets or 
machetes and received medical assistance from the United Nations Population Fund, the 
World Health Organization and M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res Belgium. Large-scale looting, 
pillaging and arson were also observed in both regions. Hospitals, clinics and granaries 
were looted in many localities and villages.  
</p>
<p>24. The mission also concluded that many people died from hunger, malnutrition and 
illness or by drowning while crossing the Liberian border in an attempt to seek refuge in a 
safe area. The fighting and subsequent looting and burning of property resulted in a grave 
humanitarian crisis. There is, as a result, massive internal and cross-border displacement of 
the population. Living conditions in IDP camps, notably at the Catholic Mission in 
Du&#233;kou&#233;, where at least 27,500 people sought refuge, remain deplorable. During the 
reporting period, at least 40 people died at the Catholic mission owing to poor sanitary and 
hygienic conditions.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Human rights violations in Grand Lahou, Dabou and Irobo 
</b></p>
<p>25. There have been reports of human rights violations, including extrajudicial and 
summary executions and destruction of properties, committed by more than 200 retreating 
militiamen and Liberian mercenaries in Dabou, Irobo and Grand-Lahou, cities along the 
coastline west of Abidjan. On 4 May, at least 55 people were killed by militias and Liberian 
mercenaries heading towards the border with Liberia after being defeated in Yopougon, on 
3 May, by the FRCI. Witnesses reported that the dead were mostly civilians and a number 
of FRCI elements as well as Colonel Ahouma Brouha Nathana&#235;l, whose convoy was 
ambushed by the militias and mercenaries at Grand Lahou. There were also several 
accounts of destruction of properties, including houses and shops belonging to persons 
perceived to be Ouattara supporters.   
</p>
<p>26. The presence of militiamen and mercenaries in remote areas or in neighbouring 
Liberia continues to threaten peace and stability in the country and to jeopardize any 
attempts towards sustained social cohesion and peaceful cohabitation between 
communities. On 9 May, a fact-finding mission was conducted in Dabou, Irobo and Grand-</p>


<p>Lahou to verify allegations of mass killings by Liberian mercenaries. The findings are that 
at least 17 civilians and 6 FRCI elements were killed in Irobo while 22 civilians and 4 FRCI 
members were killed in Grand Lahou. The 7 people killed in Dabou were 4 civilians and 3 
FRCI members.  
</p>
<p>27. There is a fear that, if not controlled, disarmed and reintegrated into their areas 
and/or countries of origin, the retreating militias and mercenaries who were dislodged from 
the suburbs of Yopougon and Abobo by FRCI forces could continue a campaign to target 
and kill civilians indiscriminately. Those armed groups could also threaten regional 
stability by offering their services to other fighting forces in neighbouring countries. This is 
raising security concerns specifically for Liberia, which is still recovering from a legacy of 
armed conflicts and will have elections in 2011. Liberia and Ghana are bearing the brunt of 
the situation in C&#244;te d'Ivoire both in terms of refugee flow, transnational rebel movements 
and the proliferation of small arms.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Sexual and gender-based violence 
</b></p>
<p>28. While a number of cases of sexual and gender-based violence were reported during 
the reporting period, access to appropriate assistance for victims remained a major concern, 
especially during the conflict, when most clinics had either closed down or were seriously 
affected. Nonetheless, the relevant stakeholders continued to provide responses to 
individual cases that were brought to their attention. The Human Rights Division of 
UNOCI has documented the following cases, although it is extremely likely that many 
other cases went unreported.  
</p>
<p>29. On 7 February, unidentified armed men ambushed a bus in Fengolo (5km north of 
Du&#233;kou&#233;) and raped five women. On 27 February, in Seboni II (200km north of Bouak&#233;), 
members of the Forces Nouvelles allegedly raped a 23-year-old woman. On 19 March, in 
Williamsville, three young Malian girls were allegedly raped by members of a militia group 
that attacked their residence. On 3 May, in the Yopougon-Siporex neighbourhood, a 32-
year-old woman was raped by men believed to be members of the FRCI. The incident 
happened when she was found hiding in a college building. The victim told Human Rights 
Officers that her assailants, dressed in military uniforms and armed, accused her of assisting 
the militias. In one of the rape cases documented by the Human Rights Division, the assault 
resulted in the death of the victim. On 17 May, in the Petit Paris neighbourhood in 
Korhogo, a 17-year-old was gang-raped. She stated that she was seized at about 1.00 am by 
a group of six men who alleged they were a dozo (traditional hunters) vigilante group.  
</p>
<p>30. On the night of 22 May, two sisters aged seven were reportedly abducted while 
playing outside their home in the 220 Logements neighbourhood in Yamoussoukro. After a 
search mounted by their family and neighbours, one of them was found in a traumatized 
state near the &#201;cole Primaire Public Zaher while the body of the other was found in a 
nearby bush. Medical analysis revealed that the deceased child had been raped and 
physically assaulted before her death. A 27-year-old woman was raped by an unidentified 
armed man on the night of 1-2 May 2011 in the Zanzan neighbourhood in Bondoukou. All 
the victims received medical attention. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Internal displacement and refugees 
</b></p>
<p>31. The heightened level of insecurity combined with armed confrontations between 
security forces loyal to Mr. Gbagbo and the Forces Nouvelles/FRCI and Commando 
Invisible, as well as inter-community clashes in many parts of the west, resulted in a 
humanitarian crisis which led to a massive displacement of the population. As of 30 May </p>


<p>2011, at least 500,000 people remained internally displaced, with 13,504 in Abidjan and 
44,110 in the west (Danan&#233;, Du&#233;kou&#233; and Guiglo). More than 70 per cent of IDPs are 
staying with host families. Widespread damage to homes and infrastructures, the remaining 
insecurity and the inability of the State to provide basic social services such as health and 
education pose a challenge to the return process and C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire could face a protracted 
displacement situation. An estimated 187,266 Ivorians have sought refuge in neighbouring 
countries, particularly in Liberia. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> VIII. Attacks on religious leaders and places of worship 
</b></p>
<p>32. There were attacks against places of worship and religious leaders during the 
reporting period with attendant consequences on the human rights of the victims. On 13 
March, in Port Bouet II, Yopougon, the Imam of the local mosque was killed by elements 
of the FDS. On 15 March in Att&#233;coub&#233;, two persons were killed and at least 18, including a 
one-year-old child and four women, were wounded during a grenade attack by unidentified 
men at the Boribana mosque. On the night of 19 March, a local Muslim leader, the Imam of 
Williamsville, a Malian national, was killed in front of his mosque by elements of the FDS 
assisted by militias during a military operation in the Williamsville neighbourhood in 
Abidjan. His son was also reported to have been seriously wounded during the same 
incident.  
</p>
<p>33. Separately, on 17 April, a group of heavily armed members of the FRCI were 
reported to have raided the premises of the Jesuit Institute of Technology in Angr&#233;, 
Abidjan. During this raid, they were reported to have threatened and intimidated at least six 
priests including the Rector and physically assaulted one of them while ordering them to 
hand over the money in their possession and other valuables. The assailants also searched 
the property and confiscated seven computers and a number of mobile phones. One of the 
FRCI members was alleged to have stated that they were attacking the Institute in 
retaliation for attacks against mosques and also under the perception that the Catholic 
Church supported Mr. Gbagbo and that the Institute was being used to hide weapons. It 
should be noted that no single weapon was found. In May, elements of the FRCI also 
conducted an attack against the Baptist Church in Yopougon and arrested 56 people whom 
they detained in Gesco before releasing them following intervention by UNOCI.  
</p>
<p><b> IX. Incitement and violence against ECOWAS foreign nationals 
and UNOCI  
</b></p>
<p>34. Through the State-run media Radiodiffusion T&#233;l&#233;vision Ivoirienne (RTI), the 
Gbagbo camp systematically sent out messages with hate and xenophobic contents directed 
specifically towards UNOCI, pro-RHDP individuals and nationals of ECOWAS member 
States. The RTI regularly presented distorted information and pictures aimed at 
encouraging the public, particularly the Young Patriots, to attack UNOCI staff members. In 
addition, through meetings held in several neighbourhoods in Abidjan, as well as 
statements through the RTI, Mr. Bl&#233; Goud&#233;, the leader of the so-called Young Patriots, on 
numerous occasions ordered his membership to directly obstruct the work of UNOCI by all 
possible means, as illustrated by his announcement on 24 February through RTI. Prior to 
this call, Mr. Bl&#233; Goud&#233;, on 5 February, during a meeting at the place de la R&#233;publique in 
Abidjan, called on his members to attack the convoy of UNOCI military contingents.  
</p>
<p>35. Within the context of the post-electoral conflict, nationals of ECOWAS member 
States, in particular from Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria and Togo, were targeted by 
pro-Gbagbo groups with the support of the security forces. The Human Rights Division of </p>


<p>UNOCI documented an increasing number of cases of serious human rights violations 
against ECOWAS nationals, including summary executions, forced disappearances, 
arbitrary arrest and detention, as well as destruction of private property.  
</p>
<p>36. In February, the Young Patriots were increasingly involved in the killing of 
nationals from some West African States. In a recurrent pattern, they attacked Burkina Faso 
and Malian nationals, beat them and burnt them alive in the middle of streets. On 3 
February, in Bingerville, a Burkina Faso national was burnt alive by Young Patriots who 
accused him of being a &#8220;rebel&#8221;. Between 28 February and 5 March, they burnt to death 
three Malian nationals in the Yopougon neighbourhood in Abidjan. On 24 February in 
Lovigui&#233; (22 km from Agboville), a Burkina Faso community leader was attacked by a 
mob of villagers and burnt to death in retaliation for the death of one of their kin from the 
village, who was killed in the clashes in Abobo PK 18. This incident led to a massive 
exodus of Burkina Faso populations from the area.   
</p>
<p>37. On 21 March, the Human Rights Division interviewed a group of five Nigerians 
who on 20 March had fled from the Williamsville neighbourhood, Abidjan, due to 
continuous raids on their residence by armed civilians. According to one of them, a group 
of four hooded armed civilians broke into his house on 17 March at about midnight, 
physically assaulted him and stole the sum of 200,000 FCFA while threatening to kill him, 
citing as reason his nationality. In addition, they informed the Human Rights Division that 
at least three people, including two women, were killed on the night of 19-20 March in 
Williamsville during a similar raid. The Human Rights Division is investigating these 
cases. 
</p>
<p>38. On the basis of incitement through RTI, the Young Patriots attacked and obstructed 
the movement of UNOCI within Abidjan and some parts of the west. For instance, on 5 
February, a United Nations vehicle was attacked between PISAM, a local hospital in 
Cocody, and the UNOCI Headquarters by Young Patriots, while in several instances, the 
Young Patriots set up roadblocks to stop and search United Nations cars and intimidate 
staff. UNOCI convoys travelling to and from the regions were regularly subjected to 
numerous checks and controls while others were denied passage through roadblocks 
manned by pro-Gbagbo militia. 
</p>
<p>39. Despite a statement by the Security Council on 3 March, in which it condemned the 
threats, obstruction and acts of violence by Mr. Gbagbo&#8217;s forces against United Nations 
personnel, a mortar shell was launched on UNOCI Headquarters in the afternoon of the 31 
March, reportedly by pro-Gbagbo forces. No casualties were reported. On 2 April four 
United Nations peacekeepers were seriously injured by pro-Gbagbo forces while on 
humanitarian mission in Abidjan. The Human Rights Division also documented threats to 
the life of UNOCI staff members. In April, a man who had worked for UNOCI as a driver 
during the elections in Abidjan informed UNOCI human rights officers that he had been 
threatened with death by armed men who visited his home on two separate occasions. In the 
same vein, a human rights officer who was returning to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire after leave was 
denied entry at the airport by law enforcement officers who molested her and forcibly took 
her back to the aircraft, forcing her to fly back to her home country.  
</p>
<p><b> X. Arrest and detention of Mr. Gbagbo and his close associates  
</b></p>
<p>40. On 11 April, Mr. Gbagbo and his wife, Simone Gbagbo, were arrested in the bunker 
of the presidential palace by the FRCI and taken to the Golf Hotel. Approximately 120 
other people were also arrested at the same time and taken from the presidential palace to 
the Golf Hotel. Seventy to eighty of these were released almost immediately. Mr. Gbagbo 
was transferred to Korhogo, in the northern region, where he has since been under house </p>


<p>arrest in a presidential residence. His wife was sent to Odienn&#233; in the north-east of the 
country where she also remains under house arrest. While some dignitaries of the Gbagbo 
regime were sent to Bouna, Katiola and Korhogo, some FPI members are still in Abidjan, 
where they are detained at the Hotel Pergola, allegedly as a protective measure.  
</p>
<p>41. The same day, President Ouattara said in a televised address that he had insisted that 
Mr. Gbagbo&#8217;s safety was guaranteed and announced that he would request that judicial 
proceedings be opened against Mr. Gbagbo, his wife and those who were apprehended. 
While President Ouattara&#8217;s assurances that nobody should be harmed during the arrest are 
to be commended, it should be noted that D&#233;sir&#233; Tagro, the former Interior Minister, died 
on 12 May, the day after his arrest, of wounds allegedly sustained during the arrest. The 
Human Rights Division has been informed that an autopsy will be conducted which will 
shed more light on the circumstances surrounding his death. It is important for the 
Government to conduct investigations into the circumstances of the death of Mr. Tagro.  
</p>
<p>42. Regarding those persons arrested and detained at the same time as Mr. Gbagbo, the 
Human Rights Division of UNOCI has engaged with the Government to ascertain the exact 
numbers, their names and where they are being held. The Human Rights Division has had 
access to some of the detainees in Bouna, Pergola and Bouak&#233;. However, in Korogho, the 
FRCI Commander has systematically denied human rights officers access to the detainees. 
Where access was granted in Bouna, human rights officers met with seven key associates of 
Mr. Gbagbo. The team noted that conditions of hygiene and sanitation were poor and the 
cells were poorly ventilated, forcing the detainees to sleep outside in a tent. The toilets were 
in the open air without regard for the privacy of the users. Three of the detainees need 
special medical attention. Some detainees were reportedly being subjected to ill-treatment, 
including death threats and forced exercise, by elements of the FRCI.    
</p>
<p>43. In the interim, the office of the General Prosecutor has initiated preliminary 
proceedings against Mr. Gbagbo and his close collaborators. Nonetheless, President 
Ouattara has formally requested the International Criminal Court to prosecute crimes 
committed since 28 November 2010. On 26 May, former president Gbagbo was 
interrogated by the Abidjan Public Prosecutor accompanied by the Korhogo Public 
Prosecutor. The interrogation took place in the presence of a committee of six African 
lawyers formed to defend Mr. Gbagbo. It was the second interrogation of Mr. Gbagbo since 
his arrest on 11 April 2011. It should be noted that during the first interrogation, on 7 May, 
the lawyers of Mr. and Ms. Gbagbo were not present.  
</p>
<p>44. The Human Rights Division is closely following up the cases of detention and 
constantly reminding the relevant government authorities of their responsibility to ensure 
full respect for the human rights of the detainees as well as ensuring that the issue of 
amnesty be properly addressed to avoid a perception of selective justice which may also 
have the potential of undermining efforts to combat impunity. UNOCI has continued to 
meet with the Minister of Justice, the Prosecutor of Abidjan and the Military Prosecutor to 
review all related aspects with emphasis on the need for respect for the due process rights 
of all persons currently under detention. 
</p>
<p><b> XI. Human rights situation after the arrest of Mr. Gbagbo 
</b></p>
<p>45. While there is relative calm in most parts of the country under the control of the 
FRCI, including Abidjan, confrontations between the FRCI and pro-Gbagbo militias and 
mercenaries have resulted in many deaths and the destruction and looting of property. 
Retreating pro-Gbagbo militias and mercenaries have targeted and killed individuals 
identified as coming from the North, leaving a climate of fear, mistrust and serious 
concerns about retaliation.  </p>


<p>46. Indiscipline and excesses by the FRCI, which is composed of several different 
groups with no clear command structure, and an assortment of other armed groups are also 
a concern. There have been reports of arbitrary arrest, torture, rape, looting and extortion by 
some FRCI elements in roadblocks and homes, many of which have ethnic dimensions. 
There is also the continuing risk of reprisals by FRCI elements and RHDP supporters 
against former FDS and LMP supporters which, if they persist, could seriously undermine 
efforts aimed at social cohesion and reconciliation.  
</p>
<p>47. There have been many reports suggesting that elements of the FRCI are involved in 
human rights violations in both Abidjan and the rest of the country. In neighbourhoods 
across Abidjan, including Yopougon, Angr&#233;, Plateau, Zone 4, Koumassi, Rivera and 
Cocody. At least 300 people were arbitrarily arrested and transferred to the prison in 
Bouak&#233; and other places of detention. While the majority of these have been released, 
reports indicate that at least 56 are still in detention.   
</p>
<p>48. During May, numerous cases of ill treatment and illegal arrest, followed by 
extortion, have been documented. On 3 May, in the Yopougon Acad&#233;mie Cit&#233; 
neighbourhood, a man was reportedly shot in both hands by elements of the FRCI who 
alleged that he was a militia member, an allegation rejected by his family members. The 
FRCI members were reported to have arrived at the family residence of the victim, ordered 
all the occupants outside and instructed them to kneel down, identified the victim, whom 
they subsequently shot in both hands, and conveyed him to one of their bases, where he was 
detained for 6 days and released upon the payment of 250,000 FCFA as the first instalment 
of a total 500,000 FCFA they requested from his family. On 23 May, a 52-year-old man 
from Benkro, a sous pr&#233;fecture of Oum&#233;, died in detention after he was severely beaten and 
ill-treated by two members of the FRCI stationed in Doukouya (74km west of 
Yamoussoukro). Prior to his death, he had been summoned on 22 May by FRCI members 
who, in the presence of the victim&#8217;s brother and without questioning him, began kicking 
and hitting him with their rifle butts.  
</p>
<p><b> XII. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusion  
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>The political crisis in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire created a climate of insecurity and impunity 
which led to large-scale human rights violations and abuses. Some political actors, 
through radical statements and actions, incited local communities and supporters to 
carry out acts that have undermined the full realization of human rights. Throughout 
the reporting period, civilians were subjected to excessive and disproportionate force 
by the security forces, sometimes in collaboration with militia groups and 
mercenaries.  
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>While the presence of the FRCI has helped to stabilize the security situation 
following the end of hostilities, there is still a security vacuum due to the fact that 
many members of the police and gendarmerie abandoned their posts around the 
country and many police stations were looted and destroyed. Coupled with the 
proliferation of small arms and armed groups, this has often led to violence, especially 
at the inter-community level, with attendant consequences on the human rights 
situation. The creation of a new professional armed force and the reconstitution of 
security sector institutions could play a vital role in addressing the aforementioned 
concerns, and deserves critical attention.   
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>The ongoing processes, both nationally and internationally, to address the issue 
of impunity, will be essential in ensuring justice and reconciliation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. </b></p>


<p><b>The creation of a Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as announced by 
President Ouattara, could play a significant role in this regard, but cannot replace 
measures to ensure criminal accountability. The Human Rights Division continues to 
work with the relevant government departments in identifying the challenges and the 
institutional and capacity gaps related to the implementation of specific action to 
guarantee the protection and promotion of human rights.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>In line with the above, the High Commissioner makes the following 
recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. To the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Take immediate measures to address the security gap in order to offer 
adequate protection to the civilian population, adopt a zero tolerance policy on serious 
human rights violations, including sexual violence, and bring to justice any elements 
of the security forces involved in such violations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Take the necessary steps to establish or rebuild relevant institutions, 
including the judiciary, police and correctional services, and a national human rights 
institution, to ensure the effective protection of human rights and accountability for 
all perpetrators of human rights violations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Train and sensitize the police, gendarmes, armed forces and the 
judiciary in dealing with sexual and gender-based violence cases and provide legal 
assistance services to victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Ensure that the conditions of detention of Mr. Gbagbo, his wife, former 
officials and any other detainees are in line with international standards, including 
with regard to access by the relevant organizations with a mandate to monitor 
detention centres, and expedite their prosecutions and trials in accordance with 
international due process and fair trial requirements;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (e) Develop a comprehensive transitional justice strategy which 
encompasses, inter alia, accountability, reparations, vetting, and reform of the 
security sector and the judiciary; and ensure that the Dialogue, Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission is established and operates in accordance with 
international standards, including consultations with victims and civil society 
organizations with respect to the scope of its mandate and the appointment of its 
members, to ensure balanced ethnic, regional, religious, gender and political 
representation;</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Comprehensively address the root causes of the conflict, including 
ethnic, religious and gender-based discrimination, the socio-economic imbalance 
between different parts of the country, as well as land disputes and inter-communal 
conflicts, and implement a national reconciliation programme;   
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Review and implement the recommendations of the International 
Commission of Inquiry on C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire mandated by the Human Rights Council 
through concrete action designed to break the cycle of impunity, bring perpetrators to 
justice and rehabilitate victims with regard to their rights and dignity; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Issue a standing invitation to special procedures mandate holders of the 
Human Rights Council to visit C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire; </b></p>


<p><b> 2.  To the international community 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Provide assistance to the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire for the rapid re-
establishment of judicial institutions, including those for juvenile justice; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Provide appropriate assistance to the region in order to address the 
regional</b> <b>implications of its ongoing normalization efforts, especially in view of the 
massive flow of Ivorian refugees into neighbouring countries, the involvement of 
mercenaries in the conflict and the resulting proliferation of small arms and light 
weapons. 
</b></p>
