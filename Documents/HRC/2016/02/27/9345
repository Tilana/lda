<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Secretary-General has submitted to the Commission on Human Rights and 
subsequently the Human Rights Council an annual report on technical cooperation in the field of 
human rights, reflecting the discussions of the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for 
Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights (VFTC). Based on Commission on 
Human Rights resolution 2004/81 and the subsequent analytical report<b>2</b> on the progress and 
concrete achievements made, as well as obstacles encountered in the implementation of the 
programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights and on 
the operation and administration of the Voluntary Fund, the Human Rights Council in its 
decision 2/102 requested<b> </b>the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
continue with the fulfilment of their activities, in accordance with all previous decisions 
adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, and to update the relevant reports and studies. 
The present report is submitted in this context as an update of previous reports,<b>3</b> focusing on the 
work of the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of 
Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>I. THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE VOLUNTARY FUND 
FOR TECHNICAL COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>2. Members of the Board of Trustees are appointed by the Secretary-General to advise the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on streamlining 
and rationalizing the working methods and procedures of the Technical Cooperation Programme. 
Current members are Mary Chinery-Hesse (Ghana), chairperson; William A. Schabas (Canada), 
acting chairperson for the last session; Viacheslav Bakhmin (Russia); and Monica Pinto 
(Argentina). A fifth member, Vitit Muntarbhorn (Thailand), resigned just before the last session 
of the Board of Trustees due to the newly adopted rule of non-accumulation of mandates, as he 
currently also serves as the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. The process of identification of a new member has been 
initiated. 
</p>
<p>3. In recent years, the Board has moved away from detailed revision of individual projects to 
advising OHCHR on policy orientation, global vision and strategy at a broader programme level. 
The evolution of the role played by the Board is appreciated by OHCHR, which benefits greatly 
from the experience and wisdom of the Board, particularly in relation to the ongoing reform 
within the United Nations and OHCHR and the strengthened country engagement of OHCHR. 
</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>4. The Board holds its meetings twice a year. The twenty-sixth session took place in 
May 2007 and the twenty-seventh session in November 2007. The overall objective of the 
twenty-sixth session was to explore some of the challenges identified in the High 
Commissioner&#8217;s Plan of Action of 2005 in terms of substantive themes or cross-cutting issues 
which represent entry points from the perspective of country engagement and technical 
cooperation programming. The twenty-seventh session built on the previous sessions of the 
Board by a continued examination of various components of the United Nations Human Rights 
Programme on Technical Cooperation funded by VFTC, and was timed to correspond with the 
OHCHR annual consultation with heads of field presences. As technical cooperation activities 
are implemented mostly in the field, it is essential for the Board to be able to interact with field 
staff that carry out the work, and receive a first-hand account of the ongoing work related to 
capacity-building and technical cooperation. During the session, the Board focused on technical 
cooperation and capacity-building activities implemented through human rights advisers placed 
in United Nations country teams and human rights components of United Nations peace 
missions. 
</p>
<p><b>II. TRANSLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS THEMES INTO 
TECHNICAL COOPERATION PROGRAMME AND 
POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>5. Translating themes such as corruption and poverty, and their possible interlinkage, as well 
as other cross-cutting themes, into an action agenda for OHCHR remains an ongoing challenge. 
In this sense, the Board was pleased to note the increased emphasis on enhanced collaboration 
between the Research and Right to Development Branch (RRDB), the Capacity Building and 
Field Operations Branch (CBB) and the field presences in relation to poverty reduction. The 
Board was specifically briefed on the work of OHCHR presences in Guatemala, Liberia and 
Nepal as a basis for discussing how more focused strategies can make a difference in addressing 
the root causes of the human rights violations associated with poverty. The value of best practice 
models was recommended in developing strategies to tackle such a complex phenomenon as 
poverty. On a more general level, the Board felt that poverty is a difficult concept to define, and 
that economists would probably look at it differently to human rights experts. More should be 
done in order to clarify the definition, its linkages, root causes and a combination of these, 
i.e. discrimination, lack of sound governance, corruption, conflict, marginalization, lack of 
proper access to political and civil rights, and economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>6. The Board was also briefed on the United Nations conference on anti-corruption measures, 
good governance and human rights held in Warsaw on 8-9 November 2006. It was organized by 
OHCHR in cooperation with and hosted by the Government of Poland. Good governance has 
been part of the focus of OHCHR for some time, however corruption represents a fairly new 
theme of work for OHCHR. The objective of the conference was to share information on the role 
of anti-corruption measures in good governance practices, nationally and internationally, for the 
promotion and protection of human rights, to generate debate and clarify a conceptual basis for 
corruption. The Board members emphasized the importance of the issue and acknowledged that 
corruption might be both a cultural and a structural issue. As there are many actors with a 
mandate to fight corruption, the Board recommended that OHCHR should focus on issues</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>where the organization could bring added value. Impunity, lack of access to information, weak 
institutions, poverty resulting from poor governance and inequality, democratic deficit, and 
discrimination are potential areas where corruption is the cause of depriving people of their 
rights, as well as often being among the root causes of conflict. At the same time the Board 
underlined the importance of having a corruption-free police force, national planning agencies, 
audit agencies, judicial academies, and military academies. The Board additionally saw the 
importance of focusing on the so-called South-North dimension when addressing corruption. 
</p>
<p>7. In relation to economic, social and cultural rights (ESCR), the Board was briefed on how 
theoretical expertise on ESCR developed in the RRDB feeds into country engagement, technical 
cooperation and capacity-building efforts. The Board of Trustees mentioned that there has been a 
tendency to give priority to political and civil rights in general. It is a misconception that ESCR 
are only aspirational goals rather than enforceable rights. The Board emphasized that cultural 
rights are often the &#8220;poor cousin&#8221; of economic and social rights and further noted that ESCR 
have the potential to act as a bridge to achieve political and civil rights. Overall, the Board noted 
an increased attention to these rights and encouraged greater attention to field ESCR activities in 
the future. 
</p>
<p>8. In view of the recent adoption of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
and its Optional Protocol, the Board was apprised of the thematic work of OHCHR in this area. 
The Board commended the ongoing work, in particular the enunciation of policy and strategy 
through, inter alia, developing handbooks, mainstreaming initiatives, incorporation into laws, 
and assistance to countries upon request. The Board emphasized that &#8220;disabilities&#8221; is a cross-
cutting theme, which is often combined with conflict, governance and discrimination. The Board 
recommended that disabilities should be mainstreamed and integrated into the work of all 
United Nations country teams. In order to enable participation by persons with disabilities, the 
Board further pointed out that appropriate physical infrastructure needs to be available. For 
example, in order to participate in the Committee work in Geneva, blind persons<b> </b>would need 
&#8220;reasonable accommodations&#8221; such as assistance during travel and stay in Geneva, materials in 
accessible formats (i.e. braille), etc. 
</p>
<p>9. The Board was informed of the work of the open-ended Working Group on the Right to 
Development, particularly of its three-year workplan to operationalize a set of criteria for 
the evaluation of certain global development partnerships from a human rights perspective. 
In addition, the Board was briefed on the adoption of Human Rights Council resolution 4/4, 
which endorsed the practical global partnership approach recommended by the Working Group. 
Four global partnerships would be assessed in 2007/2008 from the perspective of the right to 
development. The Board noted the focus on partnerships and existing mechanisms, and 
commented that there will be a need for buy-in from the various country teams. The 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the essential instrument in this regard, which 
highlights that there is both an international and a national angle to the right to development. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. TECHNICAL COOPERATION AND CAPACITY-BUILDING 
ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED THROUGH HUMAN RIGHTS 
ADVISERS AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMPONENTS OF 
UNITED NATIONS PEACE MISSIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>  1. Human rights advisers placed in United Nations country teams 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Board was briefed about OHCHR assistance to country teams as it plays an 
increasingly important part of the technical cooperation provided at field level in support of 
national human rights protection systems. The Board noted that human rights advisers attached 
to the offices of Resident Coordinators play an important role in advising Resident Coordinators 
on human rights policy and strategic issues and in facilitating the capacity-building of country 
teams and national counterparts. The Board learned that in 2006 OHCHR completed a review of 
the role and functions of human rights advisers, with the aim of increasing their effectiveness, 
following a similar exercise conducted in 2005 for human rights components of peace missions. 
In 2006, two human rights advisers were stationed in country teams in Sri Lanka and Pakistan 
and, based on lessons learned from the review and the consequent standardized terms of 
reference drawn up for human rights advisers, in 2007 an additional nine human rights advisers 
have been deployed on either OHCHR contracts (Ecuador, Guyana, the Maldives, Nicaragua, 
Rwanda, Somalia and the Southern Caucasus) or UNDP contracts (Indonesia and Kyrgyzstan), 
out of which six are funded through the VFTC. Six additional human rights advisers are 
expected to be deployed in the near future (Moldova, Papua New Guinea, Niger, the Philippines 
Russia and the Great Lakes region of Africa). The Board fully supports the use of VFTC for the 
deployment of human rights advisers and noted the importance of foreseeing sufficient budgets 
for activities and domestic travel. 
</p>
<p>11. During its twenty-seventh session, the Board participated in the human rights adviser 
session of the OHCHR annual consultation with heads of field presences. The agenda of this 
session included the sharing of practical experiences of various human rights advisers pertaining 
to the implementation of technical cooperation activities; human rights work in post-disaster 
situations, the contribution of human rights advisers to national development processes and 
capacity-building of United Nations staff. The session also dwelt on various practical issues such 
as the generic terms of reference for human rights advisers, substantive backstopping from 
OHCHR, Geneva to human rights advisers (i.e. development of tools, etc.), and the potential 
assistance provided to national human rights institutions by human rights advisers. 
</p>
<p>12. The Board members emphasized the importance of human rights advisers and noted the 
need for both financial and substantive support and backstopping, as such advisers operate alone 
within country teams and are expected to provide advice and assistance on a variety of human 
rights related issues, including training, human rights programming, capacity-building and 
technical cooperation. Additional funds for deployment would mean that these officers who are 
currently working on their own could be assisted by a national legal officer, have a small budget 
for domestic travel and activities, and be able to strategically encourage the members of country 
teams to reach out to rights holders and assist duty bearers to fulfil their human rights 
obligations. It is evident that human rights advisers cannot be experts on all counts; some might 
be strong on providing training, others on formulation of human rights programmes, etc.</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Additional financial support or access to a regional pool of funds could allow human rights 
advisers to be assisted by specialized short-term experts from the United Nations system 
(for example, on child rights, environmental law, gender, disabilities, etc.). 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Human rights components of United Nations peace missions 
</b></p>
<p>13. During the course of the twenty-seventh session, the Board had separate sessions with 
selected heads of human rights components of United Nations peace missions. The Board was 
briefed in depth on lessons learned from implementing technical cooperation in Afghanistan and 
Sudan. To facilitate the work of the Board of Trustees and to enable it to better review technical 
cooperation undertaken by human rights components of peace missions, a mapping exercise has 
been initiated. This aims to identify good practices based on lessons learned on the 
implementation of technical assistance and capacity-building activities in the context of 
United Nations peace operations that could be replicated and/or serve as a basis for new or 
improved future interventions. The mapping exercise is expected to be finalized at the beginning 
of 2008, and will assist the Board in continuing its follow-up and providing advice to advance 
technical cooperation carried out by human rights components of peace missions. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. UPDATES ON RECENT DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING 
THE UNITED NATIONS REFORM PROCESS AND THE 
UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  The United Nations reform process - &#8220;One UN&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>14. The report of the Secretary-General&#8217;s High-level Panel on United Nations System-wide 
Coherence, &#8220;Delivering as One&#8221; (November 2006) recommends that human rights, as a 
cross-cutting issue, must be an integral part of United Nations activities, particularly when 
delivering as &#8220;One UN&#8221; at the country level. Consultations by the Panel have reaffirmed the 
legitimacy of the United Nations to address human rights through, inter alia, supporting national 
counterparts in their pursuit of international human rights commitments. In this context, eight 
country teams (Albania, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Pakistan, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uruguay, and 
Viet Nam) are piloting &#8220;One UN&#8221; (One Programme, One Budget, One Leader and One Office) 
with the Governments of the countries concerned. 
</p>
<p>15. During its sessions in 2007 the Board was briefed on current views on the development of 
a strategy to contribute to the &#8220;One UN&#8221; process and to bring human rights to the forefront of 
United Nations operations on the ground, in line with &#8220;Delivering as One&#8221;. The Board was 
pleased to note the reform effort (which it sees as a more long-term endeavour) and its emphasis 
on keeping the United Nations presence light, while maximizing use of the expertise of all the 
agencies. They saw the deployment of human rights advisers to country teams as a potentially 
efficient way for OHCHR to contribute its human rights expertise. The Board also underlined the 
importance of OHCHR positioning itself in order to be able to feed into the pool of potential 
candidates for Resident Coordinators, and at the same time ensure opportunities for staff 
progression from OHCHR into higher positions in the United Nations system. The Board further 
noted the challenges ahead as to how to effectively engage at the country level, how OHCHR 
can ensure adequate capacity internally and how to strengthen the OHCHR regional offices to 
substantively backstop technical cooperation at the level of country presences, human rights 
components within peace missions and human rights advisers placed in country teams. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  The universal periodic review  
</b></p>
<p>16. In 2007 the Board also looked at the challenges/implications for OHCHR stemming from 
the 2005 World Summit and the subsequent reform process initiated by the High-level Panel 
followed by inter alia the report of the Secretary-General entitled &#8220;In Larger Freedom&#8221;, which 
together marked a paradigm shift for human rights, reaffirming human rights as one of the 
three pillars of the United Nations. In this regard, the Board has made an effort to keep abreast of 
the process of institution-building within the framework of the Human Rights Council, 
particularly regarding the development of the universal periodic review (UPR) process, and to 
consider how the new mechanisms could possibly benefit, influence and/or provide challenges 
for OHCHR work on technical cooperation. 
</p>
<p>17. As such, the Board noted the new developments as per Human Rights Council 
resolutions 5/1 and 6/17 and the request for the establishment of a new additional trust fund to 
help countries implement recommendations emanating from the UPR process, namely the 
Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance. It should be recalled that in the Board&#8217;s 
briefing to Member States in May 2007 it was discussed whether the VFTC should be used for 
the UPR follow-up. Since then, the Human Rights Council has decided to establish a new trust 
fund for the UPR. The Board will follow with interest technical cooperation activities that will 
stem from the UPR process, with a view to ensuring efficiency and coherence with the Technical 
Cooperation Programme as a whole. 
</p>
<p><b>V. THE FINANCIAL SITUATION OF THE VOLUNTARY 
FUND FOR TECHNICAL COOPERATION IN THE 
FIELD OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Finance and Budget Section and the Donor and External Relations Sections of 
OHCHR provide the Board of Trustees with an update on the financial situation of the VFTC at 
each session. The Board noted that as of 1 January 2007 the VFTC would be used for technical 
cooperation activities in country offices, for human rights advisers and for human rights 
components of peace missions. 
</p>
<p>19. As of 31 October 2007, the financial situation of the VFTC was as follows: total income 
of US$ 5,439,315 and US$ 8,484,642 of expenditure and commitment. The estimated fund 
balance is US$ 7,416,712, considering the 2006 carry over of US$ 10,462,712. More detailed 
information on income and expenditure is to be found in the annex. 
</p>
<p>20. The Board acknowledges that earmarked contributions are not ideal for OHCHR as such, 
nor from a financial management point of view. However, the reality is that some Member States 
prefer to earmark their contributions and to channel their funds through the VFTC within the 
oversight of an independent Board of Trustees. During the last session the High Commissioner 
reiterated the important role the VFTC plays as a funding vehicle for implementation of 
technical cooperation activities. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR 2008/2009 
</b></p>
<p> Finally, during the twenty-seventh session, the Board was informed of the Strategic 
Management Plan (SMP) for 2008/2009 which will continue the implementation of the Plan of 
Action of the High Commissioner. The first SMP (2006/2007) focused on internal strengthening 
and capacity-building whereas the SMP for 2008/2009 will focus more on implementation and 
results at the country level. Based on lessons learned from the first SMP, the Board noted that, 
according to the plan outlined, the SMP for 2008/2009 will be produced in a more organized 
manner with a greater focus on measurable result oriented indicators. In line with the Plan of 
Action, the overarching theme for the SMP 2008/2009 will be impunity. In this regard, the Board 
was specifically briefed on the theme of impunity and possible areas of technical cooperation in 
that context for the next biennium. The Board noted with interest that potential areas for 
technical cooperation would include transitional justice, capacity-building for the judiciary, 
prosecutors, police, security forces, etc. </p>
