Origin Energy Limited and its Controlled Entities
Notes to the financial statements
Overview
Origin Energy Limited (the Company) is a for profit company domiciled in Australia. The address of the
Company’s registered office is Level 45, Australia Square, 264-278 George Street, Sydney NSW 2000. The
nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company and its controlled entities (the Group) are
described in the Segment information.
The consolidated general purpose financial statements of the Group for the year ended 30 June 2016 were
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 18 August 2016. 
The financial statements:
•
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), Australian
Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards
Board (AASB) and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board;
have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, environmental
scheme certificates, surrender obligations, available for sale financial assets and assets and liabilities
classified as held for sale that are carried at their fair value; and trade and other receivables that are
initially recognised at
less accumulated
impairment losses;
fair value, and subsequently measured at amortised cost
•
•
•
•  are presented in Australian dollars;  
•
present reclassified comparative information where required for consistency with the current year’s
presentation;
adopt all new and amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the AASB that are
relevant to the operations of the Group and effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July
2015; and
do not early adopt any Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have been issued or amended but
are not yet effective. Refer to note F11 for further details.
Key judgements and estimates
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, a number of judgements and estimates have been
made. Judgements and estimates which are material to the financial statements are found in the following
notes:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•
Income (note A2)
Trade and other receivables  (note B1)
Exploration, evaluation and development assets  (note B2)
Property, plant and equipment  (note B3)
Intangible assets  (note B4)
Provisions  (note B5)
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities (note C4)
Income tax expense  (note D1)
Estimates of recoverable amounts are based on an asset’s value in use or fair value less costs to sell, using
a discounted cash flow method. This requires estimates and assumptions to be made about highly uncertain
external factors such as future commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, discount rates, the effects of
inflation, climate change policies, supply-and-demand conditions, reserves, future operating profiles and
production costs.
The recoverable amounts of non-current assets have been assessed at 30 June 2016 based on the types of
judgements and estimates described above. Where required, any impairment has been recognised in the
income statement.

Revenue from the sale of oil and gas by the Integrated Gas segment is recognised when title to the commodity
passes to the customer. Revenue from the sale of electricity and gas by the Energy Markets segment is
recognised on delivery of the product. Amount excludes revenue from discontinued operations of $251 million
(2015: $2,254 million). Note A1 provides segment revenue.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues.
(3)
Key estimate: unbilled revenue
At the end of each period, the volume of energy supplied since a customer's last bill is estimated in
determining the unbilled revenue included in income. This estimation requires judgement and is based
on historical customer consumption patterns. 
Related to this are unbilled network expenses for unread gas and electricity meters which are estimated
based on historical customer consumption patterns and accrued at the end of the reporting period. This
is recorded within Trade and other payables in the Statement of Financial Position.

Financing costs incurred for the construction of a qualifying asset are capitalised whilst the asset is being
constructed or prepared for use at the rate applicable to the borrowings. Where borrowings are not specific to an
asset, financing costs are calculated at an average rate based on the general borrowings of the Group (2016:
4.40 per cent; 2015: 4.90 per cent).

Restatement of weighted average number of shares used as the denominator
During the period, Origin completed a rights issue of 636,086,881 shares at $4.00 per share. The price was
at a 34.4 per cent discount to the market price and therefore a bonus was received by shareholders who
participated in the rights issue. Accordingly, earnings per share for the 2015 comparative period have been
adjusted for the bonus element of the issue by multiplying the average weighted number of shares prior to the
rights issue by 1.14 (i.e. a 14% bonus element).

Calculation of earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated as profit for the period attributable to the parent entity (2016: $589
million loss; 2015: $658 million loss) divided by the average weighted number of shares.
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations is calculated as profit for the period from continuing
operations attributable to the parent entity (2016: $610 million loss; 2015: $459 million loss) divided by the
average weighted number of shares (2016: 1,578,213,157; 2015: 1,263,960,708).
Diluted underlying earnings per share represents profit for the period attributable to the parent entity divided
by an average weighted number of shares (2016: 1,580,493,399; 2015; 1,264,413,970) which has been
adjusted to reflect the number of shares which would be issued if outstanding options, performance share
rights and deferred shares rights were to be exercised (2016: 2,280,242; 2015: 453,262). 
Due to the statutory loss attributable to the parent entity for the year ended 30 June 2016, the effect of these
instruments and the impact of the share rights issue on these instruments has been excluded in the 30 June
2016 calculation of diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as
they would reduce the loss per share.

receivables (including unbilled revenue) reflect the amount anticipated to be collected. The collectability of these
balances is assessed on an ongoing basis. When there is evidence that an amount will not be collected, it is
provided for and then written off.
If receivables are subsequently recovered, the amounts are credited against other
expenses in the income statement when collected.
The Group's customers are required to pay in accordance with agreed payment terms. Depending on the customer
segment, settlement terms are generally 14 to 30 days from the date of the invoice. Credit approval processes are in
place for large customers. All credit and recovery risk associated with trade receivables has been provided for in the
statement of financial position.
Key judgements and estimates
Recoverability of trade receivables: Judgement is required in determining the level of provisioning for customer
debts. Impairment allowances take into account the age of the debt, prevailing economic conditions and historic
collection trends.
Unbilled revenue: Unbilled gas and electricity revenue is not collectable until customers' meters are read and
invoices issued. Refer to note A2 for judgement applied in determining the amount of unbilled gas and electricity
revenue to recognise.
The average age of trade receivables is 18 days (2015: 22 days). At 30 June, the ageing of trade receivables that
were not impaired was as follows:
Not yet due
1-30 days past due
31-60 days past due

The Group holds a number of exploration permits which are grouped into areas of interest according to
geographical and geological attributes. Expenditure incurred in each area of interest is accounted for using
the successful efforts method. Under this method all general exploration and evaluation costs are expensed
as incurred except the direct costs of acquiring the rights to explore, drilling exploratory wells and evaluating
the results of drilling. These direct costs are capitalised as exploration and evaluation assets pending the
determination of the success of the well. If a well does not result in a successful discovery, the previously
capitalised costs are immediately expensed.
The carrying amounts of exploration and evaluation assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine
whether any of the following indicators of impairment are present:
•   the right to explore has expired, or will expire in the near future, and is not expected to be renewed;
•   further exploration for and evaluation of resources in the specific area is not budgeted or planned; 
•   the Group has decided to discontinue activities in the area; or  
•   there is sufficient data to indicate the carrying value is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful 
    development or by sale.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment is
recognised in the income statement if required.
Key judgement: recoverability of exploration and evaluation assets 
Assessment of the recoverability of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure requires certain
estimates and assumptions to be made as to future events and circumstances, particularly in relation to
whether economic quantities of reserves have been discovered. Such estimates and assumptions may
change as new information becomes available. If it is concluded that the carrying value of an exploration
and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered by future exploitation or sale, the relevant amount will be
written off to the income statement.  
Upon approval of the commercial development of a project, the exploration and evaluation asset is classified
as a development asset. Once production commences, development assets are transferred to property,
plant and equipment.
Acquisition of exploration permits in the Browse Basin
In August 2014, the Group acquired a 40 per cent interest in two offshore exploration permits in the Browse
Basin in Western Australia. Origin paid US$600 million cash consideration with additional payments of
US$75 million payable upon a project Final Investment Decision (FID) and US$75 million payable upon first
production. A further payment of up to US$50 million will be payable on first production if Proved plus
Probable (2P) reserves at the time of FID reach certain thresholds.

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortisation and
impairment charges. Cost includes the estimated future cost of required closure and rehabilitation.
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed to determine if there is any indication of impairment. If any such
indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated and if required, an impairment is recognised in
the income statement.

Origin Energy Limited and its Controlled Entities
Notes to the financial statements
B3 Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Several different depreciation methodologies are used by the Group. Sub-surface assets relating to
producing areas of interest are amortised on a units of production basis. This method applies an average unit
depletion cost to current period reserve production. The proved and probable reserves (2P) expenditure to
date and an estimate of future development expenditure required to develop those reserves are used to
derive the unit depletion cost. Land and capital work in progress are not depreciated. All other assets are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
The range of depreciation rates for the current and comparative period for each class of asset are:
Generation property, plant and equipment
Other land and buildings
Other plant and equipment
Producing areas of interest
%
1 - 33
0 - 18
1 - 50
2 - 25
At 30 June 2016, the Group reassessed the carrying amounts of its non-current assets for indicators of
impairment.
Estimates of recoverable amount are based on an asset’s value in use or fair value less costs to sell (level 3
fair value hierarchy), using a discounted cash flow method. The recoverable amount of these assets is most
sensitive to those assumptions highlighted in the key judgements and estimates below.
Key judgements and estimates
Recoverability of carrying values: Assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that
generate largely independent cash inflows (cash generating unit). A Cash Generating Unit's ("CGU")
recoverable amount comprises the present value of the future cash flows which will arise from use of the
assets. Assessment of a CGU's recoverable amount requires estimates and assumptions to be made about
highly uncertain external factors such as future commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, discount rates, the
effects of inflation, climate change policies and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand
conditions.
In addition, the Group makes estimates and assumptions about reserves, future operating
profiles and production costs. Such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes
available. If it is concluded that the carrying value of a CGU is not likely to be recovered by use or sale, the
relevant amount will be written off to the income statement.
Estimation of reserves: Reserves are estimates of the amount of product that can be extracted from an
area of interest. A range of assumptions are used to estimate economically recoverable 2P reserves. As the
economic assumptions change from period to period, and because additional geological
information
becomes available during the course of operations, estimates of 2P reserves may change from period to
period. These changes could impact the asset carrying values, unit of production depletion calculations,
restoration provisions and deferred tax balances.
Estimation of commodity prices: The Group's best estimate of future commodity prices is made with
reference to internally derived forecast data, current spot prices, external market analysts' forecasts and
forward curves. Where volumes are contracted, future prices reflect the contracted price. Future commodity
price assumptions impact the recoverability of carrying values and are reviewed at least annually.
Estimation of useful economic lives: A technical assessment of the operating life of an asset requires
significant judgement. Useful lives are amended prospectively when a change in those assessments occurs.
Restoration provisions: An asset's carrying value includes the estimated future cost of required closure
and rehabilitation activities. Refer to note B5 for key judgement related to restoration provisions.
Future downhole costs: The depletion and amortisation calculation for producing areas of interest is
dependent
in part on the estimated future downhole expenditure required to develop and extract 2P
undeveloped reserves. Changes in future downhole expenditure can therefore impact amortisation
recognised. Future expenditure estimates have been based on the proposed development profiles for the
fields.

In assessing recoverable amount, an asset’s estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the asset. The pre-tax discount rates that have been applied to the above non-current
assets in the current and prior measurement of recoverable amount range between 8.5% and 9.7% (2015:
between 9.3% and 10.3%).
During the prior year, the Halladale Black Watch Speculant exploration asset was reclassified to development
assets and is included within the Otway Basin CGU.
The impairment charges noted above primarily resulted from a reduction in the reported reserves in the case
of BassGas, Cooper and Otway Basin CGUs.

During the period a decision was made to write-off an organisation wide IT implementation. As a
consequence, an impairment charge of $94 million (2015: $72 million) was recognised in the financial
statements which reflects the write-off of the intangible asset relating to this project. The intangible
asset relating to this project is allocated across the reportable segments. The impairment is recorded in
the Corporate Segment.
During the prior period the Group's investment in Contact Energy was classified as held for sale and
was remeasured to the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell at the time of
reclassification resulting in an impairment loss of $265 million being recognised. Refer to note E4.

Restoration provisions are initially recognised at the best estimate of the costs to be incurred in settling the
obligation. Where restoration activities are expected to occur more than 12 months from the reporting
period the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
At each reporting date, the restoration provision is remeasured in line with changes in discount rates, and
changes to the timing or amount of the costs to be incurred based on current legal requirements and
technology. Any changes in the estimated liability in future periods are added to or deducted from the
related asset. The unwinding of the discount is recognised in each period as interest expense.
Key estimate: restoration, rehabilitation and dismantling costs 
The Group estimates the cost of future site restoration activities at the time of installation or construction of
an asset, or when an obligation arises. Restoration often does not occur for many years and thus
significant judgement is required as to the extent of work, cost and timing of future activities.

Financial assets are recognised (or derecognised) on the date on which the Group commits to purchase
(or sell) the asset.
The environmental scheme certificates and surrender obligations are initially recorded at cost.
Subsequently, they are recorded at their market price (i.e. fair value) where there is an active market. If
there is no active market, certificates continue to be recorded at cost.
Investments are designated as available-for-sale financial assets if they do not have fixed maturities and
fixed or determinable payments and are intended to be held for the medium to long term. The Group's
available-for-sale assets are primarily Settlement Residual Agreements.

Interest-bearing liabilities are initially recorded at
the amount of proceeds received (fair value) less
transaction costs. After that date the liability is amortised to face value at maturity using an effective interest
rate method with any gains or losses recognised in the income statement.

Some of the Group's borrowings are subject to terms which allow the lender to call on the debt should there
be a change in control of the Group. As at 30 June 2016 these terms had not been triggered.
Significant funding transactions
In October 2015, the Group completed a rights issue of 636,086,881 shares at $4.00 per share. The rights
issue was fully underwritten and was completed on 2 October 2015 (Institutional rights offer) and 28 October
2015 (Retail rights offer). The net proceeds from the rights issue of $2.5 billion were used to pay down
Group borrowings.
In December 2014, the Group amended $6.6 billion of syndicated loan facilities to reduce the interest rate
margin, extend the maturities and increase the limit of the facilities by $750 million to $7.4 billion. The terms
of the bank loan facilities were extended by 16 months to December 2018 and December 2019 respectively.
In September 2014, the Group issued €1 billion hybrid capital securities on the Luxembourg Exchange which 
were swapped into A$1.4 billion. After hedging to Australian dollars, the cost to the Group is 7.9 per cent per
annum for the first 5 years and thereafter at reset rates. The hybrid securities mature after 60 years and can
be redeemed at years 5 and 10 or on any interest payment date thereafter.

A number of these financial instruments are recorded at the value which reflects current market conditions,
i.e. at fair value. The Group's methodology for calculating fair value can be found in note C4.
Management of these risks is carried out under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The key
financial risks to which the Group is exposed are explained further in the following sections:
•  Credit risk 
•  Liquidity risk 
• 
•  Interest rate risk
Market risk (including foreign exchange and price risk)
C2.1 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not fulfil its financial obligations under a contract or other
arrangement. In order to manage credit risk the Group has credit limits which determine the level of
exposure that it is prepared to accept with respect to counterparties. The Group is exposed to credit risk
through its normal operating activities primarily through customer contracts, financing activities (including
Mandatorily Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares), deposits and the collection risk from
arrangements entered into to manage financial risk.
risk management policies which allocate credit
The Group has Board approved credit
limits to
counterparties based on publicly available credit information from recognised providers where available.
Credit policies cover exposures generated from the sale of products and the use of derivative instruments.
The Group also utilises International Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) agreements with all
derivative counterparties in order to limit exposure to credit risk through the netting of amounts receivable
from and amounts payable to individual counterparties. Refer note F8.
The carrying amounts of financial assets, which are disclosed in more detail in notes B1, B6 and C5, best
represents the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date. The Group holds no
significant collateral as security and there are no other significant credit enhancements in respect of these
assets. All financial assets are monitored in order to identify any potential changes in the credit quality.

C2.2 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The
Group is exposed to liquidity risk through its ongoing business obligations and its strategy to take advantage
of new investment opportunities as they arise. The Group has a capital structure which allows it to support
these activities. A key element of this structure is the use of committed undrawn debt facilities.
The tables below set out the contractual timing of cash flows on derivative and non-derivative financial assets
and liabilities at reporting date and includes borrowings drawn at reporting date, including interest, and all

C2.3 Foreign exchange (FX) risk
FX risk is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will impact the Group's result. FX risk arises from future
commercial transactions (including interest payments and principal debt repayments on foreign currency
long-term borrowings,
the sale and purchase of oil and gas, LPG, LNG and the purchase of capital
equipment), the recognition of assets and liabilities (including foreign receivables and borrowings) and net
investments in foreign operations. The Group is mainly exposed to fluctuations in US dollar and New
Zealand dollar through its operations (both overseas and in Australia), its financing facilities and through
arrangements put in place to manage risk.
As at 30 June 2016, after hedging, the Group is exposed to FX risk on borrowings of US$2,247 million
(A$3,021 million). As at 30 June 2015, after hedging and excluding Contact Energy's New Zealand dollar
debt, the Group is exposed to FX risk on borrowings of US$2,247 million (A$2,929 million).
To manage FX risk the Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate
swaps (both fixed-to-fixed and fixed-to-floating). In certain circumstances borrowings are left in the foreign
currency, or hedged from one currency to another, to match payments of interest and principal against
expected future business cash flows in that currency.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to FX translation
risk. This currency exposure is managed primarily by borrowing in the currency to which the foreign
operation is exposed.
Significant transactions undertaken in the normal course of operations which are denominated in a foreign
currency are managed on a case by case basis.
The table below shows the impact of a 10 per cent change in FX rates (holding all other things constant) on
profit and equity based solely on the Group's borrowings and related financial instruments (excluding debt
designated as a net investment hedge) existing at the reporting date but does not take into account any
mitigating actions that management might undertake if the rate change occurred.

To manage its price risks the Group utilises a range of financial and derivative instruments including fixed
price swaps, options, futures and fixed price forward purchase contracts. Refer to note C5. The policy for
managing price risk permits the active hedging of price and volume exposures within prescribed limits. The
full hedge portfolio is tested on an ongoing basis against these limits.

C2.5 Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that fluctuations in interest rates affect the Group's results. Borrowings issued at
variable interest rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates
expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The exposure of the Group's borrowings (excluding lease liabilities), after hedging, to interest rate changes
and the contractual repricing periods at the reporting date are set out below:

The Group's risk management policy is to manage interest rate exposures using Profit at Risk and Value at
Risk methodologies. Exposure limits are set to ensure that the Group is not exposed to excess risk from
interest rate volatility.
The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by entering into fixed rate interest rate swap contracts
and fixed rate debt securities, with rates ranging between 2.25 per cent to 7.91 per cent per annum, at a
weighted average rate of 5.14 per cent per annum (2015: 2.20 per cent to 7.91 per cent per annum, at a
weighted average rate of 4.81 per cent per annum). Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of
converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
The Group manages its fair value interest rate risk by using fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps. Where
possible these are designated to hedge the interest rate costs associated with underlying debt obligations.
The table below shows the effect on profit and equity if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or
lower based on the relevant interest rate yield curve applicable to the underlying currency of the Group's
interest-bearing assets and liabilities. All other variables have been held constant and the impact of any
mitigating actions that management might undertake if the rate change occurred have not been taken into
account.

C3 Capital management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the ability to continue as a going concern,
so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group monitors its current and future funding
requirements for at least the next five years and regularly assesses a range of funding alternatives to meet
these requirements in advance of when the funds are required.
Key factors considered in determining the Group's capital structure and funding strategy at any point in time
include expected operating cash flows, capital expenditure plans, maturity profile of existing debt facilities,
dividend policy and the ability to access funding from banks, capital markets, and other sources.
The group monitors its capital requirements principally through the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as
adjusted net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is adjusted to take into account the effect of FX hedging
transactions on the Group’s foreign currency debt obligations. The Group maintains a gearing ratio
designed to optimise the cost of capital while providing flexibility to fund growth opportunities.

C4 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities (continued)
The main inputs and assumptions used by the Group in measuring the fair value of level 3 financial
instruments are as follows:
Forward commodity prices: Both observable external market data and internally derived forecast data are
used which impact the expected cash flows.
Physical generation plant variables: Variables which would be used in the valuation of physical
generation assets with equivalent risk management outcomes impact the expected cash flows. These
include new build capital costs, operating costs and plant efficiency factors.
Liquidity premium: A premium was applied to allow for the lack of volume in the market relative to the size
of the instruments being valued.
Lower strike premium: A premium was applied to allow for instances where instruments have lower strike
prices compared to strike prices associated with the observable market prices.
Risk-free discount rate: The discount rates applied to the cash flows of the Group are based on the
observable market rates for risk-free interest rate instruments for the appropriate term.
Credit adjustment: An observable entity or counterparty discount or credit spread curve is applied to the
discount rate depending on the asset/liability position of a financial
instrument. Where a counterparty
specific credit curve is not observable, an estimated curve is applied which takes into consideration the
credit rating of the counterparty and its industry.
Oil put inputs: Both observable external market data and internally derived forecast data are used in the
valuation. Observable external market data includes foreign exchange movements, risk free interest rates,
and Brent oil prices.
Internally derived data principally includes the forward price path for Japanese
Customs-cleared Crude (JCC) which is not readily observable in the market. The forward curve for JCC is
inferred from the Brent oil forward curve.
The use of different methodologies or assumptions could lead to different measurements of fair value. For
fair value measurements in Level 3, a 10 per cent increase or decrease in the unobservable assumptions
would have the following effects:

The proceeds from the sale of Contact Energy $1,599 million and from the equity rights issue $2,496 million were
used to repay interest-bearing liabilities.
The fair value of these financial instruments reflect the present value of estimated future cash flows of the
instrument. The following key variables are used to determine the present value:  
• market pricing data (for the relevant underlying interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity
prices); 
• discount rates; and
• credit risk of the Group or counterparty where appropriate.
For these instruments, each of these variables is taken from observed market pricing data at the valuation
date and therefore these variables represent those which would be used by market participants to execute
and value the instruments.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date they are entered into and are subsequently
remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether
the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Gains or losses on derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments are recognised in the
income statement and resulted in a $198 million loss in the year ended 30 June 2016 (2015: $587 million
loss). This includes a $10 million loss relating to discontinued operations (2015: $27 million loss).
The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
• 
•
hedges of the fair value of recognised assets, liabilities or firm commitments (fair value hedge);
hedges of a particular cash flow risk associated with a recognised asset, liability or highly probable
forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or
hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).
•
the inception of
The Group documents at
these transactions the relationship between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking
various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on
an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The following table shows the fair value of instruments which have been designated as hedging instruments:

C5 Hedging and derivatives (continued)
Analysis of financial instruments which have been designated as hedging instruments
(a) Fair value hedges
The Group designates certain cross currency interest rate swaps in fair value hedge relationships. Changes
in the fair value of these interest swaps are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in
the fair value of the hedged item. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the
adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is
amortised to profit and loss over the remaining life using a recalculated effective interest rate.
The changes in the fair values of the hedged items and hedging instruments recognised in the income
statement for the year are disclosed in the following table:

(b) Cash flow hedges
The Group designates certain foreign exchange contracts, electricity derivatives, interest rate swaps, cross
currency interest rate swaps and oil derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships. The effective portion of
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within expenses.
Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to the income statement in the periods when the hedged
item affects profit or loss (for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). When a hedging
instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any
cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast
transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the
income statement.
The following sets out the amounts recognised in the income statement and equity arising from the Group's
cash flow hedges:
Effective portion of the gains on cash flow hedges recognised in the cash flow
hedge reserve (pre-tax)

(c) Net investment and hedge of net investment in foreign operations
The Group designates certain foreign denominated borrowings in net investment hedge relationships.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and of related
hedges that are deemed effective, are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the
foreign currency translation reserve within equity (2016: $36 million loss; 2015: $130 million loss). They are
released to the income statement upon disposal of the foreign operation. The ineffectiveness recognised in
the income statement from net investment hedges for the year to 30 June 2016 totalled $nil (2015: $nil).
  
Set out below are the different types of derivatives used by the Group and details of their key attributes.
(d) Types of derivatives
Interest rate swaps
At 30 June 2016, the fixed interest rates varied from 2.25 per cent to 3.33 per cent (2015: 2.20 per cent to
6.95 per cent) and the main floating rate was the Bank Bill Swap Benchmark (BBSW).
The hedged interest payment transactions are expected to impact profit at various dates between one and
seven years from the reporting date.
Cross currency interest rate swaps
At 30 June 2016, the fixed interest rates varied from 2.50 per cent to 7.91 per cent (2015: 2.50 per cent to
7.91 per cent) and the main floating rates were BBSW and US LIBOR.
The hedged interest payment transactions are expected to impact profit at various dates between one
month and seven years from the reporting date.
Forward foreign exchange contracts
The hedged foreign currency denominated transactions are expected to impact profit at various dates
between one month and seven years from the reporting date.
Electricity derivatives
The hedged electricity purchase and sale transactions are expected to impact profit continuously for each
half hour period throughout the next 12 years from the reporting date.
Oil derivatives
The hedged oil sale and purchase transactions are expected to impact profit continuously throughout the
next five years from the reporting date.

Origin Energy Limited and its Controlled Entities
Notes to the financial statements
D1 Income tax expense (continued)
The Company and its wholly-owned Australian resident entities, which met the membership requirements,
formed a tax-consolidated group with effect from 1 July 2003. The head entity within the tax-consolidated
group is Origin Energy Limited. Tax funding arrangement amounts are recognised as inter-entity amounts.
Income tax expense is made up of current tax expense and deferred tax expense. Current tax expense
represents the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using current tax rates and any
adjustment
to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax expense represents changes in
temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial
position and its tax base.
Key judgements
Tax balances: Tax balances reflect a current understanding and interpretation of existing tax laws.
Uncertainty arises due to the possibility of changes in tax law or other future circumstances to impact the tax
balances recognised in the financial statements. Ultimate outcomes may vary based on circumstances.
Deferred taxes: The recognition of deferred tax balances requires judgement as to whether it is probable
such balances will be utilised and/or reversed in the foreseeable future. 
Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT): The PRRT applies to all Australian onshore oil and gas projects,
including coal seam gas projects. The application of PRRT legislation involves significant judgement around
the taxing point of projects, the transfer price used for determining PRRT income, and the measurement of
the Starting Base on transition of existing permits, production licenses and retention leases into the PRRT
regime. In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, estimates are required in respect of future
augmentation (escalation) of expenditure, the sequence in which current and future deductible amounts are
expected to be utilised, and the probable cash flows used in determining the recoverability of deferred tax
assets.

D2 Deferred tax
Deferred tax balances arise when there are temporary differences between accounting carrying amounts and
the tax bases of assets and liabilities, other than for the following:
•
where the difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a
business combination and affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; 
where temporary differences relate to investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint
arrangements to the extent the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary
differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
where temporary differences arise on initial recognition of goodwill.
•
•
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced if it is no longer probable
that the related tax benefit will be realised.

PRRT is considered, for accounting purposes, to be a tax based on income under AASB 112 Income Taxes . 
Accordingly, any current and deferred PRRT expense is measured and disclosed on the same basis as income
tax. The application of PRRT legislation relies on a forecast of future years expenditure in order to determine
whether the utilisation of the PRRT base will be required. As the forecast indicates that no utilisation is required,
no deferred tax asset has been recognised with respect to PRRT in these financial statements.
(2)
A deferred tax liability has not been recorded in respect of the investment in Australia Pacific LNG as the Group is
able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference through its voting rights and it is not expected
that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future.

The Mandatorily Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares (MRCPS) are recognised as a financial asset by the
Group and the MRCPS dividend is recognised as interest revenue in the Group’s income statement. The
proportion attributable to the Group’s own interest (37.5 per cent) is eliminated through the equity accounted
investment balance as Australia Pacific LNG capitalises a portion of interest expense associated with the MRCPS.
In calculating Origin's return on capital employed, an adjustment is made to the carrying value of the
Australia Pacific LNG equity accounted investment as noted below.

Non-cash fair value uplift represents the increase in Origin's equity accounted investment in Australia Pacific LNG
arising from the partly paid shares issued to ConocoPhillips (CoP) in October 2009 and the dilution impact of
subsequent share issues to Sinopec (August 2011 and July 2012). 
In the initial years, Origin was not required to make an equivalent contribution and instead recorded a non-cash fair
value uplift to its investment in Australia Pacific LNG. The equity contributions made by CoP and Sinopec to
Australia Pacific LNG were used to fund construction of the LNG Project assets, which will be depreciated over
their useful lives (approximately 30 years). 
In each period Origin’s equity accounted share of Australia Pacific LNG’s earnings will
include a depreciation
charge referrable to the non-cash fair value uplift. When these earnings are reflected in Origin’s investment
balance this depreciation amount will reduce the remaining balance of the non-cash fair value uplift. 
The 30 June 2016 balance includes an estimated depreciation charge of $22 million associated with the non-cash
fair value uplift described above.
Australia Pacific LNG is subject to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax legislation and has an unrecognised
deferred tax asset balance of $3,747 million (100 per cent Australia Pacific LNG) at 30 June 2016 (30 June
2015: $3,151 million). Any future recognition of this balance by Australia Pacific LNG will result in an
increase in the Group’s equity accounted investment in Australia Pacific LNG, rather than a deferred tax
asset, as the Group equity accounts its 37.5 per cent interest.

E1 Joint arrangements (continued)
E1.3 Transactions between the Group and Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd
The Group provides services to Australia Pacific LNG including corporate services, Upstream operating
services related to the development and operation of Australia Pacific LNG's natural gas assets, and
marketing services relating to coal seam gas (CSG). The Group incurs costs in providing these services
and charges Australia Pacific LNG for them in accordance with the terms of the contract governing those
services.
Separately, the Group has entered agreements with Australia Pacific LNG to purchase gas (2016: $296
million; 2015: $253 million) and the Group sells gas to Australia Pacific LNG (2016: $41 million; 2015: $75
million). At 30 June 2016, the Group's outstanding payable balance for purchases from Australia Pacific
LNG is $27 million (2015: $22 million) and outstanding receivable balance for sales to Australia Pacific
LNG is $1 million (2015: $12 million).
The Group has invested in Mandatorily Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares (MRCPS) issued by
Australia Pacific LNG by way of subscription up to an amount of $5.25 billion. The MRCPS are the
mechanism by which the funding for the CSG to LNG Project has been provided by the shareholders of
Australia Pacific LNG in proportion to their ordinary equity interests. The MRCPS have a fixed rate
dividend obligation based on the relevant observable market interest rates and estimated credit margin at
the date of issue. The dividend is paid twice per annum. The mandatory redemption dates for the MRCPS
are 31 December 2022 ($3.75 billion) and 31 December 2024 ($1.5 billion). The financial asset (loan)
reflecting these MRCPS was $4,848 million as at 30 June 2016 (2015: $3,304 million). Dividends received
are recognised as interest. Refer to note A2.
The carrying value of the financial asset at 30 June 2016, as disclosed in note B6, reflects the Group’s
view that Australia Pacific LNG will utilise cash flows generated from their export operations to redeem the
MRCPS for their full issue price prior to their mandatory redemption date. There are no conditions existing
at the reporting date which indicate that Australia Pacific LNG will be unable to repay the full carrying
value. Accordingly the financial asset/(loan) is valued at amortised cost and reflects the cash provided to
Australia Pacific LNG.
The MRCPS were cancelled on 1 July 2016 and replaced with US$2.8 billion of MRCPS, with a
mandatory redemption date of 30 June 2026, and US$0.8 billion capital contribution (refer note F12).
E1.4 Interests in unincorporated joint operations
The Group's interests in unincorporated joint operations are brought to account on a line-by-line basis in
the income statement and statement of financial position. These interests are held on the following assets
whose principal activities are oil and/or gas exploration, development and production, power generation
and geothermal power technology:
•  Cooper Basin
•  Bass Basin
•  Bonaparte Basin
•  Browse Basin
•  Canterbury Basin
•  Beetaloo Basin
E2 Business combinations
•  Otway Basin
•  Perth Basin 
•  Surat Basin
•  Taranaki Basin
•  Worsley Power Plant
•  Geodynamics
There were no significant business combinations during the years ended 30 June 2016 and 30 June 
2015.

Includes unsecured bank guarantees of $9 million and letters of credit of $25 million related to discontinued
operations.
The Group's share of guarantees for certain contractual commitments of its joint ventures is shown at
note F2. The Group has also given letters of comfort to its bankers in respect of financial arrangements
provided by the banks to certain partly-owned controlled entities.
Joint arrangements
As a participant in certain joint arrangements, the Group is liable for its share of liabilities incurred by
these arrangements. In some circumstances the Group may incur more than its proportionate share of
such liabilities, but will have the right to recover the excess liability from the other joint arrangement
participants.
Australia Pacific LNG has secured US$8.5 billion in funding through a project finance facility. As of 30
June 2016, Australia Pacific LNG has drawn down US$8.5 billion under
the facility for capital
expenditure, fees and interest. The Group guarantees its share of amounts drawn under the facility
during the construction phase of the project (37.5 per cent share at 30 June 2016 being US$3.2 billion).
The Group continues to provide parent company guarantees in excess of its 37.5 per cent shareholding
in Australia Pacific LNG in respect of certain domestic contracts.
Legal and regulatory
Certain entities within the Group (and joint venture entities, such as Australia Pacific LNG) are subject to
various lawsuits and claims as well as audits and reviews by government or regulatory bodies. In most
instances it is not possible to reasonably predict the outcome of these matters or their impact on the
Group. Where outcomes can be reasonably predicted, provisions are recorded.
A number of sites owned/operated (or previously owned/operated) by the Group have been identified as
contaminated. These properties are subject to ongoing environmental management programs. For sites
where the requirements can be assessed and remediation costs can be estimated, such costs have
been expensed or provided for.
Warranties and indemnities have also been given and/or received by entities in the Group in relation to
environmental liabilities for certain properties divested and/or acquired.

Capital expenditure
As part of the acquisition of Browse Basin exploration permits, the Group agreed to pay cash consideration
of US$75 million contingent upon a project Final Investment Decision (FID) and US$75 million contingent
upon first production. The Group will pay further contingent consideration of up to US$50 million upon first
production if 2P reserves, at the time of FID, reach certain thresholds. These obligations have not been
provided for at the reporting date as they are dependent upon uncertain future events not wholly within the
Group’s control.

Explanatory notes to share-based payments for the year ended 30 June
(a) Equity Incentive Plan
Eligible employees are granted share-based remuneration under the Origin Energy Limited Equity Incentive
Plan. Participation in the plan is at the Board’s discretion and no individual has a contractual right to
participate or to receive any guaranteed benefits. Equity incentives are offered in the form of Options and
share rights.
(i) Long Term Incentive (LTI)
LTI includes the award of Options and Performance Share Rights (PSRs) which do not carry dividend or
voting entitlements and will only vest if certain performance standards are met. The number of awards that
will vest depends on Origin’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) ranking relative to the group of companies
comprising the S&P/ASX 100 index at grant date. No awards vest if Origin’s TSR ranks at or below the 50th
percentile. Testing of the TSR market performance condition occurs four years after the grant date and
there is no re-testing.
Vested Options may be exercised up to a maximum of 10 years after grant date. The exercise price of
Options is based on the weighted average price of the Company’s shares over a period of at least 10
trading days determined by the Board prior to the grant date. As there is no exercise price for PSRs, once
vested they are exercised automatically. When exercised, either automatically or upon payment of the
exercise price, a vested award is converted into one fully paid ordinary share that carries voting and
dividend entitlements.      
The fair value of the awards granted is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase
in equity, over the vesting period. In exceptional circumstances(1) unvested Options or PSRs may be held
‘on foot’ subject to the specified performance hurdles and other plan conditions being met, or dealt with in
an appropriate manner deteremined by the Board. Fair value is measured at grant date using a Monte Carlo 
simulation model that takes into account the exercise price, share price at grant date, price volatility,
dividend yield, risk-free interest rate for the term of the security and the likelihood of meeting the TSR
market condition. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards
that vest except where due to non-achievement of the TSR market condition. Set out below are the inputs
used to determine the fair value of the options and PSRs granted during the year:

(ii) Short Term Incentive (STI)
STI includes the award of Deferred Share Rights (DSRs) which vest where the employee remains employed
with satisfactory performance for a set period (generally between two and four years). DSRs do not carry
voting or dividend entitlements. Once vested, a DSR entitles the holder to one fully paid ordinary share of the
Company. As there is no exercise price for DSRs, they are exercised automatically upon vesting. The fair
value of DSRs is recognised as an employee expense over the related service period. DSRs are forfeited if
the service and performance conditions are not met. In exceptional circumstances(1) the DSRs, which
represent a portion of 'earned' STI, will vest at cessation unless the Board determines otherwise (for
example they may be held 'on foot' until the originally intended vesting date). Fair value is measured at grant
date as the market value of an Origin share less the discounted value of dividends foregone.

F8 Master netting or similar agreements      
The Group enters into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)
master netting agreements. In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a
single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a net amount
payable by one party to the other.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position,
where the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts and there is an intention to
settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Group has also entered
into arrangements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting, but still allow for the related amounts to be offset
in certain circumstances, such as a loan default or the termination of a contract. 
The following table presents the recognised financial instruments that are offset, or subject to master netting
arrangements but not offset, as at reporting date. The column 'net amount' shows the impact on the Group's
statement of financial position if all set-off rights were exercised.

The parent entity has entered into a deed of indemnity for the cross-guarantee of liabilities of a number of

The parent entity has also provided guarantees for certain contractual commitments of its joint ventures
associated with capital projects.
F11 New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2016, and have not been applied in preparing these financial
statements. The Group has reviewed these standards and interpretations, and with the exception of
AASB 9 Financial Instruments, AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and AASB 16 Leases,
determined none of these standards and interpretations materially impact the Group. AASB 9 Financial
Instruments proposes a revised framework for
financial
instruments. AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers introduces the core principle that an
entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. AASB 16 will primarily affect the accounting by lessees and will result in the recognition of
almost all leases on the balance sheet. The standard removes the current distinction between operating
and financing leases and requires recognition of an asset and a financial liability to pay rentals for almost
all
lease contracts. The accounting by lessors, however, will not significantly change. The Group is
currently assessing the impact of these standards.

F12 Subsequent events
Completion of Cullerin Range Wind Farm Sale
On 17 June 2016 Origin entered into a Share Sale Agreement with EDL Holdings (Australia) Pty Ltd for
the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary Cullerin Range Wind Farm Pty Ltd for cash consideration of $72
million. Completion of the transaction occurred on 13 July 2016. The expected gain on sale before tax and
transaction costs is approximately $12 million. Simultaneously, Origin Energy Electricity Limited entered
into an Offtake Agreement with Cullerin Range Wind Farm Pty Ltd.
Completion of OTP Geothermal Pte Ltd Sale
On 8 April 2016 Origin announced that it had entered into a Sale Agreement with KS Orka Renewables
Pte Ltd for the sale of its 50 per cent interest in OTP Geothermal Pte Ltd (OTP) for cash consideration of
approximately US$30 million (Origin share). Settlement of the transaction occurred on 16 August 2016.
Origin's investment in OTP is recorded at its recoverable amount at 30 June 2016 therefore there will be
no significant profit or loss realised on divestment in the year ending 30 June 2017.
Australia Pacific LNG Functional Currency
Australia Pacific LNG has changed its functional currency from AUD to USD from 1 July 2016 for
accounting and reporting purposes. On 30 June 2016 Australia Pacific LNG elected to change its
functional currency for PRRT to USD from 1 July 2016 and intends to change its functional currency for
income tax purposes to USD with effect from 1 July 2016.
Funding of Australia Pacific LNG
On 1 July 2016 Australia Pacific LNG undertook a capital reduction and cancellation of all existing 14,000
AUD denominated mandatory redeemable preference shares (MRCPS) (Origin’s share, A$4.8 billion).
The capital reduction was funded by issue of USD denominated MRCPS to a value of US$7.4 billion
(Origin’s share US$2.8 billion or A$3.7 billion) and a non-cash shareholder capital contribution of US$2.2
billion (Origin’s share US$0.8 billion or A$1.1 billion).
Other than the matters described above, no other item, transaction or event of a material nature has
arisen since 30 June 2016 that would significantly affect the operations of the Group, the results of those
operations, or the state of affairs of the Group, in future financial periods.

In  accordance  with  the  Corporations  Act  2001  (Cth),  the  Directors  of  Origin  Energy  Limited 
(Company) report on the Company and the consolidated entity Origin Energy Group (Origin), being 
the Company and its controlled entities for the year ended 30 June 2016. 
 
The Operating and Financial Review and Remuneration Report form part of this Directors’ Report. 
 
1. 
 
During the year, the principal activity of Origin was the operation of energy businesses including: 
 
• 
• 
•  wholesale and retail sale of electricity and gas; and  
• 
 
There were no other significant changes in the nature of these activities during the year. 
 
2. 
 
A review of the operations and results of operations of Origin during the year, the financial position of 
Origin and the business strategies and prospects for future financial years, is set out in the Operating 
and Financial Review, which forms part of this Directors’ Report.  
 
3. 
 
The following significant changes in the state of affairs of the Company occurred during the year: 
 
Australia Pacific LNG 
 
Almost eight years after the establishment of Australia Pacific LNG in October 2008, the first train of 
the  two  train  (nine  million  tonnes  per  annum  nameplate  capacity)  CSG  to  LNG  project  was 
commissioned and LNG production and export is well underway. Since January 2016 Australia Pacific 
LNG  has  shipped  36  cargoes,  the  majority  under  long  term  Sale  and  Purchase  Agreements  with 
Sinopec and Kansai. The second train is expected to commence production in the second quarter of 
the 2017 financial year. 
 
Actions taken to strengthen the Balance Sheet  
 
Sale of Contact - On 10 August 2015 Origin completed the sale of its 53.09 per cent shareholding in 
Contact  Energy.  The  transaction  was  underwritten  at  a  fixed  price  of  NZ$4.65  per  share  providing 
NZ$1.8 billion (A$1.6 billion) in net proceeds.  
 
Entitlement Offer – In October 2015 Origin completed an Entitlement Offer, raising $2,496 million net 
cash proceeds and issuing 636 million new shares. 
 
Dividends - As part of the Entitlement Offer in October 2015 Origin announced the reduction of the 
dividend to 20 cents per share on the expanded capital base, with an unfranked interim dividend of 10 
cents per share paid on 31 March 2016. The Board has determined not to pay a dividend in respect of 
earnings for the second half of the financial year.  
 
Asset sales - The sale of infrastructure, wind and geothermal assets sales totalling $476 million1 were 
announced,  with  $118  million  completed  as  at  30  June  2016.  The  program  is  on  track  to  achieve 
sales totalling at least $800 million by the end of the 2017 financial year.
1 Includes proceeds from OTP sale of US$30 million converted at an exchange rate of AUD/USD of 0.73.
Events subsequent to balance date
the Company’s operations in future financial years; 
results of those operations in future financial years; or 
the Company’s state of affairs in future financial years.
Exit  from  certain  activities  -  The  decision  to  exit  from  geothermal  activities  and  international 
exploration to focus on two strong businesses, Energy Markets and Integrated Gas. 
 
As  acquisition  and  development  activities  diminished  and  the  Australia  Pacific  LNG  project  nears 
completion, headcount across operational and functional roles reduced by more than 2,500 over the 
last 18 months. 
 
Developments 
 
Development  activities  were  limited  to  capital  expenditure  to  completing  projects  that  have 
commenced and utilise existing infrastructure. In the Bass Basin, the Yolla-5 and Yolla-6 production 
wells  were  commissioned  and  production  commenced  during  the  year.  In  the  Otway  Basin  the 
Halladale and Speculant wells were connected to the Otway Gas Plant and first gas is expected in 
late August 2016. In the Perth Basin, execution phase of the Stage 1a Waitsia Gas Project is nearing 
completion, with the commencement of flows expected by the end of August. 
 
The events described above and those disclosed in the Financial Statements represent the significant 
changes in the state of affairs of Origin for the year ended 30 June 2016.

The Company’s operations are subject to environmental regulation under Commonwealth, State and 
Territory legislation. For the year ended 30 June 2016, the Company’s Australian operations recorded 
a number of environmental incidents arising from Origin’s activities including those where Origin was 
the operator of a joint venture. These incidents resulted in environmental impacts of a minor and/or 
temporary  nature.  Regulators  were  notified  of  reportable  environmental  incidents.  The  Company 
received  ten  notices,  one  of  which  was  for  an  incident  occurring  in  the  previous  reporting 
period. These notices included requests for further information, official warnings and/or enforcement 
actions. Appropriate remedial actions have been taken or are being undertaken in association with the 
relevant regulators, in response to each notice and reportable environmental incident.

Under its Constitution, the Company may indemnify current and past Directors and Officers for losses 
or liabilities incurred by them as a Director or Officer of the Company or its related bodies corporate to 
the extent allowed under law. The Constitution also permits the Company to purchase and maintain a 
Directors’  and  Officers’  insurance  policy.  No  indemnity  has  been  granted  to  an  auditor  of  the 
Company in their capacity as auditor of the Company. 
 
The  Company  has  entered  into  agreements  with  current  Directors  and  certain  former  Directors 
whereby it will indemnify those Directors from all losses or liabilities in accordance with the terms of, 
and subject to the limits set by, the Constitution. 
 
The agreements stipulate that the Company will meet the full amount of any such liability, including 
costs and expenses to the extent allowed under law. The Company is not aware of any liability having 
arisen, and no claim has been made against the Company during or since the year ended 30 June 
2016 under these agreements. 
 
During  the  year,  the  Company  has  paid  insurance  premiums  in  respect  of  Directors’  and  Officers’ 
liability, and legal expense insurance contracts for the year ended 30 June 2016. 
 
The insurance contracts insure against certain liability (subject to exclusions) of persons who are or 
have been Directors or Officers of the Company and its controlled entities. A condition of the contracts 
is that the nature of the liability indemnified and the premium payable not be disclosed.

There is no former partner or director of KPMG, the Company’s auditors, who is or was at any time 
during  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  an  officer  of  the  Origin  Energy  Group.  The  auditor’s 
independence  declaration  for  the  financial  year  (made  under  section  307C  of  the  Corporations 
Act (Cth)) is attached to and forms part of this Report. 
 
13. 
 
The amounts paid or payable to KPMG for non-audit services provided during the year was $381,000 
(shown  to  nearest  thousand  dollar).  Amounts  paid  to  KPMG  are  included  in  F7  to  the  full  financial 
statements.
Auditor independence
Non-audit services
Based  on  written  advice  received  from  the  Audit  Committee  Chairman  pursuant  to  a  resolution 
passed by the Audit Committee, the Board has formed the view that the provision of those non-audit 
services  by  KPMG  is  compatible  with,  and  did  not  compromise,  the  general  standards  of 
independence  for  auditors  imposed  by  the  Corporations  Act  2001  (Cth).  The  Board’s  reasons  for 
concluding that the non-audit services provided by KPMG did not compromise its independence are: 
 
•
all  non-audit  services  provided  were  subjected  to  the  Company’s  corporate  governance 
procedures  and,  on  each  occasion,  were  below  the  pre-approved  limits  imposed  by  the  Audit 
Committee; 
all non-audit services provided did not, and do not, undermine the general principles relating to 
auditor independence as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor’s own work, acting 
in a management or decision making capacity for the Company, acting as an advocate for the 
Company or jointly sharing risks and rewards; and 
there  were no known conflict of interest situations nor any  other circumstance arising out of a 
relationship between Origin (including its Directors and officers) and KPMG which may impact on 
auditor independence.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION 
 
This Operating and Financial Review (OFR) contains forward looking statements, including statements of current intention, 
statements of opinion and predictions as to possible future events and future financial prospects. Such statements are not 
statements  of  fact  and  there can  be no  certainty  of  outcome  in  relation  to  the  matters  to  which  the  statements  relate.  
Forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors that 
could  cause  the  actual  outcomes  to  be  materially  different  from  the  events  or  results  expressed  or  implied  by  such 
statements,  and  the  outcomes  are  not  all  within  the  control  of  Origin.  Statements  about  past  performance  are  not 
necessarily indicative of future performance. 
 
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries, affiliates and associated companies (or any of their respective officers, 
employees or agents) (the “Relevant Persons”) makes any representation, assurance or guarantee as to the accuracy or 
likelihood  of  fulfilment  of  any  forward  looking  statement  or  any  outcomes  expressed  or  implied  in  any  forward  looking 
statement. The forward looking statements in this OFR reflect views held only at the date of this report and except as 
required  by  applicable  law  or  the  ASX  Listing  Rules,  the  Relevant  Persons  disclaim  any  obligation  or  undertaking  to 
publicly update any forward looking statements, or discussion of future financial prospects, whether as a result of new 
information or future events.  
 
This OFR and Directors’ Report refer to Origin’s financial results, including Origin’s Statutory Profit and Underlying Profit. 
Origin’s Statutory Profit contains a number of items that when excluded provide a different perspective on the financial and 
operational  performance  of  the  business.  Income  Statement  amounts,  presented  on  an  underlying  basis  such  as 
Underlying Profit, are non-IFRS financial measures, and exclude the impact of these items consistent with the manner in 
which the Managing Director reviews the financial and operating performance of the business. Each underlying measure 
disclosed has been adjusted to remove the impact of these items on a consistent basis. A reconciliation and description of 
the items that contribute to the difference between Statutory Profit and Underlying Profit is provided in Appendix 1 of this 
OFR. 
 
Certain other non-IFRS financial measures are also included in this OFR. These non-IFRS financial measures are used 
internally by management to assess the performance of Origin’s business and make decisions on allocation of resources. 
Further information regarding the non-IFRS financial measures is included in the Glossary in Appendix 6 of this OFR. Non-
IFRS  measures  have  not  been  subject  to  audit  or  review.  Certain  comparative  amounts  from  the  prior  corresponding 
period have been re-presented to conform to the current period’s presentation. 
 
Disclosures of Origin and APLNG’s reserves and resources are as at 30 June 2016. These reserves and resources were 
announced  on  29  July  2016  in  Origin’s  Annual  Reserves  Report  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  (Annual  Reserves 
Report). Origin confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included 
in the Annual Reserves Report and that all the material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates 
in the Annual Reserves Report continue to apply and have not materially changed.  
 
Petroleum  reserves  and  contingent  resources  are  typically  prepared  by  deterministic  methods  with  support  from 
probabilistic methods. Petroleum reserves and contingent resources are aggregated by arithmetic summation by category 
and as a result, proved reserves (1P reserves) may be a conservative estimate due to the portfolio effects of the arithmetic 
summation.  Proved  plus  probable  plus  possible  (3P  reserves)  may  be  an  optimistic  estimate  due  to  the  same 
aforementioned reasons. 
 
Some of APLNG’s CSG interests are subject to reversionary rights to transfer back to Tri-Star a 45% interest in APLNG’s 
share of those CSG interests that were acquired from Tri-Star in 2002 if certain conditions are met. Please refer to section 
6 for further information. 
 
On 10 August 2015, Origin divested its entire 53.09% interest in Contact Energy. Information in this report referencing total 
operations includes Contact Energy and references to continuing operations exclude Contact Energy. Key financial items 
on a total operations and continuing operations basis are included in Appendix 2.

Almost  eight  years  after  the  establishment  of  APLNG,  Origin  recorded  a  major  milestone  with  the 
commencement of LNG production by APLNG. This has occurred at a time when oil prices have fallen to the 
lowest level in many years. As a consequence Origin began the financial year with an unsustainably high level 
of debt. 
 
Origin has responded to these circumstances through a series of initiatives to reduce debt and build resilience 
in a low oil price environment. These include: 
•  The sale of its 53.09% interest in Contact Energy for NZ$1.8 billion; 
•  The Entitlement Offer to raise $2.5 billion of equity (Entitlement Offer); 
•  Commencement of asset sales program to deliver at least $800 million of proceeds by  end of financial
year 2017 with $484 million announced to date;
•  The continued delivery of capital and operating cost reduction targets across Origin, with a head count
reduction in excess of 2,500 over the last 18 months;
•  The  decision  to  exit  from  geothermal  activities  and  international  exploration  to  focus  on  two  strong
businesses, Energy Markets and Integrated Gas; and
•  The purchase of put options over 15 million barrels of oil for the 2017 financial year with a strike price of
A$55/bbl (75% of the volume) and US$40/bbl (25% of the volume) and forward sale of LNG cargoes.
These circumstances and Origin’s response to them have driven the results for the 2016 financial year. 
 
Statutory loss of $589 million decreased $69 million from the prior year driven by lower Underlying Profit ($317 
million) with Items excluded from Underlying Profit of $954 million, $386 million lower than the prior year. 
 
Items  excluded  from  Underlying  Profit  included  impairments  of  $515  million  reflecting  costs  related  to  the 
decision to cease development activities ($171 million) and Upstream impairments ($344 million) due primarily 
to downward revisions to reserves in the Otway, Bass and Cooper basins. Refer to Appendix 1 for additional 
detail. 
                                                      
1 Refer to Glossary in Appendix 6 for definitions of terms set out in the table. 
2 Prior period adjusted for the bonus element (discount to market price) of the September 2015 rights issue.
Origin’s Underlying Profit of $365 million is down $317 million on the prior year including a lower contribution 
from discontinued operations, reflecting the sale of Contact Energy ($68 million). 
 
Underlying  EBITDA  from  continuing  operations  decreased  $27  million  reflecting  a  strong  contribution  from 
Energy Markets and maiden contribution from the sale of LNG by APLNG,  offset by the impact of lower oil 
prices. Underlying Profit from continuing operations decreased $249 million primarily due to increased share 
of APLNG Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (ITDA) ($231 million) associated with recognition of 
increased sales of natural gas and LNG. Revenue from increased sales given the low oil price environment 
have been insufficient to offset the increase in ITDA. The higher ITDA also includes a disproportionate share 
of costs associated with infrastructure assets related to the LNG export project. 
 
Movements in Underlying and Statutory earnings per share reflect lower earnings and the effect of a higher 
weighted average number of shares following the issue of new shares under the entitlement offer completed 
during October 2015. 
 
The Board has determined to not pay a dividend in respect of earnings for the second half of the financial 
year.

Cash flows from operating activities decreased $429 million to $1,404 million due to lower operating cash flow 
from discontinued operations ($384 million) following the sale of Contact Energy. Cash flows from continuing 
operations decreased $45 million or 3% to $1,333 million including the impact of actions taken to reduce costs 
and risks in response to low oil prices (-$395 million). 
 
Cash flow used in investing activities decreased $3,725 million to $189 million: 
•  Lower  capital  expenditure  from  continuing  operations  ($277  million)  reflecting  delivery  on  Origin’s 
commitment to reduce capital expenditure in Energy Markets, reduction in capital expenditure related to 
the Exploration and Production (E&P) operations as growth projects complete, and the decision taken to 
cease international growth activities3.
•  Lower  net  contribution  to  APLNG  ($960  million)  as  construction  of  the  LNG  export  project  nears
o  sale  of  assets  to  reduce  debt  ($1,718  million),  including  Origin’s  interest  in  Contact  Energy 
o  prior period acquisition of Poseidon ($686 million).

As at 30 June 2016, Origin’s capital employed of $25,921 million includes capital related to APLNG of $13,033 
million,  comprising  the  carrying  value  of  its  equity  accounted  investment  ($5,945  million),  the  balance  of 
MRCPS ($4,848 million) and Origin’s share of APLNG project finance ($4,163 million) less the non-cash fair 
value uplift7 ($1,923 million) recorded  on the creation of APLNG  and subsequent share issues  to  Sinopec. 
APLNG has been in the project development phase and is ramping up to full operations, and as a result, is yet 
to deliver a return on capital. 
 
Adjusted EBIT decreased $449 million to $829 million including the impact of Origin’s sale of its interest in 
Contact Energy (-$257 million), lower E&P EBIT and disproportionate D&A from Origin’s investment in APLNG 
until the project reaches full operations. 
 
Capital  employed  decreased  $3,983  million  to  $25,921  million  reflecting  actions  taken  by  Origin  to  reduce 
debt, with average capital employed steady. 
 
Underlying  ROCE  of  3.0%  for  the  2016  financial  year  is  1.6%  lower  than  the  prior  year  reflecting  lower 
adjusted  EBIT.  Underlying  ROCE  continues  to  be  impacted  until  the  returns  from  the  capital  invested  for 
APLNG starts to be realised as APLNG moves towards full production.

Adjusted Net Debt
•  A  strong  operational  performance  from  Origin’s  Energy  Markets  business  and  significant  increase  in 
APLNG production was offset by the impacts of lower liquids prices. Underlying EBITDA decreased $27 
million or 2% to $1,635 million.
•  Energy Markets Underlying EBITDA increased $70 million to $1,330 million, reflecting the achievement of 
targeted  operating  cost  reductions.  The  integrated  portfolio  performed  well,  with  stable  Electricity  and 
Natural Gas gross profit in a higher and more volatile wholesale energy price environment. 
Integrated Gas Underlying EBITDA decreased $112 million to $386 million due to:
•
o  An  increased  contribution  from  LNG  operations  ($18  million)  reflecting  the  commencement  of 
LNG  production  ($119  million)  (including  a  disproportionate  share  of  operating  costs  related  to 
infrastructure assets), offset by the impact of lower oil prices on Australia Pacific LNG’s domestic 
gas  sales  ($63  million)  and  lower  LNG  net  recovery  as  APLNG  upstream  capital  expenditure 
declines ($38 million); and
o  Lower  contribution  from  Origin’s  E&P  operations  ($130  million)  primarily  reflecting  lower  liquids
prices and volumes ($90 million), and increased exploration expense ($34 million).

9 Refer to Appendix 4 for additional detail. 
10 Prior period adjusted for the bonus element (discount to market price) of the September 2015 rights issue. 
11 Origin’s cash contribution to APLNG for the current year is net of $338 million of interest income ($165 million in the prior period) 
received on MRCPS. Interest on the Mandatorily Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares is paid to shareholders twice per annum 
based on a fixed interest rate.
•  Origin’s share of ITDA increased $234 million to $296 million primarily reflecting APLNG’s ITDA as LNG 
production  commenced.  This  includes  a  disproportionate  share  of  costs  associated  with  infrastructure 
assets related to the LNG export project and MRCPS interest expense paid by APLNG to shareholders, 
which is offset by the recognition of MRCPS interest income in Origin’s underlying net finance costs.
•  Underlying net financing costs increased $22 million to $100 million reflecting the partial movement into 
underlying  earnings  (from  Items  excluded  from  Underlying  Profit  in  FY2015)  of  net  financing  costs 
(interest  expense  and  MRCPS  interest  income)  associated  with  the  funding  of  Origin’s  investment  in 
APLNG following recognition of Train 1 LNG sales, previously capitalised interest moving into underlying 
net financing costs, partly offset by the impact of lower debt following proceeds received from the sale of 
Origin’s interest in Contact Energy. Refer to Appendix 4 for additional detail.
•  While Underlying tax expense was $16 million lower at $275 million, the tax rate increased from 32% to
43% reflecting a higher APLNG loss.
•  As a consequence, Underlying Profit decreased $249 million or 41% to $354 million. 
•  Cash flows from operating activities decreased 3% or $45 million to $1,333 million including the impact of
actions taken to reduce costs and risks in response to low oil prices (-$395 million).
•  Capital expenditure (excluding acquisitions) decreased $277 million to $693 million reflecting delivery on 
Origin’s commitment to reduce capital expenditure in Energy Markets, reducing capital expenditure related 
to the E&P operations as growth projects complete, and the decision taken to cease international growth 
activities.
•  Origin’s net cash contribution to APLNG decreased to $1,206 million (compared to $2,166 million in the
prior period) as construction of the LNG export project nears completion.
A detailed analysis of the underlying performance of the business by operating segment is provided in Section 
5. Appendix 3 provides further segment detail for Underlying EBITDA and Underlying EBIT.

2.3
Funding and capital management
Liquidity
As at 30 June 2016, Origin held cash and cash equivalents of $146 million compared with $151 million at 30 
June 2015.  
 
As at 30 June  2016, Origin has $6.7 billion of committed undrawn  debt facilities and cash (excluding bank 
guarantees). 
 
Adjusted Net Debt
Between 2011 and 2015, Origin raised foreign currency denominated debt in the US and Euro markets. This 
foreign currency debt was hedged into either AUD or USD using cross currency interest rate swap (CCIRS) 
derivatives.  
 
Accounting standards require the foreign currency debt and the linked CCIRS derivatives to be disclosed in 
different lines on the Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet). Foreign currency debt is translated at 
the  current  market  spot  rate  and  classified  as  interest-bearing  liabilities,  whilst  the  associated  CCIRS 
derivatives are measured at current market rates (fair value) and are classified as either derivative assets or 
derivative  liabilities  on  the  Statement  of  Financial  Position.  It  is  the  combination  of  the  interest-bearing 
liabilities and the derivative assets or derivative liabilities that reflect the Company’s adjusted net debt position 
or the quantum of funds the Company is required to repay upon maturity of the debt. 
 
As at 30 June 2016, Origin’s interest bearing  liabilities on the Statement of Financial  Position  were $9,616 
million.  The  associated  CCIRS  was  a  net  derivative  asset  of  $339  million  on  the  Statement  of  Financial 
Position. The net amount reflects the quantum of debt Origin is required to repay upon maturity. 
 
Adjusted Net Debt decreased $3,971 million to $9,131 million including the impact of Origin’s $2,500 million 
rights issue and sale of Origin’s share of Contact Energy.
12 In the 2013 financial year Origin entered into agreements to sell the majority of its future oil and condensate over a 72 month period 
commencing 1 July 2015. Upon entry into the agreements, Origin received A$482 million reflecting the prevailing average oil forward price 
at the time of the transaction of US$89/bbl, discounted to US$62.40/bbl to reflect the receipt of the sales proceeds upfront. Delivery of oil 
and condensate production into the forward sale agreement commenced during the current period for which revenue is recognised at 
US$62.40/bbl, but for which there is no associated cash flow as proceeds were received upfront.

Origin’s  underlying  average  interest  rate  incurred  on  debt  for  the  current  period  was  5.9%,  compared  with 
5.1% in the prior period. The increase is primarily due to the: 
•
recognition in Underlying Profit of interest at a higher interest rate (primarily driven by hybrid debt) on debt 
used to fund Origin’s investment related to APLNG Train 1 and infrastructure assets from 1 March 2016; 
and 
repayment  of  drawn  bank  debt  from  the  proceeds  from  debt  reduction  actions.  The  interest  rate 
associated with bank debt is lower than capital market and hybrid debt.
•
Underlying  net  financing  costs  used  to  calculate  the  Underlying  average  interest  rate  include  interest  on 
Origin’s Australian Dollar, US Dollar and New Zealand Dollar debt obligations. Origin’s New Zealand Dollar 
debt obligations were converted to Australian Dollar obligations following the sale of Contact Energy in August 
2015. 
 
Approximately 62% of Origin’s consolidated debt obligations are fixed to 30 June 2017 at an average rate of 
6.3% including margin. 
 
APLNG Debt
The total amount drawn down by APLNG from its project finance facility during the period was US$157 million 
and at 30 June 2016, US$8,462 million of the total US$8,500 million project finance facility had been drawn. 
Origin’s 37.5% share of APLNG drawn Project Finance is US$3,173 million. 
 
APLNG Funding
On 1 July 2016 APLNG adopted US dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, and APLNG’s existing 
MRCPS facility of A$12.9 billion (A$4.8 billion Origin share) was repaid and cancelled. This was funded by the 
issue of a new US dollar denominated MRCPS and ordinary equity. Origin’s MRCPS receivable in the 2017 
financial year will total US$2.8 billion. The USD MRCPS earn an effective interest rate of 6.37% per annum. 
All future contributions by shareholders to APLNG will be ordinary equity contributions. Origin plans to manage 
the income statement impact of foreign exchange rate gains or losses related to its US dollar denominated 
MRCPS receivable against exposure to its existing US dollar denominated debt portfolio. Any residual foreign 
exchange impact will be disclosed outside of underlying earnings.
13 Inclusive of Contact
Share capital
During the current period, Origin issued an additional 644 million shares (including 636 million shares under 
the entitlement offer completed during October 2015, one million shares under incentive plans and six million 
shares under Origin’s dividend re-investment plan), raising a total of $2,538 million ($2,496 million net cash 
proceeds of the entitlement offer and $42 million from the dividend reinvestment plan). 
 
The total number of shares on issue was 1,753 million at 30 June 2016. 
 
The  weighted  average  number  of  shares  used  to  calculate  basic  EPS  at  30  June  2016  increased  by  314 
million to 1,578 million from 1,264 million at 30 June 2015. 
 
2.4
Final dividend – Nil
The Board has determined not to pay a dividend  in respect of earnings for the second half of the financial 
year. While the Board will review each dividend decision in light of the prevailing circumstances, the Board’s 
view is that suspension of the dividend is in the best overall interest of shareholders.
3.
ORIGIN’S BUSINESS STRATEGY
In  the  short  term,  in  light  of  the  significant  fall  in  oil  prices,  Origin  has  taken  steps  to  increase  business 
resilience to low oil prices as described in Section 1. Origin has also made adjustments to its strategy to focus 
on two strong businesses, Energy Markets and Integrated Gas, including the decision to: 
•  pursue its renewable energy strategy through Energy Markets; and 
•  discontinue international exploration (excluding New Zealand) and geothermal activities. 
 
Origin currently supplies energy to wholesale and retail energy markets primarily in Australia, and to the Asia 
Pacific region via its 37.5% interest in APLNG. 
 
Origin  believes  that  a  renewed  global  commitment  in  2016  to  reduce  carbon  emissions  will  accelerate  the 
transition from more carbon intensive to less carbon intensive fuels. It is widely believed that the resources 
that will most benefit from this transition are natural gas and renewable energy – particularly wind and solar.  
 
The increased impact of intermittency that arises with a growing use of renewable energy requires firming to 
provide  communities  with  reliable  and  affordable  energy  on  a  more  sustainable  basis.  For  the  medium  to 
longer term natural gas will have a critical role to play in providing a less carbon intensive fuel and reliability 
both locally and globally, resulting in a growing demand for natural gas. Origin intends to lead this transition in 
local markets through its Energy Markets business and in regional markets through its investment in APLNG 
and its growing LNG production. 
 
In supplying these markets, Origin’s strategy is to invest in the contestable segments of energy production, 
power generation and energy wholesaling and retailing. This strategy is designed to provide opportunities to 
grow the value of the Company and deliver a return on capital employed in excess of the Company’s cost of 
capital by connecting energy resources to customers, while allowing for the more effective management of the 
risks that arise across an increasingly competitive energy supply chain.  
 
Origin  intends to focus its  interests on natural gas resources in  Australia  with paths to monetise resources 
both  domestically  through  Energy  Markets  and  internationally  through  LNG  exports,  particularly  to  the  Asia 
Pacific region where demand for energy is expected to increase over the medium to longer term.  
 
Origin  also  intends  to  continue  growing  its  position  in  renewable  energy  to  meet  its  obligations  under  the 
Renewable  Energy  Target  in  Australia  and  build  capability  for  the  increasing  role  that  renewable  energy  is 
expected to play in the future.  
 
Origin believes the successful pursuit of this strategy will lead to Origin: 
•  being a leader in the Australian energy market; and 
•  having a regionally significant position in natural gas and LNG production. 
 
3.1
Leader in energy markets
Origin, through its Energy Markets business, has leading integrated operations in the energy supply, power 
generation and retail sectors of the Australian energy supply chain. The Energy Markets business comprises: 
 
•
the leading energy retailing position in Australia by customer accounts with approximately 29%14 share of 
natural gas and electricity retail customer accounts in Australia’s eastern and southern states, servicing 
approximately 4.2 million gas, electricity and LPG customers with a broad range of energy products and 
solutions;
•  a large and diverse gas portfolio which, together with flexible gas transport arrangements and coal supply
agreements, support a strong domestic power generation and retail business;
14 Based on Origin natural gas and electricity customer accounts as at 30 June 2016 and estimated market customer accounts as at 30 June 2015.
•  a  significant  power  generation  portfolio  of  approximately  6,000  MW  providing  flexibility  and  diversity
across fuel, generation type and geography; and
•  a  substantial  renewable  energy  portfolio  that  provides  flexibility  for  Origin  to  develop  or  support  the 
development  of  additional  renewable  energy  and  fulfil  its  aspiration  to  be  one  of  Australia’s  leading 
renewable energy companies.
With  the  vision  to  be  Australia’s  most  trusted  energy  solutions  provider  leading  a  transition  to  a  more 
renewable  future  and  offering  products  and  services  across  both  grid  supply  and  distributed  generation, 
Energy  Markets  is  extending  its  reach  beyond  the  meter.  The  energy  landscape  is  rapidly  empowering 
consumers, with technology enabling consumers to generate electricity from roof tops, storing electricity for 
use in peak periods and managing energy requirements using connected devices.  
 
Combining capability in retail and wholesale markets with deeper knowledge of customers, Energy Markets is 
embracing  this  change  to  provide  differentiated  solutions  and  services  to  help  the  empowered  consumer 
manage their energy needs. Energy Markets is implementing the following strategies to move closer to the 
customer and improve returns: 
•
Integrated  wholesale  portfolio  pivoting  to  utility  scale  renewables,  supported  by  flexible  fuel,  generation 
and transport capacity to benefit from changing market dynamics
•  Customer strategy delivering service excellence and innovative products to consumers, while improving
customer lifetime value and continuing to reduce costs
•  New  energy solutions, including solar  and battery storage solutions, serviced  hot  water and embedded
electrical networks, while continuing to build digital metering capability
3.2
Regionally significant position in natural gas and LNG production
The  Integrated  Gas  business  comprises  Origin’s  37.5%  shareholding  in  APLNG  and  E&P  operations. 
Integrated Gas’ strategy is to lower the cost of Australia’s vast onshore and near-shore resources and connect 
them to high value markets. 
 
APLNG owns extensive CSG reserves, predominantly in the Surat and Bowen basins in Queensland. APLNG 
has the largest 2P CSG reserves position15 in Australia of 13,529 PJe16 and is in the completion stages of a 
large-scale CSG-to-LNG project on Curtis Island  in  Queensland  that  has a design nameplate capacity of 9 
million tonnes per annum. Train 1 of the facility is already operating, with Train 2 expected to be completed in 
Q2  of  FY17.  APLNG  is  delivering  LNG  under  its  long  term  supply  contracts  with  customers  in  China  and 
Japan. Origin is the upstream operator of the APLNG project, responsible for the development of the CSG 
resources and the processing and transportation of gas to the LNG facility on Curtis Island.  
 
Origin also has E&P operations in Australia and New Zealand, with exploration and production interests in the 
Otway, Bass and Cooper Basins in eastern and southern Australia, the Browse and Perth basins in Western 
Australia, the Bonaparte basin in north-western Australia, the Beetaloo Basin in the Northern Territory and the 
Taranaki and Canterbury Basins in New Zealand.  
 
As the upstream operator of the APLNG project, together with Origin’s own existing gas operations, Origin has 
significant capabilities in natural gas production and has a substantial reserves position including 6,277 PJe of 
2P reserves17. Origin expects that from the early 2020’s the global LNG market will shift from being long to 
short,  the  Australian  East  Coast  gas  market  will  trend  towards  export  parity  pricing,  that  a  tightening  East 
Coast  gas  supply  creates  opportunity  and  that  Origin  believes  that  Australian  gas  resources  are  globally 
competitive when exported through existing infrastructure and that connecting these gas resources to export 
markets enhances value.

To deliver shareholder value through this strategy requires a focus on:
•  Continued execution and technology innovation to reduce find and develop costs in APLNG’s upstream
operations, Origin’s other gas resources and prospective opportunities;
•  Maintaining access to resources and prudently manage the existing portfolio of onshore and near-shore
assets and prospective opportunities; and
•  Leveraging proven gas and LNG marketing capability to access high value emerging export and existing
domestic markets.

PROSPECTS AND OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE FINANCIAL YEARS
4.1
Prospects
In  the  2017  financial  year  APLNG  expects  to  commence  production  from  Train  2,  ending  a  long  period  of 
significant capital  expenditure. The commencement of LNG production by  APLNG has happened  at a time 
when oil prices are at their lowest level for many years and these circumstances resulted in an unsustainably 
high level of debt. 
 
Origin’s  priorities  for  the  next  few  years  are  continuing  to  reduce  debt  and  lift  returns.  To  achieve  these 
priorities Origin will: 
•  Complete the APLNG project
The APLNG project is nearing completion with Train 1 exporting cargoes since January 2016, and Train 2 
expected to do so in the second quarter of the 2017 financial year. The remaining funding contribution is 
forecast to be $0.6 billion from 1 July 2016 until Australia Pacific APLNG is self-funding.
•  Limit capital spend
Capital expenditure (excluding APLNG) is limited to maintaining existing assets, completing projects that 
have commenced and meeting joint venture and permit commitments.
•  Continue to deliver on the asset sales program
The sale of infrastructure, wind and geothermal assets sales totalling $484 million18 have been announced 
to date, and on track to contribute a total of $800 million to debt reduction by the end of the 2017 financial 
year.
•  Maximise earnings and operating cash flow
Continue the strong performance in the Energy Markets business with increasing production in Integrated 
Gas, and ongoing benefits of cost out programs lowering costs.
•  Maintain adequate liquidity
Maintain adequate debt and capital markets facilities to cover all foreseeable funding requirements.
Growing contributions from Energy Markets
As the gas and electricity wholesale markets experience significant change from the impact of LNG exports 
and increased renewables, Origin’s integrated portfolio has proven resilient and profitable. Origin will continue 
to utilise this flexible energy portfolio, leading customer experience and product innovation to maintain strong 
Natural Gas contributions, drive growth in Electricity margins and pivot to a renewable future.  
 
The three Gladstone LNG projects are expected to come into full production in the 2017 financial year. Origin 
will  continue  to  utilise  its  flexible  gas  supply  and  transport  arrangements,  along  with  its  flexible  generation 
portfolio, to manage the swings in the gas market. Origin expects to maintain Natural Gas contributions in the 
absence of low cost ramp gas in future years. In the medium term, there is upside exposure in Natural Gas to 
higher oil prices. 
 
Origin’s flexible electricity portfolio is structured to maintain a competitive cost of energy and support further 
margin  expansion  as  higher  wholesale  market  prices  are  reflected  in  customer  tariffs  in  the  2017  financial 
year. 
 
To meet the national 33 TWh renewable energy target, a further 14 TWh of renewable generation is required 
to  come  into  the  system  by  2020.  Origin  is  well  placed  to  benefit  from  additional  renewable  energy  in  its 
portfolio. An overall short energy and long capacity position, combined with a short renewable portfolio, means 
that Origin’s existing generation assets will not be stranded and the peaking fleet in particular will benefit from 
                                                      
18 Includes proceeds from OTP sale of approximately US$30 million converted at an exchange rate of AUD/USD of 0.73
price  volatility.  Finally,  the  development  cost  of  renewable  energy,  especially  utility-scale  solar,  is  rapidly 
decreasing and is expected to continue to provide Origin with a competitive cost of electricity and Renewable 
Energy Certificates (RECs). 
 
For  customers,  product  and  service  innovations  like  Solar-as-a-Service,  Predictable  Plan,  batteries  and 
metering  services  will  be  a  priority.  The  development  of  Origin’s  digital  and  innovation  capabilities  also 
underpins  the  continued  evolution  of  cost  reductions,  ensuring  Origin  can  provide  excellent  customer 
experience  through  simplified  customer  journeys  at  the  most  efficient  cost  for  customers.  The  continued 
success  and  growth  of  the  LPG,  Solar,  Centralised  Energy  Services  and  Acumen  businesses  underpin 
Origin’s aspiration to expand the multi-product holdings of customers and increase customer life time value. 
 
These  trends  of  increasing  wholesale  prices,  volatility  and  REC  prices  are  expected  to  improve  Origin’s 
competitive  position  compared  to  retailers  with  less  integrated  and  flexible  portfolios.  Origin  will  focus  on 
managing margins and continuing to build customer loyalty and trust with leading customer experience. 
 
Growing production and reducing cost in Integrated Gas 
 
In the current low oil price environment, Origin has implemented actions to build resilience to low oil prices. In 
light of these actions and the objectives of growing production and reducing breakeven cost, key priorities are: 
•  Continuing execution momentum, including completing the APLNG project and fulfilling the project finance
lenders’ tests with parent guarantees falling away, and completing the Halladale / Speculant project;
•  Continuing to reduce development and production costs while building flexibility, with opportunity to lower
APLNG’s breakeven costs and reducing controllable costs across E&P operations;
•  Securing new high value markets to support future growth; 
•  Managing  the  portfolio  with  discipline  by  investing  in  backfill  opportunities  only  when  a  clear  route  to
market exists; and
participation.
•  Building the capability and culture to deliver with a particular focus on increasing indigenous and female
APLNG 
 
The APLNG project is being increasingly derisked, with the commencement of production from Train 1 with 36 
cargoes  loaded  to  date,  the  majority  under  long  term  Sale  and  Purchase  Agreements  with  Sinopec  and 
Kansai.  First  cargo  from  Train  2  is  expected  in  the  second  quarter  of  the  2017  financial  year.  Upstream 
operated production is exceeding 1,200 TJ/d, and Train 1 production is exceeding design nameplate capacity. 
The  Train  1  project  finance  operational  lenders  test19  has  commenced  and  the  release  of  the  first  tranche 
(60%) of shareholder guarantees is on track for the second quarter of the 2017 financial year, with the balance 
of  shareholder  guarantees  of  APLNG’s  US$8.5  billion  project  finance  facility  expected  to  be  completed  in 
calendar year 2017.  
 
The  Project  Cost  of  APLNG’s  CSG-to-LNG  Project  is  forecast  to  be  $25.9  billion  and  Origin’s  remaining 
contribution to APLNG is expected to be $0.6 billion, both in line with previous guidance20. 
 
Origin has previously announced a cost reduction program to APLNG’s Upstream operator cash cost base by 
$1 billion per annum from Phase 1 levels. As at 30 June 2016, in excess of $1 billion of initiatives had been 
implemented, with these savings expected to be realised on a recurring basis from the 2017 financial year. 
This cost reduction program is on-track to deliver a reduction of around 50% in APLNG’s cost per well relative 
to Phase 1 well costs. In addition, Origin has the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to sell additional 
gas and/or LNG when opportunities arise.
19 The 120 day train operational test is expected to be completed in calendar year 2016 and the 90 day two train operational test is 
expected to be completed in calendar year 2017. 
20 Project cost guidance as announced in February 2013, based on December 2012 exchange rates. APLNG net contribution guidance as 
announced at Origin’s half year 2016 result.
In the short to medium term, Origin remains focused on potential reductions to Australia Pacific LNG’s  break-
even  cost  by  a  further  US$2-3/boe  through  taking  advantage  of  additional  sales  when  opportunities  arise, 
further cost reductions through technology and innovation  and cost compression in periods of low oil price. 
 
Exploration and Production 
 
Production in the E&P operations in the 2017 financial year is expected to be higher than the prior year as 
Halladale  /  Speculant  comes  online,  partly  offset  by  lower  deliverability  from  the  existing  Otway  wells  and 
lower observed reservoir performance in the Bass Basin. 
 
Origin  is  focused  on  continuing  to  limit  capital  expenditure  in  E&P  to  completing  projects  that  have 
commenced, including the Halladale / Speculant project expected to be online in late August 2016, the Yolla 
MLE compression project, and meeting joint venture and permit commitments, including in the Beetaloo and 
Cooper basins. 
 
4.2
Outlook
FY2016  and  FY2017  are  transitional  years  for  Origin  as  LNG  production  commences  and  ramps  up  to  full 
production over this period. In FY2017 Origin expects21 a 45-60 per cent increase in Underlying EBITDA when 
compared to FY2016 Underlying EBITDA from continuing operations:  
•  Energy  Markets  Underlying  EBITDA  to  increase  to  $1.44-$1.54  billion,  driven  by  Electricity  margin 
expansion, maintaining the increased Natural Gas contribution, continued improvement in cost to serve 
and  an  increased  contribution  from  LPG  and  Solar  &  Energy  Services.  This  includes  additional  annual 
costs of approximately $32 million from new agreements entered into as part of asset sales to date.  
Integrated Gas Underlying EBITDA to increase to $1-$1.15 billion, comprising
•
o  E&P  Underlying  EBITDA  to  increase  to  $350  -  $400  million,  driven  by  increased  production  to 
approximately  90  PJe  (from  75  PJe  in  FY2015)  from  Halladale/Speculant  coming  online,  albeit 
about two months later than previously scheduled, partly offset by lower production across other 
basins
o  LNG Underlying EBITDA to increase to $650 - $750 million as LNG production continues to ramp 
up  and  revenue  recognition  for  Train  2  begins  in  Q3  FY2017.  The  negative  contribution  from 
APLNG oil-linked domestic contracts is forecast to have a diminishing impact as the initial ramp 
period of selling gas to QGC22 is expected to come to an end during H1 FY2017, with volumes 
reducing  in  FY2017  to  approximately  65  PJ23  (from  approximately  100  PJ23  in  FY2016),  and 
thereafter averaging 25 PJ23 over the medium term.
•  Corporate costs to reduce as benefits from the functional cost reduction program are realised. 
 
Underlying  Depreciation  and  Amortisation  (ex-APLNG)  will  increase  driven  by  Halladale/Speculant  coming 
online. 
Underlying  APLNG  ITDA  will  increase  significantly  as  APLNG  comes  into  full  production.  Disproportionate 
costs  associated  with  APLNG  shared  infrastructure  will  continue  to  have  an  impact  until  Train  2  revenue 
recognition commences. 
Following Train 2 revenue recognition, all LNG related items previously excluded from Underlying Profit will be 
recognised within Underlying Profit.  
Origin’s remaining contribution to APLNG is expected to be $0.6 billion from 1 July 2016 until APLNG is self-
funding, in line with previous guidance. Capital expenditure (excluding APLNG) for FY2017 is expected to be 
approximately  $550  million,  limited  to  maintaining  existing  assets,  IT  spend  in  Energy  Markets,  completing
21 This guidance is based on an average oil price US$52.90/bbl and a AUD/USD exchange rate of $0.74 and is dependent on the timing 
of production from Train 2. For APLNG the effective oil price for oil linked LNG sales will incorporate the lag in oil prices associated with 
LNG Sale and Purchase Agreements. 
22 Under agreements that Australia Pacific LNG entered into with QGC in 2010, Australia Pacific LNG will sell to QGC its entire share of 
gas production from the ATP620/648 fields for an initial ramp period.

projects  that  have  commenced  and  meeting  joint  venture  and  permit  commitments.  This  is  higher  than 
previous  guidance  due  to  the  timing  of  asset  sales  and  the  completion  of  the  Halladale/Speculant  project, 
additional spend associated with appraisal testing on the Waitsia resource and additional maintenance spend 
in the Otway Basin and the Darling Downs Power Station. 
 
Origin continues to target further debt reduction and expects adjusted net debt to be well below its target of $9 
billion at the end of the 2017 financial year. 
 
In FY2018 and beyond, as APLNG completes the transition from development to full production of its LNG 
project,  Origin  expects  to  see  significant  growth  in  earnings  and  returns,  strong  cash  flow  and  continuing 
reduction in debt.

segment  result  includes  a  depreciation  expense  of  $326  million  (up  7%  from  the  prior  corresponding 
period) primarily reflecting investment in digital capability.
•  Returns increased with Underlying EBIT margin rising from 9.6% to 10.1% and commitments to reduce 
operating costs by  $100 million from financial  year 2014 level and capital expenditure reduction  of $50 
million  in  financial  year  2016  were  achieved.  Announcement  of  the  sales  of  Mortlake  Terminal  Station, 
Mortlake Pipeline and Cullerin Range Wind Farm at attractive earnings multiples.
•  Net  cash  flow  from  operating  and  investing  activities  increased  71%  or  $522  million  to  $1,262  million 
reflecting  higher  underlying  EBITDA  performance,  improved  working  capital  management,  lower  capital 
expenditure and proceeds from asset sales.
•  Natural  Gas  Gross  Profit  was  stable  with  higher  sales  volumes  in  all  segments  offset  by  the  impact  of 
higher Energy Procurement Costs, lower oil-linked revenues and reduced demand for capacity services 
as Queensland LNG projects are commissioned.
•  Electricity Gross Profit was stable reflecting improved margin management in all segments offset by lower 
retail  volumes  from  prior  period  customer  losses  and  the  moderating  impacts  of  solar  and  energy 
efficiency.
•  Electricity  and  Natural  Gas  Cost  to  Serve  decreased  by  $11  per  customer  ($53  million)  reflecting 
continued  improvements  in  customer  experience  and  the  operations  of  the  retail  business  through 
digitisation and back office automation.
•  Customer experience rose with Interactive NPS increasing by 6 points to +12.3 and customer accounts 
stable  in  a  highly  competitive  retail  environment.  Completion  of  Origin’s  online  digital  platform  has 
improved  functionality  helping  customers  interact  with  Origin  when  and  where  they  want,  along  with 
further product and service innovations including Predictable Plan, Solar as a Service and a simplified bill.
•  Growing LPG and Solar & Energy Services and renewable energy capacity increased 156 MW (23%).

Natural Gas sales volumes increased 10% or 21 PJ to 228 PJ. Business customer volumes increased 32 PJ 
or 34%, driven by the sale of an additional 30 PJ to LNG producers sourced primarily from increased contract 
volumes. Retail volumes increased 0.4 PJ reflecting higher customer numbers partly offset by milder weather. 
Volumes supplied for internal generation reduced 11.6 PJ. 
 
Gross  Profit  was  stable  with  increased  volumes  offset  by  the  impact  of  higher  energy  procurement  costs 
reflecting low cost ramp gas leaving the market, reduced sales of gas capacity services as Queensland LNG 
projects conclude commissioning and lower oil-linked sales revenues from LNG customers. 
 
Gross Profit unit margin decreased $0.70/GJ to $3.10/GJ primarily due to a higher proportion of lower margin 
sales to LNG producers.

Electricity  volumes  increased  by  0.8  TWh  or  2%  to  38.1  TWh.  Business  volumes  increased  1.2  TWh  as 
access  to  competitively  priced  energy  in  a  rising  wholesale  price  environment  and  improved  customer 
experience allowed Origin to increase market share. Retail volumes decreased by 0.4 TWh largely reflecting 
customer  losses  in  the  prior  year  (0.2  TWh),  and  the  moderating  impacts  of  energy  efficiency  and  solar 
penetration (0.2 TWh).  
 
Origin’s Energy Procurement Costs increased $0.9/MWh reflecting a $2.0/MWh increase in Wholesale Energy 
Costs,  partly  offset  by  a  $1.0/MWh  improvement  in  Generation  Operating  Costs.  Wholesale  Energy  Costs 
increased,  primarily  reflecting  higher  gas  fuel  costs  in  the  second  half  of  the  2016  financial  year  as  the 
departure  of  ramp  gas  put  upward  pressure  on  wholesale  gas  prices  and  unplanned  outages  at  Eraring 
resulting  in  increased  use  of  higher  cost  gas-fired  generation  and  pool  purchases.  Generation  Operating 
Costs decreased $34 million reflecting the end of the Bulwer Island and Worsley Joint Ventures ($18 million) 
and underlying cost reductions through operational efficiencies ($17 million). 
 
Electricity Gross Profit was stable reflecting improved margin management in Retail and Business segments 
as a result of Origin’s wholesale energy costs increasing less than market rate ($21 million), offset by lower 
Retail volumes ($21 million). 
 
Gross Profit unit margin decreased $0.70/MWh to $33.80/MWh reflecting a higher proportion of lower margin 
Business volumes which more than offset the impact of an increase in Business and Retail customer margins. 
 
Gross Profit per customer increased $7 to $467 per customer with margin expansion partly  offset by lower 
average Retail customer usage.

Origin generated 20.1 TWh of electricity from its internal generation portfolio (20.6 TWh in the prior period) 
representing  53%  (55%  in  the  prior  period)  of  Origin’s  38.1  TWh  of  Electricity  volumes  sold.  Output  from 
Origin’s gas-fired generation fleet decreased by 0.9 TWh to 6.3 TWh reflecting decreased availability of low 
cost ramp gas.  
 
During  the  year  Origin  contracted  2.2  TWh  from  renewable  energy  power  purchase  agreements.  New 
agreements have also been signed during the year with Fotowatio Renewable Ventures for the proposed 100 
MW (with option for an  additional 35 MW) Clare Solar Farm and the  operating 56 MW Moree Solar Farm, 
pivoting the portfolio to a renewable future with new sources of energy and competitively  priced renewable 
energy certificates.

Electricity  and  Natural  Gas  Operating  Costs  decreased  by  $53  million  driven  by  a  $63  million  decrease  in 
Maintenance Costs offset by a $9 million increase in Acquisition and Retention costs.  
 
The reduction in maintenance costs reflects continued improvements in the operations of the retail business 
through digitisation and automation of back office processes and vendor management. These improvements 
have also led to a reduction in Ombudsmen complaints from 4.9 to 3.4 (per 1000 customers), and Interactive 
Net  Promoter  Score  (NPS)35  improving  from  6.336  to  12.3.  Back  office  processing  operations  were 
successfully transferred from Wipro to Accenture during the year, which will continue to deliver cost savings 
through  further  automation  and  optimisation.  Bad  debt  expense  as  a  percentage  of  Total  Natural  Gas  and 
Electricity Revenue has been steady at 0.61%. 
 
Acquisition  and  retention  costs  increased  $9  million,  or  9%  due  to  a  12%  increase  in  sales  activity.  This 
increase  reflects  higher  inbound  call  volumes  driven  by  the  popular  ‘Origin  Voucher’  and  Predictable  Plan 
campaigns  while Origin continues to drive sales activity  toward internal channels. “Predictable Plan” allows 
customers to pay fixed amounts regardless of how much energy they use. 
 
Customer experience and product innovation
Successful  completion  of  the  online  digital  platform  has  improved  functionality,  helping  customers  interact 
when they want, and how they like. Customers can see when and where their energy is being used, review 
their bills and pay them online, switch to e-services and predict the cost of their next bill. 
 
During  the  year  Origin  also  increased  paperless  billing,  with  around  1.6  million  customer  accounts  having 
taken up e-billing (72% increase) and 0.8 million customers are paying by direct debit (19% increase). 
 
Extended  call  centre  hours  continued  to  offer  customers more  freedom  to  get  in  touch  when  it  suits  them. 
Origin  also  redesigned  energy  bills,  making  them  easier  to  read  and  understand  focusing  on  the  key 
information and charges customers want to know 
 
Origin’s social and digital media activity increased during the year allowing Origin to engage key customers 
and audiences, provide broader communication and respond to issues. Origin have also brought innovative 
products  to  customers  like  Predictable  Plan  which  provides  customers  the  peace  of mind  to  pay  the  same 
amount each month for 12 months, regardless of how much they use, and Solar as a Service which gives the 
customer the benefit of solar without the upfront capital cost.
33 Origin includes within its Cost to Serve all costs associated with servicing and maintaining customers, all customer acquisition and 
retention costs. Maintenance costs include billing, credit and collections. 
34 Customer wins (FY16: 544; prior period: 518) and retains (FY16: 1,531; prior period: 1,340) and represents Cost to Serve per average

Solar & Energy Services
Year ended 30 June
2016

Change %
Solar & Energy Services Gross Profit increased by 31% or $13 million to $55 million driven by an increase in 
Solar sales and Centralised Energy  Services (CES)  customers as Origin extends the energy solutions and 
services  beyond grid based energy supply: 
•  Solar  sales  grew  by  95%  to  21MW,  including  significant  growth  of  Origin’s  Solar  as  a  Service  product 
(8MW of 21 MW), where Origin owns, installs and maintains the solar system. Origin has collaborated with 
Tesla in bringing a battery solution to market so customers can optimise the use of solar in their home. 
Origin has also introduced Origin Solar Repairs, offering end-to-end solutions through service and repair 
of solar PV systems.
•  The CES business, where multi-tenanted buildings are supplied through a single point and energy then 
metered  and  on-sold  to  residents,  is  growing  rapidly.  In  June  Origin  announced  its  largest  CES 
partnership with Lend Lease in Melbourne’s Victoria Harbour precinct.
•  Origin’s  Acumen  metering  business  is  a  metering,  data  management  and  energy  intelligence  service 
provider.  Initially  focussed  on  business  customers,  this  year  Origin  has  expanded  into  the  residential 
electricity market, and now have a total of more than 62,000 meters under management.
Operating costs increased $12 million reflecting business growth

customers. As at 30 June 2016, Origin had 387,000 LPG customer accounts, an increase of 5,000 accounts. 
 
5.1.7
Capital Expenditure
Capital  expenditure  of  $236  million  (decrease  of  $62  million  compared  to  the  prior  period)  included 
expenditure related to customers systems and digital investments ($81 million), generation ($92 million), LPG 
($30 million) and Solar & Energy Services ($19 million).
37 Revised customer accounts methodology to exclude customers in the process of transferring to or away from Origin in order to reflect 
active customers. 
38 Australian Capital Territory (ACT) customer accounts are included in New South Wales. 
39Northern Territory customers are included in South Australia.
5.2
Integrated Gas
Integrated  Gas  was  formed  as  of  1  July  2015,  following  the  combination  of  the  previous  E&P  and  LNG 
segments.  
 
LNG  includes  Origin’s  37.5%  equity  accounted  share  of  the  results  of  APLNG  and  Origin’s  activities  and 
transactions  arising  from  its  operatorship  of  the  APLNG  upstream  operations  and  management  of  Origin’s 
exposure to LNG pricing risk. 
 
In  Origin’s  Financial  Statements,  the  financial  performance  of  APLNG  is  equity  accounted.  Consequently, 
revenue  and  expenses  from  APLNG  do  not  appear  on  a  line  by  line  basis  in  the  Integrated  Gas  segment 
result. Origin’s share of APLNG’s Underlying EBITDA is included in the Underlying EBITDA of the Integrated 
Gas segment. Origin’s share of APLNG’s Underlying interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation expense is 
accounted  for  between  Underlying  EBITDA  and  Underlying  EBIT  in  the  line  item  “Share  of  interest,  tax, 
depreciation  and  amortisation  of  equity  accounted  investees”.  As  a  result,  Origin’s  share  of  APLNG’s 
Underlying net profit after tax is included in the Underlying EBIT and Segment Result lines.  
 
E&P includes exploration and production interests located in eastern and southern Australia, the Browse and 
Perth  basins  in  Western  Australia,  the  Bonaparte  Basin  in  north-western  Australia,  the  Beetaloo  Basin  in 
Northern Territory and in New Zealand.

Integrated  Gas  Underlying  EBITDA  decreased  23%  or  $112  million  to  $386  million  with  an  increased 
contribution  from  LNG  operations  ($18  million);  reflecting  the  commencement  of  LNG  production 
($119 million) (including a disproportionate share of operating costs related to infrastructure assets), offset 
by the impact of lower oil prices on Australia Pacific LNG’s domestic gas sales ($63 million) and lower 
LNG net recovery as APLNG upstream capital expenditure declines ($38 million), and lower contribution 
from  Origin’s  E&P  operations  ($130  million)  primarily  reflecting  lower  liquids  prices  and  volumes  ($90 
million), and increased exploration expense ($34 million). 
Integrated  Gas  segment  result  decreased  $337  million  to  -$215  million  driven  by  lower  EBITDA 
($112 million) and increased share of APLNG ITDA ($231 million) associated with recognition of increased 
sales of natural gas and LNG. Revenue from increased sales given the low oil price environment, have 
been insufficient to offset the increase in ITDA. The higher ITDA also includes a disproportionate share of 
costs associated with infrastructure assets related to the LNG export project and MRCPS interest expense 
paid by APLNG to shareholders.
•  Cash  flow  from  operating  activities  decreased  $409  million  to  $26  million  due  to  lower  EBITDA  after 
adjusting for the non-cash impacts of exploration expense and equity accounted share of APLNG EBITDA 
(-$134 million) and the impact of actions taken to reduce risk in response to low oil prices (-$293 million).
•  Capital expenditure ($171 million) and contribution to APLNG ($960 million) decreased as growth projects
near completion.
•
•
•  Net cash flow from operating and investing activities improved by $1,413 million to -$1,605 the result of 
lower  capital  expenditure  and  APLNG  contribution  and  the  Poseidon  acquisition  in  the  prior  year 
($686 million), partly offset by lower operating cash flow.
•  The  Train  1  facility  is  now  fully  operational  and  is  performing  as  expected  with  daily  production  rates 
having achieved and exceeded design nameplate capacity. 36 cargoes have been shipped to date, the 
majority under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreements with Sinopec and Kansai.
•  Construction of the Train 2 facility continues to progress, with Train 2 first cargo expected in the second
quarter of the 2017 financial year.
•  Halladale and Speculant construction works at well site and at the reception facilities in Otway Gas Plant
have completed in readiness for commissioning. First gas is expected late August 2016. 
In the Perth Basin, the execution phase of the Stage 1a Waitsia Gas Project is nearing completion, with 
the commencement of flows expected by end of August.

Underlying LNG EBITDA increased $18 million reflecting the commencement of LNG production ($119 million) 
(including a disproportionate share of operating costs related to infrastructure assets), offset by the impact of 
lower oil prices on Australia Pacific LNG’s domestic gas sales ($63 million) and lower LNG net recovery as 
APLNG upstream capital expenditure declines ($38 million). 
 
The LNG segment result decreased $242 million. APLNG ITDA increased $231 million with the recognition of 
increased  sales  of  natural  gas  and  LNG,  a  disproportionate  share  of  costs  associated  with  infrastructure 
assets  related  to  the  LNG  export  project,  and  MRCPS  interest  expense  paid  by  APLNG  to  shareholders         
(-$58 million). Revenue from increased sales given  the low  oil price environment, have been  insufficient  to 
offset  the  increase  in  ITDA.  Origin’s  net  financing  costs  of  $30  million  reflect  the  partial  movement  into 
underlying earnings (from Items excluded from Underlying Profit in FY2015) of net financing costs associated 
with  the  funding  of  Origin’s  investment  in  APLNG  following  recognition  of  Train  1  LNG  sales,  inclusive  of 
MRCPS income received from APLNG (+$58 million). 
 
Cash flow from operating activities decreased $150 million to ($116 million) due to lower LNG net recovery as 
APLNG upstream capital expenditure declines, and the impact of actions taken to reduce risk in response to 
low oil prices, including the payment of oil put premium ($117 million) to reduce exposure to low oil prices in 
financial year 2017 and insurance related to the completion of the APLNG Project ($37 million).

Total  APLNG  production  increased  by  244  PJe  or  140%  to  418  PJe,  reflecting  commencement  of  LNG 
production  from  Train  1  and  increased  volumes  sold  under  the  QGC  contract.  The  first  shipment  of  LNG 
departed the APLNG facility on Curtis Island on 9 January 2016, with 27 LNG cargoes equating to 98 PJ sold 
during the period and 36 cargoes to date. LNG revenues and expenses related to 72 PJ were recognised in 
earnings from 1 March, 2016. During the period approximately 100 PJ were delivered into the QGC contract.

The  APLNG  export  project  is  a  two  train  project  with  a  design  nameplate  capacity  of  9  million  tonnes  per 
annum of LNG.  
 
APLNG has committed LNG offtake agreements for approximately 20  years with Sinopec for approximately 
7.6 million tonnes per annum and with Kansai Electric for approximately 1 million tonnes per annum. 
 
Project performance and key milestones
The Downstream project was 98% complete at 30 June 2016.  
 
During  the  period,  production  from  operated  fields  was  increased  to  meet  LNG  train  demand.  Average 
production from operated assets increased to 1,047 TJ/d in the June 2016 Quarter from 405 TJ/d in the June 
2015 Quarter, reflecting ongoing commissioning, de-watering and production ramp-up of wells to meet LNG 
Train  1  feed  gas  requirements.  When  combined  with  the  volumes  from  non-operated  assets,  APLNG  is 
expected to produce more than enough to supply domestic contracts and APLNG’s contractual requirements 
under its long term supply contracts with customers in China and Japan.  
 
As at 30 June 2016, a total of 27 cargoes were loaded and shipped to customers, including to Sinopec and 
Kansai in accordance with their respective long term Sales and Purchase Agreements. 
 
The Train 1 facility is now fully operational and is performing as expected with daily production rates achieved 
in excess of design nameplate capacity. The Bechtel Performance Test was completed in April 2016 and the 
Train  1  facility  has  been  handed  over  to  the  Downstream  Operator,  ConocoPhillips.  The  APLNG  Train  1 
operational lenders’ test has commenced and the release of the first tranche of shareholder guarantees is on 
track for the second quarter of the 2017 financial year. 
 
Construction of the Train 2 facility continues to progress. In July 2016, first fire of the last two of seven Gas 
Turbine Generators occurred, and in August 2016 high pressure fuel gas was introduced into the facility. The 
Upstream business continues to ramp up in readiness for Train 2 first cargo, expected in the second quarter of 
the  2017  financial  year.  The  Train  2  lenders’  test  requirements  are  expected  to  be  met  and  the  remaining 
shareholder guarantees released during the 2017 calendar year.

Origin’s share of total production decreased 7.6 PJe or 9% to 74.6 PJe due to lower well deliverability, natural 
field  decline  and  lower  plant  availability  from  planned  statutory  compliance  shutdown  at  Otway  (9.4  PJe), 
partly offset by higher Bass Basin production (3.7 PJe) due to Yolla 5 and Yolla 6 coming on-line during the 
current year. 
 
Sales  volumes  decreased  6.3  PJe  or  7%  to  82.6  PJe  in  line  with  decreased  production.  Commodity  Sales 
Revenue decreased  by  $149 million  or 20% to  $592 million, predominantly  driven by  lower production and 
lower average realised liquid prices (including impact of forward sales and hedging). During the  year Origin 
commenced delivering oil and condensate production under the Oil Forward Sale Agreements. Revenue on 
these volumes is recognised at US$62.40/bbl. 
 
E&P  EBITDA  decreased  $130  million  to  $269  million  due  to  increased  exploration  expense  ($34  million) 
driven by the $53 million write-off of exploration expenditure in Vietnam, lower liquids prices ($60 million), and 
lower production ($48 million), primarily at Otway due to lower well deliverability and lower plant availability 
from a planned statutory compliance shutdown, partly offset by lower general operating costs ($7 million). 
 
Cash flow from operating activities decreased $259 million to $142 million due to lower EBITDA adjusted for 
non-cash  exploration  expense  (-$96  million),  and  the  commencement  of  oil  and  condensate  production 
deliveries into the Oil Forward Sale Agreements (-$139 million)43.

Total  expenses  increased  by  $20  million  or  7%  to  $306  million  primarily  reflecting  increased  exploration 
expense ($34 million) driven by the $53 million write-off of exploration expenditure in Vietnam, partly offset by 
a  decrease  in  royalties,  tariffs  and  freight  ($7  million)  due  to  lower  sales  volumes  and  revenue  and  lower 
general operating costs ($7 million). 
 
Further  information  regarding  production,  sales  volumes  and  revenues  is  provided  in  Origin’s  June  2016 
Quarterly Production Report, available at www.originenergy.com.au. 
 
Capital Expenditure
Capital expenditure decreased $149 million from the prior period as growth projects start to complete. Capital 
expenditure for the period of $412 million included: 
•  Halladale / Speculant - $146 million; 
•  Bass Basin - $66 million; 
•  Cooper Basin - $85 million; 
•  Beetaloo and Cooper Basin farm-ins - $43 million; 
•  Perth Basin - $18 million, primarily Senecio/Waitsia; and 
•  Other assets $54 million. 
 
Reserves
Origin’s proved plus probable (2P) reserves increased by 111 PJe (after production of 74 PJe) to a total of 
1,204 PJe excluding Origin’s share of APLNG reserves, compared with 30 June 2015. 
 
Origin undertakes a full assessment of its reserves on an annual basis at the end of the financial year. A full 
statement of reserves attributable to Origin at 30 June 2016 is included in Origin’s Annual Reserves Report 
released to ASX on 29 July 2016 and available on Origin’s website at www.originenergy.com.au. 
 
Operations
Production and Development
Origin’s producing operations include assets in the Bass and Otway Basins off the south coast of Victoria, the 
Cooper  Basin  in  central  Australia  the  Perth  Basin  in  Western  Australia  and  the  Taranaki  Basin  in  New 
Zealand. 
 
Origin’s development activities during the year reflected actions taken by Origin to limit capital expenditure to 
completing projects that have commenced and utilise existing infrastructure. 
 
In the Bass Basin, the Yolla-5 and Yolla-6 production wells were commissioned and production commenced 
during the  year. The tie-in and commissioning of the compression and condensate modules onto  the  Yolla 
platform commenced during the current year with the modules planned to be online late in the 2017 financial 
year.
Progress continued on the development of the Halladale/Speculant project in the Otway Basin. Installation of 
the Halladale and Speculant pipeline from the well site to Otway Gas Plant and the construction works at the 
well site and at the reception facilities have completed in readiness for commissioning. First gas is expected 
late August 2016. 
  
Execution phase of the Stage 1a Waitsia Gas Project is nearing completion, with the commencement of flows 
expected by end of August 2016.  
 
Exploration and Appraisal
Development  and  appraisal  activities  within  Australia  and  New  Zealand  during  the  period  were  confined  to 
joint venture and permit commitments. 
 
In the Beetaloo Basin drilling operations recommenced during the period with the re-entry and casing of the 
Amungee NW-1H well drilled in 2015. Subsequent to the end of the period, Beetaloo W-1 was spudded on 22 
July, with civil works ongoing as part of the 2016 calendar year campaign which includes the drilling of two 
vertical wells.  
 
As part of Origin’s obligations under the CBOS Farmin Agreements entered into in 2014, Origin committed to 
a multi well work programme in the Cooper Basin. In fulfilment of the farm-in obligations, the hydraulic fracture 
stimulation of the Ethereal-1 exploration well in PEL 637 commenced during the year and extended production 
testing is scheduled for early in the 2017 financial year.  
 
Also  in  fulfilment  of  CBOS  farm-in  obligations,  planning  continued  for  the  drilling  of  two  wells  in  PEL  638 
scheduled for the 2017 financial year. Origin’s interest in these permits provides the opportunity to participate 
in technology trials and further develop learnings which may be applicable in the Beetaloo and marginal and 
low permeability CSG acreage.

RISKS RELATED TO ORIGIN’S FUTURE FINANCIAL PROSPECTS
The scope of operations and activities means that Origin is exposed to risks that can have a material impact 
on our financial prospects and reputation. Material risks, and the Company’s approach to managing them, are 
summarised below.
Risk Management Framework 
Origin has a risk management framework overseen by the Board Risk Committee. Origin’s approach to risk 
management aims to embed a risk-aware culture in all decision-making and to manage risk in a proactive and 
effective  manner.  This  includes  identifying,  evaluating,  managing  and  monitoring  risks,  and  mitigating  their 
impact should they materialise. If a risk, such as natural disasters, cannot be managed using internal controls, 
it is transferred to third parties via insurance where commercially possible.
Material Risks 
The material risks in this section have been categorised as Strategic, Operational, Financial or Project. Should 
any of the risks identified be realised, these risks could materially affect Origin’s ability to meet its objectives 
and  impact  on  future  financial  performance,  either  directly  or  by  triggering  a  succession  of  events  that,  in 
aggregate, becomes material.  
 
Strategic 
Strategic risks arise from uncertainties that may emerge in the medium to longer term and, while they 
may  not  necessarily  impact  on  short  term  profits,  can  have  immediate  impact  on  the  value  of  the 
Company.  These  risks  are  managed  through  ongoing  planning  and  the  allocation  of  resources  and 
attention from management and the Board. 
Culture 
Origin’s Purpose, Principles, Values and Commitments are set out in Origin’s Compass, which guides 
how things are done at Origin and defines Origin’s culture. It guides good decision making in a way 
that is common across Origin. Origin relies on its people to reflect the Compass in all things that they 
do.  Failure  to  comply  with  the  Compass  may  affect  Origin’s  risk  profile,  business  operations  and 
financial prospects.  
Competition  
Origin  operates  in  a  highly  competitive  environment,  which  can  result  in  downward  pressure  on 
margins, customer losses and higher costs to serve. Origin’s strategy to build  customer loyalty  and 
trust  by  improving  customer  experience  and  creating  differentiated  product  offerings  to  move  the 
customer conversation away from price helps to mitigate this risk. Origin’s strategy is to be competitive 
on cost of energy and cost to serve.  
 
Competition for generation capacity and sources of fuel can impact the cost of energy. Development 
of competing generation technologies can displace our existing generation assets.  
 
The potential discovery or commissioning of significant new gas resources in eastern Australia could 
have a significant impact on the gas supply and demand dynamics and therefore gas prices in eastern 
Australia.  LNG  production  in  Queensland  competes  with  domestic  gas  demand  and  could  result  in 
material changes to the domestic gas price. Origin is able to partially mitigate its exposure by altering 
how it manages its wholesale and generation portfolio. 
Technological developments / disruption  
Energy  demand  through  the  grid  is  impacted  by  the  growth  in  distributed  generation,  appliance 
efficiency, closures across energy intensive industries and smaller average dwelling size. Technology
also has the potential to disrupt by enabling competition to provide new energy solutions which adopt 
lower  cost  or  new  business  models  (e.g.  using  Cloud  technology).  Origin’s  strategy  is  to  meet  this 
change  by  growing  our  distributed  generation  and  home  energy  services  business  in  the  consumer 
and business markets and, where appropriate, monitoring, reviewing and trialling new technology. 
Oil and gas reserves and resources  
Origin  is  involved  in  oil  and  gas  exploration  and  there  is  no  assurance  that  resources  will  be 
discovered  through  these  activities  or  that  any  particular  undeveloped  reserves  will  proceed  to 
development or will be ultimately recovered. There is a risk that actual production may vary from that 
predicted. Origin employs established industry procedures to identify and consider areas for potential 
exploration. Origin monitors reservoir performance and adjusts development plans accordingly. 
Demand for energy 
The  volume  of  electricity,  gas  and  LPG  the  Company  sells  is  dependent  on  our  customer’s  energy 
usage. Reductions in energy demand from price changes, consumer perception of energy affordability, 
consumer  behaviour,  operational  closures  across  energy 
technological 
advancement, mandatory energy efficiency schemes, weather and other factors, can reduce Origin’s 
revenues  and  adversely  affect  Origin’s  future  financial  performance.  Origin  constantly  monitors  and 
reviews consumption patterns and trends to identify changes in energy demand. 
Regulatory policy 
Origin  operates  in  highly  regulated  environments  and  is  exposed  to  changes  in  regulatory  policy. 
Origin manages its exposure to industry  wide regulatory risk through active engagement with policy 
makers and preparing for regulatory and legislative changes. 
Climate change 
Origin is exposed to changes in regulatory policy as a result of climate change. Origin’s strategy for 
transitioning  into  a  carbon  constrained  future  comprises  balancing  our  position  to  remain  flexible  in 
decarbonisation scenarios. We aim for a leading renewable position to meet our Renewable Energy 
Target.  
 
In the medium term, increasing levels of renewables driven by Renewable Energy Targets will have an 
effect on baseload fossil fuel generation. Origin invests directly or indirectly in utility scale renewables 
and leverage its peaking generation capacity to manage the intermittency of renewables will help to 
mitigate this risk. 
Financial
industries,
intensive
Financial risks are the risks that directly impact the financial performance and resilience of Origin. The 
Board manages these risks by setting limits on the overall financial exposure that Origin is prepared to 
take, and has commodity and treasury risk management systems to monitor and report performance 
against these limits. Origin manages commodity price risk through a combination of physical positions 
and derivatives contracts. 
Commodity 
  Oil prices - Origin has a material long term exposure to the international oil price through the sale 
of  gas,  oil,  LPG  and  its  investment  in  APLNG.  Pricing  can  be  volatile  and  downward  price 
movements  can  impact  on  our  cash  flow,  financial  performance,  recoverable  reserves  and  asset 
carrying values.
  Wholesale  electricity  prices  and  volumes  –  Prices  for  electricity  Origin  sources  to  on-sell  to 
customers  are  volatile  and  are  influenced  by  many  factors  that  are  difficult  to  predict,  including 
operating constraints at Origin’s power stations. Customer volumes also vary on a daily basis and 
over time.
  Other  commodity  prices  -  Origin  is  exposed  to  price  fluctuations  in  respect  of  coal  and  gas 
purchases for electricity generation and gas, renewable energy and LPG for on-sale to customers. 
Higher prices erode our margins if we are unable to pass on additional costs to customers. Lower
prices impact our margins and asset carrying value for gas producing assets.
Foreign  exchange  and  interest  rates  -  Origin  is  exposed  to  interest  rate  movements  and  foreign 
exchange rate fluctuations. This impacts the Australian dollar value of foreign currency denominated 
assets and liabilities, revenues, dividends received and expenses. 
Credit  /  counterparty  -  Some counterparties  may  fail  to  fulfil  their  obligations  (in  whole  or  in  part), 
under major hedge and sales contracts. APLNG has long term off take agreements with Sinopec and 
Kansai, who account for the majority of its LNG revenues. There is a risk Origin is unable to effectively 
bill and or collect outstanding debt from customers.  
Insurance  –  Losses  and  liabilities  from  uninsured  or  underinsured  events  could  reduce  Origin’s 
revenue or increase costs.   
Tax – Any change in, or change in the interpretation, application or enforcement of, applicable tax laws 
regulations,  royalty  regimes  or  any  actual  or  alleged  failure  to  comply  could  significantly  increase 
Origin’s tax liability and expose Origin to legal, regulatory and other actions that could adversely affect 
Origin’s financial performance and prospects. 
APLNG  is  required  to  pay  royalties  on  its  production  to  the  Queensland  government.   APLNG  has 
disputed  in  the  Queensland  courts  the  petroleum  royalty  decision  received  from  the  Queensland 
Treasurer.  There  is  a  risk  APLNG  may  not  be  successful  in  this  dispute  and  this  may  impact  the 
quantum of royalties APLNG is required to pay. 
Access  to  capital  markets  –  Origin  considers  that  it  has  sufficient  liquidity  through  currently 
committed credit facilities. However, if it fails to appropriately manage its liquidity position, or if markets 
are not available to Origin at the time of any financing or refinancing that it requires, due to general 
market conditions or matters specific to Origin such as a credit rating downgrade, there is a risk that 
Origin’s business, prospects and financial flexibility will be adversely affected.  
APLNG’s  project  finance  facility  (US$8.5  billion)  –  The  facility  is  severally  guaranteed  by  each 
APLNG  shareholder  (including  Origin)  in  its  respective  shareholding  proportions  during  the  project 
construction  phase.  These  guarantees  will  be  released  if  the  project  satisfies  customary  completion 
tests. A delay in satisfying the requirements will mean Origin’s guarantee remains in place for longer, 
and failure to pass the completion tests could result in a requirement for early repayment of debt. The 
project  finance  facility  contains  restrictions  on  APLNG  making  shareholder  distributions  if  specified 
financial metrics are not satisfied. 
Operational 
Operational  Risks  arise  from  inadequate  or  failed  internal  processes,  people  or  systems  or  from 
external events. This could impact the environment, the health and safety of our people and members 
of  the  public  or  the  sustainability  of  our  operations  and  assets  and  in  turn  adversely  affect  Origin’s 
financial prospects. 
Origin’s risk management framework operates to identify, manage, monitor and mitigate operational 
risk. It sets out the minimum standards that Origin expects for all operated assets. Origin management 
systems operate to see that our assets are well designed, safely operated and properly maintained.  
Core operations are subject to periodic audits and assurance. Origin maintains an extensive insurance 
program  to  mitigate  consequences  by  transferring  financial  risk  exposure  to  third  parties  where 
commercially possible. 
Health and safety - The complexity, scale and geography of Origin’s operations give rise to a range of 
health, safety and security risks, including air, land or marine transport and other work related safety 
exposures.  
Cyber  security  -  A  cyber  security  incident  could  lead  to  a  breach  of  privacy,  disruption  of  critical 
business processes, loss of or corruption of data or theft of commercially sensitive information.
Production – Operating activities include oil and gas projects, power generation, LPG facilities and 
CSG to LNG processing, through APLNG. These activities are exposed to outages and the potential to 
damage, both directly and as a result of a natural disaster, plant failure,  interruptions to fuel supply 
required  to  operate  the  assets  or  failure  or  unavailability  of  third  party  infrastructure,  including 
transmission, distribution and pipeline infrastructure. 
Process safety - Production assets are exposed to process safety and loss of containment risks. 
Environment - The complexity, scale and geography of projects and operations give rise to a range of 
potential  effects  on  the  environment,  including  Origin’s  carbon  emissions,  water  use,  waste 
management, and impacts on biodiversity.  
Social - Origin’s activities give rise to potential disturbance or harm to communities and a range of 
risks including land access, impacts on people, and social and economic impacts on communities.  
Joint ventures – Origin participates in a number of joint ventures which, in some cases, are operated 
by a third party. That partner may have economic or other business interests that are inconsistent with 
our own and may take actions contrary to the objectives or interests of Origin. There is also a risk that 
joint venture partners may become bankrupt, default on or fail to fulfil their obligations as required or 
expected thereby impacting the performance of the joint venture and adversely affecting Origin or its 
interest in the joint venture. 
Litigation  and  dispute  resolution  -  The  nature  of  Origin’s  business  means  we  are  exposed  to 
litigation,  regulatory  actions  or  dispute  resolution  processes,  investigations,  inquiries,  disputes  or 
claims.  
  Reversion  –  The  CSG  interests  that  APLNG  acquired  from  Tri-Star  in  2002  are  subject  to 
reversionary rights. If triggered, these rights will require APLNG to transfer back to Tri-Star a 45% 
interest in those CSG interests for no additional consideration. The reversion trigger will occur when 
APLNG  has  recovered  from  its  revenue  derived  from  the  acquired  CSG  interests  its  expenditure 
relating to the acquired CSG interests plus interest on that expenditure, its royalty payments and the 
original acquisition price. Approximately 21% of APLNG’s 3P CSG reserves as of 30 June 2016 are 
subject to these reversionary rights.
  Tri-Star has commenced proceedings against APLNG claiming that reversion has occurred. APLNG 
denies that claim and is defending it. If Tri-Star’s claim is not successfully defended, Tri-Star may be 
entitled  to  an  order  that  reversion  occurred  as  early  as  1  November  2008  and  the  reserves  and 
resources that are subject to reversion may not be available for APLNG to sell or use. These events 
may  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the  financial  performance  of  APLNG  and  therefore 
significantly affect the amount and timing of cash flows from APLNG to its shareholders, including 
Origin. 
Project  
Origin undertakes investments in a variety of major projects including gas and oil projects, electricity 
generation and operational systems. These major projects are exposed to the effectiveness of Origin’s 
project  management  and  events  outside  of  Origin’s  control,  such  as  weather  events  or  natural 
disasters, which may result in adverse cost and schedule implications and, in turn, Origin’s financial 
prospects.  Origin  manages  major  projects  in  accordance  with  well-established  project  management 
processes. 
Environmental and social regulatory obligations are  maintained and managed for projects, including 
the APLNG’s CSG-to-LNG project. Origin and APLNG’s processes and internal compliance monitoring 
are designed to ensure activities are conducted in accordance with all approval obligations. 
The construction phase of the APLNG Project is nearing completion. The first cargo from Train 2 of 
APLNG is expected in the second quarter of the 2017 financial year. Delay in the start-up of Train 2 
would delay cash flow, the recognition of revenue and costs in underlying earnings and may also affect 
APLNG’s  ability  to  satisfy  the  project  finance  completion  tests  and  subsequent  removal  of  Origin’s 
several guarantee of its share of the project finance facility.

Non-IFRS Financial Measures
This document includes certain Non-IFRS Financial Measures. Non-IFRS Financial Measures are defined as 
financial measures that are presented other than in accordance with all relevant Accounting Standards. Non-
IFRS Financial Measures are used internally by management to assess the performance of Origin’s business, 
and to make decisions on allocation of resources. The Non-IFRS Financial Measures have been derived from 
Statutory Financial Measures included in the Origin Consolidated Financial Statements, and are provided in 
this report, along with the Statutory Financial Measures to enable further insight and a different perspective 
into the financial performance, including profit and loss and cash flow outcomes, of the Origin business. 
 
The principle non-IFRS profit and loss measure of Underlying Profit has been reconciled to Statutory Profit in 
Appendix 1. The key Non-IFRS Financial Measures included in this report are defined below.

Items that do not align with the manner in which the Managing Director reviews the 
financial and operating performance of the business which are excluded from 
Underlying Profit. Items excluded from Underlying Profit are categorised as: 
Fair value and foreign exchange movements – reflecting the impact of mark to market 
movements on financial assets and liabilities from period to period 
LNG related items before revenue recognition – primarily comprising net financing 
costs incurred (but unable to be capitalised) in funding Origin’s investment in APLNG 
which relate to the period prior to revenue recognition for each of the two LNG Trains.  
Disposals, impairments and business restructuring – reflecting the impact of actions 
and decisions to dispose, acquire, revalue or restructure the company’s assets and 
business operations. 
Total revenue for the Energy Markets, Integrated Gas, Contact Energy and Corporate 
segments, including inter-segment sales, as disclosed in note A1 of the Origin 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
Underlying interest expense for the current period divided by Origin’s average drawn 
debt during the current period (excluding funding related to APLNG).

REMUNERATION REPORT 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 
This report is attached to and forms part of the Directors’ Report
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Each  year the Non-executive  Directors (NEDs) undertake a review of Origin’s remuneration practices  to 
ensure the current approach remains appropriate. In so doing the NEDs:
•  Consider feedback from shareholders; 
•  Examine emerging market practice; and 
•  Test remuneration outcomes against company performance.
Last year the Board engaged remuneration advisor Pay Governance to undertake a comprehensive review 
of  executive  remuneration  and  structure.    The  review  confirmed  that,  while  the  basic  structure  of  the 
remuneration system was appropriate, changes could be made that would strengthen alignment between 
executive and shareholder interests, particularly in relation to the use of capital and cash. 
 
Those changes were implemented during FY2016, following communication with shareholders through last 
year’s Remuneration Report.  More specifically, the following changes have been made.
•  Overall
o  More  specific  peer  groups  were  adopted  for  the  overall  At  Target  and  Maximum

remuneration  benchmarks 
companies that were larger and the 10 companies that were smaller than Origin plus AGL, 
Woodside, Santos and Oil Search (if they are not already in that group).
for  executive  remuneration,  namely
•  Short Term Incentive (STI)
o  Operating  Cash  Flow  After  Tax  (OCAT  Ratio)  was  replaced  with  a  Net  Cash  from
Operating and Investing Activities (NCOIA) performance metric in the STI plan; and
o  Vesting periods for Deferred STI for senior executives were lengthened from an average of 
two  years  to  an  average  of  three  years.    Vesting  for  grants  of  Deferred  Share  Rights 
(DSRs)  relating  to  FY2016  will  occur  over  two,  three  and  four  years  to  better  align 
outcomes with the Company’s investment cycle, rather than one, two and three years as 
was previously the case.
•  Long Term Incentive (LTI)
o  A second hurdle was introduced based on Return on Average Capital Employed (ROCE). 
This measure applies to the Performance Share Rights (PSRs) component of LTI, while 
the relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) hurdle will apply to the Options component;
o  The allocation methodology for PSRs has been changed and is now based on face value
(previously fair value discounted for performance hurdles was used);
o  The ratio of Options to PSRs in the LTI mix was changed from 75:25 to 50:50; 
o  A more specific comparator group was adopted for the TSR hurdle than the S&P/ASX 100 
companies that were previously used.  The revised group is defined at the commencement 
of the performance period as those 10 ASX-listed companies that are larger than and 10 
that are smaller than Origin plus AGL, Woodside, Santos and Oil Search (if they are not 
already in that group).
o  The  average  vesting  period  for  senior  executives  has  been  lengthened  such  that  the 
Options  tranche  is  now  subject  to  a  five-year  vesting  period,  while  retaining  the  vesting 
period for PSRs at four years.
These changes have been made to:
•  Align  overall  remuneration  outcomes  to  companies  of  comparable  size,  given  the  changes  in 
Origin’s market capitalisation and its near term performance. The Board has exercised discretion 
downwards for STI and LTI to achieve these outcomes;
•  Strengthen the linkage to capital management; 
•  Strengthen the linkage between the STI plan hurdles and short term profitability; 
•  Better align the length of vesting periods for both Deferred STI and LTI arrangements to Origin’s
investment cycle; and
PSRs in response to market feedback.
•  Set  the  mix  of  Options  and  PSRs  to  an  appropriate  level  and  review  the  allocation  process  for
Directors  consider  that  the  changes  made  will  further  strengthen  the  alignment  with  the  interests  of 
shareholders. Directors recommend that shareholders read the full Remuneration Report to understand the 
nature of that alignment.

INTRODUCTION
Following  enhancements  to  Origin’s  remuneration  approach  that  were  implemented  during  FY2016, 
Directors consider that:
•  The remuneration system is focused on delivering shareholder value over the long term (Section
2);
•  Remuneration outcomes for executives reflect returns to shareholders (Section 3); and 
•  Appropriate governance and remuneration arrangements for NEDs provide a strong focus on
shareholders’ interests (Section 4).
This  report  is  focused  on  executives  who  are  Key  Management  Personnel  (KMP).  It  also  provides  a 
broader perspective on other employees of the Group1 whose remuneration includes awards under the LTI 
arrangements (which at June 2016 included another approximately 80 executives).

ORIGIN’S EXISTING REMUNERATION SYSTEM IS FOCUSED ON 
DELIVERING SHAREHOLDER VALUE OVER THE LONG TERM
The overriding objective of Origin’s remuneration system is to align the interests of staff and shareholders, 
while attracting and retaining valuable staff. Origin strives to do this by:
•  Aligning  the  interests  of  executives  and  shareholders  by  providing  rewards  that  support
shareholder value creation; and
•  Attracting  and  retaining  high  calibre  executives  from  diverse  backgrounds  through  a  fair  and 
incentivises  superior
remuneration  structure
competitive 
performance over the longer term.
that  appropriately
rewards  and
Origin’s  senior  management  remuneration,  including  for  KMP,  consists  of  three  main  elements,  namely 
Fixed Remuneration, STI and LTI. 
 
Origin’s remuneration policy is designed so that each of these elements supports the overall objectives.  In 
addition,  the  policy  works to  reward  superior  executive  performance  by  paying  in  the  top  quartile  of  the 
market when superior outcomes are delivered for shareholders. 
 
For  KMP  roles,  Origin’s  position  in  the  market  is  benchmarked  against  industry  peers  and  comparably 
sized S&P/ASX companies.  Directors have exercised discretion to ensure that overall remuneration is held 
within  the  overall  limits  of  those  benchmarks,  recognising  the  change  in  the  company’s  overall  market 
capitalisation. 
 
As  the  Group  employs  staff  across  a  broad  spectrum  of  roles  and  disciplines,  the  Hay  Group’s  All 
Organisations’ benchmark, representing approximately 430 organisations, is used as the major reference 
for non-KMP roles2. 
 
The way Fixed Remuneration, STI and LTI operate together is described in greater detail in Sections 2.1 to 
2.6. 
 
 
2.1
Fixed Remuneration is benchmarked to the midpoint of the external market 
to attract quality people who can deliver value for shareholders
Fixed Remuneration takes into account the size and complexity of a recipient’s role and the skills required 
to succeed in such a position. It includes cash salary, employer contributions to superannuation and salary 
sacrifice benefits. 
 
It  is  regularly  reviewed  against  the  median  of  comparably  sized  companies,  while  recognising  the 
difficulties of reducing Fixed Remuneration when a market discontinuity occurs such as has happened in 
the past 12 months, largely in response to the fall in oil prices. 
 
2.2  STI awards are designed to reward superior achievement for shareholders in
relation to key operational measures
STI  plays  a  key  role  in  aligning  superior  operational  outcomes  for  shareholders  with  remuneration 
outcomes for management. 
 
STI opportunity levels vary according to the Business Unit served by the executive and according to their 
role.  The amount at risk increases with job size and the capacity to influence the overall performance of 
the business (Tables 1 and 2). 
 
The amount of STI awarded reflects overall corporate performance as well as Business Unit financial and 
operational outcomes over the course of the year.
2 For job families in skill shortage areas (such as geosciences and some professional specialists) the relevant market has been 
determined by reference to smaller peer groups such as those sourced from commissioned surveys and industry forums, including 
National Rewards Group.

To achieve the maximum award, the recipient’s relevant operational targets must be significantly exceeded. 
Delivering  targeted  operational  outcomes  results  in  an  award  of  60%  of  maximum  STI.  If  targeted 
outcomes are not achieved, the award of STI is reduced proportionally below 60% (to zero where threshold 
outcomes  are  not  achieved).  The  Board  retains  discretion  to  adjust  outcomes,  upwards  or  downwards, 
where it considers it appropriate to do so. Such discretion has been regularly used by the Board. 
 
The Managing Director’s STI is determined by reference to the Group’s financial and safety performance 
for the  year; the Company’s overall Employee Engagement Score; and a  number of personal measures 
that  reflect  strategic  and  people  priorities,  including  delivering  value  for  shareholders  and  succession 
planning. 
 
STI for other executives is determined by reference to Group performance as well as Business Unit and 
personal  operational  measures.  Examples  of  Business  Unit  measures  include  safety  outcomes; 
engagement  scores;  project  delivery  milestones;  production  metrics  (especially  in  the  Integrated  Gas 
Business Unit) or customer satisfaction and profitability (especially in the Energy Markets’ Business Unit). 
 
All  STI  recipients  have  exposure  to  the  Group’s  financial  performance.  For  FY2016  two  Group  financial 
metrics applied with equal weighting: 
•  Net cash from operating and investing activities (‘NCOIA’). This measure was adopted for the first time
this year; and
•  Underlying earnings per share (EPS). 
 
These two measures have been adopted in response to shareholder feedback and reflect the importance 
of earnings per share and cash generation after investment as key drivers of returns to shareholders.   
 
The  degree  of  exposure  to  Group  and  Division  financial  metrics  increases  with  increasing  job  size,  as 
shown in Table 2.

Group measures and outcomes are approved by the Board. Business Unit goals are set by the Managing

Managing Director is assessed by the Managing Director, reviewed by the Remuneration Committee and

assessing whether to exercise discretion, the Board pays particular attention to items in the accounts below

Deferred STI is awarded in the form of DSRs. A DSR is the right to a fully paid share 
in the Company at no cost. 
Unvested DSRs carry no entitlement to dividends and no voting rights. 
As no dividends are paid on DSRs, their maximum value is the Face Value5 less the 
discounted value of any dividends foregone6. The number of DSRs to be awarded is 
calculated as the dollar allocation value (one-third of the total STI award) divided by 
the maximum value. The minimum value of the DSRs is nil, which will be the case if 
the ongoing service and personal performance conditions are not met. 
For  the  Managing  Director,  awards  recommended  by  the  Board  are  submitted  for 
approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held immediately after the 
year to which they relate. 
DSRs  vest  over  two,  three  and  four  years,  subject  to  continuing  service  and 
satisfactory personal performance7 obligations.8,9   The DSRs awarded in respect of 
the 
into 
in  number,  with 
corresponding deferral (vesting) periods. 
In the case of ‘Other Executives’, where smaller DSR parcels are allocated, all DSRs 
have  a  two  year  service  and  personal  performance  obligation  (and  corresponding 
two year deferral.) 
DSRs vest on meeting the service and personal performance conditions. Exercise of 
DSRs is automatic on vesting and the exercise price is nil. DSRs that do not vest on 
the service condition date lapse immediately. DSRs are subject to clawback (Section 
2.5). 
On a capital reorganisation, the number of unvested DSRs to which each participant 
is entitled may be adjusted in a manner determined by the Board to minimise or 
eliminate any material advantage or disadvantage to the participant.10 
DSRs are forfeited if the service and performance conditions are not met, except in 
exceptional circumstances11. In those circumstances, the DSRs, which represent a 
portion  of  ‘earned’  STI,  will  vest  at  cessation,  unless  the  Board  determines 
otherwise. 
If a Change of Control12 occurs prior to the vesting of DSRs the Board has discretion 
to bring forward vesting dates.
4 Except where an award is to be made to an executive who is unable to serve a tenure requirement by virtue of death, disability, 
redundancy, genuine retirement, or other exceptional circumstances as approved by the Board. In those limited circumstances no 
amount of the STI is deferred and the STI will be awarded wholly in cash. 
5  Face  value  is  the  present  day  market  value  of  an  Origin  share.  For  awards  subject  to  shareholder  approval,  the  Face  value  is 
referenced to the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) 10-day pricing period if the DRP is in operation, otherwise it is a 10-day Volume 
Weighted Average Price to a date in mid-September. For general awards, it is measured as a 30-day Volume Weighted Average Price 
over the 15 trading days prior to and including 30 June of the financial year to which the STI award relates and the 15 following trading 
days. 
6 If no dividends are recommended to be paid to shareholders during the performance period, no discount is applied and the 
maximum value is Face value. 
7 Satisfactory personal performance is assessed under Origin’s standard performance and development cycle. 
8 For FY2015 and prior, the tranches were one, two and three years respectively. 
9 Deferred STI awards are awarded in respect of the current year’s performance to 30 June, but granted in the following financial 
year. The accounting expense for these grants is recognised from the commencement (1 July) of the current financial year, i.e. the 
beginning of the STI earning performance period. In the following financial year the accumulated expense recognised is ‘trued-up’ 
according to the number of instruments expected to vest. This valuation is then used to recognise the expense over the remaining 
expensing periods. 
10 If new awards are granted, they will, unless the Board determines otherwise, be subject to the same terms and conditions as the 
original awards. 
11 The circumstances are defined as death, disability, redundancy, genuine retirement, or other exceptional circumstance approved by 
the Board. 
12 On a person/entity acquiring 20% or more of the relevant interest in the Company pursuant to a takeover bid that has become 
unconditional, or on a person/entity otherwise acquiring 20% or more of a relevant interest in the issued capital of the Company.

LTI  awards  are  designed  to  align  executive  remuneration  with  financial 
outcomes for shareholders over the longer term
Target Value

0%
LTI arrangements provide executives with a deferred equity interest in Origin, the value of which depends 
on  the  extent  to  which  the  performance  hurdle  is  met  and  exceeded;  and  by  the  extent  of  share  price 
appreciation  in  the  case  of  PSRs,  or  in  the  case  of  Options,  the  amount  by  which  the  share  price  has 
appreciated  above  the  exercise  price.  Fundamentally,  this  means  that  if  shareholders  do  well,  the 
Executive  does  well.  Conversely,  if  shareholders  do  not  do  well,  the  Executive  does  not  do  well.  This 
creates alignment between shareholders and the Executive. 
 
A grant of LTI is considered for Executive KMP and approximately 80 other executives, who, in the view of 
the  Directors,  are  involved  in  long-term  strategic  decisions  that  are  company  transformational  with 
significant strategic implications. 
 
The Target Value of an Executive’s LTI allocation is determined by the position held and the executive’s 
influence on the long-term performance of the Company, as summarised in Table 4. 
 
Table 4: LTI allocation as a percentage of Fixed Remuneration, FY2016 
 
Position

Other Executive KMP (average) 
Other EMT (average) 
Other Executives (average) 
 
As  a  general  principle,  Origin’s  LTI  scheme  is  designed  so  that  high  performing  executives,  over  time, 
come close to the Target Value in their LTI allocation. Nonetheless, LTI allocations are made having regard 
to: 
•  Benchmark levels of unvested equity relative to market to meet incentive and retention objectives and
% of Fixed Remuneration 
Minimum
120% 
76% 
50% 
35%
to build potential equity stakes that will appropriately align executive and shareholder interests;
•  The performance and potential of each executive; and 
•  The overall impact of LTI on overall remuneration, having regard to benchmark comparables. 
 
The actual allocation to be made to an Executive in any year may vary below the Target Value (including to 
zero) depending on the level of unvested equity held relative to benchmark, as well as the performance and 
potential of the Executive. 
 
In  exceptional,  but  limited  circumstances,  the  Board  may  determine  that  an  LTI  allocation  that  is  higher 
than the Target Value is warranted. In all cases, the LTI allocation is subject to Board discretion, and in the 
case of the Managing Director, to shareholder approval. 
 
Table 5 summarises the future potential value of LTI allocations granted as equity in the form of Options 
and PSRs, subject to varying outcomes.

Maximum
The future value of a PSR cannot be 
calculated because it will reflect the share 
price at the time.  The maximum present-
day value, assuming full vesting, is the 
current Face Value of a share less the 
discounted value of dividends foregone (if 
any) over the vesting period, multiplied by 
the number of PSRs granted.  
It is not possible to determine a maximum 
value for an Option. The exercise price 
payable for an Option is set as the 
current market value of an Origin share. 
Therefore, the present day value of an 
Option (Face Value less the exercise 
price to pay) is zero. 
The attribution of any value to a vested 
Option requires an assumption about the 
amount by which the future share price at 
vesting will exceed the exercise price, 
less the value of any dividends foregone 
(if any) over the five year vesting period.
The performance conditions (hurdles) are described in Table 6. 
 
As  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  a  maximum  potential  value  (assuming  full  vesting)  for  the  Options 
component, there is no “maximum value” that can be specified for the overall future potential LTI. 
 
The  number  of  PSRs  that  are  awarded  is  calculated  by  taking  half  of  the  dollar  value  of  the  LTI  award 
(determined with reference to the Target Value in Table 4) and dividing it by the Face Value of a share. 
 
The number of Options that are awarded is calculated by taking the remaining half of the dollar value of the 
LTI award and dividing it by the expected value of an Option from Table 5. 
 
The  performance  period  for  Options  is  five  years  and  for  PSRs  it  is  four  years.  This  represents  a 
lengthening of the vesting period from its previously being four years for both Options and PSRs.

LTI is awarded in the form of: 
(a)  PSRs, which are the right to a fully paid share in the Company at no cost; and 
(b)  Options, which are the right to a fully paid share in the Company upon payment
of an exercise price (see below).
For Executive KMP, Other Executive Management Team and more senior Other 
Executives, the LTI award is split half as PSRs and half as Options. The grant for the 
remaining Other Executives is wholly in PSRs. 
PSRs and Options carry no voting rights or entitlements to dividends. 
For the Managing Director, awards recommended by the Board are submitted for 
approval by shareholders at the AGM held immediately after the year to which they 
relate. 
The number of PSRs allocated for each Executive is calculated by reference to the 
Face Value. 
The number of Options allocated for each Executive is calculated by reference to 
their expected value (Table 5). As identified in Table 5, the Face Value of an Option 
is zero and, therefore, cannot be used for allocation purposes. 
As the performance condition for Options (Relative TSR) is a market-based hurdle, 
the expected value is determined using the same methodology as is used to 
determine the accounting fair value used for expensing purposes. 
The expected value for Options takes into account the fact that dividends are not 
paid on Options; some or all of the Options might not vest; an exercise price must be 
paid on vesting; and even if vesting occurs, the share price at the vesting date might 
or might not be above the exercise price of the Option. 
The exercise price for PSRs is nil. 
The exercise price for Options that are subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting (namely, those for the Managing Director) is referenced to 
the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) 10-day pricing period if the DRP is in 
operation, otherwise it is a 10-day Volume Weighted Average Price to the date in 
September that the DRP would have otherwise applied. For general awards, it is 
measured as a 30-day Volume Weighted Average Price over the 15 trading days 
prior to and including 30 June of the financial year to which the LTI award relates 
and the following 15 trading days. 
Vesting of PSRs and Options are subject to performance conditions. 
For PSRs, the hurdle is a ROCE measure, more specifically a statutory Origin EBIT 
divided by a Funds Employed measure13. 
For Options, the hurdle is TSR relative to a Reference Group of companies. The 
Reference Group is determined at the beginning of the performance period and 
comprises the 10 ASX-listed companies that are larger than and the 10 that are 
smaller than Origin plus AGL, Woodside, Santos and Oil Search (if they are not 
already in that group).14 The TSRs are measured over the five year performance 
period.
13The numerator in the calculation will be Origin’s EBIT and Origin’s share of APLNG EBIT plus the Dilution Adjustment. Origin’s EBIT 
and Origin’s share of APLNG EBIT is Statutory Origin EBIT adjusted to remove the following items: a. Origin’s share of APLNG 
interest and tax (which is included in Origin’s reported EBIT); b. Items excluded from underlying earnings in the (decrease)/increase in 
fair value of financial instruments and LNG items category (with the LNG items category expected to cease once Train 2 commences 
operations). It should be noted that gains and losses on disposals and impairments will only be excluded subject to Board discretion. 
The denominator of Average Capital Employed equals Shareholders Equity plus Origin Debt plus Origin’s Share of APLNG Project 
Finance plus the non-cash fair value uplift in Origin’s investment in APLNG plus net derivative liabilities. The adjustment to Average 
Capital Employed reflects the impact of the accounting uplift in the asset base of APLNG of $1.9 billion which was recorded on the 
creation of the APLNG Joint Venture. This balance will be depreciated in APLNG’s income statement on an ongoing basis and, 
therefore, a dilution adjustment is made to remove this depreciation. From Origin’s perspective, cash was received for this amount up-
front at the time of the creation of the Joint Venture. The non-cash fair value adjustments are disclosed and explained in Note E1.2 in 
the financial statements. Average Capital Employed is a simple average of opening and closing capital employed in any one year. 
14For 2016 grants, the TSR Reference Group comprises the following 22 companies which were the relevant companies on 
30 June 2016: AGL Energy Ltd, APA Group, ASX Ltd, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd, Aurizon Holdings Limited, Caltex Australia Ltd, CIMIC

FY2016 details 
Relative TSR is a transparent and robust forward-looking measure which represents 
an assessment of the Company’s ability to invest and achieve a return on capital 
relative to other companies. 
Options have no value unless the share price rises above the exercise price, 
therefore, the hurdle combines both absolute and relative share price performance 
conditions. 
There is no retesting. Any unvested Options and/or PSRs after the test at the end of 
the relevant performance period lapse immediately. 
For PSRs, the ROCE performance condition is measured over each of four financial 
years (FY2017-FY2020 for the 2016 grants), beginning on 1 July prior to grant and 
ending on 30 June of the fourth year. ROCE performance for the period is 
determined by the simple arithmetic average of the four annual returns. Targets are 
set with respect to both ROCE for the period and the achievement relative to the 
Company’s pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) as described below. 
For Options, the Relative TSR performance condition is measured over a period of 
five financial years, beginning on 1 July of the grant year and ending on 30 June of 
the fifth year. 
The TSR for Origin and for each company in the Reference Group is measured on 
the basis of a three month weighted average prior to the first and last dates of the 
performance period. 
For 2016 PSRs, the ROCE target is defined as the simple average of the four year 
Board approved targets (in advance) for each of FY2017, FY2018, FY2019 and 
FY2020. 
Subject to the ROCE target being met, half of the PSRs will vest if pre-tax WACC 
is achieved in FY2019 and/or FY2020, and all of the PSRs will vest if the pre-tax 
WACC is exceeded by at least two percentage points in FY2019 and/or FY2020, 
with proportional vesting on a straight-line basis between those two outcomes. 
The exercise price for PSRs is nil. PSRs are exercised automatically on vest, and 
lapse immediately if they fail to vest on the test date. 
Vesting of Options occurs if Origin’s TSR exceeds the 50th percentile of the 
Reference Group of companies over the performance period. Half of the Options 
vest if Origin’s TSR exceeds the 50th percentile, and the full Options award vests at 
the 75th percentile, with proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis for outcomes 
between the 50th and 75th percentiles. 
Options that vest must be exercised together with payment of the exercise price (as 
detailed above) upon which shares are then allotted. 
Unexercised Options lapse up to a maximum of 10 years after grant. 
PSRs and Options are subject to Clawback (Section 2.5).
Stockland Corp Ltd, TPG Telecom Ltd, and Woodside Petroleum Ltd. Asciano was excluded because it will be de-listed and, as a 
result, South32 was included. Companies that subsequently cease to be listed (for example through merger, acquisition or de-listing) 
are not replaced, unless the Board determines otherwise.

FY2016 details 
Unvested Options and PSRs lapse on cessation of employment other than in 
circumstances of death, disability, redundancy, genuine retirement, or other 
exceptional circumstance as approved by the Board.15 In those circumstances, the 
unvested Options or PSRs may be held “on foot” subject to the specified 
performance hurdles and other Plan conditions being met, or dealt with in an 
appropriate manner determined by the Board16. 
If a Change of Control17 occurs prior to the vesting of Options and/or PSRs, the 
Board has discretion to bring forward testing against the Performance Conditions as 
at the date of the Change of Control, and vesting will occur to the extent that the 
relevant Performance Conditions have been met. 
On a capital reorganisation, the number of unvested Options and/or PSRs to which 
each participant is entitled, or the exercise price (if any) or both, may be adjusted in 
a manner determined by the Board to minimise or eliminate any material advantage 
or disadvantage to the participant.18 
The Company’s policy requires that employees cannot trade instruments or other 
financial products which limit the economic risk of any securities held under any 
equity-based incentive schemes so long as those holdings are subject to 
performance hurdles or are otherwise unvested. Non-compliance may result in 
summary dismissal.
2.4  Executive shareholding
It  has  been  agreed  with  the  Managing  Director  that  he  will  maintain  a  substantial  shareholding  in  the 
Company. Over the last six years he has held in excess of a million shares. At 30 June 2016, the value of 
his shareholding was the equivalent of approximately 3.6 times his Fixed Remuneration. 
 
 
2.5  Malus and Clawback
The Short and Long Term Incentive arrangements include malus and clawback provisions to enable the 
Company to reduce or clawback awards where it is required. 
 
Where  the  Board  is  not  satisfied  that  an  award  determination  is  appropriate  and  warranted,  it  has  the 
discretion to apply malus to vary the award downward, including to zero. 
 
Clawback provisions provide the Board with the ability to cancel unvested equity awards or to demand the 
return of shares or the realised cash value of those shares where the Board determines that the benefit 
obtained was inappropriate as a result of fraud, dishonesty or breach of employment obligations by either 
the recipient or any employee of the Group. There have been no circumstances during the current or prior 
reporting periods requiring the application of clawback provisions.
15 In addition, vested but unexercised Options that are not exercised within 60 days of cessation of employment lapse immediately. 
16 In rare circumstances, the Board might use its discretion to cash settle PSRs and/or Options that stay on foot and vest where an 
executive leaves due to death, disability, redundancy or genuine retirement. 
17 On a person/entity acquiring 20% or more of the relevant interest in the Company pursuant to a takeover bid that has become 
unconditional, or on a person/entity otherwise acquiring 20% or more of a relevant interest in the issued capital of the Company. 
18 If new awards are granted, they will, unless the Board determines otherwise, be subject to the same terms and conditions as the 
original awards.
2.6  Senior executives receive a greater percentage of their total remuneration in
the form of STI and LTI
Fixed Remuneration, STI (both cash and deferred) and LTI work together to generate alignment with the 
interests of shareholders. 
 
The relative mix of these components for different roles is summarised in Table 7. 
 
Table 7: Remuneration Mix by Role (At Target)
In  the  case  of  the  Managing  Director,  at  the  At  Target  levels  in  Tables  1  and  4,  almost  half  of  his 
remuneration  is  deferred,  and  more  than  two-thirds  is  at-risk19.  As  job  size  diminishes,  the  proportions 
deferred and at-risk fall (and the proportion of Fixed Remuneration increases). 
 
 
2.7
To assist with preserving shareholder value, retention plans are selectively 
used to retain key staff
The Board Remuneration Committee regularly assesses the risk of the Group losing key staff in areas of 
intense  market  activity.  Typically,  they  are  critical  technical  operational  staff  or  senior  executives  who 
manage core activities or have skills that are being actively solicited in the market. 
 
In  such  circumstances,  the  Board  Remuneration  Committee  may  consider  putting  in  place  deferred 
payment arrangements to reduce the risk of losing such staff. More specifically, such staff may be offered 
DSRs or deferred cash payments if they remain in ongoing employment at a nominated date and achieve 
personal performance targets. 
 
The DSRs are the same equity vehicle as described in Section 2.2 for Deferred STI, but the purpose is 
strictly  retention  and  the  deferral  period  (up  to  four  years)  may  vary  according  to  the  specific 
circumstances. For accounting purposes expensing for retention DSRs differs from DSRs awarded under 
Deferred STI arrangements20. 
 
At 30 June 2016, there were 106,621 retention DSRs on issue for 9 recipients (154,408 at 30 June 2015, 
19 recipients). 
 
No deferred cash or retention DSRs were granted to KMP during the current or prior period.
19 At maximum outcomes, 46% of his remuneration is deferred and 73% is at risk. 
20 The expensing for DSRs awarded under the Retention Plan is recognised from the date of grant because this is the 
commencement of the service period. This differs from expensing of DSRs under Deferred STI arrangements (Section 2.2) where the 
service period commences at the beginning of the STI performance year.
2.8
The Employee Share Plan focuses all staff on safety
Operational  excellence  and  safety  performance  are  tightly  linked.  For  this  reason,  the  Board  has 
determined that staff should have an incentive to focus on safety. 
 
The  Board  has  the  ability  to  make  an  annual  award  of  up  to  $1,000  worth  of  shares  to  all  permanent 
employees  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand  (other  than  Executive  Directors)  with  more  than  one  year  of 
service. Such an award is valued by staff, and for this reason the Board has determined that its allocation 
should be made subject to company-wide targets relating to safety being met during the year. 
 
Shares awarded under the Employee Share Plan must be held for at least three years following the award 
or until cessation of employment, whichever occurs first. 
 
For FY2016, a target was set for 85% of actions to be closed out within 14 days in the Company’s Health 
Safety and Environment Management System by the relevant manager or safety adviser. This target was 
exceeded  (87.3%).  As  a  result,  the  Company  will  award  up  to  $1,000  worth  of  shares  to  approximately 
4,800 eligible employees. 
 
The  Company  will  acquire  the  requisite  shares  on-market  for  transfer  to  employees  during  late  August 
2016, subject to compliance with applicable regulations. 
 
 
2.9  Shareholder  interests  are  served  by  focusing  on  gender  pay  equity  which
aims to make the most of the talents of all staff
Origin’s policy is to deliver equal pay for equal work21, with a view to attracting and retaining quality staff 
regardless of gender. Research has shown that organisations that make the most of the talents of women 
are superior performers over time. 
 
Each year, a central review of proposed pay arrangements for the coming 12 months is conducted for all 
divisions  of  the  Company  at  all  job  grade  levels.  If  the  proposed  pay  arrangements  diverge  by  plus  or 
minus  1%  between  males and  females  at  a  Business  Unit  or  Company  level,  managers  are  required  to 
review and revise recommendations to bring any variation within 1%. A more detailed description of gender 
equity is provided in the Company’s Corporate Governance Statement. 
 
While  equal  work  is  recognised  with  equal  pay,  females  are  over-represented  in  lower-graded  jobs  and 
under-represented in higher-graded jobs. The Corporate Governance Statement describes the Company’s 
initiatives  and  publicly  stated  goals  that  aim  to  improve  the  Company’s  gender  distribution  profile  and 
increase the proportion of women in senior roles.
21 Equal work is defined by reference to Hay Group’s standard job grades.

REMUNERATION OUTCOMES FOR EXECUTIVES REFLECT 
RETURNS TO SHAREHOLDERS
Aligning the interests of executives and shareholders is integral to Origin’s remuneration policy. This 
section of the Remuneration Report outlines the extent to which that has been achieved. 
 
3.1  Origin’s recent financial outcomes have been challenging and disappointing
for shareholders
FY2016 was a challenging year financially for Origin and its shareholders. 
 
More specifically, the collapse in the global oil price from over US$100 per barrel in the prior financial year 
to  $26  per  barrel  in  January  2016,  before  recovering  to  US$48  per  barrel  on  30  June  2016  has  had  a 
material impact on Origin and its shareholders. As a result, Origin entered the 2016 Financial Year with an 
unsustainably high level of debt. Market expectations of returns from Origin’s investment in the Australian 
Pacific LNG project (APLNG) materially reduced, translating into a fall in the Company’s share price of 45% 
(adjusted for the 2015 rights issue) in FY2016. 
 
Table 8 shows Origin’s TSR relative to the S&P/ASX 100 index, noting its recent underperformance relative 
to prior periods of outperformance. Table 9 graphs the fall in Origin’s share price relative to declining oil 
prices. 
Table 8: 10 year TSR versus S&P/ASX 100 (indexed to 100 from 30 June 2007 to 30 June 2016)
Table 9: 10 year Origin share price (historic prices re-stated for Rights issues) versus Brent Oil 
crude price
Origin has responded to this challenge by focusing on debt reduction through asset sales (including selling 
the Company’s interest in Contact Energy); a $2.5 billion pro-rata capital raising; and ongoing reductions in 
capital expenditure and operating costs. 
 
These circumstances and Origin’s response to them have driven results for the 2016 financial year. 
 
As can be seen in Table 10, the Company reported a statutory loss of $589 million and an Underlying Profit 
of  $365  million.  Non-cash  post-tax  impairments  were  $515  million  of  the  $954  million  Excluded  from 
Underlying Profit. These impairments related to the discontinuation of exiting activities ($171 million) and 
the write down of reserves in certain producing assets ($344 million). The balance comprised fair value and 
foreign exchange movements ($195 million) as well as APLNG related items ($222 million).

Underlying EBITDA from continuing operations decreased $27 million, reflecting a strong contribution from 
Energy Markets and maiden contribution from the sale of LNG by APLNG, offset by the impact of lower oil 
prices. 
 
Underlying  Profit  from  continuing  operations  decreased  $249  million  primarily  due  to  Origin’s  having  to 
recognising  an  increased  share  of  APLNG’s  Interest,  Tax,  Depreciation  and  Amortisation  (ITDA)  ($231 
million). This occurred because the sale of natural gas and LNG revenue in a low oil price environment was 
insufficient  to  offset  the  increase  in  ITDA.  The  higher  ITDA  also  includes,  because  of  the  accounting 
standards, a disproportionate share of costs associated with shared infrastructure assets related to Train 1 
of LNG export project coming on stream. 
 
Movements in Underlying and Statutory earnings per share reflect lower earnings and the effect of a higher 
weighted  average  number  of  shares  following  the  issue  of  new  shares  under  the  Entitlement  Offer, 
completed in October 2015. 
 
A strong operational performance from Energy Markets resulted in an increased contribution of $70 million 
to $1,330 million. Gross profit contributions from the Natural Gas and Electricity businesses were preserved 
in a market that has changed significantly in the past year.  At the same time costs were reduced. Energy 
Market’s net cash from operating and investing activities increased by $522 million to $1,262 million. 
 
A major milestone in the development of Origin was achieved with the commencement of LNG production 
by  APLNG  in  January  2016.  Production  has  ramped  up  quickly  to  be  above  nameplate  capacity  with  to 
date APLNG shipping 36 cargoes, primarily to its two major customers, Sinopec and Kansai. 
 
The  maiden  contribution  from  the  commencement  of  LNG  production  by  APLNG  has  in  part  offset  the 
impact  of  lower  oil  prices  on  contribution  from  the  Integrated  Gas  business,  which  decreased  by  $112 
million  to  $386  million.  As  the  investment  in  APLNG  nears  completion  and  cash  flows  from  production 
begin, cash flow after operating and investing activities has improved by $1,413 million to ($1,605) million.

In building resilience to a lower oil price environment, the Company has made good progress during the 
year on assets sales and cost reduction. 
 
Action  during  the  year  was  also  taken  to  reduce  exposure  to  low  oil  prices  through  the  purchase  for 
FY2017 of put options over 15 million barrels of oil at prices of US$40 per barrel and A$55 per barrel. 
 
As a result of actions taken to reduce debt and to strongly improve operational performance, importantly 
from a shareholder’s perspective, net cash from operating and investing activities has improved by $3,296 
million to $1,215 million. As a consequence of this improvement and the equity raising, Origin’s adjusted 
net debt decreased $3,971 million to $9,131 million at year end. 
 
3.2  Outcomes for shareholders have been reflected in those for executives
Origin is committed to aligning outcomes for shareholders with those of Executives. 
As a consequence, NEDs — with the support of management — have exercised discretion in relation to 
both STI and LTI in the past two years. 
In FY2015, after the publication of the Remuneration Report, but before the Annual General Meeting 
and in response to the declining share price and the decision to proceed with the rights issue, Mr King 
and Ms Moses agreed to forego their Deferred STI as well as the proposed LTI awards (see Tables 11 
and 13 for the reported and revised outcomes for FY2015). 
Outcomes in relation to STI, LTI and overall remuneration are outlined in the following sections.
3.2.1 STI outcomes 
For FY2016, with the Managing Director’s agreement, the Board exercised discretion in relation to his STI 
payment, reducing it to zero. Downward discretion has also been exercised in relation to some, but not all, 
KMP reflecting their relative performance and that of their business. These outcomes can be seen in Table 
11. 
Table 11 also summarises the STI award in terms of the cash element and the deferred component.  For 
FY2016, the period over which deferred rights vest is two, three and four years (versus one, two and three 
years in 2015), thereby creating additional alignment with returns to shareholders.

STI  decisions  were  made  having  regard  to  corporate,  business  unit  and  individual  performance  targets. 
Table  12  outlines  the  benchmark  corporate  financial,  safety  and  engagement  targets  against  which 
discretion  was  exercised.  Additional  operational  targets  were  set  for  the  Chief  Executives  of  the  two 
operating Business Units as well as their having personal performance targets.
23 Notes to Table 11 
This Table (and Tables 13, 15 and 16) exclude former Other Executive KMPs P Zealand and D Barnes. P Zealand ceased being 
KMP on 30 April 2015 and had no KMP remuneration for FY2016. D Barnes ceased being KMP on 10 August 2015, and during the 
period 1 July 2015 to 10 August 2015 received $93,791 in Fixed Remuneration; no incentive awards were attributable to this period 
and no Origin equity was granted in relation to FY2015 or FY2016. 
1  Fixed Remuneration here represents the actual Fixed Remuneration taken home during the period. It does not include Contact 
Energy Board fees earned by G. King, K. Moses and D. Baldwin (these are detailed in Table 24). For D Baldwin in FY2015 the 
Remuneration shown is the reference for STI calculation which was the annualised Fixed Remuneration for the role to which he 
was appointed during the year.
2  Where the actual STI payment is less than maximum potential, the difference is foregone. 
3  STI cash represents two-thirds of the STI awarded in respect of the relevant year, the balance is STI deferred. 
4  STI deferred represents one-third of the STI awarded in respect of the relevant year, the balance is STI cash. This component is 
awarded in DSRs that will vest in three equal tranches after two, three and four years (for FY2016) and after one, two and three 
years (FY2015). The grant of equity relating to the FY2016 Deferred STI allocation for G King will be subject to shareholder 
approval to be obtained at the 2016 Annual General Meeting (AGM).
5  FY2015 Deferred STI allocations (and the STI Awarded % of maximum) for G King and K Moses have been re-stated because 
the equity grant that was proposed to be put to shareholders at the 2015 AGM was withdrawn prior to the AGM and no STI 
deferred equity grants were made.
6  As Acting CFO, G Mallett was appointed to KMP on 16 May 2016. FY2016 STI amounts are pro-rated for the period 16 May to 
30 June 2016. The calculation of STI is based on annual Fixed Remuneration of $590,000 and excludes an Acting allowance 
that is included in the pro-rated Fixed Remuneration in this Table.
7  K Moses ceased being KMP on 16 May 2016. FY2016 STI amounts are pro-rated for the period 1 July 2015 to 16 May 2016.

The  financial  metrics  were  finalised  after,  and  taking  into  account,  the  rights  issue  and  reflected  the 
increased emphasis on cash generation following the fall in the oil price. Against those targets, a 76.3 
percent target was achieved. Origin’s total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) was set against the 
backdrop  of  the  prior  year’s  performance.  The  outcome  fell  below  a  year-on-year  reduction,  with  no 
award being made. The Serious Injury Frequency rate (SIFR), which was introduced as a second target 
in  FY2016,  was  significantly  better  than  target.  Taken  together,  the  combined  measures  yielded  an 
overall 20% outcome for the safety metric. The Employee engagement measure, set annually, aimed for 
a  significant  improvement.  Against  the  backdrop  of  a  major  redundancy  program,  the  marginally 
improved  FY2016  result  versus  the  prior  year  resulted  in  a  20  percent  outcome. These  results  were 
measured  in  May  2016  through  an  annual  voluntary  employee  survey  conducted  externally  by  AON 
Hewitt using its methodology. 
In exercising  its discretion, the Board took into account these results; the remuneration outcomes for 
comparably sized companies; and the impact of Impairments on the statutory results. Due regard was 
also had to the decline in share price experienced by shareholders, the worst of which occurred prior to 
last year’s Annual General Meeting and after the revised remuneration decisions were made in relation 
to Mr King and Ms Moses.
24 Notes to Table 12 
1  Re-stated for Rights Issue in October 2015. 
2  For FY2015 the two performance indicators Underlying EPS and OCAT Ratio were combined in equal weights to form the Group
STI Financial Performance Metric (see Table 2). For FY2016 NCOIA replaced the OCAT Ratio component.
3  Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR), a standard industry measure of recordable injuries per million work hours.  In
FY2015 TRIFR was the sole safety measure; in FY2016 a gateway of Serious Injury Frequency Rate (SIFR) was added.
3.2.2 LTI outcomes 
Discretion has also been exercised by the Board over the past two years in relation to LTI, as can be seen 
in Table 13, which shows the actual LTI allocations (conditional pay) made during the period relative to the 
Target Values defined in Section 2.3.  
More  specifically,  Mr  King  and  Ms  Moses  received  no  LTI  allocation  under  the  revised  remuneration 
arrangements announced prior to the FY2015 Annual General Meeting. Ms Moses, who has announced 
her intention to retire to pursue a career as a NED, has also not received an LTI allocation for FY2016.

LTI allocations are subject to meeting performance conditions over periods of four years (PSRs) and five 
years (Options). If those performance conditions are not met, the awards will be forfeited without having 
generated any value to the executive. The equity grant relating to the FY2016 allocation for the Managing 
Director will be subject to shareholder approval. 
In other words, Directors consider it is appropriate for the Managing Director and other KMP members to 
receive an LTI award for FY2016 because they will only vest over five and four years if both the returns to 
shareholders  outperform  comparable  sized  companies  (TSR  vesting  condition  for  Options)  and  if  the 
returns  on  funds  employed  significantly  improve  and  exceed  Origin’s  weighted  average  cost  of  capital 
(ROCE vesting condition on PSRs). 
The alignment of LTI awards with the interests of shareholders has been powerfully demonstrated over the 
past four years, where no vesting has occurred. This can be seen in Table 14.
25 Notes to Table 13 
1  Fixed Remuneration here represents the actual Fixed Remuneration taken home during the period. It does not include Contact 
Energy Board fees earned by G. King, K. Moses and D. Baldwin (these are detailed in Table 24). For D Baldwin in FY2015 the 
Remuneration  shown  is  the  reference  for  LTI  calculation  which  was  the  annualised  amount  for  the  role  to  which  he  was 
appointed during the year.
2  The  FY2016  LTI  award  allocation  is  subject  to  performance  hurdles  over  five  years  for  Options  and  four  years  for  PSRs
(FY2015: four years in both cases) and may vest (partially or fully) or lapse in a future period.
3  The grant of equity relating to the FY2016 LTI allocation for G King will be subject to shareholder approval to be obtained at the

Directors consider that the overall pay outcomes for FY2015 and FY2016 are aligned with the interests of 
shareholders. 
Table 15 shows that even though the total allocation is slightly higher in FY2016 for the Managing Director, 
the cash component has decreased by 35 percent from the FY2015 revised amount. LTI payments will only 
be made if the vesting conditions are met and shareholders do well.

More specifically, the way such alignment occurs can be seen in Table 16 which summarises the actual 
pay received by KMP in FY2015 and 2016 as well as the impact of LTI from prior years that did not meet 
                                                 
26 Notes to Table 14 
1  The  period  most  representative  of  the  vesting  cycle  for  LTI  awards  that  were  tested  during  the  periods  was  four  years.
Accordingly the TSR data shown here is a 4-year rolling CAGR measured at each 30 June.
2  The LTI vesting represents the level of LTI vesting achieved as a proportion of LTI tested during the period. 
27 Notes to Table 15 
1  Fixed Remuneration here represents the actual Fixed Remuneration taken home during the period. It does not include Contact 
Energy Board fees earned by G. King, K. Moses and D. Baldwin (these are detailed in Table 24). For D Baldwin, the FY2015 
amount is made up of 7 months at $1,028,000pa and 5 months in the changed role of CEO Integrated Gas at $1,150,000pa.
2  STI cash represents two-thirds of the STI awarded in respect of the relevant year, the balance is STI deferred. 
3  STI deferred represents one-third of the STI awarded in respect of the relevant year, the balance is STI cash. This component is 
awarded in DSRs that will vest in three equal tranches after two, three and four years (for FY2016) and after one, two and three 
years (FY2015). The grant of equity relating to the FY2016 Deferred STI allocation for G King will be subject to shareholder 
approval to be obtained at the 2016 Annual General Meeting (AGM).
4  The  FY2016  LTI  award  allocation  is  subject  to  performance  hurdles  over  five  years  for  Options  and  four  years  for  PSRs 
(FY2015: four years in both cases) and may vest (partially or fully) or lapse in a future period. The grant of equity relating to the 
FY2016 LTI allocations for G King will be subject to shareholder approval to be obtained at the 2016 AGM.
5  FY2015  Deferred  STI  and  Deferred  LTI  allocations  have  been  re-stated  because  the  equity  that  was  proposed  to  be  put  to 
shareholders at the 2015 AGM was withdrawn prior to the AGM. Accordingly no equity grants were made in relation to FY2015 
for G King or for K. Moses.
6  G Mallett was appointed KMP on 16 May 2016. FY2016 amounts are pro-rated for the period 16 May to 30 June 2016. 
7  K Moses ceased being KMP on 16 May 2016. FY2016 amounts are pro-rated for the period 1 July 2015 to 16 May 2016.

During the year the first tranche of Deferred STI (awarded for FY2014) vested, while over $9 million of 
previously reported statutory remuneration was forfeited. During the last 3 years the Managing Director 
has forfeited more than $9.5m of LTI equity that was previously reported as statutory remuneration. 
 
The potential for future vesting  of existing Options and  PSRs (from prior LTI awards)  will depend on 
Origin’s TSR performance through to the end of the relevant performance period. However, based on 
performance to date it is unlikely that Executives will see any vesting of prior LTI awards for at least the 
next three years.
28 Notes to Table 16 
1
Fixed Remuneration here represents the actual Fixed Remuneration taken home during the period. It does not include Contact 
Energy Board fees earned by G. King, K. Moses and D. Baldwin (these are detailed in Table 24). 
STI cash represents two-thirds of the STI awarded in respect of the relevant year, the balance deferred. 
Deferred STI vested represents one-third of the component of the 2014 STI award that was deferred. This tranche vested in 
October 2015, with the remaining two tranches deferred until October 2016 and October 2017 respectively. The vested value is 
calculated as the number of vested securities multiplied by the closing price of Origin ordinary shares on the day they vested. 
LTI vested represents prior year Origin LTI awards vesting wholly or partially during the year. None vested during FY2016. The 
table does not include vesting for Contact Energy LTI awarded in respect of D Baldwin’s prior employment with that company 
(FY2015 nil, FY2016 $498,886). 
Equity  Forfeited  includes  any  prior  year  Origin  equity  allocations  that  were  forfeited  during  the  year  (i.e.  the  relevant  grants 
realised no benefit). For FY2016 this represents Options and PSRs that were granted in 2010, and PSRs that were granted in 
2012.  The  table  does  not  include  D  Baldwin’s  Contact  Energy  equity  forfeits  that  related  to  prior  employment  with  Contact 
Energy  Ltd  (FY2015  nil,  FY2016  $269,175).  The  forfeited  value  represents  the  grant  date  value  that  was  disclosed  and 
attributed to remuneration at the time of the grant. See Table 26. 
The total is the sum of Fixed Remuneration cash, STI cash, Deferred STI vested, LTI vested less Equity Awards Forfeited. 
G Mallett was appointed KMP on 16 May 2016. FY2016 amounts are pro-rated for the period 16 May to 30 June 2016.

4.  APPROPRIATE GOVERNANCE AND REMUNERATION
ARRANGEMENTS FOR NEDs HAVE ENSURED A STRONG 
FOCUS ON SHAREHOLDERS’ INTERESTS
Effective governance is central to Origin’s remuneration approach. It is achieved through a clear definition 
of  responsibilities,  appropriate  composition  of  the  Board  Remuneration  Committee,  and  adherence  to 
processes  that  ensure  independent  decision-making.  It  is  also  supported  by  appropriate  remuneration 
arrangements for NEDs. 
 
 
4.1  Governance responsibilities are clearly defined
The  full  Board  has  oversight  of  Origin’s  remuneration  arrangements.  It  is  accountable  for  executive  and 
NEDs remuneration and the policies and process governing both. 
 
The Board Remuneration Committee, through its Chairman, reports to the full Board and advises on these 
matters.  The  Committee  is  comprised  of  a  minimum  of  three  members  who  must  be  NEDs.  All  current 
members of the Committee, including its Chairman, are independent. There is a standing invitation to all 
Board members to attend the Committee’s meetings. 
 
The main responsibilities of the Board and Remuneration Committee are described in Table 17.

The  Remuneration  Committee  is  composed  of  NEDs  with  an  appropriate 
level of independence and expertise
The Board Remuneration Committee is comprised of four independent NEDs, as shown in Table 18. Each 
Director  has  remuneration  experience  either  as  a  member  of  board  remuneration  committees  at  other 
major companies or in their prior role as an executive.

The Committee met four times during FY2016. 
 
4.3  Board and Remuneration Committee processes ensure independence
The  Remuneration  Committee  operates  under  a  Charter  published  on 
the  Company’s  website 
at www.originenergy.com.au.  In particular, the Charter identifies the processes for dealing with conflicts of 
interest.  The  Charter  and  all  associated  processes  are  followed  assiduously  by  the  Board  and 
Remuneration Committee. 
 
The Committee has established protocols for engaging and dealing with external advisors, including those 
defined as Remuneration Consultants for the purpose of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The protocols 
require engagement by the Committee; instruction by the Chairman of the Committee, delivery of reports 
direct  to  the  Committee  through  its  Chairman,  and  a  prohibition  on  communication  with  Company 
management except as authorised by the Chairman and limited to the provision or validation of factual and 
policy  data.  The  advisor  must  furnish  a  statement  confirming  the  absence  of  any  undue  influence  from 
management. 
 
In  2015  the  Committee  appointed  Pay  Governance  under  the  protocols29  to  assist  with  examining  its 
remuneration structure. Given the comprehensive nature of that review the Committee did not appoint an 
advisor during FY2016. 
 
Table 19 summarises the sources of general remuneration benchmarking data used during FY2016.
29 Pay Governance did not act as a Remuneration Consultant for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).

4.4  Origin’s remuneration approach is to ensure NEDs are remunerated in ways
that maintain their independence
Appropriate remuneration for NEDs is achieved by:
−  Setting  Board  and  Committee  fees  taking  into  account  market  rates  for  relevant  Australian
organisations for the time commitment and responsibilities involved; and
−  Delivering those fees in a form that is not contingent on Origin’s performance.
As a result, remuneration  arrangements for NEDs are different from those in  place for Executives. NED 
remuneration is not performance-based or dependent on the Company’s results. Fees are fixed to allow for 
independent and objective assessment of executive and Company performance. 
 
No Executive KMP is remunerated for acting as a Director of Origin. Prior to the sale of Origin’s interest in 
Contact Energy in August 2015, G King, K Moses and D Baldwin were, however, remunerated for serving 
as directors of its Board (as shown in Table 24). 
 
 
4.5  NED fees have not been increased and are within the aggregate cap
Board  and  Committee  fees  are  reviewed  regularly  having  regard  to  the  level  of  fees  paid  to  NEDs  at 
Australian companies of comparable size and complexity. This approach reflects the responsibilities and 
time commitment necessary for the role. 
 
Per diem fees may also be paid on occasions where approved special work is undertaken outside of the 
expected commitments. None were paid during FY2016. 
 
The Board has determined that no increase be made to NED fees for FY2017. NED fees have remained 
unchanged  since  FY2013,  apart  from  the  introduction  of  fees  for  the  Risk  Committee  which  were 
introduced  in  FY2016.    This  decision  has  been  taken  recognising  the  returns  to  shareholders  in  recent 
years.
The  Origin  Chairman  receives  a  single  fee  that  is  inclusive  of  Committee  activities,  while  other  NEDs 
receive  a  base  Board  fee  and  separate  fees  for  their  role  on  specific  Committees,  other  than  the 
Nomination Committee, which is considered within the base fee. All fees are inclusive of superannuation 
contributions. 
 
The  aggregate  cap  for  NED  remuneration  ($2,700,000)  was  last  approved  by  shareholders  at  the  2010 
Annual General Meeting. The Board does not propose a change to this cap for FY2017. 
 
Table 20 shows the structure and level of NED fees for FY2016 and for those proposed for FY2017:

4.6  NEDs are required to acquire and hold shares in the Company
To more closely align the interests of the Board and shareholders, NEDs are required to hold a minimum of 
20,000 shares in the Company within three years of appointment. 
 
Details on the Directors’ holdings in shares are set out in Table 29.
Appendices: KMP disclosures 
 
Appendix 1: KMP
Managing Director
KMP include Executive Directors and executives with authority and responsibility for planning, directing and 
controlling the activities of Origin Energy and its controlled entities (together making Executive KMP) and 
NEDs. NEDs are required by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to be included as KMP for the purpose of 
disclosure in the Remuneration Report. However, Origin’s NEDs do not consider themselves to be part of 
‘management’.

Appendix 2: Contractual Arrangements for Executive KMP
The  table  below  sets  out  the  main  terms  and  conditions  of  the  employment  contracts  of  the  Managing 
Director and Executive KMP (excluding NEDs) as at 30 June 2016. 
 
As noted in Section 2, the contractual terms were determined with reference to the size and complexity of 
the  job  roles,  benchmarked  against  the  external  market.  They  reflect  the  principles  of  reward  for 
performance and alignment with the interests of shareholders.

an STI can be paid that reflects the extent of 
achievement against the objectives set for the year 
having regard to the part of the year that has 
elapsed prior to termination. In such a case, the 
STI payment will be made in cash.
−  DSRs, Options and/or PSRs lapse on termination 
other than in cases of death, disability, bona fide 
redundancy or genuine retirement.
−  Statutory entitlements only for termination with
cause
−  Payment in lieu of notice at Company discretion 
−  For Company termination “without cause” pro rata
earned STI is payable
−  For Company termination “without cause” payment
equivalent to 3 weeks’ Fixed Remuneration per 
year of service capped at 74 weeks; a minimum 
may also apply (generally 18-22 weeks)
−  DSRs, Options and/or PSRs lapse on termination 
other than in cases of death, disability, bona fide 
redundancy or genuine retirement.
Details regarding the Managing Director’s remuneration arrangements are provided in earlier sections of 
this Report but are included in the summary below for completeness.
30 Note to Table 22. The table includes arrangements agreed prior to amendments to the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) regarding 
termination payments which came into effect on 24 November 2009. The amended provisions apply to KMP contract variations, and 
to KMP appointments after that date. Entitlements under pre-existing contracts are generally not subject to the amended legislative 
provisions.

The Managing Director maintains a substantial shareholding in the Company  as reflected in Table 29 of 
this Report (and equivalent tables in prior Reports). At 30 June 2016 the value of his shareholding was the 
equivalent of approximately 3.6 times his Fixed Remuneration (Section 2.4).

G King, D Baldwin, and K Moses were the Company’s nominees on the Board of Contact Energy, and resigned as directors on 10 August 2015 on completion of the sale of the Company’s 
interest in Contact. FY2016 Contact Energy fees relate to the period 1 July 2015 to 10 August 2015. FY2016 remuneration is converted to Australian dollars using an exchange rate of 
$1.1166 for the period 1 July 2015 to 10 August 2015 (FY2015 - $1.0777). 
Cash STI in respect of the relevant reporting period represents two-thirds of STI award. The Cash STI is granted for the respective year ended 30 June, determined following the close of the 
respective financial year and paid during September. 
Non-monetary benefits include insurance premiums and fringe benefits such as car parking and expenses associated with travel. 
The Deferred STI represents the accounting value of equity to be granted for the current year in addition to grants made in this and prior periods. It relates to the balance (one-third) of the 
STI award that was made for the relevant year as referred to in Note 2 above. The valuation uses a discounted cash flow methodology that recognises that dividends are not paid on DSRs. 
Deferred STI in respect of the current year will be granted as DSRs in the following financial year. The expense is recognised beginning on 1 July of the financial year to which the STI award 
relates. In following reporting periods the accumulated expense is adjusted for the number of instruments then expected to vest. The share based expense for Deferred STI for FY2015 for G
King and for K Moses included intended equity grants that were proposed to shareholders but were subsequently withdrawn prior to the 2015 Annual General Meeting. As no equity was 
granted, the expense attributable to the intended grant has been reversed in the FY2016 expense ($214,321 for G King and $126,722 for K Moses). 
The LTI value for Options and PSRs represents the accounting value of equity granted in relation to prior periods that is attributable to the relevant reporting period. All LTI equity granted in 
prior periods is subject to market-based performance hurdles, accordingly the accounting fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology that takes into account market 
hurdles, and is allocated to each reporting period from the date of grant and spread evenly over the service period. Commencing in FY2017 LTI grants will include non-market hurdles with 
different methodology for allocating the share based remuneration expense. 
The accounting value of LTI for D Baldwin includes equity issued by Contact Energy in relation to his earlier employment by Contact Energy prior to 1 April 2011. 
G Mallett was appointed to the KMP role of Acting Chief Financial Officer on 16 May 2016, FY2016 remuneration represents the period 16 May 2016 to 30 June 2016. 
K Moses ceased being KMP on 16 May 2016, FY2016 remuneration represents the period 1 July 2015 to 16 May 2016. Untested share based instruments that were awarded in respect of 
prior years’ awards may remain on foot or become forfeited upon retirement. If they remain on foot any unvested expense is accelerated. If forfeited, previously booked expense is reversed. 
The status of Ms Moses’ outstanding share based instruments at retirement is unknown and no accounting adjustment has been made. 
D Barnes ceased being KMP on 10 August 2015 upon completion of the sale of the Company’s interest in Contact Energy. FY2016 remuneration represents the period 1 July 2015 to 10 
August 2015. During employment with Contact Energy, D Barnes was paid in New Zealand currency. FY2016 short term benefits are converted to Australian dollars using an exchange rate 
of $1.1166 for the period 1 July 2015 to 10 August 2015 (FY2015 - $1.0777). Post-employment superannuation benefits were remitted monthly in Australian dollars using the month-end 
exchange rate. Fixed Remuneration (base salary plus superannuation) and all or part of Contact Energy’s variable remuneration for the period of employment with Contact Energy was 
reimbursed by Contact Energy. The accounting value of Deferred STI and of LTI includes equity issued by Contact Energy in relation to his employment by Contact between 1 April 2011 
and 10 August 2015. 
P Zealand ceased being KMP on 30 April 2015. FY2015 remuneration represents the period 1 July 2014 to 30 April 2015. 
S Perkins was appointed as Non-executive Director on 1 September 2015, remuneration represents the period 1 September 2015 to 30 June 2016. 
S Sargent was appointed as Non-executive Director on 29 May 2015. FY2015 remuneration represents the period 29 May 2015 to 30 June 2015. 
B Beeren retired as Non-executive Director on 22 October 2014. FY2015 remuneration represents the period 1 July 2014 to 22 October 2014. 
R Norris retired as Non-executive Director on 16 September 2015. FY2016 remuneration represents the period 1 July 2015 to 16 September 2015. 
All named Executive KMP and Executive Directors are employed and remunerated by the Company and its controlled entities. All NEDs are remunerated by the Company.

Notes to Table 26 
1
The value of Options awarded in relation to FY2015 (granted in early FY2016) is the fair value calculated at grant date using a 
Black Scholes model with a Monte Carlo simulation methodology to account for hurdles; and the value of PSRs granted in the 
year is the fair value calculated at grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology to account for hurdles. The value of 
DSRs granted in the year is the fair value calculated at grant date using a discounted cashflow technique. The fair value of each 
instrument has been calculated independently by Mercer Consulting. The value disclosed for each instrument (Options, PSRs, 
and DSRs) is the total value for each instrument over the period. This amount is allocated to remuneration (Table 24) over the 
vesting period. Refer Note F3 of the financial statements for further detail of the assumptions used in determining grant date fair 
value of Options and PSRs. 
The value of rights (Options, PSRs, and DSRs) exercised during the year is calculated as the market price of the Company’s 
shares  on  the  ASX  as  at  the  close  of  trading  on  the  date  the  rights  were  exercised,  after  deducting  any  exercise  price.  The 
exercise price for PSRs and DSRs is nil. 
D Barnes and D Baldwin’s Contact securities were issued under the Contact Energy Employee LTI Scheme as Chief Executive 
Officer  or  Managing  Director  (respectively)  of  Contact  Energy.  Contact  Energy  relied  on  NZSX  Listing  Rule  7.3.9  to  allow 
participation of the CEO/Managing Director in the LTI Scheme. D Baldwin received cash director’s fees from Contact Energy in his 
capacity as a director post 1 April 2011 following the end of his secondment to Contact Energy and until Origin sold its interest in 
Contact Energy on 10 August 2015, but did not receive further securities in Contact Energy under its LTI Scheme. D Barnes and 
D Baldwin retain Contact Energy securities subject to their corresponding exercise hurdles and vesting requirements. 
G Mallett was appointed on 16 May 2016. 
K Moses ceased being KMP on 16 May 2016. 
D Barnes ceased being KMP on 10 August 2015.

Table 27: Details of Options, PSRs and DSRs Granted in FY2016
Rights (Options, PSRs, and DSRs) to equity in the Company granted to KMP during the period are listed below.  No NEDs hold Options, PSRs or DSRs.  No 
Options, PSRs, or DSRs have been granted since the end of the reporting period. Options, PSRs, and DSRs were provided at no cost to the recipients. Unvested 
Options and PSRs expire on the earlier of their expiry date or on cessation of employment. In addition to a continuing employment service condition, the ability to 
exercise Options and PSRs is conditional on the consolidated entity achieving certain performance hurdles. Subject to achieving the performance hurdles, Options 
and PSRs granted in the period will be exercisable four years after the Grant Date. Details of the performance hurdles are included in the LTI information in section 
2.3.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Origin Energy Limited ABN 30 000 051 696
Page 1 of 14
the  3rd  edition  ASX  Corporate  Governance  Principles  and
Origin  is  committed  to  the  creation  of  shareholder  value  and  meeting  the  expectations  of 
stakeholders to practice sound corporate governance. 
 
Origin  aspires  to  the  highest  standards  of  integrity,  personal  safety  and  environmental 
performance.  To  achieve  this,  every  employee  and  contractor  is  required  to  act  in  accordance 
with Origin’s governance and business conduct standards across its operations in Australia and 
internationally. 
 
Compliance  with 
Recommendations (ASX Principles) 
 
This  statement  has  been  approved  by  the  Board  and  summarises  the  Company’s  governance 
practices  which  were  in  place  throughout  the  financial  year  ended  30 June 2016.  During  the 
financial year and to the date of this Report, Origin has complied with all of the ASX Principles. 
 
Principle 1: Lay solid foundations for management and oversight 
 
The Board’s roles and responsibilities are formalised in a Board Charter, which is available on the 
Company’s website. The Charter sets out those functions that are delegated to management and 
those  that  are  reserved  for  the  Board.  The  Company  Secretary  is  accountable  directly  to  the 
Board, through the Chairman, on all matters to do with the proper functioning of the Board. 
 
Before  a  Director  is  appointed,  Origin  undertakes  appropriate  evaluations.  These  include 
independent  checks  of  a  candidate’s  character,  experience,  education,  criminal  record, 
bankruptcy history, and any other factors which would affect the Company’s or  the individual’s 
reputation. 
 
Where a candidate is standing for election or re-election as Director, the notice of meeting will set 
out  information  on  the  candidate  including  biographical  details,  qualifications  and  experience, 
independence status, outside interests and the recommendation of the rest of the Board on the 
resolution. 
 
At  the  time  of  joining  Origin,  Directors  and  senior  executives  are  provided  with  letters  of 
appointment,  together  with  key  Company  documents  and  information,  setting  out  their  term  of 
office, duties, rights and responsibilities, and entitlements on termination. 
 
The  performance  of  all  key  executives,  including  the  Managing  Director,  is  reviewed  annually 
against:
  a set of personal financial and non-financial goals; 
  Company and Business-Unit specific goals; and 
  adherence  to  the  Company’s  Compass,  which  reflects  the  role  that  Origin’s  Purpose,
Principles, Values and Commitments play in everyday decision making.
The Remuneration Committee and the Board consider the performance of the Managing Director 
and  all  members  of  the  Executive  Management  Team  (EMT)  when  deciding  whether  to  award 
performance-related  remuneration  through  short-term  and  long-term  incentives  for  the  year 
completed and when assessing fixed remuneration for future periods. Further information on the 
outcomes of the FY2016 assessment of executive remuneration is set out in the Remuneration 
Report. 
 
Each  year,  the  Directors  review  the  performance  of  the  whole  Board,  Board  committees  and 
individual Directors. This year, a full review was undertaken with assistance from an independent 
external  consultant,  covering  individual  Director  performance,  the  Board  and  Committees’ 
activities  and  work  program,  time  commitments,  meeting  efficiency  and  Board  contribution  to 
strategy, monitoring, compliance and governance. The results of the review were discussed by 
the  whole  Board,  and  initiatives  to  improve  or  enhance  Board  performance  and  effectiveness 
were considered and recommended.

Diversity 
 
Origin  encourages  diversity  and  the  expression  of  ideas  and  opinions,  while  also  requiring 
alignment  with  Origin’s  Principles,  Values  and  Commitments  and  the  policies  established  to 
implement them. 
 
Origin  is  committed  to  providing  equality  of  opportunity  and  a  rewarding  workplace  for  all 
employees, and has policies and procedures in place designed to:
  prevent and eliminate unlawful discrimination and harassment; 
  promote a culture, through communication and visible leadership, where managers and
employees proactively apply the Company’s diversity policies and program;
  maintain workplace flexibility policies suitable for a leading Australian company; and 
  maintain a process to deliver gender pay equity at all job levels across the Company.
Gender Diversity  
 
Increasing gender diversity, especially in senior roles, is an ongoing policy priority.  Accordingly, 
in FY2016 Origin committed to:
  continue to deliver equal average pay for men and women at each job grade; 

increase  the  number  of  women  in  senior  roles,  with  a  target  to  improve  the  rate  of 
appointment of women to senior roles by 15 per cent; and 
improve the retention of women in senior roles, with a target to reduce the gap between 
male and female turnover to zero.

Progress against these targets is reported internally on a quarterly basis to the Diversity Council, 
comprising the EMT and chaired by the Managing Director. Performance against the targets in 
FY2016 is described below. 
 
Definition of seniority  
 
For the purpose of gender diversity targets, ‘senior roles’ includes all people in Hay Pay Scale job 
grades that pay approximately $150,000 per year or more in total remuneration.1 As at 30 June 
2016 there were 1,574 people in senior roles, of which 27.4 per cent were women. 
 
We  define  seniority  by  reference  to  standard  Hay  Pay  Scale  job  grades,  rather  than  reporting 
relationship to the CEO, for two reasons:


to make genuine comparisons of seniority. In recent years executives leading four support 
functions have reported to the CEO. A large number of people in corporate support areas 
such  as  legal,  company  secretary,  human  resources,  strategy  and  communications  are 
therefore only two or three levels below the CEO, while in the operating businesses there 
are many roles with significant line management responsibility that are more than three 
levels below; and 
to  make  analysis  comparable  over  time.  Any  restructure  that  changes  EMT  roles  also 
changes the reporting relationship of hundreds of people at lower levels, making it less 
valid to accurately compare progress on gender pay equality at those levels before and 
after the restructure.
While Origin does not use reporting relationship to the CEO to define Origin’s gender diversity 
targets,  the  gender  profile  of  these  cohorts  is  of  interest  to  some  external  stakeholders  and  is 
presented in the following table. 
                                                 
1   The  number  can  only  be  approximate  because  exact  remuneration  varies  by  individual  by  year  according  to  their  assessed
performance under the Short Term Incentive Scheme.

Performance versus targets 
 
1.  Target to deliver equal average pay for men and women at each job grade 
 
Average pay for men and women at each job grade fluctuates during the year as the population 
in  each  grade  cohort  changes  with  turnover,  recruitment  and  promotions.    As  part  of  the 
appointment  process  and  also  annually  in  September  when  the  majority  of  the  workforce  has 
remuneration  reviewed  to  market,  pay  decisions  are  monitored  for  their  impact  on  gender 
positioning. Over time, as seen in the following chart, these processes have driven a long-term 
improvement in gender pay balance. 
 
Origin defines ‘equal work’ by the industry standard of Hay job grades.  At the end of FY2016, 
average female pay was higher at some grades than average male pay and lower at others. The 
average difference between male and female pay across all job grades was just below 1%.
2   Karen Moses, Executive Director, Finance and Strategy, retired from her role on the Board in the first half of the period and moved 
out of her associated line management responsibilities into a role working on special projects for the Managing Director. As a 
result, Gary Mallett moved into the role of Acting Chief Financial Officer, and three executives who previously reported to Karen 
Moses reported to the Managing Director on an interim basis. The numbers in the table represent the situation after the interim 
arrangements came into place.
3   Definitions  for  CEO-1,  CEO-2  and  CEO-3  are  as  per  Workplace  Gender  Equality  Agency  guidelines  (i.e.  excluding  clerical, 
administration and other staff that do not themselves manage people). With all staff included, CEO-3 at Origin was 46 per cent 
female (cohort 219).
Origin Energy Limited ABN 30 000 051 696
Page 4 of 14
2.  Target to improve the rate of appointment of women to senior roles by 15 per cent versus the
prior year
The percentage of women recruited into senior roles (28.6 per cent) was down, after three years 
of  significant  improvement,  as  shown  in  the  following  chart.    The  key  policies  and  actions 
introduced four years ago to drive that improvement were still in place in FY2016, namely, every 
interview  panel  for  a  senior  role  must  be  made  up  of  both  men  and  women;  where  possible4 
every shortlist must have at least one woman; and progress versus target for each Business Unit 
is reported to and reviewed by the Diversity Council each quarter. 
 
During  the  year  very  significant  effort  went  into  the  fair  and  orderly  downsizing  of  Origin’s 
workforce,  and  senior  appointments  were  relatively 
to  previous  years. 
Nevertheless,  the  FY2016  result  on  appointments  was  disappointing  in  light  of  the  recent 
progress.  
 
External appointment to senior roles (per cent females)
few  compared
3.  Target to reduce the gap between male and female turnover to zero 
 
Due  to  large-scale  downsizing  programs  executed  during  the  year,  turnover  for  both  men  and 
women was much higher than in previous years. Overall, 25.5 per cent of men in senior roles and 
31 per cent of women in senior roles left Origin during the year.
The Fit for the Future program reduced the number of people in functional support roles in Origin 
by  approximately  half.  Those  roles  were  held,  both  before  and  after  the  reductions,  by 
approximately 50 per cent women, 50 per cent men. This compares to the overall Company split, 
in senior roles, of 28.6 per cent female, 71.4 per cent male. We knew therefore that a large-scale 
reduction  in  the  functional  areas,  even  if  gender  neutral,  would  disproportionately  affect  the 
gender  split  across  Origin,  which  it  did  in  the  final  result.  The  gap  of  5.5  percentage  points 
between male and female turnover in senior roles means we did not achieve our target.
4   Some senior roles, mainly engineering and technical, receive no female applicants or no candidates are able to be identified.

Targets for FY2017 
 
Origin’s public diversity targets for FY2017 will be:
  continue to deliver equal average pay for men and women at each job grade; 

increase  the  number  of  women  in  senior  roles,  with  a  target  that  36  per  cent  of  such 
appointments be female; and 
improve the retention of women in senior roles, with a target to reduce the gap between 
male and female turnover to zero.

If female appointments to senior roles were to be 36 per cent, this would represent a 25 per cent 
improvement  on  our  performance  in  FY2016.  Thirty  six  per  cent  has  been  targeted  because  it 
would constitute our best ever performance on this measure.  
 
The Board oversees Origin’s strategies on gender diversity, including monitoring achievements 
against gender targets set by the Board. The Board has set itself a target of females being at 
least 40 per cent of the Board by 2020. 
 
Principle 2: Structure the Board to add value 
 
The Board is structured to facilitate the effective discharge of its duties and to add value through 
its deliberations. 
 
In  FY2016,  the  Board  had  10  scheduled  meetings,  including  a  two-day  strategic  planning 
meeting. The Board also had six separate scheduled workshops to consider matters of particular 
relevance.  Outside  of  scheduled  meetings,  the  full  Board  met  on  three  other  occasions  to 
consider significant matters. In addition, the Board conducted visits of Company operations and 
met with operational management during the year. 
 
From time to time, the Board delegates its authority to non-standing committees of Directors to 
consider transactional or other matters. In the 12 months to 30 June 2016, five such additional 
Board  Committee  meetings  were  held.  In  addition,  the  Board  established  a  Due  Diligence 
Committee as part of the pro-rata accelerated renounceable entitlement offer which took place in 
2015. This Committee met nine times. 
 
At  Board  meetings,  Directors  receive  reports  from  executive  management  on  financial  and 
operational  performance,  risk,  strategy,  people,  HSE,  and  major  projects  or  initiatives  in  which 
Origin  is  involved.  In  addition,  the  Directors  receive  reports  from  Board  Committees  and,  as 
appropriate, presentations on opportunities and risks for the Company. 
 
Non-executive Directors also meet without the presence of management (including the Managing 
Director)  to  address  such  matters  as  succession  planning,  key  strategic  issues,  and  Board 
operation  and  effectiveness.    All  Directors  have  access  to  Company  employees,  advisers  and 
records.    In  carrying  out  their  duties  and  responsibilities,  Directors  have  access  to  advice  and 
counsel from the Chairman, the Company Secretary and the Group  General Counsel, and are 
able to seek independent professional advice at the Company’s expense, after consultation with 
the Chairman. 
 
New  Directors  undergo  an  induction  program  which  includes  sessions  with  members  of 
management,  Chairman  of  the  Board,  and  Chairmen  of  each  relevant  Board  Committee,  and 
visits to key operations to familiarise them with Origin’s business and administration.  Directors 
also  receive  continuing  education  through  ongoing  briefings  and  workshops  on  industry, 
regulatory or other relevant topics and attendance at industry or governance conferences.

The  Board’s  size  and  composition  is  determined  by  the  Directors,  within  limits  set  by  Origin’s 
Constitution, which requires a Board of between five and 12 Directors. As at 30 June 2016, the 
Board  comprised  eight  Directors,  including  seven  Non-executive  Directors,  all  of  whom  are 
considered independent by the Board, and the Managing Director. Of the eight Directors, two are 
women.  Directors’  profiles,  duration  of  office  and  details  of  their  skills,  experience  and  special 
expertise are set out in the Directors’ Report. 
 
The  Board  seeks  to  have  an  appropriate  mix  of  skills,  experience,  expertise  and  diversity  to 
enable  it  to  discharge  its  responsibilities  and  add  value  to  the  Company.  The  Board  values 
diversity in all respects, including gender and differences in background and life experience, 
communication  styles,  interpersonal  skills,  education,  functional  expertise  and  problem  solving 
skills. 
 
Together, the Directors contribute the following key skills and experience:

The Company’s policy on the Independence of Directors requires that the Board is comprised of 
a majority of independent Directors. In defining the characteristics of an independent Director, the 
Board uses the ASX Principles, together with its own considerations of the Company’s operations 
and businesses and appropriate materiality thresholds. Further details of the matters considered 
by the Board in assessing independence are contained in the Independence of Directors Policy 
which is part of the Board Charter and is available on the Company’s website. 
 
The Board reviews each Director’s independence annually. At its review for the FY2016 reporting 
period, the Board formed the view that all Non-executive Directors were independent. 
 
The Board selects and appoints the Chairman from the independent Directors. The Chairman, Mr 
Cairns, is independent and his role and responsibilities are separate from those of the Managing 
Director.

Five Committees assist the Board in executing its duties relating to audit, remuneration, health, 
safety and environment (HSE), nomination and risk. Each Committee has its own Charter which 
sets out its role, responsibilities, composition, structure, membership requirements and operation. 
These are available on the Company’s website. Each Committee’s Chairman reports to the Board 
on the Committee’s deliberations at the following Board meeting where the Committee meeting 
minutes  are  also  tabled.  Additional  and  specific  reporting  requirements  to  the  Board  by  each 
Committee are addressed in the respective Committee Charters. 
 
Additional  information  about  the  Audit  Committee,  Risk  Committee,  HSE  Committee  and 
Remuneration Committee is provided in response to Principles 4, 7 and 8 respectively. 
 
A list of the members of each Board Committee as at 30 June 2016 is set out below and their 
attendance at Committee meetings during FY2016 is set out in the Directors’ Report.

The Nomination Committee is comprised of the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of each 
other  Board  Committee,  and  is  chaired  by  Mr  Cairns.  The  Nomination  Committee  met  once 
during FY2016, and provides support and advice to the Board by:
16 years 6 months
C: Chairman
  assessing the range of skills and experience required on the Board and of Directors as 
part  of  the  Company’s  continued  consideration  of  Board  renewal  and  succession 
planning; 
reviewing the performance of Directors and the Board;
 
  establishing  processes  to  identify  suitable  Directors,  including  the  use  of  professional
intermediaries; 
recommending Directors’ appointments and re-elections; and
 
  considering the appropriate induction and continuing education provided for Directors.
5 Mr Sargent also chairs the Origin Foundation.
Origin Energy Limited ABN 30 000 051 696
Page 8 of 14
When  identifying  potential  candidates,  the  Nomination  Committee  considers  the  current  and 
future needs of Origin and desired attributes and skill sets for a new Director. Where a candidate 
is recommended by the Nomination Committee, the Board will assess that candidate against a 
range  of  criteria  including  background,  experience,  professional  qualifications and  the  potential 
for the candidate’s skills to augment the existing Board and his/her availability to commit to the 
Board’s activities. If these criteria are met and the Board appoints the candidate as a Director, 
that  Director  will  stand  for  election  by  shareholders  at  the  following  Annual  General  Meeting 
(AGM). 
 
Each year the performance of the Directors retiring by rotation and seeking re-election under the 
Constitution  is  reviewed  by  the  Nomination  Committee  (other  than  the  relevant  Director),  the 
results  of  which  form  the  basis  of  the  Board’s  recommendation  to  shareholders.  The  review 
considers  a  Director’s  expertise,  skill  and  experience,  along  with  his/her  understanding  of  the 
Company’s  business,  preparation 
for  meetings,  relationships  with  other  Directors  and 
management, awareness of ethical and governance issues, independence of thought and overall 
contribution. 
 
The  Board  reviewed  the  performance  of  Mr  Gordon  Cairns  and  Mr  Bruce  Morgan,  who  are 
standing  for  re-election  at  the  AGM  in  October  2016.  Neither  Mr  Cairns  nor  Mr  Morgan  were 
present for his own review. The Board found that each of the Directors seeking re-election had 
been  high  performing  Directors  and  concluded  that  each  of  them  should  be  proposed  for  re-
election.  
 
Principle 3: Act ethically and responsibly 
 
All  Directors  and  employees  are  expected  to  comply  with  the  law  and  act  with  a  high  level  of 
integrity. Origin has a Code of Conduct and a number of policies governing conduct in pursuit of 
Company objectives in dealing with shareholders, employees, customers, communities, business 
partners,  suppliers,  contractors  and  other  stakeholders.  The  Code  of  Conduct  is  based  on  the 
Company’s Statement of Purpose, Principles, Values and Commitments (Origin Compass), which 
serves as a guide to Origin’s decision making, behaviours and actions for its employees. 
 
The Origin Compass and a summary of the Code of Conduct is available on Origin’s website. 
 
Origin prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation or acceptance of bribes and facilitation payments 
in any form. It also prohibits the provision of gifts and gratuities, both directly and indirectly, to 
public  officials  or  relatives  or  associates  of  public  officials.  The  giving  or  receiving  of  gifts  or 
hospitality  is  prohibited  in  all  circumstances  that  influence,  create  obligations  or  conflicts  of 
interest, indicate favouritism or do not align with Origin’s Code of Conduct.  
 
Origin encourages individuals to report known or suspected instances of inappropriate conduct, 
including breaches of the Code of Conduct and other policies and directives. There are policies in 
place designed to protect employees and contractors from any reprisal, discrimination or being 
personally disadvantaged as a result of their reporting a concern. 
 
Principle 4: Safeguard integrity in corporate reporting 
 
The Board has an Audit Committee which comprises five Non-executive Directors, all of whom 
are independent. The Chairman of the Board cannot chair the Audit Committee. The Chairman of 
the  Audit  Committee,  Mr  Bruce  Morgan,  is  an  independent  Director  with  significant  financial 
expertise.  All  members  of  the  Committee  are  financially  literate  and  the  Committee  possesses 
sufficient  accounting  and  financial  expertise  and  knowledge  of  the  industry  in  which  Origin 
operates.
Origin Energy Limited ABN 30 000 051 696
Page 9 of 14
Prior to approval of the Company’s financial statements for each financial period, the Managing 
Director and the Acting Chief Financial Officer give the Board a declaration that, in their opinion, 
the financial records have been properly maintained, that the financial statements complied with 
the accounting standards and gave a true and fair view, and that their opinion had been formed 
on the basis of a sound system of risk management and internal compliance and control which 
was operating effectively. 
 
The  Audit  Committee  oversees  the  structure  and  management  systems  that  are  designed  to 
protect  the  integrity  of  the  Company’s  corporate  reporting.  The  Audit  Committee  reviews  the 
Company’s  half  and  full  year  financial  reports  and  makes  recommendations  to  the  Board  on 
adopting  the  financial  statements.  The  Committee  provides  additional  assurance  to  the  Board 
with regard to the quality and reliability of financial information. The Committee has the authority 
to seek information from any employee or external party. 
 
The internal and external auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee Chairman and, at 
each scheduled Committee meeting, meet separately with the Committee without management 
present. 
 
The Committee reviews the independence of the external auditor, including the nature and level 
of non-audit services provided, and reports its findings to the Board every six months. 
 
The names of the members of the Audit Committee are set out in the table under Principle 2 and 
their attendance at meetings of the Committee is set out in the Directors’ Report. 
 
The  external  auditor  attends  the  Company’s  AGM  and  is  available  to  answer  questions  from 
shareholders relevant to the audit. 
 
Principle 5: Make timely and balanced disclosure 
 
Origin has adopted policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with its continuous 
disclosure obligations and make senior management accountable for that compliance. 
 
Origin is committed to providing timely, full and accurate disclosure and to keeping the market 
informed with quarterly releases detailing exploration, development and production, and half and 
full year reports to shareholders including in digital format on the Company’s website. 
 
All  material  matters  are  disclosed  immediately  to  the  stock  exchanges  on  which  Origin’s 
securities are listed (and subsequently to the media, where relevant), as required by the relevant 
listing  rules.  All  material  investor  presentations  are  released  to  the  stock  exchanges  and  are 
posted on the Company’s website. Other reports or media statements that do not contain price 
sensitive information are included on the Company’s website. Shareholders can subscribe to an 
email notification service and receive notice of any announcements released by the Company. 
 
Both  the  Continuous  Disclosure  Policy  and  the  Communications  with  Shareholders  Policy  are 
available on the Company’s website. 
 
Principle 6: Respect the rights of shareholders 
 
Origin respects the rights of its shareholders and has adopted policies to facilitate the effective 
exercise  of  those  rights  through  participation  at  general  meetings  and  with  the  provision  of 
information about Origin and its operations. 
 
Origin  is  committed  to  providing  a  high  standard  of  communication  to  shareholders  and  other 
stakeholders  so  that  they  have  all  available  information  reasonably  required  to  make  informed 
assessments of the Company’s business value and prospects.
Origin Energy Limited ABN 30 000 051 696

Shareholders are able to review the financial and non-financial performance of Origin via a half 
year  report,  shareholder  review,  Annual  Report,  Sustainability  Report  and  annual  general 
meeting materials. These reports are also available on the ASX and in online digital format via 
Origin’s website. Shareholders may also request these in hardcopy. 
 
Sustainability  reporting  is  guided  by  the  Global  Reporting  Initiative  and  includes  disclosures  of 
material  environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  aspects  of  the  Company’s  business 
activities. 
 
Origin  also  discloses  other  ESG  information  via  regulated  National  Greenhouse  Emissions 
Reporting,  as  well  as  voluntary  disclosure  platforms  such  as  the  Carbon  Disclosure  Project. 
Origin regularly engages with and provides requested information to research firms. Origin was 
again included in the FSTE4Good Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability Australia Index during 
the period.  
 
All communications from, and the majority of communications to, the Origin’s share registry are 
available  electronically,  including  the  publication  of  company  reports,  and  shareholders  are 
encouraged to take up the option of e-communications. 
 
Origin’s website contains a list of key dates and all recent announcements, presentations, past 
and  current  company  reports  and  notices  of  meetings.  Shareholder  meetings  and  results 
announcements are webcast and an archive of these meetings is published on the Company’s 
website. 
 
Origin  welcomes  and  encourages  shareholders  to  attend  and  participate  at  its  AGM,  either  in 
person,  by  proxy  or  attorney,  or  by  other  means  adopted  by  the  Board.  At  each  AGM,  the 
Chairman allows a reasonable opportunity for shareholders to ask questions of the Board and the 
external auditors. Shareholders who are unable to attend the AGM are able to view a webcast of 
the meeting (and certain past general meetings) on the Company’s website. 
 
Origin has a wide stakeholder engagement program and a dedicated investor relations function to 
facilitate effective two-way communication with investors.  
 
The Communications with Shareholders Policy is available on the Company’s website. 
 
In addition to shareholders, the Company’s projects and operations necessitate interaction with a 
range  of  stakeholders  including  local  communities,  business  partners,  government,  industry, 
media, suppliers and NGOs. Origin has a program to support these stakeholder interactions and 
facilitate constructive relationships. These include:
  dedicated  community  advisors
the  Company’s 
engagement with local communities and regular dialogue with the communities in which 
Origin operates;
facilitate  and
implement
to  help
  a  government  relations  team  which  regularly  interacts  with  policy  makers  within  the 
jurisdictions of Origin’s operations, particularly to help develop sound and stable policy to 
ensure business certainty;
  dedicated external affairs team with regular interaction with media and NGOs to create a
better understanding of Origin’s business; and
  making  a  contribution  to  the  formulation  of  energy  and  carbon  policy  through  public 
submissions to various enquiries (public submissions Origin has made in these areas are 
available on the government or the Company’s website).
Further  information  on  the  Company’s  stakeholder  engagement  program  can  be  found  in  the 
Sustainability Report under Engaging with Stakeholders.

Customers  are  a  central  part  of  Origin’s  engagement,  innovation  and  value  creation.  Origin 
continues  to  adapt  processes,  introduce  new  products  and  invest  in  technology  to  provide 
customers with greater choice and an improved customer experience. The Sustainability Report 
provides further information on Origin’s interaction with its customers. 
 
Principle 7: Recognise and manage risk 
 
Origin’s approach to risk management aims to embed a risk-aware culture in all decision-making 
and to manage risk in a proactive and effective manner.  The Board has an overarching policy 
governing  the  Company’s  approach  to  risk  oversight  and  management  and  internal  control 
systems. This policy and further information on Origin’s approach to managing its material risks is 
available on the Company’s website. 
 
Origin has established a Risk Committee to oversee its policies and procedures in relation to risk 
management and internal control systems. The Risk Committee is comprised of the Chairman of 
the Board and the Chairman of each other Board Committee, and is chaired by independent Non-
executive  Director  Ms  Maxine  Brenner.  The  Risk  Committee  Charter  is  available  on  the 
Company’s website. The names of the members of the Risk Committee are set out in the table 
under Principle 2 and a record of their attendance at meetings of the Committee is set out in the 
Directors’ Report. 
 
The Chief Risk Officer has unfettered access to the Chairman of the Risk Committee. 
 
The  Company’s  risk  policies  are  designed  to  identify,  assess,  manage  and  monitor  strategic, 
operational, financial and project risks and mitigate the impact in the event that they materialise. 
The  Board  has  also  approved  policies  for  hedging  interest  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates  and 
commodities. Certain specific risks are covered by insurance. 
 
Management  is  responsible  for  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  risk  management  and 
internal  control  systems  to  manage  the  Company’s  risks.  Management  reports  to  the  Risk 
Committee on how material risks are being managed and the effectiveness of controls in place to 
mitigate those risks. The Risk Committee has an annual calendar that includes regular detailed 
risk profile reviews.  
 
The Risk Committee reviews the Company’s risk management framework annually to satisfy itself 
that  it  continues  to  be  sound.  An  independent  review  of  the  design  of  the  risk  management 
framework  was  completed  during  the  financial  year  and  it  found  the  framework  to  be  sound. 
Management has reported to the Risk Committee and the Board that, as at 30 June 2016, the 
framework is sound.  
 
Origin also has an internal audit function which utilises both internal and external resources to 
provide  an  independent  appraisal  of  the  adequacy  and  effectiveness  of  the  Company’s  risk 
management  and  internal  control  systems.  The  internal  audit  function has  direct  access  to  the 
Chairmen  of  the  Audit  and  HSE  Committees  and  management,  and  has  the  right  to  seek 
information.  A  risk-based  approach  is  used  to  develop  the  annual  internal  audit  plan,  aligning 
planned  internal  audit  activities  to  the  Company’s  material  risks.  The  internal  audit  plan  is 
approved by the Audit and HSE Committees annually and reviewed quarterly. 
 
In  addition  to  internal  audit  activities,  second  line  assurance  activity  is  undertaken  across  the 
business  in  the  management  of  risk.  The  findings  of  this  activity  are  reported  through  to  the 
relevant executive and, where appropriate, Board Committee. 
 
Origin’s approach to the management of risks and controls reflects the ‘three lines of defence’ 
model. The first line of defence comprises operational business managers that own and manage 
risks.  The 
that 
oversee/monitor/challenge  risks.  The  third  line  of  defence  comprises  the  Origin  group  internal 
audit function that assures compliance with policies and standards.

The Board’s HSE Committee supports and advises the Board on HSE matters and HSE related 
risks  arising  out  of  the  activities  and  operations  of  Origin  and  its  related  companies.  The  HSE 
Committee comprises the Managing Director and four independent Non-executive Directors. The 
Chairman,  Mr  John  Akehurst,  is  an  independent  Director.  The  Board  considers  that  the  direct 
impact the deliberations of the HSE Committee can have on the day-to-day operations of Origin 
makes it appropriate for the Managing Director to be a member of that Committee. 
 
The names of the members of the HSE Committee are set out under Principle 2 and a record of 
their attendance at meetings of the Committee is set out in the Directors’ Report. 
 
Beyond the financial results, Origin is witnessing changes in community attitudes and increased 
focus  on  local  and  global  environmental  challenges.  Origin  recognises  the  need  for  disclosure 
and transparency of decision making to help investors assess both short term and long term risks 
and prospects. 
 
Origin assesses the environmental and social risks associated with all projects and operations. 
Projects  are  developed with  precautionary  engineering  and management  measures in  place  to 
mitigate  or  manage  key  environmental  and  social  risks,  and  operations  are  managed  using 
policies and procedures to control remaining environmental and social risks. Environmental and 
social risk management is subject to periodic audits and assurance. 
 
As one of Australia’s largest power generators, Origin closely measures, manages and reports on 
the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  associated  with  its  generation  operations.  These  emissions  are 
governed by laws and regulations. Management of emissions extends to the development of a 
low carbon power generation portfolio including natural gas, wind and solar. 
 
Further information on Origin’s management and performance in the social, environmental and 
economic aspects in operating its business is contained in the Sustainability Report6. 
 
Origin  measures  its  reputation,  that  is,  how  Origin  is  perceived  by  Australians  (including 
shareholders) using RepTrak® methodology. Origin’s reputation performance and reputation risk 
issues are periodically reported to the Board. 
 
In  addition  to  stakeholder  measurement  through  RepTrak,  Origin  also  engages  a  number  of 
bespoke advisors to provide real-time monitoring of mainstream and social media to evaluate the 
external operating environment and ensure emerging risks, issues and shifting public and policy 
debates  are  identified  and  addressed  accordingly.  Quarterly  quantitative  and  qualitative 
mainstream  media  analysis  is  undertaken  to  better  understand  external  trends,  sentiment  and 
key public influencers. 
 
These  insights  influence  and  inform  Origin’s  external  affairs  and  stakeholder  engagement 
strategies, as well as customer facing positioning and community engagement approaches. 
 
Principle 8: Remunerate fairly and responsibly 
 
The  Remuneration  Report  sets  out  details  of  the  Company’s  policies  and  practices  for 
remunerating Directors, key management personnel and employees. 
 
The Board has a Remuneration Committee which comprises four Non-executive Directors, all of 
whom are independent. The Chairman, Dr Helen Nugent, is an independent Director. The names 
of the members of the Remuneration Committee are set out under Principle 2 and a record of 
their attendance at meetings of the Committee is set out in the Directors’ Report.

The remuneration of Non-executive Directors is structured separately from that of the Managing 
Director and senior executives. Information on remuneration for Non-executive Directors is in the 
Remuneration Report. 
 
Origin has established a policy which governs dealings in its securities. This precludes any Origin 
personnel  from  engaging  in  short-term  dealings  in  the  Company’s  securities  and  margin  loans 
should not be entered into if they could cause a dealing that is in breach of the general insider 
trading  provisions  of  the  Corporations  Act  or  the  Policy.  Origin  personnel  are  prohibited  from 
entering  into  hedging  transactions  which  operate  to  limit  the  economic  risk  of  any  of  their 
unvested equity-based incentives. The Dealing in Securities Policy is available on the Company’s 
website. 
 
The Code of Conduct, Dealings in Securities Policy and other relevant policies are supported by 
appropriate training programs and regular updates.

1 Under Listing Rule 4.7.3, an entity must lodge with ASX a completed Appendix 4G at the same time as it lodges its annual 
report with ASX. 
Listing Rule 4.10.3 requires an entity that is included in the official list as an ASX Listing to include in its annual report either a 
corporate governance statement that meets the requirements of that rule or the URL of the page on its website where such a 
statement is located. The corporate governance statement must disclose the extent to which the entity has followed the 
recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance Council during the reporting period. If the entity has not followed a 
recommendation for any part of the reporting period, its corporate governance statement must separately identify that 
recommendation and the period during which it was not followed and state its reasons for not following the recommendation and 
what (if any) alternative governance practices it adopted in lieu of the recommendation during that period. 
Under Listing Rule 4.7.4, if an entity chooses to include its corporate governance statement on its website rather than in its 
annual report, it must lodge a copy of the corporate governance statement with ASX at the same time as it lodges its annual 
report with ASX. The corporate governance statement must be current as at the effective date specified in that statement for the 
purposes of rule 4.10.3. 
2 “Corporate governance statement” is defined in Listing Rule 19.12 to mean the statement referred to in Listing Rule 4.10.3 
which discloses the extent to which an entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance Council 
during a particular reporting period.
