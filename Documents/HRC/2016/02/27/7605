<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eighteenth session 
from 27 January to 7 February 2014. The review of New Zealand was held at the 1st 
meeting on 27 January 2014. The delegation of New Zealand was headed by Judith Collins, 
Minister of Justice, Minister for Ethnic Affairs and Minister for Accident Compensation 
Corporation. At its 10th meeting, held on 31 January 2014, the Working Group adopted the 
report on New Zealand. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of New Zealand: C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Japan and the 
Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of New 
Zealand: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/18/NZL/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/18/NZL/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/18/NZL/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Germany, 
Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to New Zealand through the troika. The 
questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Minister of Justice and Minister for Ethnic Affairs of New Zealand, Judith 
Collins, presented the national report. She described New Zealand as a young, ethnically 
diverse and democratic country in the South Pacific. 
</p>
<p>6. New Zealand had a robust institutional framework, vital to promoting and protecting 
human rights, and encouraged strong civil society input. The Bill of Rights Act and the 
Human Rights Act specifically protected the civil and political rights of its citizens. For the 
eighth year in a row, New Zealand had ranked first or equal first in Transparency 
International&#8217;s Corruption Perceptions Index for having the most open and transparent 
Government and public sector. Whilst priding itself on promoting human rights and equal 
treatment for all citizens, New Zealand was continually seeking to improve. 
</p>
<p>7. Addressing an advance question from Germany on the protection of economic, 
social, and cultural rights, New Zealand confirmed that it recognized the fundamental 
importance of those rights, which were protected through a variety of legislative 
mechanisms, including publicly funded education, health care and social assistance. </p>


<p>8. In response to an advance question from the United Kingdom, New Zealand 
confirmed that its UPR preparation had included extensive consultation with civil society 
and human rights organizations, including multiple public meetings. The New Zealand 
Human Rights Commission and the general public had been consulted during the 
preparation of the draft report. 
</p>
<p>9. New Zealand had increased support for international human rights instruments and 
engagement with United Nations bodies. In 2010, New Zealand had supported the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and in 2011, it had ratified the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography (OP-CRC-SC). New Zealand had received visits from 
the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples and the Subcommittee on 
Prevention of Torture. 
</p>
<p>10. Responding to an advance question from Liechtenstein on the Kampala amendments 
to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, New Zealand confirmed it was a 
long-standing supporter of the International Criminal Court and would make a formal 
decision on ratification of the amendments in the first quarter of 2014. 
</p>
<p>11. New Zealand explained that the indigenous M&#257;ori people of New Zealand were a 
unique group with a rich culture integral to the country&#8217;s identity. M&#257;ori constituted around 
15 per cent of the New Zealand population and Te Reo M&#257;ori was an official language of 
New Zealand. The Treaty of Waitangi, which had been signed in 1840, was a partnership 
agreement between M&#257;ori and representatives of the State and a founding document of New 
Zealand. 
</p>
<p>12. M&#257;ori played a strong role in governance. The M&#257;ori Party and the governing 
National Party worked together in a formal coalition arrangement. The Governor-General, 
three Ministers in Cabinet and 20 per cent of Members of Parliament were of M&#257;ori 
descent. 
</p>
<p>13. New Zealand acknowledged that the story of M&#257;ori achievement was not 
consistently positive. M&#257;ori were over-represented in the criminal justice system as 
offenders and victims. With the adoption of the Addressing the Drivers of Crime initiative, 
however, the number of young M&#257;ori appearing in court had reduced by 30 per cent in the 
past two years. The Government had launched the Youth Crime Action Plan in 2013, 
aiming to reduce crime and recidivism for young M&#257;ori. 
</p><p>14. New Zealand described the role of women in leadership in the country. There had 
been two female prime ministers and two female Governors-General. Three of the four 
levels of the judiciary were headed by women and there were six women in Cabinet. Since 
1998, the gender pay gap had been trending downwards (it currently stood at 10.1 per cent) 
and New Zealand ranked in the top ten of the Global Gender Gap Report published by the 
World Economic Forum. 
</p>
<p>15. New Zealand acknowledged that women and children experienced an unacceptably 
high rate of family violence; the Government was determined to eradicate that problem. In 
2012, the Government had reconvened the Family Violence Ministerial Group, providing 
oversight to a whole-of-government approach to addressing family violence. Recognizing 
the link between alcohol abuse and family violence, in December 2013, the Government 
had enacted legislative changes governing the sale and supply of alcohol. The police had 
indicated that those changes were already making a positive difference to the country&#8217;s 
drinking culture. 
</p>
<p>16. Other significant developments had included: the introduction of Police Safety 
Orders; increasing penalties for breaches of domestic violence restraining orders; 
expanding the definition of domestic violence to include economic and financial abuse; </p>


<p>implementing the 2009 Action Plan for New Zealand Women; and implementation of 
recommendations of the Taskforce for Action on Sexual Violence. 
</p>
<p>17. Responding to the advance question from the United Kingdom on data collection 
and efficacy of domestic violence programmes, New Zealand confirmed that the Families 
Commission was leading work to assess data sources and had developed provisional 
indicators and recommendations for improving data quality. 
</p>
<p>18. Responding to the advance question from the Czech Republic about implementing 
the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women, agencies had met regularly to review progress on all the recommendations since 
the Committee&#8217;s consideration of the seventh periodic report in 2012. New Zealand would 
report back to the Committee in October 2014. 
</p>
<p>19. Referring to an advance question from Spain, New Zealand confirmed that 
protecting children against abuse and neglect was a key priority for the Government. It had 
launched the White Paper for Vulnerable Children and the Children&#8217;s Action Plan in 2012. 
The Vulnerable Children Bill had been introduced in September 2013 to give effect to the 
proposals in the White Paper. The Government was working on extensive reforms across 
health, education, and social sectors. 
</p>
<p>20. In May 2013, the New Zealand Parliament had legislated to allow marriage between 
any two people regardless of gender identity, sex, or sexual orientation. The first same-sex 
couple had been married in New Zealand on 19 August 2013. Legislation also allowed for 
same-sex couples to adopt children and for couples to remain married, regardless of a 
change in their legal gender. 
</p>
<p>21. Referring to the annex to its national report regarding Tokelau, New Zealand said 
that in 2007, Tokelauans had voted by referendum to remain a territory of New Zealand. 
New Zealand continued to have special responsibilities to Tokelau and therefore reported 
on the human rights situation in Tokelau as part of its national UPR report. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>22. During the interactive dialogue, 76 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>23. France commended the ratification of OP-CRC-SC. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. Gabon commended New Zealand for the harmonious cohabitation of its various 
ethnic communities. It welcomed cooperation with treaty bodies and special procedures, 
and the support to OHCHR through financial contributions. It encouraged New Zealand to 
continue taking measures in favour of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>25. Germany praised the progress achieved in protecting children and women against 
violence, especially within families, and welcomed the endorsement of the Taskforce for 
Action on Violence within Families. It applauded measures to remove socioeconomic 
differences, especially targeting M&#257;ori. Germany made recommendations. 
</p><p>26. Greece welcomed the ratification of OP-CRC-SC. It commended the introduction of 
ten marae-based courts and two Pasifika courts for M&#257;ori and Pacific young people, but 
was concerned at the overrepresentation of indigenous people in the criminal justice 
system. It remained concerned at the high rates of violence against women. Greece made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Hungary commended New Zealand for its leadership in promoting the rights of 
persons with disabilities, its significant efforts to address previous recommendations on </p>


<p>gender equality and the progress made in increasing women&#8217;s representation in the public 
and private sectors. Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Indonesia appreciated the implementation of the New Zealand Disability Strategy. It 
welcomed advances in the constitutional, legal and administrative frameworks to enhance 
human rights and the development of the Second National Action Plan on Human Rights. 
Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. Iran (Islamic Republic of) expressed concern that the safeguards to protect the rights 
of minorities from discrimination and marginalization were insufficient, putting them at a 
higher risk of torture and ill-treatment than the majority population, and at the continued 
high levels of violence against women, particularly M&#257;ori, Pacific and minority women. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Ireland applauded the long-standing, positive leadership on gender equality, while 
expressing concern that one in four New Zealand women experienced sexual violence a 
least once in their lifetime. It noted the significant strides made in advancing the rights of 
M&#257;ori people. Ireland made recommendations. 
</p><p>31. Israel commended New Zealand for its positive response to recommendations during 
its first review, including those on the elimination of violence against women, equality and 
non-discrimination. It noted measures to promote the rights of persons with disabilities and 
encouraged continued focus on the workplan to address the health of persons with 
intellectual disabilities. Israel made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>32. Italy requested further information on the outcome of the &#8220;Growing Up in New 
Zealand&#8221; study, particularly factors influencing children&#8217;s socioeconomic conditions, and 
on the tools used to monitor the trend in child poverty and assess the results of the country&#8217;s 
poverty reduction policies. Italy made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>33. Jamaica noted the many initiatives designed to protect human rights, such as the 
&#8220;Speak Out&#8221; initiative on racial discrimination, and the strides made in the six priorities 
identified by the Government. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>34. Kyrgyzstan noted the commitment to improving and strengthening human rights 
institutions in constructive cooperation with treaty bodies and special procedures, the 
standing invitation to all special procedures and the recent ratification of OP-CRC-SC. It 
commended New Zealand for its activities and financial action to support at-risk children 
and their families. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic noted the long history of promoting and 
protecting human rights and the strong support of humanitarian initiatives. It encouraged 
the Government to continue its cooperation with the United Nations, other international 
organizations and stakeholders to overcome the remaining constraints and challenges. 
</p>
<p>36. Libya welcomed the Government&#8217;s intention to introduce a new action plan for 
human rights and encouraged it to consult with all stakeholders. It noted the efforts and 
positive results of M&#257;ori and Pacifika in the fields of employment, health, education and the 
administration of justice. 
</p><p>37. Malaysia noted the efforts to improve the lives of M&#257;ori and encouraged the 
Government to continue strengthening their social, economic and cultural rights. It 
highlighted progress made in improving the rights of women, children and persons with 
disabilities. Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Mauritius commended New Zealand for its non-discriminatory policies to address 
inequalities in education, employment, health and social welfare in order to raise living 
standards among the deprived. It applauded the recent introduction of the White Paper and </p>


<p>Vulnerable Children Bill and would value learning from those experiences. Mauritius made 
a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>39. Mexico welcomed the repeal of the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004 and the 
promulgation of the 2011 Marine and Coastal Area Act, which enabled M&#257;ori to seek 
recognition of their rights by engaging directly with the Government or by applying to the 
High Court. It noted the reforms in the field of social assistance aimed at reducing 
economic inequalities. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Montenegro commended the ratification of OP-CRC-SC and the significant progress 
made in terms of legislation, institutions and monitoring mechanisms. It asked about 
specific steps taken to prohibit underage and forced marriages. Montenegro made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Morocco requested more information on the New Zealand anti-corruption policy, as 
it constituted good practice for other countries. Morocco asked about measures envisaged to 
remedy the difficulty some schools had incorporating the principle of cultural diversity. It 
welcomed the initiatives being taken to assist vulnerable groups. Morocco made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Responding to the request from the United Kingdom for information on how New 
Zealand was addressing the poor outcomes for M&#257;ori in terms of health, education, housing 
and employment, it described the Wh&#257;nau Ora (family health) programme. Over 150 health 
and social service providers had come together as Wh&#257;nau Ora collectives to develop 
services working directly with M&#257;ori families to identify their needs and aspirations. 
Common themes included better lives for children; employment; housing and home 
ownership; education and skills development; and health and cultural well-being. Early 
results of the programme showed positive signs of change: Kaiti School in Gisborne had 
reported a fall in illness and a consequent rise in attendance. While initial feedback from 
families showed high levels of satisfaction, the Government was continually assessing its 
services in order to improve them where possible. 
</p>
<p>43. New Zealand confirmed that addressing child poverty was a key priority for the 
Government. Poverty in New Zealand was generally understood as &#8220;exclusion from a 
minimum acceptable way of life in one&#8217;s own society because of a lack of adequate 
resources&#8221;. Child poverty rates were in the middle of the international league tables 
published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 
</p>
<p>44. Children in New Zealand had access to free education, health care and, where 
necessary, welfare for their parents. The Government&#8217;s approach in addressing child 
poverty was to promote social mobility, moving families out of poverty through paid 
employment driven by economic growth and improved educational performance.  
New Zealand was testing a change in the delivery of social services through the Social 
Sector Trials, which supported decision-making at the local level and strengthened 
coordination at every level of government and within the community. 
</p>
<p>45. The Government also focused on children&#8217;s engagement and success in education, 
particularly on increasing vulnerable children&#8217;s participation in early childhood education.  
</p>
<p>46. The 2013 budget had contained numerous child poverty initiatives: a $NZ 9.5 
million investment over five years to help extend the KickStart school breakfast 
programme; the provision of $NZ 500,000 a year over three years to help the charity 
KidsCan provide health products, raincoats and shoes for children in need; and a $NZ 45 
million investment in the Rheumatic Fever Prevention Programme. 
</p>
<p>47. New Zealand clarified that its constitutional arrangements were based on the 
Constitution Act and other legislation, such as the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, the 
Treaty of Waitangi, court decisions, constitutional practice and the wider context of  </p>


<p>New Zealand&#8217;s international obligations. The arrangements continued to evolve through 
engagement with M&#257;ori and through negotiation and acceptance of new international 
commitments. 
</p>
<p>48. New Zealand had established an independent Constitutional Advisory Panel in 2010. 
In 2013, the Panel had found that, while there was not broad support for a supreme 
constitution, there was support for entrenching some elements. The Panel&#8217;s 
recommendations had included a review of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and support 
for the continued development of the role and status of the Treaty of Waitangi. The key 
recommendation was that the Government should actively support a continuing 
conversation on constitutional issues. The Government was currently considering the 
recommendations; any changes would need to be carefully examined and have broad public 
support. 
</p>
<p>49. Myanmar highlighted the country&#8217;s impressive achievements in promoting women&#8217;s 
participation, particularly in government. It appreciated measures taken to benefit M&#257;ori 
and welcomed the publication of the White Paper on Vulnerable Children and the 
introduction of the Vulnerable Children Bill. 
</p>
<p>50. Namibia commended government efforts to improve the lives of persons with 
disabilities, including the Funded Family Care scheme which provided financial assistance 
to family caregivers. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. The Netherlands welcomed the leadership New Zealand had provided to enhance the 
rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people and same-sex couples, 
including the introduction of the Marriage Amendment Act 2013. It noted some gaps with 
regard to the right to education and work for M&#257;ori and persons with disabilities, violence 
against women, child poverty and abuse. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Nicaragua applauded advances made in harmonizing national legislation through 
broad consultations with all social actors. It acknowledged the leadership role of New 
Zealand alongside other countries in helping to guarantee women&#8217;s rights and progress 
towards gender equality. Nicaragua made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. The Niger welcomed the action New Zealand had taken in response to 
recommendations, particularly concerning legislation and policy measures in the areas of 
anti-discrimination, education, employment, health and social protection. It commended 
New Zealand for the Marine and Coastal Area Act 2011 and its cooperation with the treaty 
bodies. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>54. Nigeria welcomed the country&#8217;s engagement with OHCHR. It asked New Zealand to 
address the controversial issues around public health and the Disability Strategy. It called 
on New Zealand to ensure that government programmes benefitted all individuals without 
discrimination. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55. Norway welcomed the move to support the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples and achievements in promoting gender equality and women&#8217;s 
rights. It was encouraged by the determination of New Zealand to do more to address 
violence against women through measures to empower them and improve their rights. 
Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Oman noted that constitutional discussions were a priority for New Zealand in its 
efforts to improve human rights. It commended New Zealand for its strategies concerning 
people with disabilities and children at risk and the progress it had made in the provision of 
basic services such as health, transportation and housing. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>57. Paraguay appreciated the recognition of New Zealand of the need to strengthen 
relations between the Government and M&#257;ori and its objective of reducing the high level of </p>


<p>domestic violence. It noted policies aimed at M&#257;ori, particularly health and education 
programmes. It commended the ratification of OP-CRC-SC. Paraguay made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. The Philippines welcomed continued efforts to build a strong legal framework to 
protect migrant workers. It applauded changes in immigration operating policies to allow 
immigrants who lodged complaints to continue living in New Zealand and have access to 
remedies. It hoped that New Zealand would consider ratifying the International Convention 
on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families 
(ICRMW) and International Labour Organization (ILO) Domestic Workers Convention, 
2011 (No. 189). 
</p><p>59. Portugal welcomed the commitment to promoting equality and non-discrimination. 
It encouraged the priority given to improving the protection of children against abuse and to 
reducing domestic violence, in particular its impact on women and children, through the 
adoption of appropriate measures. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. The Republic of Moldova noted the priority given to ensuring that the human rights 
impacts of the Canterbury earthquakes were taken into account in the rebuilding process. It 
asked whether New Zealand would consider gradually withdrawing its reservations to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>61. Romania welcomed efforts to address the effects of long-term situations that at times 
harmed the rights of the citizens. It congratulated New Zealand for its cooperation with 
human rights mechanisms and its commitment to promoting them. It made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>62. Slovakia applauded efforts to further strengthen children&#8217;s rights through the 
ratification of OP-CRC-SC and encouraged its effective implementation. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Slovenia welcomed the ratification of OP-CRC-SC and the Government&#8217;s efforts to 
reduce domestic violence and its impact on women and children, which were a matter of 
concern. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Somalia congratulated New Zealand on the achievements described in its report. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Spain welcomed new legislation to ensure respect of economic, social and cultural 
rights and efforts to reduce child poverty and combat gender-based violence. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Sri Lanka noted efforts to reduce violence against women and improve their 
economic independence and participation in governance. It welcomed the ratification of 
OP-CRC-SC and the Vulnerable Children Bill. It welcomed the announcement of further 
measures to combat the exploitation of migrant workers. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. The State of Palestine welcomed the progress made to promote equality and non-
discrimination in ensuring the rights of indigenous peoples. It commended the ratification 
of OP-CRC-SC and the launch of the White Paper for Vulnerable Children and the 
Children&#8217;s Action Plan. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. Switzerland praised the Treaty settlement process. It remained concerned at the 
numerous cases of domestic violence, abuse and harassment, and at inequalities in health-
care provision, education and salaries, particularly affecting M&#257;ori and Pacifika people. It 
was also concerned that the new legislation on intelligence-gathering might affect privacy 
and freedom of expression. It made recommendations. </p>


<p>69. In response to a comment from Iran (Islamic Republic of), New Zealand reaffirmed 
that torture did not occur in New Zealand. 
</p>
<p>70. In response to a comment from Namibia on the use of tasers, New Zealand clarified 
that police officers were routinely unarmed, that all tasers had an automatic video function 
when in use, and that every incident of taser use was investigated. The use of tasers had 
certainly saved lives; there had been no substantiated incidents of misuse since their 
introduction, and they would remain in service. 
</p>
<p>71. New Zealand was very diverse for a small country with a bicultural foundation; it 
was home to 213 different ethnicities and over 120 languages. In 2013, New Zealand had 
run successful training programmes for ethnic leaders, women and youth. The programmes 
would be extended further in 2014. To improve accessibility, the Government also offered a 
national telephone interpreting service offering interpreting services in 44 different 
languages. 
</p>
<p>72. The Immigration Amendment Act dealt with the eventuality of an illegal mass 
arrival on New Zealand shores. New Zealand recognized that the irregular movement of 
refugees and asylum seekers and people smuggling were significant issues globally and in 
the region. New Zealand remained committed to the Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees, the Bali process and its own annual refugee quota under the resettlement 
programme of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In 
response to interventions from Iran (Islamic Republic of), the Philippines and Sri Lanka, 
New Zealand described the aims of its comprehensive migrant settlement strategy. 
</p>
<p>73. New Zealand was committed to reducing victimization and improving support 
services to victims of crime. In 2011, the Victims Centre had been established in the 
Ministry of Justice to oversee victims&#8217; rights and services. New Zealand noted the recent 
passage of the Victims&#8217; Orders Against Violent Offenders Bill, which would create a new 
non-contact order to protect victims of sexual and serious violent offences.  
</p>
<p>74. In response to a question from Morocco on anti-corruption, New Zealand referred to 
the Organised Crime and Anti-Corruption Bill, which would be introduced in the near 
future. It would increase the effectiveness of efforts to tackle money laundering, identity 
crime and human trafficking, improve the country&#8217;s ability to assist other countries in 
criminal investigations and proceedings and strengthen the compliance of New Zealand 
with the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially 
Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime. Following enactment of the Bill, New Zealand would be able to ratify the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption.  
</p>
<p>75. Thailand applauded efforts to promote the rights of women, children, persons with 
disabilities and LGBT people. It recognized efforts to settle grievances regarding the Treaty 
of Waitangi, but expressed concern at the over-representation of M&#257;ori among the prison 
population. Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia noted the recognition by New Zealand 
of the importance of individual complaints procedures and encouraged the Government to 
make a declaration under article 14 of the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD). It asked whether the Government would 
request publication of the report of the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture following 
its 2013 visit. 
</p>
<p>77. Timor-Leste congratulated New Zealand on the ratification of OP-CRC-SC and on 
the launch of the Children&#8217;s Action Plan and the Vulnerable Children Bill. It made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>78.  Togo congratulated New Zealand on progress made since the first UPR cycle. It 
commended the ratification of OP-CRC-SC and the close cooperation with human rights 
mechanisms, in particular the financial contributions made to OHCHR activities. Togo 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>79. Trinidad and Tobago commended New Zealand on strengthening the partnership 
between the Government and M&#257;ori. It applauded the efforts made following the 
Canterbury earthquakes to rebuild the city, especially with respect to creating sustainable 
and meaningful employment for women. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>80. Tunisia noted progress made since 2010, including the ratification of OP-CRC-SC 
and the preparation of the Second National Action Plan on Human Rights. It encouraged 
further efforts to combat discrimination with a view to eliminating stereotypes of migrants,

recommendations. 
</p>
<p>92. New Zealand provided further information on the Treaty of Waitangi settlements 
process and indigenous rights. Settlements might include land, money and an apology from 
the Government. In most cases, legislation providing for the settlements was approved by 
all parties in Parliament. The Government sought to negotiate settlements for historical 
Treaty grievances that were timely, fair and durable and aimed to reach agreements with all

applications and consider establishing a programme to promote a direct engagement 
mechanism among M&#257;ori closer to the 2017 application deadline. 
</p><p>94. New Zealand had established a Ministerial Committee on Disability Issues in 2009 
to provide increased coordination across agencies and advance implementation of the  
New Zealand Disability Strategy and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities (CRPD). Those priorities had been outlined in the Disability Action Plan. The 
Committee would develop a mechanism to implement the obligation under article 4, 
paragraph 3 of CRPD to ensure that the representative organizations of persons with 
disabilities were involved in development of legislation and policy relevant to them and to 
recognize the importance of having leadership on disability issues come from persons with 
disabilities themselves. 
</p>
<p>95. New Zealand confirmed that accession to the Optional Protocol to CRPD was a key 
consideration. The Government&#8217;s Funded Family Care scheme, introduced in 2013, 
invested $NZ 23 a year million in supporting family carers of persons with disabilities. 
</p><p>96. The M&#257;ori Disability Action Plan, launched in 2012, provided strategic direction

track and achieve in order to deliver faster, smarter and more effective public services. For 
instance, new health services in urban centres focused on Pacific children, providing rapid 
access nurse-led community services to reduce rheumatic fever. 
</p>
<p>98. New Zealand children aged between 5 and 19 years had the right to free education. 
The Government was addressing the particular challenges that some children faced in </p>


<p>accessing education, particularly M&#257;ori, Pasifika, and children with disabilities, through 
measures such as the Pasifika Education Plan and the M&#257;ori Education Strategy. The

</p>
<p>119. Responding to Jamaica and Montenegro on the issue of underage and forced 
marriage, New Zealand stated that it actively supported efforts to eliminate the practice of 
forced marriage. Sexual connection with a person under the age of 16 in New Zealand was 
illegal. Any forced marriage could lead to prosecution for rape and was punishable by a 
term of imprisonment of up to 20 years. It was also an offence to conspire or to be a party 
to any such offence. The Government was not aware of any substantiated claims of 
underage or forced marriage in New Zealand. However, it was seeking advice on the issue 
and was conscious of the difficulties victims faced in reporting such practices. 
</p>
<p>120. New Zealand had introduced several measures to reduce the level of family 
violence, such as Family Violence Courts, a Family Court review, the safe@home project, </p>


<p>the Victims&#8217; Orders Against Violent Offenders Bill, and the Taskforce for Action on

the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. The New Zealand Cabinet 
would consider whether to sign the Convention in 2014. 
</p>
<p>123. The Canterbury earthquakes had been one of the most significant challenges faced 
by any New Zealand government. Since the first earthquake in September 2010, there had 
been more than 11,000 in the Canterbury region, which included  
the country&#8217;s second largest city, Christchurch. The earthquakes were so severe that the 
ground had liquefied in some areas. The estimated earthquake damage was $NZ 40 billion, 
equivalent to 20 per cent of GDP. It was a devastating event for a small country and New 
Zealand was grateful for the substantial international assistance received from a number of 
countries. 
</p>
<p>124. The earthquakes presented challenges regarding the restoration of people&#8217;s dignity 
and fundamental rights. The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority had been 
established in response to the earthquakes and the Government Recovery Strategy included 
provisions for economic, social, and cultural recovery and for the built and natural 
environment. 
</p>
<p>125. Responding to an advance question from Spain, New Zealand acknowledged the 
trauma experienced by Cantabrians. The Government had delivered short-term counselling 
services; increased community health, alcohol and drug services; initiated an extensive 
health promotion marketing campaign; provided resilience and stress-management training 
for health, social service and education workforces; and provided mental health services in 
schools to support children and young people. Those services were ongoing.  
</p>
<p>126. The New Zealand Human Rights Commission was currently preparing  
the Second Action Plan on Human Rights, a key human rights policy document that would 
identify issues to consider over the forthcoming five years. The timing of the document had 
been calibrated so that recommendations from the Universal Periodic Review could inform 
the Second Action Plan. 
</p>
<p>127. New Zealand thanked the President of the Human Rights Council and noted that the 
Government would carefully consider all recommendations before responding formally. 
</p>
