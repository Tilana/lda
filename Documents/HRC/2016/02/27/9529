<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights visited Nepal from 19 to 
24 January 2007 to assess the work of her field office in Nepal; to highlight the critical 
importance of human rights to the peace process; and to help focus attention on long neglected 
issues of discrimination which have the potential to impact negatively on the current transition.  
The annex to the present report contains her findings, including the important progress made in 
terms of the peace process and the end to conflict-related human rights violations, but also 
includes findings on the lack of progress in addressing impunity and the need to urgently address 
issues of social exclusion and discrimination.  During her visit, violent demonstrations erupted in 
the Terai region in an expression of frustration with the political process on the part of Madhesi, 
the indigenous people of the plain as compared to those from the hills.  The High Commissioner 
also reports on these demonstrations.  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) calls for restraint on the part of the security forces, for a return to 
peaceful means of protests on the part of the demonstrators, and for the Government to initiate a 
dialogue on the issues at all levels.

<p><b>I. THE VISIT OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR 
HUMAN RIGHTS TO NEPAL IN JANUARY 2007 
</b></p>
<p>1. The High Commissioner visited Nepal from 19 to 24 January 2007 to review the work of 
her field office in Nepal and to highlight the centrality of human rights in the peace process - at 
this critical juncture - as well as to call attention on a number of longstanding discrimination 
issues which have come to the fore since the end of the peace process and recently led to 
demonstrations, to lethal confrontations with the police, and to communal violence. 
</p>
<p>2. During her mission, the High Commissioner met with key government officials and 
travelled to Nepalgunj in the mid-western region and Sindhupalchowk in the central region.  In 
the mid-western region, she toured a village in Bardiya district where the indigenous Tharu 
community has suffered a large number of disappearances reportedly committed 
predominantly by State security forces, but also Maoists.  In the district of Sindhupalchowk, 
the High Commissioner met with women affected by the conflict and visited an under-equipped 
and under-staffed police post recently re-established to serve a population of 300,000. 
</p>
<p>3. The High Commissioner found that, while conflict-related violence has greatly declined, 
impunity remains prevalent in Nepal.  Both the State and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) 
(CPN-M) leadership have yet to make serious efforts to hold to account those responsible for 
past or current violations.  The human rights community is eager to see some form of 
accountability introduced for past violations.  The Comprehensive Peace Agreement envisages a 
truth-telling process but it is silent on the issue of criminal accountability.  On this point, the 
High Commissioner took the opportunity of her visit to reiterate the need to avoid granting any 
amnesties at this stage so that the possibility of trials at a later date is not precluded.  OHCHR is 
committed to ensuring civil society and the authorities available appropriate transitional justice 
assistance to help determine the best course of action in this regard. 
</p>
<p>4. During the High Commissioner&#8217;s visit, the Minister of Home Affairs and the Chief of the 
Army Staff committed themselves to ensuring a full civilian investigation into the case of Maina 
Sunuwar, a 15-year-old girl who died as a result of torture while in the custody of the then Royal 
Nepalese Army in 2004, and guaranteed that the armed forces would fully cooperate with the 
investigation.  While OHCHR will continue to press the authorities to deliver on their 
commitments in the Sunuwar case, it is understood that bringing justice in this instance must 
signal the beginning of the Government&#8217;s commitment to address past violations, not an end to 
it.  Shortly after her visit, the High Commissioner provided a first submission to the Department 
of Peacekeeping Operations of cases involving Nepalese military units and individuals against 
whom there is prima facie evidence of having committed human rights violations, with a 
recommendation that such units or individuals be barred from service with the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>5. The lack of accountability on the part of CPN-M is equally disturbing.  In Nepal, the 
High Commissioner made both public and private appeals to CPN-M to end continuing abuses 
by their cadres and she urged the authorities to bring to justice those responsible for violations.  
During the course of her mission, the CPN-M leadership stated that it had issued instructions for 
its parallel systems of governance to be dissolved.  The onus is now on CPN-M to deliver on this 
commitment and on State authorities to ensure that they can effectively fill the law enforcement 
vacuum that exists in much of the country. </p>

</p>
<p>6. The peace process has brought new urgency to addressing longstanding human rights 
issues revolving around discrimination and social exclusion.  Demonstrations in the Terai region 
organized by the Madhesi,<b>1</b> voicing their frustration at the lack of inclusion in the political 
process, erupted into violence during the High Commissioner&#8217;s visit to Nepal. 
</p>
<p>7. The absence of an effective national strategy, with concomitant commitment, to combat 
discrimination is emerging as one of Nepal&#8217;s greatest challenges during the peace process.  Such 
grievances need to be actively and imaginatively addressed by the Government and the political 
parties, in consultation with civil society, through open and public debate regarding all aspects of 
the political transition. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  UNREST IN THE TERAI REGION 
</b></p>
<p>8. OHCHR is deeply concerned about the recent violence in the Terai area of 
southern Nepal (see A/HRC/4/97, paragraphs 65 and 66) in the context of demonstrations by 
Madhesi, and the often excessive responses from the Nepal Police and Armed Police Force. 
</p>
<p>9. After the arrest of a group of Madhesi protestors in Kathmandu on 16 January 2007 for 
burning a copy of the Interim Constitution, an organization called the Madhesi Peoples&#8217; Rights 
Forum organized a Terai-wide strike (bandh), requesting that the Government amend the Interim 
Constitution so that it provide for (a) a federal State structure with autonomy for component 
states, including the Terai; (b) the redrawing of electoral constituencies based on population; and 
(c) proportional representation of Madhesis in government bodies, including the legislature and 
the security forces.  The bandh was widely observed and resulted in a shutdown of commerce 
and transportation throughout large areas of southern Nepal. 
</p>
<p>10. Following the fatal shooting of a protestor by a CPN-M cadre on 19 January 2007 and of 
four demonstrators by the Nepal Police and Armed Police Force on 22 January, both in Siraha 
District, demonstrations quickly spread throughout the Terai areas of the central and eastern 
regions.  The demonstrations resulted in extensive damage to public and private property, 
widespread threats to journalists and human rights defenders, serious injuries to demonstrators 
and police, and substantial loss of life.  At the time of writing, OHCHR had confirmed 24 deaths 
(23 civilians and 1 police officer) and hundreds of injuries, resulting primarily from 
confrontations between demonstrators and the police. 
</p>
<p>11. OHCHR field teams were deployed to monitor the demonstrations, to engage in 
preventive protection work and to investigate instances in which the Nepal Police and the Armed 
Police Force had responded to the demonstrations with excessive, and sometimes lethal, force.  
For example, OHCHR teams documented cases of the Nepal Police and Armed Police Force 
beating protestors on the head with metal-bound bamboo sticks (lathis), entering homes to beat 
residents, obstructing the passage of ambulances and emergency vehicles and firing live 
ammunition directly into crowds of demonstrators when there was no credible threat to life.  It is

<p> A/HRC/4/97/Add.1

</p>
<p>acknowledged that the police were, on several occasions, confronted with violence and severe 
provocation.  Nevertheless, many aspects of the police response mirrored the excessive and 
unnecessary use of force employed by the security forces in response to the protests of 
April 2006, documented in OHCHR public report of September 2006,<b>2</b> which indicates that the 
relevant recommendations made in that report have yet to be acted on by the law enforcement 
agencies and the Interim Government. 
</p>
<p>12. The violence subsided after the Prime Minister made a public announcement 
on 7 February 2007 that the Interim Constitution would be amended in such a way as to satisfy a 
number of the Madhesi demands.  However, the atmosphere remains tense in the Terai areas of 
Nepal, and OHCHR has serious concerns that the Nepal Police, and in particular the Armed 
Police Force, lack the capacity to respond effectively to such demonstrations using only the 
minimum necessary force. 
</p>
<p>13. During the unrest, OHCHR publicly and repeatedly called on the Government and 
Madhesi leaders to engage in immediate dialogue to stop the violence and to identify solutions to 
restore peace and respect for human rights.  OHCHR believes that, as well as addressing 
Madhesi demands for representation, there must be prompt and credible investigations into all 
killings and injuries to determine those responsible.  It is essential that those responsible for the 
violence should also be held fully accountable in accordance with the law, whether it be security 
forces personnel, CPN-M cadres or demonstrators. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p>14.<b> The issues of impunity and social exclusion, and the violence surrounding 
demonstrations need to be urgently addressed to ensure respect for human rights as a 
foundation of the peace process.  Concerted efforts will need to continue to ensure that 
there is effective accountability for past crimes, whether committed by the security forces 
or CPN-M.  The political leadership on all fronts needs to ensure that every sector of 
Nepalese society is effectively engaged in the political transition.  It will be crucial for 
security forces to learn from their past experience of policing demonstrations.  Most 
significantly, police should ensure that they avoid excessive use of force.  At the same time 
all segments of society should engage only in peaceful forms of protest.
