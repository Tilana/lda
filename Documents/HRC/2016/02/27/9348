<p>system, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Human Rights Council, and regional 
organizations, national institutions and civil society, to promote the wide dissemination of the 
United Nations study on violence against children, to give support to the first year of effective 
follow-up to its recommendations and to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-second 
session a report on progress made in the initial phase of the follow-up and to anticipate the 
necessary strategy for follow-up to the implementation of the study. A progress report was 
presented by the independent expert to the sixty-second session of the General Assembly 
on 19 October 2007 (A/62/209).  
</p>
<p><b>Activities of the independent expert 
</b></p>
<p>4. Throughout 2007 the independent expert continued his efforts to disseminate the study. A 
summary of his activities until July 2007 is contained in the progress report (A/62/209). Between 
July and December 2007 the independent expert presented the findings and recommendations 
contained in the study in different forums, including: the Conference on International Justice for 
Children, organized by the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France, on 17-18 September; the 
course for the Spanish Judiciary (Madrid, 19-21 September); and the 33rd edition of the 
International Conference of the Center Pio Manz&#250; (Rimini, Italy, 27-29 October). In November 
and December, the independent expert presented his report to the Italian Senate and the 
Portuguese National Assembly respectively. The independent expert participated in national 
launches of the study in Amsterdam (7-9 November), Brasilia (3-4 December), and 
Bucharest (13-15 December).  
</p>
<p>5. In the same period, the independent expert discussed strategies for follow-up of the study 
with national authorities in a number of countries, as well as in international forums, including: 
the Child Protection/Education Regional Meeting organized by the Americas and the Caribbean 
Regional Office (TACRO) of UNICEF in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on 20-24 August 2007; the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on 12 October in Washington DC; and the ninth 
EU-NGOs Forum on human rights held in Lisbon, on 6 and 7 December. During the 
sixty-second session of the General Assembly the expert participated to two side events on the 
follow-up of the study.  
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up 
</b></p>
<p>6. On 18 December 2007, the General Assembly adopted resolution 62/141, in which it takes 
note with appreciation of the progress report of the independent expert and requests the 
Secretary-General &#8220;to appoint for a period of three years a Special Representative on violence 
against children, at the highest possible level &#8230;&#8221;. The Assembly further recommends that the 
Special Representative, taking care to avoid duplication with relevant United Nations 
mechanisms and treaty bodies: &#8220;(a) Act as a high-profile and independent global advocate to 
promote the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against children in all 
regions &#8230;; (b) Promote and support, in cooperation with Member States, the implementation of 
the recommendations of the United Nations study on violence against children, where 
appropriate, recommending measures, ways and means at the national, regional and international 
levels to eliminate violence against children and its causes and to remedy its consequences &#8230;; 
(c) Identify and share good practices to prevent and respond to violence against children, 
between States and across regions, assist Member States in their efforts to develop more 
comprehensive and systematic data collection on violence against children &#8230;; (d) Work closely </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and cooperate fully with relevant United Nations treaty bodies and mechanisms &#8230;; (e) Also 
work closely and cooperate with the United Nations system and the existing mandates of 
United Nations funds and programmes and specialized agencies that have responsibilities in the 
area of violence against children, in particular those that are members of the Inter-Agency Group 
on Violence against Children; (f) Establish a mutually supportive collaboration with civil 
society &#8230; and work to promote the increased involvement of children and young people in 
initiatives to prevent and respond to violence against children&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>7. In the same resolution, the Assembly further &#8220;Requests the relevant organizations of the 
United Nations system, in particular the organizations members of the Inter-Agency Group on 
Violence against Children, to continue to explore ways and means, within their respective 
mandates, by which they can contribute more effectively to addressing the need to prevent and to 
respond to all forms of violence against children.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>8. The Inter-Agency Group on Violence against Children held meetings in March and 
October 2007 with the participation of the independent expert and discussed cooperation and 
coordination in promoting follow-up to the study. A number of joint initiatives have been 
initiated by the Inter-Agency Group to promote the implementation of the recommendations of 
the study.
