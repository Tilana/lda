<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The present report is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
</p>
<p>component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-
</p>
<p>discrimination in this context, Leilani Farha, in accordance with Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 15/8 and 25/17. The report focuses on the roles of local and other subnational 
</p>
<p>levels of government and considers how they can be fully engaged in the realization of the 
</p>
<p>right to adequate housing. In the context of a trend toward decentralization of 
</p>
<p>responsibilities, the report finds that while decentralization may have significant 
</p>
<p>advantages, it must always be guided by human rights. Local and subnational governments 
</p>
<p>should be cognizant of and accountable to the human rights obligations that go along with 
</p>
<p>their growing responsibilities and States must ensure that they have the capacity and 
</p>
<p>resources needed to fulfil those obligations. 
</p>
<p>While international human rights obligations extend to all levels of government, 
</p>
<p>international human rights mechanisms tend to focus more on the role of national level 
</p>
<p>governments. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the importance of international human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms engaging constructively with the responsibilities of local governments 
</p>
<p>and finds that communications procedures and country missions provide positive 
</p>
<p>opportunities in that regard.  
</p>
<p>The report finds that housing rights claims at the domestic level often address the 
</p>
<p>role of local and other subnational governments and have generated contextualized 
</p>
<p>understandings of the right to adequate housing. Drawing inspiration from emerging human 
</p>
<p>rights initiatives bringing together cities and subnational governments, civil society, 
</p>
<p>community-based organizations and human rights institutions, the report underscores the 
</p>
<p>benefit of interactive relationships with local struggles for the realization of the right to 
</p>
<p>adequate housing.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In her report to the General Assembly (A/69/274), the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the 
</p>
<p>right to non-discrimination in this context, Leilani Farha, identified the significant 
</p>
<p>responsibilities of local and other subnational governments for key aspects of housing and 
</p>
<p>related programmes. She noted that effective engagement with those levels of government 
</p>
<p>was critical to promoting the implementation of the right to adequate housing. Given the 
</p>
<p>importance of local and other subnational governments to all aspects of the mandate, she 
</p>
<p>has decided to address that theme in her first thematic report to the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>pursuant to resolutions 15/8 and 25/17. 
</p>
<p>2. In the present report, the term &#8220;local and other subnational levels of government&#8221; 
</p>
<p>refers to everything from rural villages to large metropolitan areas, boroughs to provinces, 
</p>
<p>and recognizes that there are usually multiple levels of local government within a single 
</p>
<p>country.
1
 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur solicited and received information and views on the issue 
</p>
<p>from States, civil society and national human rights institutions.
2
 She held an informal 
</p>
<p>consultation in New York with civil society, a public consultation in Geneva with delegates 
</p>
<p>of permanent missions, and a two-day consultation with experts in housing, human rights 
</p>
<p>and local governance from around the world. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the 
</p>
<p>information and guidance received. 
</p>
<p>4. Over the last three decades, global trends toward decentralization, rapid urbanization 
</p>
<p>and the creation of megacities, as well as a significant rise in displacement caused by 
</p>
<p>conflict and natural disasters, and increased migration, have placed new and challenging 
</p>
<p>responsibilities on local and other subnational governments with respect to housing. 
</p>
<p>Effective strategies for the promotion and realization of the right to adequate housing must 
</p>
<p>engage with and respond to those challenges. 
</p>
<p>5. International human rights obligations extend to all levels of government within 
</p>
<p>their allocated sphere of responsibilities. International human rights mechanisms, however, 
</p>
<p>interact primarily with national level governments. Trends toward decentralization and 
</p>
<p>greater responsibilities for local and subnational governments have meant that States&#8217; 
</p>
<p>obligations under international human rights law rely increasingly on implementation by 
</p>
<p>local and subnational government. There is a general concern that responsibilities may be 
</p>
<p>transferred away from national level governments without a concomitant transfer of 
</p>
<p>resources, knowledge, capacity and accountability for human rights obligations with respect 
</p>
<p>to the right to adequate housing.
3
 
</p>
<p>6. While continuing to engage in direct dialogue with national level governments, the 
</p>
<p>international human rights system must also engage constructively with challenges and 
</p>
<p>developments at the local or subnational levels. That is particularly the case with respect to 
</p>

</p>
<p> 3 In the present report, the term &#8220;responsibilities&#8221; is generally used to refer to domestically assigned 
</p>
<p>authority or roles with respect to housing. The term &#8220;obligations&#8221;, on the other hand, refers to what is 
</p>
<p>required for compliance with the right to adequate housing.  </p>


<p>the right to adequate housing. Forced evictions and discriminatory exclusion from housing 
</p>
<p>often result from decisions or policies adopted at the local or subnational levels. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>local governments have increasingly critical responsibilities with respect to positive 
</p>
<p>measures required for the progressive realization of the right to adequate housing, including 
</p>
<p>infrastructure development, land-use planning, upgrading of informal settlements, 
</p>
<p>development and administration of housing and social programmes, market regulation and 
</p>
<p>resource allocation.  
</p>
<p>7. Important advances are being made in relation to human rights and the right to 
</p>
<p>adequate housing at the local level. Civil society movements to promote and enforce the 
</p>
<p>right to adequate housing are emerging in response to issues of local dimension, where 
</p>
<p>communities are denied adequate housing and seek to build more inclusive cities and 
</p>
<p>municipalities. Those movements can enrich international human rights and at the same 
</p>
<p>time, international human rights standards and principles can strengthen and support the 
</p>
<p>movements as well as community struggles for adequate housing and create the opportunity 
</p>
<p>for enhanced local-international linkages.  
</p>
<p>8. The present report into local and other subnational levels of governments in relation 
</p>
<p>to the right to adequate housing is intended as a first step toward a better understanding of 
</p>
<p>the challenges and opportunities arising at that level. The Special Rapporteur hopes to 
</p>
<p>continue the ongoing dialogue with States, civil society, human rights institutions and other 
</p>
<p>actors over the course of her mandate to consider how, in the context of prevailing trends 
</p>
<p>and diverse domestic systems, all levels of government can be fully engaged in the 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p><b> II. International human rights framework  
</b></p>
<p>9. The international human rights obligations of a State extend to all levels of 
</p>
<p>government and to any exercise of governmental authority. &#8220;All branches of government 
</p>
<p>(executive, legislative and judicial), and other public or governmental authorities, at 
</p>
<p>whatever level &#8212; national, regional or local &#8212; are in a position to engage the responsibility 
</p>
<p>of the State Party&#8221;.4 That finds expression, in the context of federal States, in article 28 of 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and article 50 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which affirm: &#8220;The provisions of the 
</p>
<p>present Covenant shall extend to all parts of federal States without any limitations or 
</p>
<p>exceptions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>10. The internal allocation of responsibilities for implementing the right to adequate 
</p>
<p>housing is a matter for State parties to determine, but the allocation must be consistent with 
</p>
<p>the obligation to ensure compliance with international human rights obligations.
5
 The 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has indicated that &#8220;all administrative 
</p>
<p>authorities will take account of the requirements of the Covenant in their decision-
</p>
<p>making&#8221;.<footnote name="6">0 See www.urbanreinventors.net/3/wsf.pdf. </footnote> Hence, the wide range of housing policy and programme decisions often made at 
</p>
<p>the local level, including budgeting, planning, zoning, allocation of benefits and publically 
</p>
<p>funded housing units, the provision or regulation of basic services, rent subsidies, and any 
</p>
<p>other decisions related to access to adequate housing, must comply with relevant, 
</p>
<p>applicable human rights norms. In most cases a national housing strategy is required among

</p>
<p>obligation imposed on States Parties to the Covenant, para. 4.

<p>application of the Covenant, para. 9. </p>


<p>regional and local authorities in order to reconcile related policies with the obligations 
</p>
<p>under the Covenant.
7
 The Committee on the Rights of the Child further clarifies that State 
</p>
<p>parties must also ensure that local authorities &#8220;have the necessary financial, human and 
</p>
<p>other resources to effectively discharge [their] responsibilities&#8221;.8  
</p>
<p><b> III. Responsibilities of local and other subnational governments 
in relation to the right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>11. There is significant diversity among States as to how responsibilities with respect to 
</p>
<p>housing and related programmes are allocated among different levels of governments. 
</p>
<p>Within a range of domestic contexts and unique histories, however, it is clear that local and 
</p>
<p>other subnational levels of government usually carry critical responsibilities linked to the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the right to adequate housing. As noted by UN-Habitat, national housing 
</p>
<p>strategies require local level implementation, reviews of laws and regulations, planning, 
</p>
<p>and financial instruments and formulation, mobilization of stakeholders, and adoption of 
</p>
<p>local housing strategies drawing on local innovation and know-how.
9
  
</p>
<p>12. General patterns demonstrate that certain responsibilities are often exercised more 
</p>
<p>effectively by national level governments while other responsibilities tend to be better 
</p>
<p>suited to local governments. National level governments are often better placed to ensure a 
</p>
<p>fair distribution of resources, so that areas with fewer resources and greater needs are not 
</p>
<p>simply left to fend for themselves. National level governments usually have greater 
</p>
<p>capacity to develop and enforce national standards, to monitor and compare programmes 
</p>
<p>and outcomes in different regions and localities, to finance housing programmes, regulate 
</p>
<p>mortgages and credit, fund housing subsidy and income support programmes, and oversee 
</p>
<p>taxation and resource allocation. To varying degrees, national governments may also 
</p>
<p>attempt to influence or direct the policies of local and other subnational governments 
</p>
<p>through incentives, conditions, priorities or required outcomes linked to the provision of 
</p>
<p>funding for locally administered programmes.
10
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>13. Local governments, on the other hand, tend to be assigned responsibilities for 
</p>
<p>provision and management of services such as water, sanitation, electricity and other 
</p>
<p>infrastructure; land-use planning, zoning and development, which relates to decisions 
</p>
<p>regarding evictions, displacement and relocation; implementing programmes to upgrade 
</p>
<p>informal settlements and inadequate housing; enforcing health, safety, environmental and 
</p>
<p>building standards; providing local emergency shelter; putting in place or implementing

</p>

</p>
<p>implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, para. 41.

<p>Habitat.pdf, para. 51. 
</p>
<p> 10 See, for example, the response to the questionnaire (see note 2 above) from the national human rights 
</p>
<p>institution in Paraguay (Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo Paraguay), where national programmes are 
</p>
<p>administered through nine regional offices that partner with municipal governments, civil society and 
</p>
<p>private actors to identify the most vulnerable groups and determine appropriate actions. In the 
</p>
<p>response to the questionnaire from the Rwanda Human Rights Commission, the national level 
</p>
<p>government establishes strategies and policies in relation to housing which are then implemented by 
</p>
<p>districts and sectors according to the terms of performance contracts. Local governments have the 
</p>
<p>flexibility to develop partnerships with international donors, as well as with community organizations 
</p>
<p>to build housing for the poor, genocide survivors, the elderly and other vulnerable groups.  </p>


<p>disaster risk reduction and response policies; and regulating the use of public space. Even if 
</p>
<p>programmes are designed and fully or partially funded by central governments, it is often 
</p>
<p>local authorities that decide where housing will be built or upgraded, and determine who 
</p>
<p>will be allocated housing units or receive social benefits or housing subsidy based on 
</p>
<p>prescribed criteria.  
</p>
<p>14. In unitary States, central governments generally hold primary responsibility for 
</p>
<p>planning, programming, regulation and funding of housing. Mortgage programmes, 
</p>
<p>subsidies, cash transfer programmes and other measures to address lack of housing among 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups are managed nationally. Those programmes, however, rely on local 
</p>
<p>implementation, allowing varying degrees of autonomy to regions and 
</p>
<p>municipalities/districts or cities.  
</p>
<p>15. In federal systems, on the other hand, local or other subnational governments often 
</p>
<p>have primary and autonomous responsibility for virtually all aspects of programmes and 
</p>
<p>policies related to the implementation of the right to housing. The role of the national level 
</p>
<p>governments in those situations may be largely one of leadership and coordination.
11
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Germany, for example, has transferred all responsibility for housing to the L&#228;nder<i>. </i>The 
</p>
<p>national level Government convenes an annual meeting of L&#228;nder which brings together 
</p>
<p>key players and facilitates national coordination. 
</p>
<p>16. The allocation of responsibilities to subnational and local governments is rarely 
</p>
<p>static. Various levels of government, development agencies, financial institutions, private 
</p>
<p>actors, community-based organizations and other relevant stakeholders continually redefine 
</p>
<p>the relationships among themselves in order to respond to new challenges or to improve the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of programmes and policies. While the reallocation of responsibilities may 
</p>
<p>move in either direction &#8212; from the centre to the local level or from the local to the central 
</p>
<p>Government &#8212; the general trend since the early 1990s has been one of decentralization.  
</p>
<p>17. Decentralization &#8212; the transfer of authority and responsibility for public functions 
</p>
<p>from the central Government to intermediate and local governments &#8212; has been advocated 
</p>
<p>as a means to enhance participatory democracy and transparency. It is generally promoted 
</p>
<p>on the basis of the principle of &#8220;subsidiarity&#8221;, which asserts that public responsibilities 
</p>
<p>should be exercised by those elected authorities who are closest to the people.
12
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Decentralization has often been linked to privatization and market deregulation, but such 
</p>
<p>phenomena need not be associated with decentralization and in fact, may run counter to the 
</p>
<p>principle of democratization that is advanced as its primary benefit.  
</p>
<p>18. Three types of decentralization have generally been distinguished: a) political 
</p>
<p>decentralization, which transfers power or authority away from the central Government; 
</p>
<p>b) fiscal decentralization, which shifts financial resources to more local governments; and 
</p>
<p>c) administrative decentralization, which moves the administration of programmes and 
</p>
<p>policies to more local authorities. It is generally agreed that all three forms of 
</p>
<p>decentralization need to occur together for successful outcomes, generally moving from 
</p>
<p>transfer of political authority, through transfer of resources to transfer of administration.
13
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>19. Decentralization has been strongly promoted in the area of housing. The Habitat 
</p>
<p>Agenda, adopted at the second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat

<p>II) in Istanbul in 1996, affirmed that &#8220;Governments should strive to decentralize shelter 
</p>
<p>policies and their administration to subnational and local levels within the national 
</p>
<p>framework, whenever possible and as appropriate&#8221;.14 Proponents of decentralization in 
</p>
<p>housing related programmes have argued that it enables local participation in housing 
</p>
<p>management and decision-making, avoids excessive bureaucracy, allows sensitivity to local 
</p>
<p>needs, draws on local capacities, increases transparency and local control and allows for 
</p>
<p>more creative and innovative programming.  
</p>
<p>20. The experiences of decentralization in relation to human rights and the right to 
</p>
<p>adequate housing, however, have been mixed. As Paul Lundberg noted, &#8220;the issue of 
</p>
<p>human rights has not figured prominently in the ongoing discussion on decentralization&#8221;.15 
</p>
<p>Reference to human rights obligations or the right to adequate housing is conspicuously 
</p>
<p>absent, even from the International Guidelines on Decentralisation and Access to Basic 
</p>
<p>Services for all
16
</p>
<p> and the European Charter of Local Self-Government<i>.

<p> Decentralization

<p>and local governance initiatives from international or regional financial institutions such as 
</p>
<p>the International Monetary Fund18 and the Inter-American Development Bank,19 United 
</p>
<p>Nations agencies such as the United Nations Development Programme,20 as well as from 
</p>
<p>associations of local governments,
21
</p>
<p> have focused on economic and political dimensions 
</p>
<p>and participatory rights linked to decentralization. However, they have largely ignored the 
</p>
<p>question of how States&#8217; human rights obligations in relation to the right to adequate housing 
</p>
<p>are to be applied to local governments that have taken on key responsibilities for 
</p>
<p>programmes and policies. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Challenges to the implementation of the right to adequate 
housing by local and other subnational level governments  
</b></p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur has identified a number of common challenges experienced 
</p>
<p>at the local level with respect to the implementation of the right to adequate housing:  
</p>
<p>(a) Inadequate resources: The scarcity of financial resources, or the limited 
</p>
<p>ability to tap into other funding sources besides national budget allocations, is a primary 
</p>
<p>concern for local authorities with respect to the implementation of the right to adequate 
</p>
<p>housing. While the responsibility for housing has been put in the hands of local or other 
</p>
<p>subnational governments, resources to meet their housing rights obligations have not 
</p>
<p>similarly flowed. Moreover, funding from national governments for local programmes is 
</p>
<p>often not responsive to changing needs or crisis situations at the local level. Lack of

<p>resources can lead subnational governments to make decisions that negatively affect the 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to adequate housing. For example, at the municipal level it is not 
</p>
<p>uncommon for available land or property to be used as an asset for real estate development 
</p>
<p>rather than for the provision of adequate housing.  
</p>
<p>(b) Insufficient knowledge and capacity regarding the right to adequate housing 
</p>
<p>and related human rights: Local and other subnational government officials are often 
</p>
<p>unaware of their obligations under international human rights law with respect to adequate 
</p>
<p>housing and may at times lack any institutional or legislative framework of accountability 
</p>
<p>for their decision-making. They may also lack institutional or technical capacity to 
</p>
<p>administer programmes efficiently, to contend with corruption, to regulate land speculation, 
</p>
<p>to ensure sustainable practices or to maintain and repair infrastructure.  
</p>
<p>(c) Overlapping, unclear and conflicting web of responsibilities: In countries 
</p>
<p>with large and rapidly expanding urban and peri-urban populations, there is often a 
</p>
<p>complex web of overlapping and colliding responsibilities between different levels of 
</p>
<p>government and between local governments. It is very difficult to ensure accountability to 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations if there is a lack of clarity about which levels of government are 
</p>
<p>responsible for what. In many cases there is tension between the interests of national and 
</p>
<p>local and other subnational governments regarding priorities. Those in need of housing are 
</p>
<p>caught in the middle, with no level of government assuming responsibility. In some other 
</p>
<p>cases, lack of clarity or multiple layers create power vacuums and can become a fertile 
</p>
<p>ground for abuse of authority.  
</p>
<p>(d) Protectionism and discrimination:<b> </b>When communities define themselves 
</p>
<p>around a local identity, there can be a tendency to exclude perceived &#8220;outsiders&#8221;, such as 
</p>
<p>migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and ethnic, religious or other minorities. That often 
</p>
<p>leads to discriminatory barriers in accessing and maintaining adequate housing and related 
</p>
<p>programmes. Scapegoating, stigmatization and discrimination against homeless people can 
</p>
<p>also be more pronounced at the local level, where communities may define themselves as 
</p>
<p>homogeneous and coalesce to drive disadvantaged groups out of local communities.
22
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>22. Viewed through a human rights lens, from the perspective of those whose right to 
</p>
<p>housing is at stake, those common challenges facing local governments or housing 
</p>
<p>providers can be seen as barriers to the realization of rights. Those who are 
</p>
<p>disproportionately affected by the challenges identified tend to be the most marginalized 
</p>
<p>groups &#8211; those whose right to housing is most at risk. It is those groups who suffer most 
</p>
<p>when local governments lack capacity or resources, when there is an absence of local 
</p>
<p>human rights accountability, when local government becomes protectionist and 
</p>
<p>exclusionary, and it is those groups who often confront the most complex web of 
</p>
<p>governmental decision-making and authority, with the least information available to them.  
</p>
<p>23. The situation of residents of informal settlements in many cities around the world 
</p>
<p>illustrates how allocation of responsibilities among different levels of government plays out 
</p>
<p>in peoples&#8217; lives. For example, a recent study considers the situation of residents of the 
</p>
<p>Mukuru settlement in Nairobi. They live in windowless shacks on privately held land 
</p>
<p>without sewage or water infrastructure. They have been unable to determine title through 
</p>
<p>local governments and therefore lack security of tenure, rendering them ineligible to apply 
</p>
<p>for basic water, sewers or electricity. With the Kenyan Constitution now recognizing &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>right to accessible and adequate housing and to reasonable standards of sanitation&#8221;, the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 22 For more information, see the report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights 
</p>
<p>(A/66/265) and the report of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and 
</p>
<p>sanitation (A/HRC/21/42). </p>


<p>challenge for local residents is to claim their rights within a complex web of regulatory 
</p>
<p>schemes and decisions applied by an array of governmental actors.
23
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>24. Homeless people have faced similar struggles. An increasing number of cities, 
</p>
<p>particularly in affluent countries, have responded to homelessness by criminalizing such 
</p>
<p>acts as sitting, lying down, or sleeping in public, or by criminalizing those who help feed 
</p>
<p>homeless persons.
24
</p>
<p> Challenging that discrimination in the United States, for example, has 
</p>
<p>meant addressing an array of laws and policies at multiple levels of government ranging 
</p>
<p>from constitutional law and housing legislation to local bylaws and ordinances.
25
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>25. The absence of human rights obligations in the priorities promoted by donor and 
</p>
<p>international development agencies in the context of decentralization is also a challenge for 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the right to adequate housing. For instance, in Indonesia, the 
</p>
<p>International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Development Programme and other donor agencies,
26
</p>
<p> at the turn of the millennium, 
</p>
<p>actively promoted decentralization without sufficient attention to human rights.  
</p>
<p>26. As noted by the former Special Rapporteur on adequate housing in the report on her 
</p>
<p>mission to Indonesia (A/HRC/25/54/Add.1), as a result of decentralization, significant 
</p>
<p>powers have been partially devolved to the provinces, districts and municipalities. 
</p>
<p>However, the decentralization of planning and land administration did not appear supported 
</p>
<p>by institutional capacity, resources or organizational tools (paras. 10&#8211;11). During her 
</p>
<p>mission she identified many of the obstacles to the implementation of the right to adequate 
</p>
<p>housing associated with decentralization when it is not properly informed by human rights, 
</p>
<p>such as &#8220;the fragmentation of programmes between various agencies and the inefficiencies 
</p>
<p>of existing coordinating mechanisms&#8221; (para. 25) and the limited capacity of local 
</p>
<p>governments to provide alternative housing to people who had been evicted from their 
</p>
<p>homes (para. 51).  
</p>
<p><b> V. International accountability 
</b></p>
<p>27. The primary dialogue between international human rights mechanisms and 
</p>
<p>procedures is with the national Government. With some exceptions, noted below, that has 
</p>
<p>generally resulted in less attention paid to the critical responsibilities of local and 
</p>
<p>subnational governments in relation to housing. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, within 
</p>
<p>the existing framework of dialogue between States parties and treaty body monitoring 
</p>
<p>mechanism, there is room for considerably more engagement with the responsibilities of 
</p>
<p>subnational governments in relation to the right to adequate housing.

<p><b> A. Treaty body monitoring mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>28. In 2009 the Secretary-General encouraged States to provide information on 
</p>
<p>participation at &#8220;national, regional and local levels of governance and, where appropriate, at 
</p>
<p>federal and provincial levels&#8221;.27 Some treaty body reporting guidelines request States to 
</p>
<p>provide information on the role and activities of subnational, regional, provincial or 
</p>
<p>municipal assemblies or authorities in promoting and protecting human rights.
28
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>29. In that regard, States have developed internal procedures for engaging subnational 
</p>
<p>governments in periodic reporting on housing rights and related issues. In some cases, local 
</p>
<p>governments have made direct written submissions to treaty bodies.
29
</p>
<p> National human 
</p>
<p>rights institutions have also played an increasingly important role in periodic reviews, 
</p>
<p>acting as catalysts for improved engagement of subnational governments with review 
</p>
<p>processes. Where subnational representatives have participated directly in periodic reviews, 
</p>
<p>they have been welcomed. Overall, however, subnational governments may experience the 
</p>
<p>treaty review process only indirectly and remotely. While they may be asked by national 
</p>
<p>Governments to provide information for reports, they often receive little direct feedback on 
</p>
<p>positive measures they have adopted and may not hear about concerns and 
</p>
<p>recommendations relevant to their areas of responsibility once the review is completed. As 
</p>
<p>a participant in the expert consultation noted: &#8220;The more local the government, the further it 
</p>
<p>is from Geneva&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>30. Though the focus of concluding observations has remained predominantly on the 
</p>
<p>national level Government, treaty bodies have identified recurrent problems regarding the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the right to adequate housing at the subnational level. The Committee on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, for instance, has identified a number of concerns 
</p>
<p>with respect to local and other subnational governments, such as: discrimination against 
</p>
<p>migrants and minority groups;
 
failure or inability of municipal social housing providers to 
</p>
<p>provide sufficient housing to marginalized groups; municipal expropriation of land that 
</p>
<p>fails to comply with international legal norms on displacement and forced evictions; the 
</p>
<p>need for coordinated national funding to local governments for adequate housing; and the 
</p>
<p>need to include the right to adequate housing in subnational law and to make that right 
</p>
<p>legally enforceable at the subnational level.
30
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>31. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has recognized positive 
</p>
<p>measures taken to develop housing strategies at the local level that promote inclusion of 
</p>
<p>racial and ethnic minorities.
31 
</p>
<p>The Committee has also expressed concern that, despite 
</p>
<p>national level efforts to support subsidized housing at the local level, the autonomy of 
</p>
<p>municipalities has acted &#8220;as a major obstacle&#8221; to achieving non-discrimination in access to 
</p>
<p>social housing, raising concerns in a number of cases about discrimination against migrants, 
</p>
<p>racial minorities, persons of foreign origin and Roma.

</p>
<p> 27 Compilation of guidelines on the form and content of reports to be submitted by States parties to the 
</p>
<p>International Human Rights Treaties (HRI/GEN/2/Rev.6), para. 45 (b). 
</p>
<p> 28 See, for example, the guidelines on treaty-specific document to be submitted by States parties under 
</p>
<p>article 35, paragraph 1, of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD/C/2/3).

</p>
<p> 31 See CERD/C/USA/CO/6, para. 9. 
</p>

<p>32. Treaty bodies have also dealt with responsibilities of subnational governments in 
</p>
<p>complaints procedures. For example, in <i>Liliana Assenova Naidenova et al. v. Bulgaria 
</i></p>
<p>(CCPR/C/106/D/2073/2011), a Roma community challenged a forced eviction initiated by 
</p>
<p>the Sofia Metropolitan Municipality, Vuzrajdane subdistrict, acting independently of the 
</p>
<p>national Government. The community was unsuccessful in challenging the eviction 
</p>
<p>domestically, with the Sofia City Court determining that the eviction was lawful and the 
</p>
<p>Supreme Administrative Court upholding that decision. The Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>requested interim measures to stop the city from proceeding with the eviction and, after 
</p>
<p>considering the communication on the merits, found that the State party would violate the 
</p>
<p>petitioners&#8217; rights under article 17 of the Covenant if the eviction proceeded without the 
</p>
<p>provision of adequate alternative accommodation for the community. The national 
</p>
<p>Government used the Committee&#8217;s decision to exert pressure on the Municipality to refrain 
</p>
<p>from carrying out the eviction. Two years later, the permanent injunction remains in place 
</p>
<p>and the community is in discussion with the municipal authorities on alternative housing. 
</p>
<p>33. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has also dealt 
</p>
<p>with housing cases that engage subnational level governments. In <i>Kell v. Canada 
</i></p>
<p>(CEDAW/C/51/D/19/2008), an indigenous woman alleged that in the context of domestic 
</p>
<p>violence, she had been dispossessed of her housing as a result of decisions taken by the 
</p>
<p>local housing authorities. The Committee deemed the Northwest Territories Housing 
</p>
<p>Corporation and the local housing authority to be agents of the State party, referring to 
</p>
<p>them as such, and concluded that, as a result of the actions of the local housing authority, 
</p>
<p>the State party had violated articles 2, paragraphs (d) and (e), and article 16, paragraph 1 
</p>
<p>(h), read in conjunction with article 1 of the Convention, which protect against 
</p>
<p>discrimination by public authorities and the equal rights of spouses with respect to 
</p>
<p>property.
33 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Universal periodic review  
</b></p>
<p>34. The universal periodic review process has also engaged the responsibilities of 
</p>
<p>subnational governments, particularly municipalities, in the implementation of human 
</p>
<p>rights. Many States engage with subnational level governments in the development of their 
</p>
<p>State report for the review. A number of States&#8217; reports for the universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>include information on the role of subnational governments with respect to housing, and 
</p>
<p>some have acknowledged the challenges of multi-jurisdictional responsibilities in relation 
</p>
<p>to housing. The recommendations emanating from the universal periodic review process 
</p>
<p>rarely engage the human rights obligations of municipalities and local governments and 
</p>
<p>seldom engage local or other subnational governments on issues of housing.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>35. Special procedures regularly engage with subnational levels of government in the 
</p>
<p>context of mandated activities because they have a number of opportunities to do so. 
</p>
<p>During official country missions and working visits, for example, special rapporteurs 
</p>
<p>regularly meet with local and other subnational authorities to assess the implementation of 
</p>
<p>human rights. In the case of the mandate on adequate housing, official visits have 
</p>
<p>systematically included an exchange of views with city councils or other subnational 
</p>
<p>officials. At times, country missions have served as a bridge, with the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 33 See also CEDAW/C/32/D/2/2003 for a link between domestic violence and inadequate housing 
</p>
<p>alternatives.  </p>


<p>bringing various levels of government and various stakeholders together. 
</p>
<p>Recommendations made in mission reports have frequently been directed toward local and 
</p>
<p>other subnational level governments within their areas of responsibility. 
</p>
<p>36. The former Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, in her report 
</p>
<p>on the official visit to Mongolia (A/HRC/23/36/Add.2, para. 97 (aa)), recommended that 
</p>
<p>local authorities should be allocated adequate resources to enable them to provide basic 
</p>
<p>services to internal migrants from rural areas to informal settlements in cities. Similarly, the 
</p>
<p>former Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, in her 
</p>
<p>report on the official mission to Japan (A/HRC/18/33/Add.3, para. 69 (d)), recommended 
</p>
<p>the adoption of a comprehensive law on water and sanitation delineating the responsibilities 
</p>
<p>of the national and municipal levels, including provisions on quality standards, maximum 
</p>
<p>tariff limits and the establishment of regulatory and complaint mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>37. Thematic reports and communications &#8212; two other mandated activities of special 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs &#8212; also engage subnational governments with respect to their housing 
</p>
<p>responsibilities. By way of illustration, the former Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, 
</p>
<p>Raquel Rolnik, in her Guiding Principles on Security of Tenure for the Urban Poor, paid 
</p>
<p>considerable attention to the role of local governments in ensuring security of tenure. 
</p>
<p>Guiding principle No. 2, for example, suggests that States, including relevant authorities, 
</p>
<p>should allocate sufficient funds to ministries, municipalities and local governments for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of measures to improve security of tenure (A/HRC/25/54, para. 5). 
</p>
<p>38. The mandate on adequate housing regularly receives allegations that identify local, 
</p>
<p>municipal and other subnational authorities as pertinent to the claims made by individuals 
</p>
<p>and communities. Those submissions raise concerns of imminent threats, including alleged 
</p>
<p>forced evictions, forced displacement or development-basis eviction without application of 
</p>
<p>existing international standards; restrictions and other discriminatory practices on access to 
</p>
<p>housing by specific populations groups, including refugees, asylum seekers, undocumented 
</p>
<p>migrants, and ethnic, religious or other minorities; and changes in housing subsidies and 
</p>
<p>welfare programmes directly impacting on people living in poverty, the unemployed, 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities or women. Complaints also refer to the lack of affordable housing, 
</p>
<p>substandard housing, fuel poverty, and denial of or inadequate services, including water, 
</p>
<p>sanitation and electricity.34 
</p>
<p>39. In communications involving local authorities, however, official responses from 
</p>
<p>States rarely indicate whether the information was shared with relevant local or subnational 
</p>
<p>authorities, or describe the concrete steps and measures taken at those levels. For example, 
</p>
<p>in 2014 the Special Rapporteur issued a joint urgent appeal together with the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, and the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, to the Government of the United States. 
</p>
<p>The letter focused on the decision by the authorities in the city of Detroit to suspend water 
</p>
<p>services to thousands of households. In its response to the letter, the Government of the 
</p>
<p>United States did not indicate whether it had consulted with the Governor of Michigan or 
</p>
<p>the Mayor of Detroit regarding the allegations.

<p><b> VI. Accountability under domestic law  
</b></p>
<p>40. While enhanced international accountability of local and other subnational 
</p>
<p>governments is important, international mechanisms can only be supplementary to effective 
</p>
<p>domestic procedures and remedies.
36
</p>
<p> The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights has emphasized the importance of ensuring effective domestic remedies for 
</p>
<p>Covenant rights. It has recognized that, while the method by which rights are given effect in 
</p>
<p>national law is a matter for each State party to decide, &#8220;the means used should be 
</p>
<p>appropriate in the sense of producing results which are consistent with the full discharge of 
</p>
<p>its obligations by the State party&#8221;.37  
</p>
<p>41. Within the flexible framework established by the Committee, local and subnational 
</p>
<p>governments have been made accountable to the right to adequate housing under domestic 
</p>
<p>law in a variety of ways, ranging from constitutional rights through legislative and 
</p>
<p>administrative requirements to rights-based housing strategies.  
</p>
<p>42. Statutory and administrative remedies often engage important components of the 
</p>
<p>right to adequate housing and they are of particular importance at the local and subnational 
</p>
<p>levels &#8211; the levels at which housing programmes are administered and where rights holders 
</p>
<p>usually first seek effective resolutions. It is particularly important that administrative 
</p>
<p>remedies be timely and effective in relation to housing, since the most fundamental 
</p>
<p>interests are often at stake.  
</p>
<p>43. Many States now include recognition of the right to adequate housing in their 
</p>
<p>constitutions and virtually all constitutions include rights such as non-discrimination or the 
</p>
<p>right to life, which should provide protection of key components of the right to housing. 
</p>
<p>Whereas interaction between international human rights bodies and States has focused on 
</p>
<p>national rather than local level governments, the opposite has generally been the case in the 
</p>
<p>context of domestic courts. Various constitutional housing rights claims have focused on 
</p>
<p>the role of local or subnational governments. The effective application of constitutional 
</p>
<p>rights at the local and subnational levels is thus critical for enhanced accountability of 
</p>
<p>subnational governments to the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the growing number of cases being 
</p>
<p>brought to courts domestically which address alleged violations of housing rights by local 
</p>
<p>and subnational governments. Those cases have generated new understandings of the 
</p>
<p>critical role that courts and administrative bodies can play in adjudicating claims and 
</p>
<p>enforcing the obligations of local and subnational governments to realize the right to 
</p>
<p>adequate housing. Developments at the domestic level in the adjudication of housing rights 
</p>
<p>claims have informed emerging international human rights norms. In parallel, domestic 
</p>
<p>court cases have made explicit references to international standards, such as those related to 
</p>
<p>the scope and content of the right to adequate housing in general comment No. 4 (1991) on 
</p>
<p>the right to adequate housing and general comment No. 7 (1997) on the right to adequate 
</p>
<p>housing: Forced evictions of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>45. The jurisprudence of the South African Constitutional Court has been particularly 
</p>
<p>influential. The South African Constitution guarantees the right to access adequate housing 
</p>
<p>and obliges all levels of government to take reasonable legislative and other measures, 
</p>
<p>within available resources, to achieve the progressive realization of that right. The famous 
</p>
<p><i>Grootbroom</i> case on the right to adequate housing considered the obligations of Cape 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 36 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 9 (1998) on the domestic 
</p>
<p>application of the Covenant, para. 4. 
</p>

<p>Metropolitan government, a municipality that was facing the most severe 
</p>
<p>homelessness/informal settlement crisis in the country.
38
</p>
<p> The claimants were living in a 
</p>
<p>sports field under plastic sheets without services. They argued that the neglect of their 
</p>
<p>desperate circumstances by the municipality and other levels of government violated their 
</p>
<p>right to adequate housing.  
</p>
<p>46. Housing is an area of concurrent national and provincial competence in South 
</p>
<p>Africa, but the Constitution requires the national and provincial governments to assign 
</p>
<p>responsibilities to a municipality &#8220;if that matter would most effectively be administered 
</p>
<p>locally and the municipality has the capacity to administer it&#8221;.39 Within that context, the 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Court established that measures taken to realize the right to adequate housing 
</p>
<p>must be &#8220;reasonable&#8221; &#8212; that they must be comprehensive, coherent, flexible and effective; 
</p>
<p>have due regard for those in poverty and deprivation; utilize available resources; be free of 
</p>
<p>bureaucratic inefficiency or onerous regulations and ultimately be capable of realizing the 
</p>
<p>right to adequate housing. The Court also emphasized the fact that responsibilities must be 
</p>
<p>clearly allocated to the different spheres of government with appropriate financial and 
</p>
<p>human resources, and that local governments have an obligation to ensure that services are 
</p>
<p>provided in a sustainable manner.
40
</p>
<p> The Court held that the housing programme had failed 
</p>
<p>to adequately prioritize those in the greatest need.  
</p>
<p>47. That decision has had a significant impact in many municipalities, leading to so-
</p>
<p>called &#8220;Grootbroom allocations&#8221;. In subsequent cases in South Africa, the reasonableness 
</p>
<p>standard has been applied to require municipalities to provide adequate alternative 
</p>
<p>accommodation to anyone evicted from either public or private land;
41
</p>
<p> to ensure 
</p>
<p>meaningful engagement with affected communities on planning and housing issues;
42
</p>
<p> and 
</p>
<p>to ensure that rent increases imposed by private landlords are just and equitable.
43
</p>
<p> With 
</p>
<p>respect to available resources, the Court has recognized that local governments cannot 
</p>
<p>escape their obligations to progressively realize the right to adequate housing simply by 
</p>
<p>claiming dependence on funding from other levels of government, and that the division of 
</p>
<p>responsibilities between the different spheres should not be absolute or inflexible where 
</p>
<p>local government is best suited to &#8220;engage with and prospectively plan around the needs of 
</p>
<p>local communities&#8221;.44  
</p>
<p>48. Important jurisprudence on the right to adequate housing applied to subnational 
</p>
<p>levels of government has also emerged from Argentina. In the Matanza/Riachuelo basin 
</p>
<p>case, a suit was filed seeking compensation for damages, including violations of the right to 
</p>
<p>housing resulting from pollution of the basin.
45
</p>
<p> The Supreme Court of Argentina held that 
</p>
<p>the responsibility to ensure the prevention of future damage and to rectify existing 
</p>
<p>environmental damage resided with all three levels of government &#8212; the national 
</p>
<p>Government, the provincial government and the City of Buenos Aires. After several

<p>hearings with all parties involved, the ruling carefully designated responsibility and a time 
</p>
<p>frame for carrying out the necessary rehabilitation work. The Court established a system of 
</p>
<p>monitoring and created a working group including the National Ombudsman and civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations, remaining seized with the case until the desired outcomes were 
</p>
<p>guaranteed for the thousands of people directly affected. 
</p>
<p>49. The Constitutional Court of Colombia has also made important advances in that 
</p>
<p>area. In 2004, in a ground-breaking ruling on the economic, social and cultural rights of 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons, the court ruled that there was an &#8220;unconstitutional state of 
</p>
<p>affairs&#8221; as a result of the internal conflict.46 The Court also held the deteriorating housing 
</p>
<p>conditions of internally displaced persons to be prima facie contrary to the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>The national Government was ordered to implement a number of measures, including a 
</p>
<p>housing plan that ensured local institutions provided equal benefits for displaced persons.
47
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In a follow-up ruling in 2006, the Court ordered relevant municipalities to organize a 
</p>
<p>working group to review the housing policies in each jurisdiction, and to develop plans and 
</p>
<p>programmes with direct participation of displaced persons, and with representatives of the 
</p>
<p>National Human Rights Institution. The Court remained seized of the case, receiving 
</p>
<p>trimestral reports from the different levels of government.
48
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>50. In Cairo, the courts have recently enforced the right to adequate housing so as to 
</p>
<p>limit the power of the City Governor to seize land for &#8220;public benefit&#8221;.49 A coalition of civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations had some success in relying on the right to housing in article 67 of the 
</p>
<p>2012 Egyptian Constitution in both political action and litigation. In a recent case, the 
</p>
<p>organizations challenged a decree issued by the Governor of Cairo announcing a seizure of 
</p>
<p>land for development, and succeeded in securing a court order repealing the order of 
</p>
<p>evacuation.
50
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>51. In India, the right to adequate housing is not included as a fundamental right in the 
</p>
<p>Constitution, but courts have now recognized the right to housing as enforceable under the 
</p>
<p>right to life. In a 2010 case,
51
</p>
<p> initiated after the petitioners had been displaced from their 
</p>
<p>land and their houses demolished, the High Court of Delhi ordered that the Government of 
</p>
<p>Delhi relocate them to a suitable place and provide alternative land with ownership rights.
52
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>52. In the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, there are no 
</p>
<p>constitutional protections through which the right to housing can be claimed. However, 
</p>
<p>statutory provisions requiring local authorities to provide housing for those who are 
</p>
<p>homeless are enforceable in courts. In addition, the European Convention for the Protection 
</p>
<p>of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is enforceable by domestic courts in the 
</p>
<p>United Kingdom. In <i>R. v. Enfield London Borough Council, ex parte Bernard</i>, for example, 
</p>
<p>when a woman with a disability was not provided with the accessible housing to which she

<p>was entitled under the Housing Act, she challenged the local authority&#8217;s actions as a 
</p>
<p>violation of her right to the protection of home and family life under article 8 of the 
</p>
<p>European Convention.
53
</p>
<p> The court held that accessible accommodation was important 
</p>
<p>because it would facilitate family life and would secure her &#8220;physical and psychological 
</p>
<p>integrity&#8221;. The court ruled that &#8220;it would have restored her dignity as a human being&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>53. Despite those significant advances in a number of jurisdictions, domestic courts in 
</p>
<p>other cases have failed to apply constitutional provisions and other domestic law to 
</p>
<p>subnational governments in a manner that is consistent with international human rights 
</p>
<p>norms. Moreover, local and other subnational governments have not consistently 
</p>
<p>implemented remedies where courts have ordered compliance with the right to adequate 
</p>
<p>housing. 
</p>
<p>54. In some States, constitutional guarantees of the right to adequate housing have 
</p>
<p>provided little protection against forced evictions carried out by local governments. For 
</p>
<p>instance, the Special Rapporteur has drawn the attention of the Government of Sri Lanka to 
</p>
<p>the fact that the city of Colombo Urban Regeneration Project reportedly authorized the 
</p>
<p>removal of thousands of shanty dwellers. Residents were not provided with adequate 
</p>
<p>information regarding their relocation and resettlement sites or adequate and timely 
</p>
<p>compensation for loss of land, housing structures, assets or small businesses. Reportedly, 
</p>
<p>affected residents who have sought remedies through the courts, based on the constitutional 
</p>
<p>right to adequate housing, have not had consistent success. Where the courts have ordered 
</p>
<p>remedies, they have not always been implemented.
54
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>55. In the Philippines, courts have not always interpreted the constitutional right to 
</p>
<p>adequate housing consistently with international human rights norms. For example, courts 
</p>
<p>ruled in one case that there was no constitutional obligation to provide resettlement 
</p>
<p>opportunities for displaced communities.
55
</p>
<p> In another case, the court found that anyone 
</p>
<p>designated a &#8220;professional squatter&#8221; may be deprived of any due process rights with respect 
</p>
<p>to evictions.
56
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that victims of violations of rights to adequate 
</p>
<p>housing by local and other subnational governments are often denied access to justice or 
</p>
<p>effective remedies, even where constitutional provisions exist.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> VII. Emerging initiatives for human rights accountability of 
subnational level governments in relation to housing 
</b></p>
<p>57. Just as the implementation of housing rights is increasingly in the hands of local 
</p>
<p>government, it is at the local level that new approaches and initiatives for government 
</p>
<p>accountability to the right to adequate housing are emerging. Local governments are

<p>organizing themselves independently of national Governments and working with civil 
</p>
<p>society and other actors to articulate models of direct human rights accountability.
57
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>58. There are significant advantages to subnational governments developing such 
</p>
<p>independent approaches. They are best placed to respond to the distinctive challenges of 
</p>
<p>implementing the right to housing at the local level and to enable residents&#8217; empowerment 
</p>
<p>and participation in local government. That offers an important foundation for community- 
</p>
<p>based, human rights approaches to local governance and programme administration. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Cities and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>59. Over the last 15 years, the &#8220;human rights city&#8221; has emerged as an important 
</p>
<p>initiative involving mayors, city officials, civic and human rights non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations and experts and community-based organizations in cities across the world.
58
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The Gwangju Declaration on Human Rights City, adopted in 2011, defined a human rights 
</p>
<p>city as &#8220;both a local community and a socio-political process in a local context where 
</p>
<p>human rights play a key role as fundamental values and guiding principles&#8221;.59 Accordingly, 
</p>
<p>local government, parliament, civil society, private sector organizations and other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders work together to improve the quality of life for all inhabitants in a spirit of 
</p>
<p>partnership based on human rights standards and norms. The Declaration emphasizes that a 
</p>
<p>legal basis &#8212; city ordinances and legal instruments such as human rights charters and legal 
</p>
<p>organizations &#8212; should be established. Human rights cities also acknowledge that 
</p>
<p>implementation is more important than policymaking and that effective accountability 
</p>
<p>mechanisms need to be developed to make city government accountable to its 
</p>
<p>commitments.  
</p>
<p>60. Seoul, in the Republic of Korea, has named itself a human rights city, having 
</p>
<p>adopted an ordinance in 2012 to protect and promote human rights for its citizens. The 
</p>
<p>ordinance establishes a Human Rights Division within the city government, human rights 
</p>
<p>policies, a Committee on Human Rights and a Human Rights Ombudsperson to ensure 
</p>
<p>access to remedies for rights violations. The Ombudsman has become a model for other 
</p>
<p>local governments in the country. With respect to housing, Seoul has adopted measures and 
</p>
<p>guidelines, particularly on forced evictions, to protect its residents. The guidelines are based 
</p>
<p>on general comment No. 7 on forced evictions of the Committee on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights, and prohibit evictions in winter or at night and require civil servants to be 
</p>
<p>present to monitor any human rights violations when executing an eviction and to provide 
</p>
<p>adequate remedies to those who are evicted, among others.  
</p>
<p>61. In keeping with human rights city initiatives, a number of cities and some provinces 
</p>
<p>and states have incorporated the right to adequate housing specifically into local 
</p>
<p>governance. Those developments should be seen as positive evidence of a &#8220;from local to 
</p>
<p>global&#8221; approach to human rights implementation.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 57 See, for example, the progress report of the Advisory Committee on the role of local government in 
</p>
<p>the promotion and protection of human rights, including human rights mainstreaming in local 
</p>
<p>administration and public services (A/HRC/27/59), paras. 38&#8211;51 and 56&#8211;59. 
</p>
<p> 58 There are a number of human rights city charters: the European Charter for the Safeguarding of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights in the City (2000), which has been signed by more than 350 European towns and 
</p>
<p>cities, the Montreal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities (2006), the Mexico City Charter for the 
</p>
<p>Right to the City (2010), the Gwangju Human Rights Charter (2012), the Vienna Charter (2012) and 
</p>
<p>the Global Charter-Agenda of Human Rights in the City (2011).

<p>62. In November 2012, the Province of Buenos Aires adopted a law on fair access to 
</p>
<p>habitat (Ley de acceso justo al habitat) which guarantees the right to housing and to a 
</p>
<p>dignified and sustainable habitat, along the lines of the provincial and national constitutions 
</p>
<p>and several international human rights treaties. The law establishes a link between the 
</p>
<p>public policy on housing and the way in which different public and private stakeholders are 
</p>
<p>involved, including real estate companies. It requires steps to be taken to address the lack of 
</p>
<p>adequate housing for people living in poverty or with special needs, and creates 
</p>
<p>mechanisms to regulate speculation around land prices. It articulates both the right to 
</p>
<p>adequate housing and the &#8220;right to the city&#8221; as core principles alongside the social function 
</p>
<p>of land and property, democratic decision-making in the city and the importance of 
</p>
<p>equitable distribution of benefits and costs of city growth, including in relation to 
</p>
<p>infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>63. Madison County in Wisconsin, United States of America, adopted a city resolution 
</p>
<p>in 2011 recognizing housing as a human right. The resolution requires Madison to promote 
</p>
<p>fair housing and refers to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and to the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, to which the United States is 
</p>
<p>party. The city is therefore required to eliminate policies with a racially discriminatory 
</p>
<p>impact. The resolution calls for an assessment of affordable and accessible housing needs 
</p>
<p>and an adequately funded, responsive housing strategy. Those types of initiatives are 
</p>
<p>particularly important in a country that has not ratified the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and raise the possibility of subnational governments 
</p>
<p>affirming direct accountability to international human rights norms even where the State 
</p>
<p>has not ratified them.  
</p>
<p>64. Human rights city initiatives are complementary to, but distinguishable from, the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;right to the city&#8221; as laid down in the 2005 World Charter on the Right to the City. Rather 
</p>
<p>than being based on existing international human rights law, that movement was born of the 
</p>
<p>idea that the freedom to make and remake our cities and ourselves is one of the most 
</p>
<p>precious yet most neglected of our human rights. The Right to the City project is therefore 
</p>
<p>more extensive than human rights city initiatives and includes values such as the social 
</p>
<p>production of housing/habitat and the rights to &#8220;sustainable and equitable urban 
</p>
<p>development&#8221;, the right to transport and public mobility, and the right to the environment. 
</p>
<p>At the same time, the World Charter on the Right to the City includes an explicit provision 
</p>
<p>on the right to adequate housing which is generally in keeping with the right as articulated 
</p>
<p>in international human rights law.
60
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>65. Brazil was a pioneer in establishing a City Statute, Law 10.257 of 10 July 2001, 
</p>
<p>creating the basis to tackle urban inequalities, and introducing the concept of the social 
</p>
<p>function of the city and property. According to the Statute, the municipalities have broad 
</p>
<p>capacities to set the basis for an urban order that addresses social exclusion and spatial 
</p>
<p>segregation, focusing on housing but also on a wider range of social and environmental 
</p>
<p>issues faced by cities. While its implementation has not always appeared to live up to the 
</p>
<p>expectations originally created, the Statute has shown the importance of shifting the 
</p>
<p>paradigm around urban reform towards a people-centred perspective, with local 
</p>
<p>governments having a central role, and combining social mobilization, legal reform and 
</p>
<p>institutional change.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><b> B. Access to justice at the local and subnational levels 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Advisory Committee to the Human Rights Council has suggested that the 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights requires independent mechanisms as a vital means of 
</p>
<p>safeguarding human rights and making the protective role of local authorities more 
</p>
<p>visible.
61
</p>
<p> Examples of such local mechanisms include local or national ombuds offices; city 
</p>
<p>level human rights commissions, such as in Bosnia and Herzegovina; national and 
</p>
<p>state/provincial level human rights commissions with jurisdiction over subnational level 
</p>
<p>governments; and elected people&#8217;s councils at the municipal level to address human rights 
</p>
<p>complaints.
62
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>67. The establishment of local human rights mechanisms provides a vehicle through 
</p>
<p>which the right to adequate housing might be protected. For example, in Portugal, the 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman has received an increasing number of housing related complaints and has 
</p>
<p>directly encouraged a municipality to refrain from undertaking evictions and demolitions 
</p>
<p>and to monitor the situation.
63
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>68. Other emerging mechanisms, such as performance contracts which stipulate 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic indicators and targets that municipal officials must meet,
64
</p>
<p> can similarly be 
</p>
<p>used as an accountability mechanism at the local level for the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>69. In the context of housing, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</p>
<p>has established that national level housing strategies based on human rights are a critical 
</p>
<p>component of ensuring the enjoyment of the right to adequate housing. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur notes that subnational and local strategies based on human rights with 
</p>
<p>measureable goals, timelines and complaints procedures, properly coordinated with national 
</p>
<p>strategies, are equally critical to the realization of the right to adequate housing.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Effective implementation of the right to adequate housing cannot be achieved 
</b></p>
<p><b>without the proactive involvement of local and subnational governments. Just as there 
</b></p>
<p><b>are key responsibilities assigned or delegated to local and subnational governments 
</b></p>
<p><b>within their domestic spheres of competence, there are also obligations to which they 
</b></p>
<p><b>are bound in international human rights law as related to the right to adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>housing.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Although the drive for decentralization can resonate with many core values 
</b></p>
<p><b>linked to the right to adequate housing, including local empowerment, meaningful 
</b></p>
<p><b>engagement, and enhanced accountability and transparency, decentralization is not 
</b></p>
<p><b>always favourable to the implementation of the right to adequate housing. Proximity 
</b></p>
<p><b>to stakeholders is only a positive feature if local and other subnational levels of 
</b></p>
<p><b>government have the necessary resources and the administrative capacity to perform

<p> 61 See the progress report of the Advisory Committee on the role of local government in the promotion 
</p>
<p>and protection of human rights, including human rights mainstreaming in local administration and 
</p>
<p>public services (A/HRC/27/59), para. 48. 
</p>

<p><b>local elites do not undermine democratic accountability; and if corruption is 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressed. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>A human rights approach to local governance and subsidiarity does not require 
</b></p>
<p><b>that all authority rest with local governments. Rather, it requires a recognition that 
</b></p>
<p><b>local governments are at a critical point of intersection between rights holders and 
</b></p>
<p><b>complex systems of multi-level governance. That makes them central actors in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>realization of the right to adequate housing within diverse domestic systems. Local 
</b></p>
<p><b>governments are in a position to bring forward the experiences of marginalized 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups and others whose rights have not been ensured and to find solutions. They 
</b></p>
<p><b>serve as the main contact point with community-based initiatives for housing 
</b></p>
<p><b>production and upgrades, linking them with broader regional, national or 
</b></p>
<p><b>international financing, development and human rights initiatives. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The responsibilities of different levels of government are not self-standing. 
</b></p>
<p><b>They rarely fall into watertight categories and usually involve collaboration among 
</b></p>
<p><b>different levels of government, in addition to other public or private actors. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Responsibilities are governed by agreements or joint initiatives among different levels 
</b></p>
<p><b>of governments as well as by relationships with community-based organizations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>civil society. Where national or regional governments provide funding for housing and 
</b></p>
<p><b>related programmes, the realization of the right to adequate housing does not rely 
</b></p>
<p><b>solely on one or the other level of government, but on their relationship.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Innovative initiatives offer new opportunities to connect international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights norms with local housing struggles and vice versa, and are resulting in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>development of new and constructive relationships between local levels of 
</b></p>
<p><b>governments, community groups and rights holders.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>It remains imperative to promote and continue to develop international norms 
</b></p>
<p><b>that are appropriate to subnational levels of government. The reasonableness 
</b></p>
<p><b>standard and the innovative approaches to structural remedies that have emerged 
</b></p>
<p><b>from domestic courts offer other jurisdictions a useful framework for engaging the 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations of local and other subnational governments to progressively realize the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to adequate housing without discrimination.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>In line with the above-mentioned conclusions, the Special Rapporteur wishes to 
</b></p>
<p><b>offer the following recommendations:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) States should encourage local and subnational level governments to 
</b></p>
<p><b>actively participate in all relevant international human rights mechanisms, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>treaty body review and complaint procedures, the universal periodic review and 
</b></p>
<p><b>special procedures. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) When addressing issues related to the right to adequate housing, 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights mechanisms should give further attention to how different 
</b></p>
<p><b>levels of government are bound by international human rights law and reference 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerns and recommendations accordingly. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Recommendations emanating from international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms should be communicated to local and subnational governments with 
</b></p>
<p><b>requests for responses and follow-up action and disseminated to local communities in 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessible form.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The responsibilities of all levels of governments should be clearly 
</b></p>
<p><b>delineated and jointly coordinated with ongoing independent review and oversight in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to ensure that jurisdictional overlap does not deny those in need access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary services or housing. Assistance should be provided to those in need in order 
</b></p>
<p><b>to ensure coordinated government responses.  </b></p>


<p><b>(e) Any processes of decentralization in relation to housing should be guided 
</b></p>
<p><b>and informed by human rights, in particular the right to adequate housing. Transfers 
</b></p>
<p><b>of responsibility for housing or other programmes from one level of government to 
</b></p>
<p><b>another should be accompanied by a clarification of concomitant human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations including requirements of monitoring and accountability.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) International financial institutions and United Nations agencies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>entities should ensure that the right to adequate housing is incorporated into 
</b></p>
<p><b>decentralization processes and housing related initiatives and activities. UN-Habitat 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other relevant international agencies should emphasize the right to adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>housing in their promotion of the roles of local and other subnational governments, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in ongoing endeavours related to the post-2015 development agenda and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>upcoming discussions on Habitat III.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) States must ensure that local and subnational governments have 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate financial and other resources for the discharge of their responsibilities, with 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity to respond to changing housing needs at the local level, particularly of 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized and disadvantaged groups. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) States should ensure that the right to adequate housing and related 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights are protected in law and applicable to the local and subnational governments. 
</b></p>
<p><b>States should guarantee access to justice and effective remedies for violations of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to adequate housing at the local as well as the national level.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) States should provide training for all local and subnational authorities 
</b></p>
<p><b>about their obligations to ensure the right to adequate housing, non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>and related human rights in all decisions, policies, plans and programmes. Judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>review of administrative decisions and policies should require consistency with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to adequate housing and other human rights.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) States should be encouraged to establish local and subnational human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights institutions to complement national human rights institutions. Human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions should ensure effective monitoring and protection of the right to adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>housing and access to effective remedies in case of violations at the local and 
</b></p>
<p><b>subnational levels. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Local and other subnational levels of government should apply and 
</b></p>
<p><b>articulate the principle of subsidiarity in an inclusive manner, consistent with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to adequate housing and non-discrimination, so as to be fully responsive to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights of marginalized and disadvantaged groups in local communities and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>advocate for their interests nationally and internationally. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Local and other subnational levels of government should endeavour to 
</b></p>
<p><b>learn about and participate in international human rights mechanisms and to engage 
</b></p>
<p><b>with community-based organizations, local civil society and human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>for that purpose. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) Cities and municipalities should consider the adoption of charters with 
</b></p>
<p><b>explicit guarantees of the right to adequate housing in order to clarify, reinforce or 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen existing domestic and international human rights obligations. Municipal 
</b></p>
<p><b>charters of rights may incorporate communication and monitoring mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>through which local challenges can be identified and addressed within a human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) Civil society and community-based organizations should develop local 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiatives to monitor the implementation of the right to adequate housing and develop 
</b></p>
<p><b>locally-based human rights standards which are complementary to and compatible 
</b></p>
<p><b>with international standards. </b></p>


<p><b>(o) Local housing and human rights groups could endeavour to develop 
</b></p>
<p><b>innovative approaches to bringing international human rights norms to the local level, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including through local hearings or panels. They should engage with the special 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures to raise issues and concerns in relation to the right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p><b>and non-discrimination in the subnational and local contexts, including via 
</b></p>
<p><b>communications and country missions.
