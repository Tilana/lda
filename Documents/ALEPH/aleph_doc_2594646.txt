Updated Presentation to Stock Holders and Note Holder August 15, 2016
This presentation includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. These statements include
estimates of future natural gas and oil reserves, expected natural gas and oil production and future expenses, assumptions regarding future natural
gas and oil prices, budgeted capital expenditures and other anticipated cash outflows, as well as statements concerning anticipated cash flow and
liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
expected results are described under Risk Factors in our 2015 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our
production forecasts are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of
future drilling activity. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements herein include
the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for oil and gas, operating risks, liquidity risks, including risks relating to our bank credit facility,
our outstanding notes and any restructuring thereof, our ability to continue as a going concern and any potential bankruptcy proceeding, political
and regulatory developments and legislation, and other risk factors and known trends and uncertainties as described in the Registration Statement
on Form S-4 filed with the SEC and in our Annual Report on Form 10- K for fiscal year 2015 filed with the SEC. Should one or more of these risks or
uncertainties occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in
the forward- looking statements. 2
Situation Overview ? Comstock has assembled a high quality portfolio of oil and gas assets in the Haynesville and Eagle Ford ? Comstock’s
enhanced completion design has transformed the Haynesville shale into one of North America’s highest return natural gas basins ? Comstock’s
acreage position provides a strong foundation with over 700 operated locations, underpinning the Company’s future growth ? The Company has
released its last operated rig, to preserve liquidity after ~18 months of depressed gas prices ? Without additional drilling, production is expected to
decline by ~30% in 2017 ? Comstock anticipates the decline in production will yield insufficient 2017 cash flow to meet fixed debt service costs
despite recent improvement in gas prices ? Alternatives to provide liquidity are likely to reduce collateral value to stakeholders ? The exchange offer
will allow the Company to restart a two-rig program which will grow production ~35% in 2017 ? Structure protects stakeholder’s interests / claims ?
Additional wells will increase cash flow, enhance the value of the asset base and help rebuild the balance sheet 3 ? Repositions Comstock to retain
key talent and maximize value
Repositioning Comstock Towards Growth ? The exchange offer will allow Comstock to redirect cash flow from interest expense to capital
expenditures ? Deploy two rigs in 2017 and drill a total of 24 wells ? Fueling growth in production and EBITDAX ? Comstock could save up to $109
million in cash interest in 2017 Status Quo (No Drillin Two Rig Developmen Expected Production (MMcfe/ Expected Production (MMcfe/ 8.6 169 6.8
