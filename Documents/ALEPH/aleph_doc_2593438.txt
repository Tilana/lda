PACIFIC DRILLING S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
Note 1 — Nature of Business
Pacific Drilling S.A. and its subsidiaries (“Pacific Drilling,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is an international offshore
drilling contractor committed to being the preferred provider of offshore drilling services to the oil and natural gas industry
through the use of high-specification floating rigs. Our primary business is to contract our high-specification rigs to drill
wells for our clients.
Note 2 — Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation — Our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for
interim financial information and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Pursuant to
such rules and regulations, these financial statements do not include all disclosures required by GAAP for complete
financial statements. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the
opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the
presented interim periods. Such adjustments are considered to be of a normal recurring nature unless otherwise
identified. Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any future period. The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements and notes of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Reverse Stock Split — On May 24, 2016, shareholders at our Extraordinary General Meeting approved a 1-for-10 reverse
stock split of our common shares (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split became effective and our common
shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis as of the commencement of trading on May 25, 2016. On the effective date
of the Reverse Stock Split, our shareholders received one new common share for every 10 common shares they owned.
No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split; instead holders of fractional shares were
paid out in cash for any fractional interests, which was not material in the aggregate. All share and per share information
in the accompanying financial statements has been restated retroactively to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.
Principles of Consolidation — Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Pacific Drilling S.A. and consolidated subsidiaries that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest and entities
that meet the criteria for variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary for accounting
purposes. We eliminate all intercompany transactions and balances in consolidation.
We are party to a Nigerian joint venture, Pacific International Drilling West Africa Limited (“PIDWAL”), with Derotech
Offshore Services Limited (“Derotech”), a privately-held Nigerian registered limited liability company. Derotech owns
51% of PIDWAL and PIDWAL has a 50% ownership interest in two of our rig holding subsidiaries, Pacific Bora Ltd. and
Pacific Scirocco Ltd. PIDWAL’s interest in the rig holding subsidiaries is held through a holding company of PIDWAL,
Pacific Drillship Nigeria Limited (“PDNL”). Derotech will not accrue the economic benefits of its interest in PIDWAL
unless and until it satisfies certain outstanding obligations to us and a certain pledge is cancelled by us. Likewise,
PIDWAL will not accrue the economic benefits of its interest in PDNL unless and until it satisfies certain outstanding
obligations to us and a certain pledge is cancelled by us. PIDWAL and PDNL are variable interest entities for which we
are the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we consolidate all interests of PIDWAL and PDNL and no portion of their
operating results is allocated to the noncontrolling interest.
In addition to the joint venture agreement, we are a party to marketing and logistic services agreements with Derotech
and an affiliated company of Derotech. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we incurred fees of $2.4
million and $5.3 million, respectively, under such agreements. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, we
incurred fees of $3.7 million and $6.9 million, respectively, under such agreements.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
Debt Issuance Costs — On April 7, 2015, Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt
Issuance Costs, which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance
sheet as a
8
Table of Contents
PACIFIC DRILLING S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) - Continued
direct deduction from the debt liability rather than as an asset. We adopted the standard effective January 1, 2016 on a
retrospective basis, which resulted in the netting of our deferred financing costs against long-term debt balances on our
consolidated balance sheets for the periods presented (see Note 4). Deferred financing costs related to our revolving
credit facility were reclassified to prepaid expenses and other current assets, and other assets. The adoption had no
impact on our operating results or cash flows for the current and prior periods.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Revenue Recognition — On May 28, 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which
requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods
or services to customers. This standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP when it
becomes effective. The standard will be effective for annual periods and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2017. We plan to adopt the new standard on January 1, 2018. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or
cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method, and we are currently evaluating the
effect the standard may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Deferred Taxes — On November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,
which requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as
noncurrent on the balance sheet. The new guidance, however, does not change the existing requirement that only
permits offsetting within a tax jurisdiction. The standard will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, and may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. We plan to adopt the standard prospectively
effective January 1, 2017, and expect that it will result in the reclassification of our deferred tax balances from current to
long-term on our consolidated balance sheets. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our current deferred tax
assets and current deferred tax liabilities were $2.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively.
Leases — On February 25, 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which requires the balance sheet recognition of
lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for virtually all of their leases. Lessees and lessors will be required to
recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.
The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply.
These practical expedients relate to the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the effective
date, initial direct costs for leases that commenced before the effective date, and the ability to use hindsight in evaluating
lessee options to extend or terminate a lease or to purchase the underlying asset. The standard will be effective for our
annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2019, although early adoption is permitted. We have not yet determined
our implementation method upon adoption, and we are currently evaluating the effect the standard may have on our
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Share-based Payments — On March 30, 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting, which requires recognition of the income tax effects of equity awards in the income statement when
the awards vest or are settled. The standard also allows employers to withhold shares upon settlement of an award for an
amount up to the employees’ maximum individual tax rate in the relevant jurisdiction without resulting in liability
classification of the award. The standard permits entities to make an accounting policy election for the impact of
forfeitures on the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards. The standard will be effective for our annual
and interim periods beginning January 1, 2017, although early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of
the standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments — On June 16, 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial
Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), which introduces a new model for recognizing credit losses on financial
instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses. The new model will apply to: (1) loans, accounts
receivable, trade receivables, and other financial assets measured at amortized cost, (2) loan commitments and certain
other off-balance sheet credit exposures, (3) debt securities and other financial assets measured at fair value through
other comprehensive income, and (4) beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. This update is effective for our
annual and interim periods beginning after January 1, 2020. We are currently evaluating the effect the standard may have
on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

2017 Senior Secured Notes
In November 2012, Pacific Drilling V Limited (“PDV”), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the
Company, as guarantor, completed a private placement of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.25% senior
secured notes due 2017 (the “2017 Senior Secured Notes”). The 2017 Senior Secured Notes bear interest at 7.25% per
annum, payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1, and mature on December 1, 2017.
The 2017 Senior Secured Notes are secured by a first-priority security interest (subject to certain exceptions) in the
Pacific Khamsin, and substantially all of the other assets of PDV, including an assignment of earnings and insurance
proceeds related to the Pacific Khamsin.
As of June 30, 2016, we have repurchased $23.7 million of our 2017 Senior Secured Notes for a purchase price of $9.1
million plus accrued interest. We recorded the resulting gain, net of the corresponding unamortized deferred financing
costs and debt discount, of $14.2 million as a gain on debt extinguishment in our statements of operations.
Senior Secured Credit Facility Agreement
In February 2013, Pacific Sharav S.à r.l. and Pacific Drilling VII Limited (collectively, the “SSCF Borrowers”) and the
Company, as guarantor, entered into a senior secured credit facility agreement, as amended and restated (the “SSCF”),
to finance the construction, operation and other costs associated with the Pacific Sharav and the Pacific Meltem (the
“SSCF Vessels”). The SSCF is primarily secured on a first priority basis by liens on the SSCF Vessels, and by an
assignment of earnings and insurance proceeds relating thereto.

In 2015, we completed the final drawdown under this facility, resulting in a cumulative total drawdown of $985.0 million.
We do not have any undrawn capacity on this facility as of June 30, 2016.
Following the final drawdown, the SSCF consisted of two principal tranches: (i) a Commercial Tranche of $492.5 million
provided by a syndicate of commercial banks and (ii) a Garanti - Instituttet for Eksportkreditt (“GIEK”) Tranche of $492.5
million guaranteed by GIEK, comprised of two sub-tranches: (x) an Eksportkreditt Norge AS (“EKN”) sub-tranche of
$246.3 million and (y) a bank sub-tranche of $246.3 million.
Borrowings under (A) the Commercial Tranche bear interest at London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin of
3.75%, (B) the EKN sub-tranche bear interest, at our option, at (i) LIBOR plus a margin of 1.5% (which margin may be
reset on May 31, 2019) or (ii) at a Commercial Interest Reference Rate of 2.37%, and (C) the bank sub-tranche bear
interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.5%. Borrowings under both sub-tranches are also subject to a guarantee fee of
2% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly. The SSCF requires semiannual amortization payments of $39.9 million. We
have entered into interest rate swaps to hedge against fluctuations in LIBOR (see Note 7).
The Commercial Tranche matures on May 31, 2019. Loans made with respect to the Pacific Sharav under the GIEK
Tranche mature on May 12, 2026. Loans made with respect to the Pacific Meltem under the GIEK Tranche mature on
November 24, 2026. The GIEK Tranche contains a put option exercisable if the Commercial Tranche is not refinanced or
renewed on or before February 28, 2019. If the GIEK Tranche put option is exercised, each SSCF Borrower must prepay,
in full, the portion of all outstanding loans that relate to the GIEK Tranche, on or before May 31, 2019, without any
premium, penalty or fees of any kind.
2020 Senior Secured Notes
On June 3, 2013, we completed a $750.0 million private placement of 5.375% senior secured notes due 2020 (the “2020
Senior Secured Notes”). The 2020 Senior Secured Notes bear interest at 5.375% per annum, payable semiannually on
June 1 and December 1, and mature on June 1, 2020.
The 2020 Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that own the Pacific Bora, the Pacific Mistral,
the Pacific Scirocco and the Pacific Santa Ana (the “Shared Collateral Vessels”), each of our subsidiaries that own or
previously owned equity or similar interests in a Shared Collateral Vessel-owning subsidiary, and certain other of our
subsidiaries that are parties to charters in respect of the Shared Collateral Vessels, and will be guaranteed by certain
other future subsidiaries. The indenture for the 2020 Senior Secured Notes allows for the issuance of up to $100.0 million
of additional notes provided no default is continuing and we are otherwise in compliance with all applicable covenants.
The 2020 Senior Secured Notes are secured, on an equal and ratable, first priority basis, with the obligations under the
Senior Secured Term Loan B (as defined below), the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and certain future
obligations (together with the 2020 Senior Secured Notes, the “Pari Passu Obligations”), subject to payment priorities in
favor of lenders under the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to the terms of an intercreditor agreement (the
“Intercreditor Agreement”), by liens on the Shared Collateral Vessels, a pledge of the equity of the entities that own the
Shared Collateral Vessels, assignments of earnings and insurance proceeds with respect to the Shared Collateral
Vessels, and certain other assets of the subsidiary guarantors (collectively, the “Shared Collateral”).
2018 Senior Secured Institutional Term Loan – Term Loan B
On June 3, 2013, we entered into a $750.0 million senior secured institutional term loan maturing 2018 (the “Senior
Secured Term Loan B”). The Senior Secured Term Loan B bears interest, at our election, at either (1) LIBOR, which will
not be less than a floor of 1% plus a margin of 3.5% per annum, or (2) a rate of interest per annum equal to (i) the prime
rate for such day, (ii) the sum of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (iii) 1% per annum above the one-month LIBOR,
whichever is the highest rate in each case plus a margin of 2.5% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly. The Senior
Secured Term Loan B requires quarterly amortization payments of $1.9 million and matures on June 3, 2018. We have
entered into interest rate swaps to hedge against fluctuations in LIBOR (see Note 7).
The Senior Secured Term Loan B has an accordion feature that would permit additional loans to be extended so long as
our total outstanding obligations in connection with the Senior Secured Term Loan B and the 2020 Senior Secured
Notes do not exceed $1.7 billion.

PACIFIC DRILLING S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) - Continued
The Senior Secured Term Loan B is secured by the Shared Collateral and subject to the terms and provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement.
2013 Revolving Credit Facility
On June 3, 2013, we entered into a $500.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing 2018 (as amended,
the “2013 Revolving Credit Facility”). The 2013 Revolving Credit Facility is secured by the Shared Collateral and subject
to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.
Borrowings under the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either (1) LIBOR plus a margin
ranging from 3.25% to 3.75% based on our leverage ratio, or (2) a rate of interest per annum equal to (i) the prime rate for
such day, (ii) the sum of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (iii) 1% per annum above the one-month LIBOR, whichever is
the highest rate in each case plus a margin ranging from 2.25% to 2.75% per annum based on our leverage ratio.
Undrawn commitments accrue a fee ranging from 1.3% to 1.5% per annum based on our leverage ratio. Interest is
payable quarterly.
The 2013 Revolving Credit Facility permits loans to be extended up to a maximum sublimit of $500.0 million and permits
letters of credit to be issued up to a maximum sublimit of $300.0 million, subject to a $500.0 million overall facility limit.
Outstanding but undrawn letters of credit accrue a fee at a rate equal to the margin on LIBOR loans minus 1%. The 2013
Revolving Credit Facility matures on June 3, 2018.
Covenants
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.  However, market conditions continue to be
challenging and it is possible we will need to seek amendments or waivers of such covenants during the next twelve
months.

Note 6 — Income Taxes
We recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained
upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount recognized is the
largest benefit that we believe has greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. As of June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, we had $25.5 million and $24.9 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding
interest and penalties) which were included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. The entire
balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2016 would favorably impact our effective tax rate if recognized.
Included on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $3.4 million and $2.5 million,
respectively, of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.
Note 7 — Derivatives
We are currently exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. From time to time, we
may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments in connection with the management of our exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative
purposes; however, for accounting purposes, certain transactions may not meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
On May 30, 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge against future fluctuations in LIBOR with an
effective date of June 3, 2013. The interest rate swap has a notional value of $712.5 million, does not amortize and
matures on December 3, 2017. On a quarterly basis, we pay a fixed rate of 1.56% and receive the maximum of 1% or
three-month LIBOR.
On June 10, 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge against future fluctuations in LIBOR with
an effective date of July 1, 2014. The interest rate swap has a notional value of $400.0 million, does not amortize and
matures on July 1, 2018. On a quarterly basis, we pay a fixed rate of 1.66% and receive three-month LIBOR.
On December 17, 2014, we entered into a series of foreign currency forward contracts as a cash flow hedge against
future exchange rate fluctuations between the Euro and U.S. Dollar. We use the forward contracts to hedge Euro
payments for forecasted capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2016, the remaining forward contracts have a notional value
of €3.8 million and will be settled in December 2016. Upon settlement, we will pay U.S. Dollars and receive Euros at a
forward rate of $1.27. As a result of partially settling the effective hedge for the six months ended June 30, 2016, we
incurred a net cash outflow of $0.6 million and reclassified the amount from accumulated other comprehensive income to
property and equipment.

As of June 30, 2016, the estimated amount of net losses associated with derivative instruments that would be reclassified
from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings during the next twelve months was $7.4 million. During the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016, we reclassified losses of $2.1 million and $4.1 million to interest expense and $0.2
million and $0.4 million to depreciation from accumulated other comprehensive loss, respectively. During the three and
six months ended June 30, 2015, we reclassified losses of $2.4 million and $4.8 million to interest expense and $0.2
million and $0.4 million to depreciation from accumulated other comprehensive loss, respectively.
Note 8 — Fair Value Measurements
We estimated fair value by using appropriate valuation methodologies and information available to management as of
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Considerable judgment is required in developing these estimates, and
accordingly, estimated values may differ from actual results.
The estimated fair value of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated their carrying
value due to their short-term nature. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our receivable from SHI (as defined in
Note 9). It is also not practicable to estimate the fair value of our SSCF debt and 2013 Revolving Credit Facility. The

We use an income approach to value assets and liabilities for outstanding interest rate swaps and foreign currency
forward contracts. These contracts are valued using a discounted cash flow model that calculates the present value of
future cash flows under the terms of the contracts using market information as of the reporting date, such as prevailing
interest rates and forward rates. The determination of the fair values above incorporated various factors, including the
impact of the counterparty’s non-performance risk with respect to our financial assets and our non-performance risk with
respect to our financial liabilities.
See Note 7 for further discussion of our use of derivative instruments and their fair values.
Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments — As of June 30, 2016, we had no material commitments.
Our liquidity fluctuates depending on a number of factors, including, among others, our revenue efficiency and the timing
of accounts receivable collection as well as payments for operating costs and debt repayments. Primary sources of funds
for our short-term liquidity needs are expected to be our cash balances and cash flow generated from operating and
financing activities. We believe our cash balances and cash flow generated from operating activities will provide
sufficient liquidity over the next twelve months to fund our working capital needs and scheduled payments on our long-
term debt.
Customs Bonds—As of June 30, 2016, we were contingently liable under certain customs bonds totaling approximately
$53.7 million issued as security in the normal course of our business.
Contingencies — It is to be expected that we and our subsidiaries will routinely be involved in litigation and disputes
arising in the ordinary course of our business.
On April 16, 2013, Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling, Inc. (“Transocean”) filed a complaint against us in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Texas alleging infringement of their dual activity patents, which was
supplemented by an Amended Complaint filed on May 13, 2013. In its Amended Complaint, Transocean seeks relief in
the form of a permanent injunction, compensatory damages, enhanced damages, court costs and fees. On May 31, 2013,
we filed our Answer to the Amended Complaint and our Counterclaims seeking Declaratory Judgments that we do not
infringe the asserted Transocean patents and that such patents are invalid and unenforceable. The trial was set for
August 8, 2016; however, the Court has granted a stay of the litigation pending the resolution of three Inter Partes
Reviews (“IPRs”) instituted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) on March 28, 2016 with respect to the same
three patents that are the subject of Transocean’s litigation against us. The PTO instituted the IPRs upon the petition of
Seadrill Americas, Inc., Seadrill Gulf Operations Auriga, LLC, Seadrill Gulf Operations Vela, LLC and Seadrill Gulf
Operations Neptune, LLC (collectively, “Seadrill”) based on a finding by the PTO that there is a reasonable likelihood that
Seadrill will succeed in proving that at least
15

PACIFIC DRILLING S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) - Continued
one of the asserted claims of each of the Transocean patents is invalid. Resolution of the IPRs is expected by the end of
March 2017. We do not believe that the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from this litigation will have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
On October 29, 2015, we exercised our right to rescind the construction contract with Samsung Heavy Industries (“SHI”)
for the drillship the Pacific Zonda (the “Construction Contract”) due to SHI’s failure to timely deliver the drillship in
accordance with the contractual specifications. SHI rejected our rescission, and on November 25, 2015, formally
commenced arbitration proceedings against us in London under the Arbitration Act 1996 before a tribunal of three
arbitrators (as specified in the Construction Contract). SHI claims that we wrongfully rejected their tendered delivery of
the drillship and seeks the final installment of the purchase price under the Construction Contract. On November 30,
2015, we made demand under the third party refund guarantee accompanying the Construction Contract for the amount
of our advance payments made under the Construction Contract, plus interest. Any payment under the refund guarantee
is suspended until an award under the arbitration is obtained. Pursuant to a mutually agreed scheduling order, SHI filed
its claims submission on January 29, 2016. We responded with our defense and counterclaim on February 26, 2016 and,
in addition to seeking repayment of our advance payments made under the Construction Contract, our counterclaim also
seeks the return of our purchased equipment, or the value of such equipment, and damages for our wasted expenditures.
SHI submitted their response to our defense and counterclaim on April 11, 2016, we filed our rejoinder on May 23, 2016
and SHI filed its sur-rejoinder on July 8, 2016. The pleadings are now complete and the disclosure phase of the
arbitration proceeding has commenced. A hearing for the arbitration proceeding has been set for May 30, 2017. We do
not believe that the ultimate outcome resulting from this arbitration will have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
Note 10 — Supplemental Cash Flow Information
Within our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, capital expenditures represent expenditures for which cash
payments were made during the period. These amounts exclude accrued capital expenditures, which are capital
expenditures that were accrued but unpaid. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, changes in accrued
capital expenditures were $(11.9) million and $5.2 million, respectively.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, non-cash amortization of deferred financing costs and accretion of
debt discount totaling $0 and $2.5 million were capitalized to property and equipment, respectively. Accordingly, these
amounts are excluded from capital expenditures in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
On May 2, 2016, shareholders at our Extraordinary General Meeting approved the cancellation of 7.3 million treasury
shares (on a pre- Reverse Stock Split basis) that we repurchased under our share repurchase program.  We accounted
for this non-cash transaction by netting the treasury shares at total cost of $30.0 million against the statutory share capital
of the cancelled shares and additional paid-in capital. Upon cancellation, the cancelled shares were returned to
authorized but unissued shares.
Note 11 — Subsequent Events
In April 2016, Total notified us of its intent to terminate the drilling contract for the Pacific Scirocco for convenience.
Throughout the second quarter, we continued to engage in discussions with Total regarding alternatives to early
termination, during which we continued to earn 80% of the current dayrate. On July 22, 2016, Total rescinded the
termination and notified us of its intent to restart operations at the full dayrate by September 15, 2016. We have further
agreed to reduce the full dayrate to $455,000 from October 15, 2016 until the end of the contract term through January 19,
2017.
Following June 30, 2016, we pledged $82.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as collateral to the SSCF lenders to
comply with the loan to value covenant, which requires semi-annual broker valuations of the vessels securing the SSCF
to equal at least 125% of the outstanding SSCF balance as of the valuation date.

Item 2 — Operating and Financial Review and Prospects
Overview
Our primary business is to contract our fleet of high-specification rigs to drill wells for our clients. We are focused on the
high-specification segment of the floating rig market. The term “high-specification,” as used in the floating rig drilling
industry to denote a particular segment of the market, can vary and continues to evolve with technological improvements.
We generally consider high-specification requirements to include rigs capable of drilling in water depths of more than
7,500 feet or projects requiring advanced operating capabilities, such as high hook-loads (>1,000 tons), large
accommodations (200+ beds), increased mud storage and pumping capacity, and high deck-load and space capabilities.

Significant Developments
See Note 11 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
General Industry Trends and Outlook
Historically, operating results in the offshore contract drilling industry have been cyclical and directly related to the
demand for and the available supply of drilling rigs, which are influenced by various factors. Since the latter half of 2014,
oil prices have exhibited great volatility, declining significantly. Although dayrates and utilization for modern drillships
have in the
17
Table of Contents
past been less sensitive to short-term oil price movements than those of older or less capable drilling rigs, the recent
sustained declines in oil prices has rendered many deepwater projects less attractive to our customers and significantly
impacted the number of projects available for modern drillships. The duration of weakness in oil prices remains
uncertain.
Drilling Rig Supply
Across the industry, there have been no orders placed since April 2014 to build additional high-specification semi-
submersibles or drillships, and within the last year, there have been several delays in delivery dates and canceled orders
for new drillships. We estimate there are approximately 29 high-specification ultra-deepwater rigs delivered or scheduled
for delivery from July 1, 2016 until the end of 2018, at least 18 of which have not yet been announced as being under
contract for clients. Additionally, as a result of significantly reduced contracting activity, 30 to 35 rigs in the ultra-
deepwater drilling industry sector have been removed from the actively marketed fleet through cold stacking or
scrapping. This trend, along with additional delays in delivery dates and cancellations of existing orders for high-
specification rigs, could continue as the offshore drilling market remains weak. The supply of high-specification units
through the end of 2018 can be estimated as a range between 110 and 125. Beyond this time frame, the supply is
uncertain and any projections have diminished predictive value.
Drilling Rig Demand
Demand for our drillships is a function of the worldwide levels of offshore exploration and development spending by oil
and gas companies, which has decreased or been delayed significantly as result of the sustained decline in oil prices.
The type of projects that modern drillships undertake are generally located in deeper water, in more remote locations,
and are more capital intensive and longer lasting than those of older or less capable drilling rigs. The drilling programs of
oil and gas companies are also affected by the global economic and political climate, access to quality drilling prospects,
exploration success, perceived future availability and lead time requirements for drilling equipment, advances in drilling
technology, and emphasis on deepwater and high-specification exploration and production versus other areas.
Overall, 2015 saw an extremely slow pace for high-specification contracting activity compared to prior years and this
trend has continued in 2016. We expect contracting activity to be slow for the remainder of 2016.
Supply and Demand Balance
Since the start of the market downturn in 2014, capital expenditure budgets have significantly declined for many
exploration and production companies, and we currently see utilization of the industry’s marketed modern drillships
below 80%, which we expect to continue through 2016.
We estimate that through the end of 2016, approximately 30 to 35 high-specification rigs without currently confirmed
client contracts will be available to commence operations. Additionally, multiple older, lower-specification ultra-
deepwater and mid-water drillships and semisubmersibles have recently completed contracts without follow-on
contracts. The imbalance of supply and demand has exerted considerable pressure on the market and resulted in very
few signed drilling contracts and significantly lower dayrates than in past years for those rigs entering into new contracts.
While recent scrapping and cold stacking of older assets have lowered the total rig supply, supply of drilling rigs
continues to exceed demand. We believe that the industry will need to see a steady increase in oil prices and continue to
remove additional rigs from supply in order to rebalance the global fleet.
For more information on this and other risks to our business and our industry, please read Item 3.D, “Risk Factors” in our
2015 Annual Report.
Contract Backlog
Our contract backlog includes firm commitments only, which are represented by signed drilling contracts. As of August 1,
2016 our contract backlog was approximately $927.3 million and was attributable to revenues we expect to generate on
the Pacific Bora, the Pacific Santa Ana, the Pacific Sharav under drilling contracts with Chevron, and revenues we
expect to generate on the Pacific Scirocco from Total. We calculate our contract backlog by multiplying the contractual
dayrate by the minimum number of days committed under the contracts (excluding options to extend), assuming full
utilization, and also including mobilization fees, upgrade reimbursements and other revenue sources, such as the
standby rate during upgrades, as stipulated in the applicable contract.
The actual amounts of revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned may differ from the
amounts and periods shown in the table below due to various factors. Our contracts customarily provide for termination at
the election of the client with an “early termination payment” to be paid to us if a contract is terminated prior to the
expiration of the fixed term. However, under certain limited circumstances, such as destruction of a drilling rig, our
bankruptcy, sustained unacceptable performance by us or delivery of a rig beyond certain grace and/or liquidated
damages periods, an early termination payment is not required to be paid. Accordingly, the actual amount of revenues
earned may be substantially lower than the backlog reported.

Revenues. The decrease in revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended
June 30, 2015, resulted primarily from the Pacific Khamsin being idle during the period and the Pacific Scirocco being on
an 80% standby rate starting in May 2016. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenue efficiency for our
operating rigs.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, our operating fleet of drillships achieved an average revenue efficiency of
99.0% compared to 95.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Revenue efficiency is defined as the actual
contractual dayrate revenue (excluding mobilization fees, upgrade reimbursements and other revenue sources) divided
by the maximum amount of total contractual dayrate revenue that could have been earned during such period.
Contract drilling revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 also included amortization of deferred
revenue of $12.7 million and $21.5 million and reimbursable revenues of $5.9 million and $9.7 million, respectively. The
decrease in the amortization of deferred revenue was primarily due to completion of the primary contract term for the
Pacific Khamsin in December 2015. Reimbursable revenues represent the gross amount earned related to costs for the
purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services and other services provided at the request of our clients that are
beyond the initial scope of the drilling contract. The decrease in reimbursable revenues was related to corresponding
decreases in reimbursable costs incurred.

Three Months Ended June 30,
2016
(in thousands, amounts per rig per day)
The decrease in direct rig related operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the
three months ended June 30, 2015, resulted from lower operating costs for the Pacific Khamsin subsequent to
completion of its contract and cost saving measures implemented for both operating and idle drillships.
Reimbursable costs are not included under the scope of the drilling contract’s initial dayrate, but are subject to
reimbursement from our clients. Reimbursable costs can be highly variable between quarters. Because the
reimbursement of these costs by our clients is recorded as additional revenue, they do not generally negatively affect our
margins.
The decrease in amortization of deferred costs was primarily due to completion of the primary contract term for the Pacific
Khamsin in December 2015.
Direct rig related operating expenses and shore-based and other support costs divided by the number of operating and
idle rig days were as follows:
 
 
 
Direct rig related operating expenses, net$ 93.5
Shore-based and other support costs
Total
The decrease in direct rig related operating expenses per operating and idle rig per day for the three months ended
June 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was attributable to lower costs on idle drillships during the
second quarter of 2016, and fleet wide cost saving measures implemented.
The decrease in shore-based and other support costs per operating and idle rig per day for the three months ended
June 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was due to reductions in Brazil and Nigeria office costs, and the
implementation of cost saving measures.
General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016
were in line with the three months ended June 30, 2015, resulting from our cost saving measures, partially offset by
higher legal costs associated with the patent litigation and arbitration proceeding.
Depreciation expense. The increase in depreciation expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to
the same period in 2015, related to depreciation expense incurred on the Pacific Meltem, after being placed into service
on August 25, 2015.

Interest expense
The increase in interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of 2015,
was due to a reduction in capitalized interest on the Pacific Meltem and the Pacific Zonda.
Gain on debt extinguishment. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased $23.7 million of our 2017
Senior Secured Notes for a purchase price of $9.1 million plus accrued interest. We recorded the resulting gain, net of
the corresponding unamortized deferred financing costs and debt discount, of $14.2 million as a gain on debt
extinguishment in our statements of operations.
Other expense. The change in other expense primarily related to the currency exchange loss due to the devaluation of
Nigerian Naira against the U.S. Dollar in the second quarter of 2016.

Income taxes. In accordance with GAAP, we estimate the full-year effective tax rate from continuing operations and apply
this rate to our year-to-date income from continuing operations. In addition, we separately calculate the tax impact of
unusual or infrequent items, if any. The tax impacts of such unusual or infrequent items are treated discretely in the
quarter in which they occur. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, our effective tax rate was 14.3%
and 20.7%, respectively. Excluding discrete items, our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was
(19.9)%.
The relationship between our provision for or benefit from income taxes and our pre-tax book income can vary
significantly from period to period considering, among other factors, (a) the overall level of pre-tax book income,
(b) changes in the blend of income that is taxed based on gross revenues or at high effective tax rates versus pre-tax
book income or at low effective tax rates and (c) our rig operating structures. Consequently, our income tax expense does
not change proportionally with our pre-tax book income. Significant decreases in our pre-tax book income typically result
in higher effective tax rates, while significant increases in pre-tax book income can lead to lower effective tax rates,
subject to the other factors impacting income tax expense noted above. Additionally, pre-tax book losses typically result
in negative effective tax rates. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2016 to
negative levels, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 was the result of our idle drillships, which are
generating losses for which no tax benefit is expected.

Revenues. The decrease in revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the six months ended
June 30, 2015, resulted primarily from the Pacific Khamsin and the Pacific Mistral being idle during the period, and the
Pacific Scirocco being on an 80% standby rate starting in May 2016. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenue
efficiency for our operating rigs.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, our operating fleet of drillships increased average revenue efficiency to
98.4%, as compared to 95.3% during the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Contract drilling revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 also included amortization of deferred
revenue of $25.3 million and $44.2 million and reimbursable revenues of $11.3 million and $15.6 million, respectively.
The decrease in the amortization of deferred revenue was primarily due to completion of the primary contract term for the
Pacific Mistral in February 2015 and the Pacific Khamsin in December 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
As of June 30, 2016, we had $371.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $82.0 million was pledged to the
lenders under the SSCF as cash collateral in August 2016. In addition, we currently have in place a $500.0 million
revolving credit facility that matures in June 2018.  As of June 30, 2016, we had drawn $285.0 million under this facility. 
Our ability to draw further indebtedness under this facility is limited by a secured debt incurrence covenant contained in
our 2017 senior secured notes.
Our liquidity requirements include meeting ongoing working capital needs, repaying our outstanding indebtedness and
maintaining adequate credit facilities or cash balances to compensate for the effects of fluctuations in operating cash
flows. Our liquidity fluctuates depending on a number of factors, including, among others, our revenue efficiency and the
timing of accounts receivable collection as well as payments for operating costs and debt repayments. Our ability to meet
these liquidity requirements will depend in large part on our future operating and financial performance as well as market
conditions, including our ability to enter into new drilling contracts for our vessels.
Primary sources of funds for our short-term liquidity needs are expected to be our cash balances and cash flow
generated from operating and financing activities. We believe our cash balances and cash flow generated from operating
activities will provide sufficient liquidity over the next twelve months to fund our working capital needs and scheduled
payments on our long-term debt. We expect to fund our long-term liquidity requirements through operating and financing
activities.

Description of Indebtedness
7.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2017. In November 2012, Pacific Drilling V Limited, our indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary, completed a private placement to eligible purchasers of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
7.25% senior secured U.S. dollar denominated notes due 2017 to fund the final construction costs related to the Pacific
Khamsin. The 2017 Senior Secured Notes bear interest at 7.25% per annum, which is payable semiannually on June 1
and December 1, and mature on December 1, 2017.
Senior Secured Credit Facility Agreement. On February 19, 2013, Pacific Sharav S.à r.l. and Pacific Drilling VII Limited,
and we, as guarantor, entered into the SSCF with a group of lenders to finance the construction, operation and other
costs associated with the Pacific Sharav and the Pacific Meltem. In 2015, we completed the final drawdown under this
facility, resulting in a cumulative total drawdown of $985.0 million. As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding balance under
the SSCF was $817.2 million.
5.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2020. On June 3, 2013, we completed a private placement to eligible purchasers of
$750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2020. The 2020 Senior Secured
Notes were sold at par, bear interest at 5.375% per annum, which is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1,
and mature on June 1, 2020.
Senior Secured Term Loan B due 2018. On June 3, 2013, we entered into a $750.0 million senior secured term loan. The
Senior Secured Term Loan B matures on June 3, 2018.
2013 Revolving Credit Facility. On June 3, 2013, we entered into the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility which, as amended
permits loans to be extended up to a maximum limit of $500.0 million and permits letters of credit to be issued up to a
maximum sublimit of $300.0 million, subject to a $500.0 million overall facility limit. As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding
balance under the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility was $285.0 million.
Covenants
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.  However, market conditions continue to be
challenging and it is possible we will need to seek amendments or waivers of such covenants during the next twelve
months.
For additional information, see Note 4 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this
Form 6-K and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2015 Annual Report.
Customs Bonds
As of June 30, 2016, we were contingently liable under certain customs bonds totaling approximately $53.7 million
issued as security in the normal course of our business. See Note 9 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
We may enter into derivative instruments from time to time to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and
foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes; however, for accounting
purposes, certain transactions may not meet the criteria for hedge accounting. See Note 7 to our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Currently, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Interest payments are based on our existing outstanding borrowings as of June 30, 2016. Amounts assume no
refinancing of existing long-term debt and no prepayments. For fixed rate debt, interest has been calculated using
stated rates. For variable rate LIBOR based debt, interest has been calculated using current LIBOR as of June 30,
2016 and includes the impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps.
Purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and
that specify all significant terms, including the quantities to be purchased, price provisions and the approximate timing
of the transactions, which includes our purchase orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of
business.
Contractual obligations do not include approximately $28.9 million of liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits related
to uncertain tax positions, inclusive of interest and penalties, included on our condensed consolidated balance sheet
as of June 30, 2016. We are unable to specify with certainty the future periods in which we may be obligated to settle
such amounts.
Some of the figures included in the table above are based on estimates and assumptions about these obligations,
including their duration and other factors. The contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from
those reflected in the tables.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions impact the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the
amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our
estimates and assumptions, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, financial instruments,
depreciation of property and equipment, impairment of long-lived assets, long-term receivable, income taxes, share-
based compensation and contingencies. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on
various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results could differ from such estimates.
For a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we use in the preparation of our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements, see Item 5, “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Critical
Accounting Estimates and Policies” in our 2015 Annual Report. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
there have been no material changes to the judgments, assumptions and estimates upon which our critical accounting
estimates are based. Significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards are discussed in Note 2
to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 6-K and in Note 2 to our consolidated
financial statements included in our 2015 Annual Report.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements and information contained in this Form 6-K constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning
of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are generally identifiable by the
use of words such as “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “our ability to,” “plan,” “potential,” “projected,” “target,”
“would,” or other similar words, which are generally not historical in nature. The forward-looking statements speak only
as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after
the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Our forward-looking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events,
including our future financial and operational performance; revenue efficiency levels; market outlook; forecasts of trends;
future client contract opportunities; contract dayrates; our business strategies and plans and objectives of management;
estimated duration of client contracts; backlog; our ability to repay our debt; expected capital expenditures and projected
costs and savings.
Although we believe that the assumptions and expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable
and made in good faith, these statements are not guarantees and actual future results may differ materially due to a
variety of factors. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our
control.
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include: the global oil and gas
market and its impact on demand for our services; the offshore drilling market, including reduced capital expenditures by
our clients; changes in worldwide oil and gas supply and demand; rig availability and supply and demand for high-
specification drillships and other drilling rigs competing with our fleet; costs related to stacking of rigs; our ability to enter
into and negotiate favorable terms for new drilling contracts or extensions; our substantial level of indebtedness; possible
cancellation, renegotiation, termination or suspension of drilling contracts as a result of market changes or other reasons;
and the other risk factors described in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 20-F and Current
Reports on Form 6-K. These documents are available through our website at www.pacificdrilling.com or through the
SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

Item 3 — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk
We are exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business.
These risks arise primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would
result from adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below. We have
entered, and in the future may enter, into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk, but
we do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative or trading purposes.
Interest Rate Risk. We are exposed to changes in interest rates through our variable rate long-term debt. We use interest
rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate risks. Interest rate swaps are used to convert floating rate debt
obligations to a fixed rate in order to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rate debt. As of June 30,
2016, our net exposure to floating interest rate fluctuations on our outstanding debt was $572.4 million, based on floating
rate debt of $1,684.9 million less the $1,112.5 million notional principal of our floating to fixed interest rate swaps. A 1%
increase or decrease to the overall variable interest rate charged to us would thus increase or decrease our interest
expense by approximately $5.7 million on an annual basis as of June 30, 2016.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk associated with our international
operations. For a discussion of our foreign exchange risk, see Item 11, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk” in our 2015 Annual Report. There have been no material changes to these previously reported matters
during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
