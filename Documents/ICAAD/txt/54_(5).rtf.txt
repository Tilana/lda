I can see Ram Hansa's House. No dispute with either one. Defendant is good man is a cane cutter. I am an elder in Maro. Defendant has lived quietly as a labourer has built a house for $30,000.00.

Defendant brought his mother and the problem started. I know the Defendant as I was the Secretary of the gang. In cross-examination Dw-4's response was "Defendant was paid by the Plaintiff to work on the farm." 

Analysis of the Evidence

Firstly the Court wishes to state that this is one of those sad cases involving a father and son dispute but the Court has to decide on the merits of the case and not on emotions. 

In this Action the Defendant pleaded that he had an agreement with his father, the Plaintiff dated 2nd December 1993 where the parties agreed that the Defendant would live on the land. The Defendant in cross-examination told the Court that he had an agreement with his brother about the land. The Court from the pleadings and the evidence tendered finds that the Plaintiff and the Defendant had no agreement for the Defendant to reside on the land. For the duration the Defendant lived on the land the Plaintiff gave the Defendant licence to reside on the land. The Plaintiff now seeks that the Defendant vacates his land.

The Defendant pleaded and gave evidence that he had an equitable interest being the legal son of the Plaintiff. The Defendant is over 21 years and married. He has his own family. The Plaintiff is about 76 years old. The Defendant was adamant that he should have a share in the land and the Plaintiff should give him land. 

A misconception remains in many children's mind that whatever is their fathers is theirs. The children generally think that they have a right to what are their fathers. The Defendant was allowed by his father to live on the land. The Defendant was paid for the work he did on the land. The Plaintiff seems to be clearly frustrated at the attitude of the Defendant and his son towards him. The Plaintiff who is well aware of what is happening and is taking this extreme action due to the behaviour of the Defendants family towards him. The Plaintiff deserves respect. He has provided place for the Defendant to live. He has been paying FDB the mortgage. 

The Plaintiff may still give the Defendant his share but that is up to him and he cannot be forced into giving anything to the Defendant just because the Defendant is his son. From the evidence tendered the Court finds there was no agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant that provided for the Defendant to live on the land. The Court also finds that the Defendant has no equitable interest in the land as a legal son. The Plaintiff is the owner of the land and is paying rental for the land. The Defendant worked for the Plaintiff and was paid for the work he did. The Plaintiff gave a licence to the Defendant to live on his land and now the Plaintiff wants the Defendant to move out.
