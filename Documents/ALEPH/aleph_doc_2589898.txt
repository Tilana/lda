OVERVIEW OF THE BUSINESS
Primero is a Canadian-based precious metals producer with operations in both Mexico and Canada.
The Company is focused on building a portfolio of high quality, low cost precious metals assets in the
Americas  through  acquiring,  exploring,  developing  and  operating  mineral  resource  properties.  The
Company  owns  two  producing  properties,  the  San  Dimas  gold-silver  mine,  located  in  Mexico’s  San
Dimas  district,  on  the  border  of  Durango  and  Sinaloa  states,  and  the  Black  Fox  mine  located  in  the
Township of Black River Matheson, Ontario, Canada. The Company owns properties adjacent to the
Black Fox mine - Grey Fox and Pike River, which together with the Black Fox mine and the Black Fox
mill, located on the Stock Mill property, comprise the Black Fox Complex.
In addition, the Company owns two exploration properties the Cerro del Gallo gold-silver-copper project,
located in the state of Guanajuato in central Mexico and Ventanas, located in Durango State, Mexico.
The profitability and operating cash flow of the Company are affected by numerous factors, including the
amount  of  gold  and  silver  produced  and  sold,  market  prices  of  gold  and  silver,  operating  costs,
regulatory  and  environmental  compliance,  as  well  as  currency  exchange  rates,  political  risks,  and
varying levels of taxation. The Company seeks to manage these risks, but many of the factors affecting
these risks beyond the Company’s control.
The Company’s shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the symbol “P” and on
the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “PPP”. In addition, Primero has a convertible
debenture trading on the TSX under the symbol “P.DB.V” and common share purchase warrants trading

PRIMERO MINING CORP. 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
Q2 2016 HIGHLIGHTS
•
•
•
•
•
•
The  Company  completed  an  equity  offering  in  June, pursuant  to  which  the  Company  issued
22,022,500 units (the “Units”) of the Company at a price of C$2.35 per Unit for aggregate gross
proceeds  of C$51,752,875  (the  “equity  offering”)  .  Each  Unit  consists  of  one  common share  of
Primero  and  one-half  of  one  common  share  purchase  warrant  (each whole  common  share
purchase warrant is a “warrant”) of the Company. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to acquire
one common share of the Corporation at a price of C$3.35 per common share until June 25, 2018.
 
During Q2, 2016 the Company continued to advance its defense of its Advance Pricing Agreement
(“APA Ruling”) with the Mexican tax authorities Servicio de Administración Tributaria (the “SAT”) in
connection with the legal claim initiated by the SAT to challenge its validity. In connection with this
claim,  also  during  the  quarter,  the Company  issued  a  Notice  of  Intent  to  submit  a  claim  to
international arbitration against the Government of Mexico, under the North American Free Trade
Agreement  (“NAFTA”)  ,  highlighting  the  improper  actions  taken  by the  SAT,  with  the  intent  of
revoking legal rights previously granted to the Company and upon which the Company relied to
expand its investment in Mexico.
 
Total production of 49,499 gold equivalent ounces in Q2 2016 compared to 62,490 gold equivalent
ounces in the same period of 2015. Gold production was 44,150 ounces in Q2 2016 compared to
54,862 ounces in Q2 2015, and silver production was 1.60 million ounces from San Dimas in Q2
2016 compared to 2.15 million ounces in Q2 2015.
At  San  Dimas,  the  mine  continued  to  refine  its  mining procedures  to  incorporate  the  enhanced
ground support activities into the routine mining sequence, and extraction averaged 2,541 tonnes
per day (“TPD”) during the quarter, consistent to the stated target of 2,500 TPD and higher than Q1
2016.  Lower  grades  were  realized  in  Q2  2016  compared  to Q2  2015  and  compared  to
expectations  as  localized  ventilation  issues  at the  Jessica  vein  and  ongoing  mine  services
improvements impacted the availability of high-grade areas during the quarter. Total gold and gold
equivalent production during the quarter was 1.5 times higher than the first quarter of 2016.
 
At Black Fox, mining activities focused mainly on the remnant areas in the upper portions of the
mine and advancing development in the Deep Central zone. Production from the remnant areas
was less than the Company anticipated. Through the remainder of the year, mining will progress
into the Deep Central zone and Black Fox will become less reliant on the upper, remnant areas of
the  mine,  which  is  expected  to  improve overall  mine  grades.  Stope  production  from  the  Deep
Central zone is expected to commence by the end of the third quarter.
 
Earnings from mine operations for Q2 2016 was $4.6 million compared to earnings of $11.1 million
in Q2 2015 mainly due to lower gold sales resulting from the lower gold production.
•
•
The Company incurred total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce of $851 for Q2 2016 compared
to $654 for Q2 2015. All-in sustaining costs were $1,310 per gold ounce for Q2 2016 compared to
$1,036 for Q2 2015. The increase in unit costs was largely due to lower production at both mines
and an increase in costs at San Dimas due to an increase in the annual union bonus following the
completion of negotiations of this bonus during Q2 2016.
 
The  Company  recognized  a  net  loss  of  $19.4  million  in  Q2 2016  compared  to  net  loss  of  $6.7
million in Q2 2015 due to the lower earnings from mine operations and a $11.1 million tax expense
in Q2 2016 mainly resulting from the devaluation of the Mexican peso compared to the U.S. dollar
in  the  quarter  on  its  Mexican  peso  denominated  tax  assets. Adjusted net loss  was  $2.4  million
($0.01 per share) for Q2 2016, compared to adjusted net income of $1.1 million ($0.01 per share)
for the same period in 2015.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
•
•
Given lower than originally planned grades are expected to continue for the remainder of the year
at San Dimas, the impact of labour disruptions on July production at San Dimas, and a one-month
timing delay in accessing the high-grade Deep Central zone ore at Black Fox, Primero updated its
2016 guidance.
 
Primero’s reduced 2016 production guidance is between 195,000 and 215,000 gold equivalent
ounces compared to a previous estimate of 230,000 to 250,000 gold equivalent ounces. An
expected reduction in silver sales to the spot market also impacted the gold/silver ratio and
correspondingly, the gold equivalent production outlook. The Company has also updated its cost
guidance with total cash cost guidance revised to $775 to $825 per equivalent ounce and all-in
sustaining costs revised to $1,200 to $1,250 per gold ounce.

Gold revenue decreased for the three and six months ending 2016 compared to the same periods
in 2015 due to reduced production at both mines. Silver revenue increased in Q2 2016 compared
to  Q2  2015 despite  lower  silver  production  because  Primero  Empresa  Minera,  S.A.  de C.V.
(“PEM”) , the company which holds the San Dimas assets, temporarily lost its export license in Q2
2015 preventing the delivery of silver outside of Mexico.
The  average  price  realized  for  gold  during  the  second quarter  of  2016  was  $1,241  per  ounce,
above the $1,171 per ounce realized in the second quarter of 2015. For the six months, the gold
price  realized of $1,201 per ounce in 2016 was slightly above the $1,179 per ounce realized in
2015.
Silver prices realized during Q2 2016 and the first six months of 2016 were in-line with the prices
realized  in  the  comparative periods of 2015, as all silver was sold to Silver Wheaton Caymans
under the terms of the silver purchase agreement in those periods.
Operating  expenses  were  $39.0  million  in  Q2  2016;  $2.6 million  higher  than  Q2  2015  mainly
driven by an increase in the union bonus at San Dimas. For the first six months of 2016, operating
expenses were  consistent  with  2015,  as  the  increase  in  union  bonus  has  been  offset by  cost
savings at Black Fox due to sourcing a significant portion of the mill feed from the low grade, lower
cost stockpile.

Depreciation and depletion was $15.8 million in Q2 2016, compared to $19.9 million in Q2 2015, a
decrease of $4.1 million due to lower production. Lower production also drove the first six months
of 2016 depreciation and depletion lower than the comparative 2015 period by $7.1 million.

General and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $7.6
million and $13.2 million, respectively, compared to $7.2 million and $15.2 million, respectively, for
the comparative periods in 2015. The increase during Q2 2016 was attributed mainly to increases
in legal and consulting services in connection with the ongoing NAFTA and APA claims. This was
offset by a decrease in share-based compensation and salaries and wages due to a reduction in
the  number  of  corporate  employees.  The  $2.0  million  decrease for  the  six  month  period  ended
June 30, 2016 was primarily from a decrease in the share-based compensation due to a one-time
additional  grant  of Phantom Share Units to certain executives which were fully expensed in Q1
2015 coupled with general office expenses relating to offices in Vancouver and Mexico City which
were closed in Q1 2015. The breakdown of general and administrative expenses is as follows:

Transaction costs for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 were $0.8 million and
$1.2 million, respectively, compared to $nil and $3.9 million for the comparative periods in 2015,
respectively.  Transaction  costs  for  both  periods  in  2016  include  costs allocated  to  the  warrants
issued in connection with the equity offering completed in June 2016. Costs incurred in 2015 relate
to the issuance of the 5.75% Convertible Debenture.
Mark-to-market gains (losses) during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 were
($2.3) million and ($2.7) million, respectively, compared to ($3.7) million and $4.5 million for the
comparative periods in 2015. The 5.75% Convertible Debentures are accounted for at fair value
and are marked-to-market each period based on the trading price of the debentures. In June 2016,
the  Company  recognized a  warrant  liability  relating  to  the  common  share  purchase  warrants
issued in connection with the equity offering. The warrant liability is measured at fair value and
marked-to-market each period based on the corresponding trading price of the warrants. The mark-
to-market loss on the warrants for 2016 was $0.4 million.
•
For  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016,  other  income (expense)  included  $0.4  million  of
unrealized foreign exchange losses arising from the translation of Canadian dollar denominated
liabilities, as the Canadian dollar strengthened during this period relative to the U.S.  dollar  (the
Company’s functional currency) . This compares to $2.3 million unrealized foreign exchange gains
for the comparative period in 2015 due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S.
dollar.

San Dimas expenses current taxes based on the taxable earnings of the period. For the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, San Dimas did not generate any taxable earnings and therefore was not
subject to current income taxes and only a small amount of mining royalty tax. The tax recovery from the
San Dimas operating losses is recorded as a deferred tax recovery, included in the San Dimas change
in tax shelter.
San Dimas income taxes are based on its Mexican peso financial statements, which includes foreign
exchange  and  other  income  items  (permanent  differences)  different  than  the  U.S.  dollar  reporting
financial  statements.  In  addition,  foreign  exchange  losses  are  recognized  in  deferred  income  tax
expense  when  the  Mexican  peso  denominated  deferred  income  tax  balance  is  translated  to  its  U.S.
dollar  reporting  currency.  For  the  three  and  six  month  periods  ended  June  30,  2016,  this  increased
deferred  tax  expense  by  $13.0  million  and  $14.7  million,  respectively  (2015-$5.6  million  and  $8.2
million,  respectively)  .  The  reduction  in  San  Dimas  tax  shelters  reflects  the  impact  of  this  foreign
exchange offset by inflation on the San Dimas’ deferred income tax balances and the impact of higher
book to tax depreciation. The volatility of the exchange rate between the Mexican peso and the U.S.
dollar can result in significant adjustments to deferred tax expense.

PRIMERO MINING CORP. 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
The San Dimas mine produced 28,978 ounces of gold and 1.60 million ounces of silver in the second
quarter  of  2016,  21%  and  26%  lower  for  gold  and  silver  respectively,  in  comparison  to  the  second
quarter of 2015. Gold and gold equivalent production in the second quarter was 1.5 times higher than
the first quarter of 2016.
Production  during  the  second  quarter  of  2016  was  impacted  by  two  main  factors  –  the  continued
optimization  of  the  mining  cycle  in  relation  to  the  implementation  of  the  enhanced  ground  support
procedures which was initiated in the first quarter of 2016 and the timing of accessing certain high grade
stopes.
At the end of the Q1 2016, all active mining areas had been updated with enhanced ground support in
accordance with the new mine policy. During the second quarter, the mine continued to refine its mining
procedures  to  incorporate  the  enhanced  ground  support  activities  into  the  routine  mining  sequence.
Mine extraction averaged 2,541 TPD during the second quarter, above the stated target of 2,500 TPD.
The gold grade realized in the second quarter 2016 of 4.10 grams per tonne was approximately 11%
below the grade in the second quarter of 2015 due to the availability of high-grade material. Localized
ventilation  issues  principally  affecting  the  Jessica  vein  resulted  in  the  deferral  of  certain  high  grade
stopes, and led to mining activity being focused on other areas. Silver grades were also impacted by
these same factors.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the San Dimas mine produced 48,557 ounces of gold and
2.52 million ounces of silver, 36% and 38% lower than the same period of 2015. The retrofitting of all
active  mine  areas  with  enhanced  standards  for  ground  support  had  a  significant  impact  on  the
production during the first quarter. Combined with the shift in timing of certain high grade stopes in the
second quarter, these factors drove year-to-date production below the comparative 2015 period.
During  the  second  quarter,  both  gold  and  silver  sales  were  reduced  in  line  with  the  decreased
production; however, silver sales were higher in Q2 2016 compared to Q2 2015 because the loss of
PEM’s export license in Q2 2015 prevented the delivery of silver to Silver Wheaton Caymans. All silver
sold in the quarter was delivered to Silver Wheaton Caymans under the silver purchase agreement. The
threshold limit under the silver purchase agreement for the 2015 contract year (August 6 of a year to
August 5 of the following year) is 6.0 million ounces of silver. As of June 30, 2016 the Company has
delivered 5.6 million ounces of silver towards this annual threshold, after which the Company will begin
selling 50% of the silver produced at San Dimas at spot market prices. Silver ounces sold into the spot
market in advance of the end of the 2016 contract year are expected to be minimal.
Overall costs were higher during the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015
due to an increased annual bonus negotiated with the union during the second quarter. The agreed
bonus was above 2015 levels and resulted in an additional charge of $2.7 million to operating costs
during the quarter.
Total cash costs on a gold-equivalent and by-product basis in the second quarter of 2016 were $843
and $765 per ounce, respectively, compared with $608 and $487 per ounce, respectively, in the second
quarter of 2015. Unit costs were higher during the quarter mainly due to lower gold and silver production
and higher costs expensed in the quarter related to the increased annual bonus negotiated with the
unionized employees. The impact of the increased union bonus was approximately $90 per ounce in
the second quarter.

PRIMERO MINING CORP. 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce were $1,063 in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $822 per
ounce in the second quarter of 2015. The increase was primarily driven by the lower gold production
during the quarter as sustaining capital was lower between periods. Capital spending at San Dimas
was $10.6 million in the second quarter and focused on underground development. Additionally, the
upgrade to the main crushing circuit was completed, with the mobile crusher substantially completed in
July. The second quarter of 2015 had comparative capital spending at $11.0 million.
For the six months to June 2016, operating costs were lower than the comparative 2015 period as the
impact of the reduced mining and milling activity during the first quarter more than offset the increased
union  bonus  cost  in  the  second  quarter.  Despite  the  lower  overall  costs,  the  lower  gold  and  silver
production levels drove unit costs higher than the comparative period of 2015. Total cash costs on a
gold-equivalent basis and by-product basis for the six months to June were $905 and $847 per ounce,
respectively, compared to $595 and $483 per ounce in 2015.
Total capital expenditures for the six months to June 2016 were slightly below the comparative 2015
period due to lower underground development. All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce were $1,183 for
the six months to June 2016, compared to $736 per ounce for the six months to June 2015. Similar to
cash costs, the lower production level drove all-in sustaining costs higher when compared to 2015.
In  June  2016,  PEM  acquired  a  large  concession  area  adjacent  to  its  San  Dimas  mine  in  Durango,
Mexico, adding 30,192 hectares substantially covering the area between the San Dimas mine and the
Ventanas exploration property located 32 kilometres to the south. The newly acquired concession is not
covered by the San Dimas silver purchase agreement, and brings PEM’s total concession area in the
district to 68,628 hectares.
San Dimas production guidance has been revised to between 135,000 and 145,000 gold equivalent
ounces from the previous estimate of 160,000 to 170,000 gold equivalent ounces. Accordingly, cash
cost guidance has also been revised to $725 to $775 per gold equivalent ounce, with all-in sustaining
costs expected to be between $950 and $1,000 per ounce.
Production  at  San  Dimas  has  been  impacted  by  lower  than  planned  grades,  unexpected  labour
disruptions in July and a lower gold/silver ratio as a result of minimal expected silver spot sales. Labour
disruptions in July were related to the local union seeking to increase short term production bonuses
and  interrupted  the  mine’s  operation  during  discussions.  The  short  term  production  bonuses  were
agreed  upon  in  late  July.  The  labour  disruption  affected  July  production  and  development  and  as  a
result, select high grade areas will not be mined in 2016 resulting in a production shortfall.
In view of these recent operational challenges at San Dimas the Company initiated a mine optimization
program,  in  conjunction  with  a  third  party.  A  seven  point  action  plan  was  developed  to  focus  on
technical  improvements  such  as  improving  development  rates  and  services,  reducing  dilution,
decreasing  operating  costs,  and  improving  labour  productivity.  The  Company  expects  to  provide  an
update at the end of the third quarter.

PRIMERO MINING CORP. 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
The Black Fox mine produced 15,172 ounces of gold in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 18,362
ounces in the second quarter of 2015. During the quarter, mining activities were mainly focused on the
remnant areas in the upper portions of the mine and advancing development of the Deep Central zone.
Mining encountered difficulty in accessing the Deep Central zone on the 660 level, as a footwall drift
was attempted but a workaround was required from the hanging wall side. This has delayed production
from this high grade area by approximately one month.
Through the remainder of the year, mining will progress further into the Deep Central zone and Black
Fox will become less reliant on the upper, remnant areas of the mine, which is expected to improve
overall mine grades. Stope production from the Deep Central zone is expected to commence by the end
of the third quarter.
During the quarter, 171,764 tonnes from the low grade stockpile were processed through the mill. This
stockpile drawdown allowed milling at a higher rate than in the second quarter of 2015, with 2,524 TPD
being milled, 3% above the 2,441 TPD milled in the second quarter of 2015. Despite higher grades and
increased tonnage being realized from underground mining in the second quarter of 2016 compared to
the second quarter of 2015, mill head grades were lower compared to 2015. In Q2 2015, the mill was
supplemented with ore from open pit operations that were higher in grade than the low grade stockpile
fed to the mill in the second quarter of 2016. The lower mill grades were principally responsible for the
lower gold production.
For the six months to June 2016, the Black Fox mine produced 28,429 ounces of gold, 14% lower than
the same period in 2015. The lack of available high grade ore in the upper, remnant areas of the mine
through the first six months of 2016 was the main factor in lower gold production. A total of 357,716
tonnes have been drawn from the low grade stockpile through the first half of the year.
Total cash cost per gold ounce were higher in the second quarter of 2016 at $870 per ounce compared
to $762 per ounce in the second quarter of 2015 as the lower gold production more than offset lower
operating  costs.  While  underground  production  was  higher  in  Q2  2016,  a  significant  portion  of
production came from the drawdown of the lower cost stockpile inventory, and thus average operating
costs were less than in 2015 when open pit mining operations contributed the majority of ore to the mill.
All-in sustaining costs were higher in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 due to the lower
gold production. Similar levels of capital expenditure were spread over fewer ounces.
For the six months to June 2016, total cash costs per gold ounce were $862, 4% lower than the prior
year as overall cost savings more than offset the lower gold production. The utilization of the lower-cost
stockpile to fill the mill as opposed to open pit mining operations was the main driver of lower average
costs compared to the six months to June 2015. All-in sustaining costs for the six months to June 2016
were  $1,382  per  ounce,  8%  above  the  comparative  2015  period  due  to  increased  underground
development to reach the Deep Central zone, combined with lower overall gold production.
Following the initial announcement in Q1 of positive drilling results from the Froome Zone located on
the Black Fox complex, the Company continued to delineate and expand the deposit and commenced
an internal economic evaluation of the Froome Zone. An initial mining plan has been developed and
preliminary engineering and geotechnical studies have begun with the focus on accessing the ore body
via an underground drift from the Black Fox pit, expediting the permitting process and timeline to initial
production.  Optimizing  studies  are  continuing  in  Q3  with  the  focus  on  reducing  capital  cost  and  de-
risking the project.

PRIMERO MINING CORP. 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
The timing delays in accessing the high-grade mineralization from the Deep Central zone is expected to
impact annual production. As a result, the guidance has been revised to between 60,000 to 70,000 gold
ounces from the original estimate of 70,000 to 80,000 gold ounces. Accordingly, to reflect the lower gold
ounces produced the cash cost guidance has been revised to $850 to $900 per gold ounce and AISC
revised to $1,250 to $1,300 per ounce. The AISC also includes additional capital costs to develop the
Deep Central zone. Additional drilling and development will be undertaken to increase available stopes
in the Deep Central zone.

PRIMERO MINING CORP. 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
OUTLOOK FOR 2016 OPERATING RESULTS
Primero has reduced its 2016 production guidance to between 195,000 and 215,000 gold equivalent
ounces at total cash costs of between $775 and $825 per gold equivalent ounce with AISC of between
$1,200 and $1,250 per gold ounce. The Company has also re-evaluated its capital budget in light of
guidance revisions and as a result 2016 capital expenditures have been reduced to $73.7 million which
included $42.4 million at San Dimas and $29.0 million at Black Fox.
At San Dimas, the labour disruption affected July production and development and as a result, select
high grade areas will not be mined in 2016 resulting in a production shortfall. For Black Fox, the timing
delay  in  accessing  the  high-grade  Deep  Central  zone  ore  led  to  a  reduction  in  the  2016  production
outlook for the mine.
The Company's 2016 production outlook is summarized in the following table:

San  Dimas’  previously  disclosed  production  outlook  was 160,000  to  170,000  gold  equivalent
ounces, 120,000 to 130,000 gold ounces and 7.5 to 8.5 million silver ounces. Black Fox previously
disclosed production  outlook  was  70,000  to  80,000  gold  ounces.  The  Company’s previously
disclosed  consolidated  production  outlook  was  230,000  to 250,000  gold  equivalent  ounces,
190,000 to 210,000 gold ounces and 7.5 to 8.5 million silver ounces.
San  Dimas’  previous  outlook  for  cash  cost  per  equivalent ounce  was  $600  to  $650  and  all-in
sustaining cost per ounce of $775 to $825. Black Fox previous outlook for cash cost per equivalent
ounce was $750 to $800 and all-in sustaining cost per ounce of $1,000 to $1,050. The Company’s
previous  outlook  for  consolidated  cash  cost  per  equivalent  ounce was $650 to $700 and all- in
sustaining cost per ounce of $975 to $1,025.
Material assumptions used to forecast total cash costs for 2016 were based on the Company’s actual
results to June 30, 2016 and include an estimated average gold price of $1,250 per ounce (based on
actual gold prices received through Q2 2016 and $1,300 per ounce for the remainder of the year) , silver
market price of $20 per ounce, and foreign exchange rates of $1.30 Canadian dollars and 18 Mexican
pesos to the U.S. dollar for the remainder of 2016. Silver sold under the silver purchase agreement is
expected to average $4.26 for the 2016 year.
The  Company’s  2016  outlook  for  revenues  and  operating  expenses  are  directly  correlated  to  its
production  outlook  and  cash  cost  outlook  with  the  assumption  that  production  will  match  sales
quantities.

Primero’s cash flows from operating activities before working capital changes were lower in the second
quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015 due to lower gold production and sales at
both San Dimas and Black Fox and higher tax instalments paid at San Dimas. For the first six months of
2016,  the  reduced  gold  and  silver  production  and  higher  tax  payments  at  San  Dimas  were  also  the
primary reasons for the decrease in cash flows from operating activities before working capital changes.
Changes in non-cash working capital were a cash inflow of $5.0 million in the second quarter of 2016
compared  with  an  outflow  of  $20.4  million  in  the  second  quarter  of  2015.  The  inflow  in  the  second
quarter of 2016 was due to a number of routine working capital movements. The outflow in the second
quarter of 2015 was due to a build-up of inventory and a reduction in payables. Inventories increased as
gold production exceeded sales, silver sales were impacted by the suspension of the export license at
PEM, and Black Fox added to its low grade stockpile.
The six months to June 2016 cash inflow from changes in non-cash working capital is due primarily to
draw downs of inventory as more gold was sold than produced at San Dimas and the continued draw
down of the low grade stockpile at Black Fox, and an increase in payroll taxes payable. For the six
months to June 2015, the increase in inventories and payment of payables drove the cash outflow from
changes in non-cash working capital.

1 Expenditures on mining interests included on the condensed consolidated interim statements of cash
flows  varies  from  capital  expenditures  shown  in  the  table  because  of  timing  of  payments  and  the
acquisition of the mining concessions near the San Dimas mine.
San Dimas capital spending during the quarter was focused on progressing underground development,
given the lower development in the first quarter due to the focus on the ground support enhancement
initiative.  Sustaining  capital  included  the  purchase  of  three  scissor  trucks  to  aid  in  ground  support
activities.
The upgrade to the main crushing circuit was completed during the quarter, with the back-up crusher
substantially  completed  in  July.  The  back-up  crusher  will  be  used  during  the  rainy  season  when
material is wetter to avoid additional wear on the main crushing circuit.
For the full 2016 year, estimated San Dimas capital expenditures are expected to be $42.4million. This
is lower than the previous guidance of $51.4 million due to the revised expectations for underground
development and exploration expenditures in light of the change in production outlook for San Dimas.

PRIMERO MINING CORP. 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
Black Fox capital expenditure focused on underground development to ramp down to the Deep Central
zone and set up this area of the ore body for stope production in the third quarter of 2016. Additional
spending on development of $4 million is required in the second half of 2016 to better understand the
economics of the deeper zone. Regional exploration work focused mainly on drilling and assessments
related to the Froome zone.
Financing activities
During  the  second  quarter,  the  Company  completed  an  equity  offering,  which  provided  proceeds  of
$37.5 million net of commissions and fees. There was no significant financing activity in the second
quarter of 2015.
For  the  six  months  to  June  2016,  in  addition  to  the  equity  offering,  $50  million  was  drawn  on  the
revolving credit facility to finance the March 31, 2016 repayment of the $48 million due on the 6.5%
Convertible Debentures assumed with the acquisition of Brigus. Total interest paid for the six months to
June 2016 was $4.5 million on the 5.75% Convertible Debentures, the 6.5% Convertible Debentures,
and the revolving credit facility.
For  the  six  months  to  June  2015,  the  Company  received  $75  million  in  gross  proceeds  from  the
issuance  of  the  5.75%  convertible  debentures,  and  repaid  $40  million  of  debt,  associated  with  the
outstanding balance of its revolving credit facility. A release of restricted cash of $9.8 million in relation
to a reduction in collateral on a reclamation bond at Black Fox also contributed to positive cash flows
provided by financing activities for the first six months of 2015. An additional $1.6 million was released
in 2016.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
FINANCIAL CONDITION REVIEW
A key financial objective is to make sure the Company has access to funds to achieve its medium term
(three year) objectives. The Company’s strategy is to ensure liquidity is available to finance exploration
and development requirements at its mining operations and growth projects as well as to repay financial
obligations. The Company manages its liquidity by ensuring that, even in a low gold price environment,
its operations can manage spending and provide adequate cash flow.
Key financial ratios the Company uses to assess new growth opportunities and to determine how much
debt the Company can take on are shown in the net asset table below.

As at the date of this MD&A, the Company had 187,733,883 common shares outstanding, the total
number of options outstanding was 6,282,710 of which 3,290,697 are exercisable.
Current ratio is calculated as ( cash and cash equivalents + other current asset) ÷ (current liabilities
+ short-term debt) .
Total liabilities-to-equity is calculated as total liabilities ÷ total equity.
Debt-to-total capitalization is calculated as (short-term debt + long-term debt) ÷ (short-term debt +
long-term debt + total equity) .
The Company’s net assets (equity) as at June 30, 2016 were $657 million compared to $649 million as
at December 31, 2015, an increase of $8 million. The equity raise completed in the second quarter more
than  offset  the  net  loss  for  the  first  six  months  of  the  year.  The  current  ratio  has  increased  from
December 31, 2015 as a result of increased cash on hand due to the equity offering and lower current
liabilities due to the payment of annual royalties and income taxes in Mexico during the first quarter of
2016.

PRIMERO MINING CORP. 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
The  6.5%  Convertible  Debenture  was  repaid  during  the  first  quarter,  through  a  drawdown  of  the
revolving credit facility. The credit facility obligation is now classified as current and thus total short-term
debt at June 30, 2016 is similar to that at December 31, 2015
The  Company’s  objective  is  to  manage  financial  risk  by  maintaining  a  conservative  balance  sheet.
Liquidity at June 30, 2016 included cash and cash equivalents of $54.5 million and an undrawn amount
on its revolving credit facility of $25.0 million.
The revolving credit facility matures on May 23, 2017. The Company expects to renew this facility, but in
the  event  full  repayment  is  required  cash  generated  by  operations  may  not  be  sufficient  to  repay
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility in full at maturity. The Company has a plan to
improve production at San Dimas and will focus on cost reduction at both operations to increase cash
flows. In addition the Company may seek other sources of financing if renewal of the revolving credit
facility is not available on terms acceptable to the Company.

The  Company  does  not  have  any  off-balance  sheet  arrangements,  other  than  the  availability  of  the
undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility of $25.0 million at June 30, 2016. The revolving credit
facility is secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets and contains customary covenants and
default clauses typical to this type of facility.
20
PRIMERO MINING CORP. 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
Pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility, the Company is required to maintain the following
financial covenants:
Covenant
Tangible net worth (in $millions) 1
Net debt leverage ratio 2
Senior net debt leverage ratio 3
Interest coverage ratio 4
Requirement
=/> $586  $
=/< 3.5:1

0.9:1 
6.0:1

4
Tangible net worth represents equity less goodwill and other intangible assets.
Net  debt  leverage  ratio  represents  total  liabilities, less  trade  payables  incurred  in  the  ordinary
course of business less unrestricted cash divided by rolling 4 quarter EBITDA, as defined in the
credit agreement.
Senior net debt leverage ratio represents that portion of net debt that ranks pari passu with or in
priority to the line of credit divided by rolling 4 quarter EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement.
Interest coverage ratio represents earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization divided
by interest expense.
As at June 30, 2016, the Company was compliant with these covenants. The Company closely monitors
the compliance to these covenants as a breach of a covenant would be considered an event of default
under the credit agreement which, if not addressed, would entitle the lenders to make the borrowings
under the revolving credit facility immediately due and payable and also causing borrowings under the
5.75%  convertible  debentures  to  become  immediately  due  and  payable.  Being  able  to  remain  in
compliance with the covenants is dependent upon many factors including, but not limited to, commodity
prices, exchange rates, and levels of gold production. Adverse changes in one or more of these factors
could negatively impact the Company’s ability to remain in compliance.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
APA Ruling
On  October  4,  2012,  the  Company’s  Mexican  subsidiary,  Primero  Empresa  Minera,  S.A.  de  C.V.
(“PEM”) received a ruling (the “APA Ruling”) from the Mexican tax authority, Servicio de Administración
Tributaria (the “SAT”) which confirmed the appropriate price for sales of silver under the Amended and
Restated Silver Purchase Agreement. Under Mexican tax law, an APA Ruling is generally applicable
for  up  to  a  five  year  period  (which  in  the  Company’s  case,  covered  the  year  in  which  the  ruling
application was filed, the immediately preceding year and the three subsequent years) . The Company’s
APA Ruling covered the five years ending December 31, 2014.
In February 2016, PEM received a legal claim from the Mexican tax authority seeking to nullify the APA.
The  legal  claim  initiated  does  not  identify  any  different  basis  for  paying  taxes,  nor  have  any  tax
reassessments been received from the SAT. The Company intends to vigorously defend the validity of
its APA. The Company has filed procedural and substantive responses to the claim. The procedural
response is a challenge against the admission of the SAT’s claim. The substantive response contains
the Company’s response to the SAT’s claim. If the SAT is successful in retroactively nullifying the APA,
the SAT may seek to audit and reassess PEM in respect of its sales of silver in connection with the
Silver Purchase Agreement for 2010 through 2014. The amount of additional taxes for which the SAT
could reassess PEM for the tax years 2010 through 2014 on the silver sold in connection with the Silver
Purchase  Agreement  cannot  be  reasonably  estimated  at  this  time  but  if  the  SAT  is  successful  in
retroactively  nullifying  the  APA  and  issuing  reassessments,  it  would  likely  have  a  material  adverse
effect  on  the  Company’s  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  and  cash  flows.  PEM  would  have
rights of appeal in connection with any reassessments.
The Company believes that it is entitled to rely on the APA which is legally binding in respect of the
Company’s 2010 through 2014 taxation years. The Company obtained the ruling transparently and in
good  faith.  Primero  believes  the  APA  should  not  be  the  subject  of  challenge  by  a  government
administration installed upon the change of government after the APA was duly issued. Primero has
and will continue to invest millions of dollars in the local Mexican economy and intends to continue
legal action aimed at ensuring that the Mexican tax authority respects the rule of law.
For 2015 and the six months of 2016, the Company continued to record its revenue from the sale of
silver for purposes of Mexican tax accounting in a manner consistent with the APA on the basis that the
applicable facts and laws have not changed. The Company’s legal and financial advisors continue to
believe that the Company has filed its tax returns compliant with applicable Mexican law. To the extent
the SAT determines that the appropriate price of silver sales under the Silver Purchase Agreement is
significantly different from the realized price and while PEM would have rights of appeal in connection
with  any  reassessments,  it  is  likely  to  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company’s  business,
financial condition and results of operations.

PRIMERO MINING CORP. 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
San Dimas
In 2004, the then owner of the San Dimas mine entered into an agreement to sell all the silver produced
at  the  San  Dimas  mine  for  a  term  of  25  years  to  Silver  Wheaton  Caymans  in  return  for  an  upfront
payment  comprising  cash  and  shares  of  Silver  Wheaton  Corp.  (“Silver  Wheaton”)  and  a  per  ounce
payment of the lesser of $3.90 (adjusted for annual inflation) , or the market price. The Company was
required to assume this agreement, with amendments, when it acquired the San Dimas mine in 2010.
The amendments provided that for each of the first four years after the acquisition date (i.e., until August
5, 2014) , the first 3.5 million ounces per annum of silver produced by the San Dimas mine, plus 50% of
the excess silver above this amount, must be sold to Silver Wheaton Caymans at the lesser of $4.04 per
ounce (adjusted by 1% per year) and market prices. From August 6, 2014 and for the life of the mine, the
first 6.0 million ounces per annum of silver produced by the San Dimas mine, plus 50% of the excess
silver above this amount, must be sold to Silver Wheaton Caymans at the lesser of $4.20 per ounce
(adjusted by 1% per year) and market prices. All silver not sold to Silver Wheaton Caymans is available
to be sold by the Company at market prices.
Black Fox Complex
On November 9, 2010, Brigus entered into a gold purchase agreement with Sandstorm to sell a portion
of future gold production from the Black Fox mine and the adjoining Pike River property for an upfront
cash payment of $56.3 million and ongoing per ounce payments of the lesser of $500 per ounce of gold
(subject to an inflationary adjustment beginning in 2013, not to exceed 2% per year) and market prices.
On November 5, 2012, Brigus elected to repurchase a portion of the stream by paying $24.4 million to
Sandstorm, which resulted in Sandstorm being entitled to 8% of the future production at the Black Fox
mine and 6.3% at the Pike River property at the same contract gold price. The Company was required to
assume the gold purchase agreement when it acquired Brigus in March 2014.
Cerro del Gallo
The Company has potential future financial commitments related to its acquisition in December 2013 of
Goldcorp’s 30.8% interest in the Cerro del Gallo project. These commitments are contingent payments
based on meeting certain milestones or market conditions. The contingent payments include:
•
•
•
•
$8 million after achieving commercial production on the phase I heap leach operation (the “First
Contingent Payment”) ;
$14  million  on  announcement  of  a  decision  by  Primero  to construct  a  carbon-in-leach  mill  for
Phase II (“the Second Contingent Payment”) ;
$5 million if the date of the First Contingent Payment occurs before December 19, 2018 and the
gold price averages  $1,500  or  more per ounce for a consecutive 30 day period within one year
following the date of the First Contingent Payment, and not later than December 19, 2018;
$5 million if the date of the Second Contingent Payment occurs before December 19, 2018 and the
gold price averages  $1,500  or  more per ounce for a consecutive 30 day period within one year
following the date of the Second Contingent Payment, and not later than December 19, 2018.
23
PRIMERO MINING CORP. 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
The Company has decided to defer a construction decision for Cerro del Gallo due to current economic
conditions.  The  timing  of  construction  will  depend  on  market  conditions  and  project  returns.  The
estimated  capital  cost  for  phase  1  of  this  project  is  over  $165  million  and  construction  would  take
approximately  18  months.  Once  completed,  Cerro  del  Gallo  would  be  expected  to  produce
approximately 95,000 gold equivalent ounces on an annual basis.
Other
In July 2016, the Company and certain officers were served with a class action lawsuit that was filed
earlier in the year in the State of California seeking to recover damages for investors in the Company’s
common shares under the U.S. federal securities laws. The Company will vigorously defend this class
action lawsuit.
Dividend Report and Policy
The  Company  has  not  paid  any  dividends  since  incorporation  and  currently  has  no  plans  to  pay
dividends.

When the Company reaches its annual threshold for deliveries under the silver purchase
agreement, the Company realizes silver sales at spot prices, increasing both revenue and net
income. Revenue in Q3 2015 and Q3 2014 included $12.8 million and $5.9 million, respectively, of
silver sales at spot prices.

In Q2 2015, silver sales were lower because of the loss of PEM’s export license and higher in Q3
2015 because of the subsequent reinstatement.
 
In Q4 2015 and Q4 2014, impairments of $104 million and $110 million, respectively, were
recorded against mining interests at Black Fox and Cerro del Gallo.
 
In Q3 2014, an impairment of $99 million for goodwill was recorded related to the value on the
acquisition of Brigus.
 
General and administrative expenses include share-based compensation which historically has
fluctuated based on the share price of the Company.
 
In Q2 2016 the Company incurred $0.4 million of mark-to-market losses on its recently issued
common share purchase warrants classified as a financial liability. These warrants are marked-to-
market each quarter.
 
In Q1 2015 the Company incurred $3.6 million of transaction costs on the issuance of the 5.75%
Convertible Debentures. These debentures are marked-to-market each quarter.
 
Finance expense varies depending on the amount of debt held by the Company.
 
Other income (expenses) largely includes foreign exchange gains or losses from the revaluation of
certain local denominated assets and liabilities at San Dimas and Black Fox to U.S. dollars.
 
Income tax expense is impacted by the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on its Mexico peso
denominated non-cash deferred income taxes, which were significant in certain periods, such as
Q2 2016, Q3 2015 and Q4 2014.
NON-GAAP MEASURES
The Company has included certain non-GAAP performance measures throughout this document. These
performance measures are employed by management to assess the Company’s operating and financial
performance  and  to  assist  in  business  decision-making.  The  Company  believes  that,  in  addition  to
conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors and other stakeholders
use this information to evaluate the Company’s operating and financial performance; however, these
non-GAAP  performance  measures  do  not  have  any  standardized  meaning.  Accordingly,  these
performance measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Cash costs per gold ounce
The Company has included the non-GAAP performance measures of total cash costs per gold ounce on
a gold equivalent ounce and by-product basis, throughout this document. The Company reports total
cash costs on a production basis. In the gold mining industry, this is a common performance measure
but  does  not  have  any  standardized  meaning.  In  presenting  cash  costs  on  a  production  basis,  the
Company follows the original recommendations made by the Gold Institute Production Cost Standard.
The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP,
certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company’s performance and ability to generate
cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in
isolation  or  as  a  substitute  for  measures  of  performance  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  The
following table provides a reconciliation of total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce and total cash
costs per gold ounce on a by-product basis to operating expenses (the nearest GAAP measure) per the

By-product silver credits are calculated as silver ounces produced multiplied by the average realized
silver price ( (A) X (B) ) in the table above.
Management uses total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce and by-product cash costs per gold ounce
to  monitor  the  operating  performance  of  its  mines  and  to  assess  the  attractiveness  of  potential
acquisition  targets.  Management  also  believes  these  measures  provide  investors  and  analysts  with
useful  information  about  the  Company’s  underlying  cash  costs  of  operations  and  the  impact  of  by-
product credits on the Company’s cost structure is a relevant metric used to understand the Company’s
operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When deriving the production costs associated
with an ounce of gold, the Company includes byproduct credits as the Company considers that the cost
to produce the gold is reduced as a result of the by-product sales supplementary to the gold production
process, thereby allowing management and the Company’s other stakeholders to assess the net costs
of gold production.
All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce
In  June  2013,  the  World  Gold  Council  (“WGC”)  published  a  guidance  note  on  non-GAAP  metrics
available to companies in the gold industry to use to report their costs in an effort to encourage improved
understanding  of  the  total  costs  associated  with  mining  an  ounce  of  gold.  The  WGC  is  a  market
development  organization  for  the  gold  industry  and  is  an  association  whose  membership  comprises
leading gold mining companies, including Primero. The WGC is not a regulatory industry organization.
The WGC worked with its member companies to develop the definition of “all-in sustaining costs per
gold  ounce”,  which  it  believes  to  be  helpful  to  investors,  governments,  local  communities  and  other
stakeholders in understanding the economics of gold mining.
The Company has adopted the reporting of “all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce”. This metric is a non-
GAAP performance measure. The Company reports this measure on a gold ounces produced basis.
The  Company  presents  all-in  sustaining  costs  because  it  believes  that  it  more  fully  defines  the  total
current  cost  associated  with  producing  gold.  The  Company  also  believes  that  this  measure  allows
investors and other stakeholders of the Company to better understand its costs of producing gold and
better assess the Company’s ability to generate cash flow from current operations. Management also
uses all-in sustaining costs in evaluating the efficiency of its operations because it believes that IFRS
measures, such as operating expenses, do not capture all of the costs incurred to discover, develop,
and sustain gold production. As the measure seeks to reflect the full cost of gold production from current
operations,  it  does  not  include  capital  expenditures  attributable  to  development  projects  or  mine
expansions, exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects, income tax payments and
financing costs. In addition, the calculation of all-in sustaining costs does not include depreciation and
depletion  expense  as  it  does  not  reflect  the  impact  of  expenditures  incurred  in  prior  periods.  Even
though  this  measure  is  not  representative  of  all  of  the  Company’s  cash  expenditures,  management
believes  that  it  is  a  useful  measure  in  allowing  it  to  analyze  the  efficiency  of  its  current  gold  mining
operations.

All-in  sustaining  costs  adjust  “  cash  costs,  net  of  by-product  credits”,  for  corporate  general  and
administrative  expenses,  reclamation  cost  accretion  and  sustaining  capital  expenditures.  Corporate
general  and  administrative  expenses  are  included  as  a  line  item  on  the  Company’s  statement  of
operations.  Sustaining  capital  expenditures  and  reclamation  cost  accretion  are  not  line  items  on  the

Sustaining capital expenditures are defined as those capital expenditures which do not increase annual
gold  ounce  production  at  a  mine  site  and  exclude  all  expenditures  at  the  Company’s  projects  and
certain expenditures at the Company’s operating sites which are deemed expansionary in nature.
Reclamation cost accretion represents the growth in the Company’s decommissioning liability due to
the passage of time. This amount does not reflect cash outflows but it is considered to be representative

Adjusted net income (loss)
The Company has included the non-GAAP performance measures of adjusted net income (loss) and
adjusted net income (loss) per share, throughout this document. Adjusted net income (loss) excludes
the following from net earnings:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Impairment charges (reversals) related to mining interests and other non-current assets;
Foreign exchange impacts on its Mexican peso denominated deferred tax liabilities;
Unrealized gains (losses) on non-hedge derivative instruments;
Mark-to-market gains (losses) on convertible debenture;
Gains/losses and other one-time costs relating to acquisitions/dispositions;
Costs related to restructuring/severance arrangements, care and maintenance and demobilization
costs, and other expenses not related to current operations;
Costs incurred to bring production to its normal capacity.
Neither  of  these  non-GAAP  performance  measures  has  any  standardized  meaning  and  is  therefore
unlikely to be comparable to other measures presented by other issuers. The Company believes that, in
addition  to  conventional  measures  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  certain  investors  use  this
information to evaluate the Company’s performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is
intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for  measures  of  performance  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  The  following  table  provides  a

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
As at June 30, 2016, the Company’s related parties include its subsidiaries, associates over which it
exercises significant influence, and key management personnel. During its normal course of operations,
the Company enters into transactions with its related parties for goods and services.
Other than payments to key management, there were no further related party transactions for the three
and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016  that  have  not  been  disclosed  in  the  Company’s  condensed
consolidated interim financial statements.
RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED
The Company has reviewed new and revised accounting pronouncements that have been issued but
are  not  yet  effective  and  determined  that  the  following  may  have  an  impact  in  the  future  on  the
Company.  The  Company  is  currently  evaluating  the  impact  of  adopting  these  standards  on  its
consolidated financial statements.
In  May  2014,  the  IASB  issued  IFRS  15  -  Revenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers  (IFRS  15)  which
supersedes existing standards and interpretations including IAS 18, Revenue. IFRS 15 establishes a
single five-step model framework for determining the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue
and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer. The standard is effective for annual periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
Primero will be required to adopt IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments” on January 1, 2018. The new standard
replaces the current multiple classification and measurement models for financial assets and liabilities
with a single model that has only two classification categories: amortized cost and fair value. It also
provides a new impairment model and includes a substantially reformed approach to hedge accounting.
In  January  2016,  the  IASB  issued  IFRS  16,  Leases  (IFRS  16)  .  IFRS  16  is  effective  for  periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. IFRS 16 eliminates the current
dual model for lessees, which distinguishes between on-balance sheet finance leases and off-balance
sheet operating leases. Instead, there is a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar to
current finance lease accounting for lessees.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The Company’s management makes judgements in its process of applying the Company’s accounting
policies  in  the  preparation  of  its  unaudited  condensed  interim  consolidated  financial  statements.  In
addition,  the  preparation  of  the  financial  data  requires  that  the  Company’s  management  make
assumptions and estimates of the impacts from uncertain future events on the carrying amounts of the
Company’s  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  and  the  reported  amounts  of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates as
the estimation process is inherently uncertain. Estimates are reviewed on an ongoing basis based on
historical  experience  and  other  factors  that  are  considered  to  be  relevant  under  the  circumstances.
Revisions to estimates and the resulting impacts on the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and
liabilities are accounted for prospectively. The critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements
applied  in  the  preparation  of  the  Company’s  unaudited  condensed  interim  consolidated  financial
statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are consistent with those applied and
disclosed  in  notes  2  and  3  to  the  Company’s  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  year
ended December 31, 2015.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company’s financial instruments at June 30, 2016 consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade and
other receivables, restricted cash, an equity investment in Fortune Bay Corp. (“Fortune Bay”) , trade and
other payables, financial lease liabilities, the convertible debentures, warrant liability and the revolving
credit facility.
At  June  30,  2016,  the  carrying  amounts  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  trade  and  other  receivables,
restricted cash and trade and other payables are considered to be a reasonable approximation of their
fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair value of the financial lease liability approximate their
carrying value as the interest rate implicit in the leases approximate current market rates.
The  fair  values  of  the  5.75%  Convertible  Debentures  and  the  warrant  liability  are  based  on  the
corresponding market price of the debenture and warrant on the TSX Exchange. Gains and losses from
fluctuations  in  the  market  price  are  recognized  in  the  statement  of  operations  and  comprehensive
income (loss) as mark-to-market gain or loss on convertible debentures and warrants.
The  levels  in  the  fair  value  hierarchy  that  the  Company’s  financial  assets  and  liabilities  that  are
measured and recognized at a fair value on a recurring basis are as follows:

Fortune  Bay  is  a  publicly  listed  company  and  the  fair value  is  based  on  the  trading  price  of  its
shares as at the date of the statement of financial position.
Fair  value  is  calculated  based  on  the  market  price  of  the convertible  debenture  on  the  TSX
Exchange as at the date of the statement of financial position.
Financial  instruments  and  non-financial  contracts  may  contain  embedded  derivatives,  which  are
required to be accounted for separately at fair value as derivatives when the risks and characteristics of
the embedded derivatives are not closely related to those of their host contract and the host contract is
not carried at fair value. The Company regularly assesses its financial instruments and non-financial
contracts  to  ensure  that  any  embedded  derivatives  are  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  its  policy.
There  were  no  material  embedded  derivatives  requiring  separate  accounting  at  June  30,  2016  or

Readers are cautioned that any controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Due to the inherent limitations in all controls systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all
control  issues  and  instances  of  fraud,  if  any,  within  the  Company  have  been  prevented  or  detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented
by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by unauthorized override
of the control. The design of any control system also is based in part upon certain assumptions about
the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a
cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Gallo mine,
expectations regarding currency fluctuations,
title disputes relating to the Company’s properties,
the timing and possible outcome of pending litigation, and
the ability of the Company to maintain effective control over financial reporting.
Such forward-looking information is necessarily based upon a number of factors and assumptions that,
while considered reasonable by the Company as of the date of such statements, are inherently subject
to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. The assumptions
made by the Company in preparing the forward looking information contained in this MD&A, which may
prove to be incorrect, include, but are not limited to: the expectations and beliefs of management; the
specific assumptions set forth above in this MD&A; assumptions relating to the existence of companies
that may wish to dispose of producing or near-term producing precious metals assets; that there are no
significant  disruptions  affecting  operations,  whether  due  to  labour  disruptions,  supply  disruptions,
damage to or loss of equipment, whether as a result of natural occurrences including flooding, political
changes, title issues, intervention by local landowners, loss of permits, or environmental concerns or
otherwise; that there are no disruptions in the supply of power from the Las Truchas power generation
facility, whether as a result of damage to the facility or unusually limited amounts of precipitation; that
development and expansion at San Dimas and Black Fox proceeds on a basis consistent with current
expectations and the Company does not change its development and exploration plans; that the Cerro
del Gallo and Grey Fox projects will be developed in accordance with the Company’s plans; that the
exchange  rate  between  the  Canadian  dollar,  Mexican  peso  and  the  United  States  dollar  remains
consistent  with  current  levels;  that  prices  for  gold  and  silver  remain  consistent  with  the  Company's
expectations;  that  prices  for  key  mining  supplies,  including  labour  costs  and  consumables,  remain
consistent  with  the  Company's  current  expectations;  that  production  meets  expectations;  that  the
Company’s  current  estimates  of  mineral  reserves,  mineral  resources,  exploration  potential,  mineral
grades and mineral recovery are accurate; that the Company identifies higher grade veins in sufficient
quantities of minable ore in the Central Block and Sinaloa Graben; that the geology and vein structures
in the Sinaloa Graben are as expected; that the Company completes the proposed tunnels and access
routes;  that  the  ratio  of  gold  to  silver  price  is  maintained  in  accordance  with  the  Company’s
expectations; that there are no material variations in the current tax and regulatory environment; that the
APA is not nullified and that the Company pays taxes on a similar basis for future periods; that Mexican
tax laws relative to the APA ruling remain unchanged; that the Company will continue to pay taxes in
Mexico based on realized prices of silver; that the Company will receive required permits and access to
surface rights; that the Company can access financing, appropriate equipment and sufficient labour and
that the political environment within Mexico will continue to support the development of environmentally
safe mining projects.
No  assurance  can  be  given  as  to  whether  these  assumptions  will  prove  to  be  correct.  These
assumptions should be considered carefully by investors. Investors are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on the forward-looking information and statements or the assumptions on which the Company’s
forward-looking information and statements are based.
Forward-looking information is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual
events or results to differ from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. Such risks include, but
are  not  limited  to:  the  volatility  of  prices  of  gold  and  other  metals;  uncertainty  of  mineral  reserves,
mineral resources, exploration potential, mineral grades and mineral recovery estimates; uncertainty of
future  production,  delays  in  completion  of  the  mill  expansion  at  San  Dimas,  exploration  and
development plans; insufficient capital to complete development and exploration plans; risks associated
with developing the Cerro del Gallo and Grey Fox projects; currency fluctuations; financing of additional
capital  requirements;  cost  of  exploration  and  development  programs;  inability  to  complete  proposed
tunnels  and  access  routes  or  other  development;  mining  risks,  including  unexpected  formations  and
cave-ins,  which  delay  operations  or  prevent  extraction  of  material;  risks  associated  with  foreign
operations; governmental and environmental regulation; tax law changes; the ability of the Company to
continue to pay taxes based on the realized price of silver; the volatility of the Company's stock price;
landowner dissatisfaction and disputes; delays in permitting; damage to equipment; labour disruptions;
interruptions.  Should  one  or  more  of  these  risks  and  uncertainties  materialize,  or  should  underlying
assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in forward-looking
statements.

PRIMERO MINING CORP. 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
Investors are advised to carefully review and consider the risk factors identified in this MD&A under the
heading “Risk and uncertainties”, and in the Company’s Annual Information Form for the year ended
December 31, 2015 as filed on SEDAR, for a discussion of the factors that could cause the Company’s
actual  results,  performance  and  achievements  to  be  materially  different  from  any  anticipated  future
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Investors
are further cautioned that the foregoing list of assumptions and risk factors is not exhaustive and it is
recommended  that  prospective  investors  consult  the  more  complete  discussion  of  the  Company’s
business,  financial  condition  and  prospects  that  is  included  in  this  MD&A.  The  forward-looking
information and statements contained in this MD&A are made as of the date hereof and, accordingly,
are subject to change after such date.
The  Company  does  not  undertake  to  update  any  forward-looking  information,  except  as,  and  to  the
extent,  required  by  applicable  securities  laws.  The  forward-looking  statements  contained  herein  are
expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.
Cautionary Note for United States Investors
The disclosure in this MD&A uses terms that comply with reporting standards in Canada and certain
estimates are made in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 “Standards of Disclosure for Mineral
Projects” (“NI 43-101”) . NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that
establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information
concerning mineral projects. Unless otherwise indicated, all reserve and resource estimates contained
in or incorporated by reference in this AIF have been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101. These
standards  differ  significantly  from  the  requirements  of  the  United  States  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) , SEC Industry Guide  7  as  amended  (“Guide  7”)  and  reserve  and  resource
information contained herein and incorporated by reference herein may not be comparable to similar
information disclosed by U.S. companies.
This  MD&A  uses  the  terms  “Mineral  Reserve”,  “Proven  Mineral  Reserve”  and  “Probable  Mineral
Reserve” which are terms defined in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum which
were  adopted  by  the  Canadian  Securities  Administrators’  NI  43-101.  Under  SEC  standards,
mineralization may not be classified as a “reserve” unless the determination has been made that the
mineralization  could  be  economically  and  legally  produced  or  extracted  at  the  time  the  reserve
determination is made. Among other things, all necessary permits would be required to be in hand or
issuance  imminent  in  order  to  classify  mineralized  material  as  reserves  under  the  SEC  standards.
Accordingly, Mineral Reserve estimates contained in this MD&A may not qualify as “reserves” under
SEC standards. In addition, disclosure of “contained ounces” is permitted disclosure under Canadian
regulations; however, the SEC only permits issuers to report mineralization as in place tonnage and
grade without reference to unit measures.

PRIMERO MINING CORP. 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
This  MD&A  also  uses  the  terms  “Measured  Mineral  Resources”,  “Indicated  Mineral  Resources”  and
“Inferred Mineral Resources”. We advise investors that while such terms are recognized and required by
Canadian securities regulations, the SEC does not recognize them. Inferred Mineral Resources have a
great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal
feasibility.  It  cannot  be  assumed  that  all  or  any  part  of  an  Inferred  Mineral  Resource  will  ever  be
upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian regulations, estimates of Inferred Mineral Resources
may not form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies, except in limited circumstances. Mineral
Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Investors are
cautioned  not  to  assume  that  all  or  any  part  of  Measured  Mineral  Resources  or  Indicated  Mineral
Resources will ever be converted into Mineral Reserves. Investors are also cautioned not to assume
that any part or all of an Inferred Mineral Resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable.
NI 43-101 also permits the inclusion of disclosure regarding the potential quantity and grade, expressed
as ranges, of a target for further exploration provided that the disclosure (i) states with equal prominence
that the potential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature, that there has been insufficient exploration
to define a Mineral Resource and that it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being
delineated as a Mineral Resource, and (ii) states the basis on which the disclosed potential quantity and
grade  has  been  determined.  Disclosure  regarding  exploration  potential  has  been  included  in  this
MD&A. United States investors are cautioned that disclosure of such exploration potential is conceptual
in nature by definition and there is no assurance that exploration of the mineral potential identified will
result in any category of NI 43-101 Mineral Resources being identified.
For  the  above  reasons,  information  contained  in  this  MD&A  may  not  be  comparable  to  similar
information disclosed by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the
United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.
