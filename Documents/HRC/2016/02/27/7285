 * Late submission. 
</p>

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>16/22 and decision 17/119, in which the Council requested the secretariat to provide an 
</p>
<p>annual written update on the operations of the Voluntary Fund for Participation in the 
</p>
<p>Universal Periodic Review and on the resources available to it. As indicated in the previous 
</p>
<p>update report (A/HRC/25/36), in an effort to consolidate information related to the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review, and on the basis of Council decision 17/119, the secretariat is 
</p>
<p>aligning the timing of submission of the reports on the activities supported through the two 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review trust funds, namely, the Voluntary Fund for Participation and the 
</p>
<p>Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance in the Implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Universal Periodic Review. As such, as of 2015, both annual reports are expected to be 
</p>
<p>submitted to the June session of the Council. The present report provides an overview of 
</p>
<p>contributions and expenditures as at 31 December 2014, together with a description of 
</p>
<p>activities funded since the previous update.

<p>a  Includes disbursements and obligations. 
</p>
<p>3. Since the establishment of the Fund, 15 countries have made financial contributions. 
</p>
<p>4. Since the Fund has not enjoyed a predictable pattern of income, substantial resources 
</p>
<p>are systematically kept as a reserve for future activities; the secretariat of the Fund has been 
</p>
<p>responsive to all requests, in line with the Fund&#8217;s terms of reference, to enable participation. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Travel to meetings 
</b></p>
<p>5. Under the terms of reference of the Fund, financial support for travel to meetings is 
</p>
<p>made available to developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to cover 
</p>
<p>travel to Geneva by one official government representative in order to participate: 
</p>
<p>(a) In sessions of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review during 
</p>
<p>which the representative&#8217;s country is considered; 
</p>
<p>(b) In plenary sessions of the Human Rights Council during which the outcome 
</p>
<p>of the review of the representative&#8217;s country is adopted. 
</p>
<p>6. The Fund also provides for the travel of official representatives (one per delegation) 
</p>
<p>of developing countries, in particular least developed countries, that are members of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council and do not have a permanent mission in Geneva, to act as 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (namely, members of the troika). 
</p>
<p>7. In addition to travel costs, the Fund also provides for the payment of a daily 
</p>
<p>subsistence allowance at the rate applicable to Geneva at the time of travel. Under the 
</p>
<p>standing official provisions for such travel, a Government formally requesting this 
</p>
<p>assistance would be advised of the official entitlements for travel and daily subsistence 
</p>
<p>allowance in connection with the required itinerary, which would be reimbursed upon 
</p>
<p>completion of the travel and provision of the necessary supporting documentation. This 
</p>
<p>arrangement, however, proved onerous for many requesting Governments, and since they 
</p>
<p>were unable to submit the claims documenting their travels they were not reimbursed. In an 
</p>
<p>effort to address this issue, since the seventeenth session of the Working Group on the 
</p>
<p>Universal Periodic Review (21 October&#8211;1 November 2013), the secretariat has arranged to 
</p>
<p>provide the economy class tickets prior to travel, and payment of the daily subsistence 
</p>
<p>allowance upon arrival in Geneva, thereby alleviating most of the difficulties associated 
</p>
<p>with retroactive reimbursement of expenses. 
</p>
<p>8. Direct ticketing does, however, require more advance planning since Governments 
</p>
<p>are required to designate their delegate with lead time sufficient to enable the secretariat to 
</p>
<p>make the travel arrangements and issue the ticket in accordance with the United Nations 
</p>
<p>official travel policies. In cases where such direct ticketing is not possible, the previous 
</p>
<p>arrangement for retroactive reimbursement of travel expenses is still provided. 
</p>
<p>9. A total of 15 States reviewed in 2014 requested financial assistance for travel to the 
</p>
<p>sessions of the Working Group at which they were reviewed. Of those, eight were least 
</p>
<p>developed countries or small island developing States. Five States, of which four were least 
</p>
<p>developed countries or small island developing States, requested financial assistance for 
</p>
<p>travel to attend the session of the Human Rights Council for the adoption of the outcome of 
</p>
<p>their review. Of the 15 States, 14 have already received reimbursement for their 
</p>
<p>expenditures. </p>


<p>10. Table 2 below shows the breakdown of financial assistance and annual expenditures, 
</p>
<p>complete with the amount authorized, status of reimbursement and total commitments to 
</p>
<p>date with regard to the financial assistance provided for the travel of government delegates 
</p>
<p>to Geneva.

<p><b> B. Training 
</b></p>
<p>11. The terms of reference of the Fund allow the financing of briefings prior to the 
</p>
<p>sessions of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review to assist countries in the 
</p>
<p>preparatory process. These briefings usually consist of plenary segments and breakout 
</p>
<p>group discussions during which the policies, procedures and modalities of the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review are examined, information is exchanged, and good practices and lessons 
</p>
<p>learned are discussed concerning the organization of national consultations, the setting up 
</p>
<p>of interministerial coordination mechanisms, the drafting of national reports and 
</p>
<p>participation in the interactive dialogues held by the Working Group and the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council in plenary session. 
</p>
<p>12. Increased efforts were invested in keeping States engaged in cooperation with the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review mechanism. This relates in particular to small island developing 
</p>
<p>States and least developed countries with no representation in Geneva. Targeted outreach 
</p>
<p>activities in 2014 involved bilateral meetings with the embassies of those countries in New 
</p>
<p>York (10&#8211;14 February) and Brussels (26&#8211;28 November) and a training seminar in 
</p>
<p>Casablanca, Morocco (9&#8211;11 December). 
</p>
<p>13. The bilateral briefings in New York and Brussels were part of a broad strategy to 
</p>
<p>engage countries with limited human capacity through different entry points. The New 
</p>
<p>York mission was part of a set of briefings that were initiated in 2009 as outreach activities 
</p>
<p>to inform delegations about the universal periodic review process and mechanism. The 
</p>
<p>initial format of the briefings was revisited in 2012 to focus on bilateral meetings at the 
</p>
<p>Permanent Missions of selected small island developing States and least developed 
</p>
<p>countries, including a general meeting with all interested delegations. In February 2014, 
</p>
<p>meetings were requested with the Permanent Missions of Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, 
</p>
<p>Fiji, the Gambia, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, 
</p>
<p>Micronesia (Federated States of), Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Saint Lucia and </p>


<p>Suriname. Meetings were subsequently held with the delegations of those countries, with 
</p>
<p>the exception of Dominica, Fiji, the Gambia and Nauru.  
</p>
<p>14. The bilateral and tailored nature of each briefing was highly appreciated and positive 
</p>
<p>feedback was received from the delegations concerned. While in most cases the New York 
</p>
<p>representation was in charge of relations with the United Nations, including in Geneva, in 
</p>
<p>some cases Permanent Representatives to the United Nations were based in Brussels. It was 
</p>
<p>found that in the past, owing to proximity and ease of contact, engaging Brussels-based 
</p>
<p>embassies of States increased the chances of securing the consistent engagement of those 
</p>
<p>States and facilitated follow-up to their national obligations. Meetings were held with 
</p>
<p>representatives of Guyana, Malawi, Sao Tome and Principe and Seychelles, and with the 
</p>
<p>representative of the Embassies of the Eastern Caribbean States and Missions to the 
</p>
<p>European Union in respect of Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the 
</p>
<p>Grenadines.  
</p>
<p>15. While in Brussels, OHCHR representatives took the opportunity to hold a series of 
</p>
<p>information meetings with various divisions of the European External Action Service. 
</p>
<p>During the course of those meetings, participants expressed a keen interest in the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review. They expressed interest in what they referred to as &#8220;horizontal issues&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>namely, coordination between agencies and delegations on human rights issues, and in 
</p>
<p>understanding better the role and involvement of civil society organizations throughout the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review process. 
</p>
<p>16. In follow-up to the seminar organized in Mauritius in July 2013 (see A/HRC/25/36, 
</p>
<p>paras. 12 and 19) a seminar was held in Casablanca from 9 to 11 December, focused on 
</p>
<p>methods of work and modalities of engagement of least developed countries and the small 
</p>
<p>island developing States with the Human Rights Council and the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>A total of 37 officials, representing 20 countries, travelled from Geneva or their respective 
</p>
<p>capital to participate in the event. Staff from the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Vice-President of the Council 
</p>
<p>participated in the briefing as resource persons. 
</p>
<p>17. The Casablanca seminar provided an opportunity for French-speaking States to 
</p>
<p>deepen their knowledge of the Human Rights Council and the universal periodic review and 
</p>
<p>to increase their skills through a simulation exercise on the analysis of recommendations 
</p>
<p>and determination of position by States under review. It also included an exercise in which 
</p>
<p>delegates were able to take on the role of troika member, which was perceived as an 
</p>
<p>effective learning tool for delegates whose States had not yet served as members of the 
</p>
<p>Council and that had consequently not had opportunities to engage with the mechanism as 
</p>
<p>part of a troika. 
</p>
<p>18. The fourth seminar organized by the International Organization of la Francophonie 
</p>
<p>in partnership with OHCHR on the universal periodic review was held in Chisinau in April 
</p>
<p>2014. The main objective was to identify challenges faced by francophone States in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of universal periodic review recommendations and recommendations 
</p>
<p>emanating from other human rights mechanisms. The seminar was also aimed at 
</p>
<p>highlighting positive examples of such implementation and follow-up measures. 
</p>
<p>19. The seminar was organized around four main themes, which participants debated in 
</p>
<p>working groups: national plans for the implementation of recommendations; assessment of 
</p>
<p>the implementation of recommendations; preparation and drafting of the national report; 
</p>
<p>and technical and financial assistance for the implementation of recommendations. 
</p>
<p>20. A number of conclusions were drawn at the seminar; they were focused, in 
</p>
<p>particular, on the cyclical nature of the universal periodic review process; the number and 
</p>
<p>formulation of recommendations; the usefulness of mid-term reports to keep track of the 
</p>
<p>status of implementation of recommendations and related challenges; the importance of </p>


<p>identifying indicators to monitor progress; the role of civil society and national human 
</p>
<p>rights institutions throughout the process; and the increasing role and the value added by 
</p>
<p>the involvement of parliamentarians. 
</p>
<p>21. OHCHR formalized a partnership with the Inter-Parliamentary Union in order to 
</p>
<p>strengthen the participation of parliamentarians in the work of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p>with a specific focus on the universal periodic review and the implementation of 
</p>
<p>recommendations emerging from the review, and in recognition of the importance of such 
</p>
<p>participation. In this context, a series of regional seminars were held in 2014, namely, in 
</p>
<p>Bucharest (February), Montevideo (July) and Rabat (September). Parliamentarians from the 
</p>
<p>respective regions were brought together at the seminars with a view to familiarizing them 
</p>
<p>with the universal periodic review process and identifying areas for their intervention and 
</p>
<p>involvement. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>22. <b>The Voluntary Fund for Participation in the Universal Periodic Review 
</b></p>
<p><b>continued to facilitate the participation of developing countries, and in particular least 
</b></p>
<p><b>developed countries, in the sessions of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
</b></p>
<p><b>Review at which they are considered. Assistance has been provided to those States, at 
</b></p>
<p><b>their request, to enable them to participate in the adoption of their outcome document 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the Human Rights Council at its plenary sessions. In that regard, and in addition to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the relevant correspondence, the secretariat is following up with delegations through a 
</b></p>
<p><b>more proactive approach to ensure that all States entitled to assistance under the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Voluntary Fund avail themselves of the opportunity. 
</b></p>
<p>23. <b>Since the inception of the universal periodic review and the inherent related 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenge to ensure that participation is indeed universal, the needs and constraints of 
</b></p>
<p><b>least developed countries have been considered. Ensuring the informed, regular and 
</b></p>
<p><b>full participation of States with little resources and no representation in Geneva, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>addition to all other States, requires regular outreach activities. Specific attention and 
</b></p>
<p><b>focus have been given to those countries through targeted initiatives either at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>bilateral level or through the organization of subregional seminars. Initiatives to 
</b></p>
<p><b>follow up on the Mauritius and Casablanca seminars will be pursued in 2015 through 
</b></p>
<p><b>targeted seminars for Lusophone countries and Caribbean States. 
</b></p>
<p>24. <b>OHCHR is expanding and strengthening its partnership with the Inter-
</b></p>
<p><b>Parliamentary Union, and the series of regional seminars will be continued in 2015. It 
</b></p>
<p><b>is expected that once the first round of seminars is concluded a compilation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>good practices that emerged in the meetings will be prepared and widely shared 
</b></p>
<p><b>among relevant stakeholders. 
</b></p>
