The Law and the Analysis of the Evidence

The prosecution in this case needed to prove the following elements of indecent assault laid against the accused:

(a) Misiwaini Tabua, (the person in the charge and appearing in court  identification)

(b) assaulted, A N (the complainant), and

(c) the assault was unlawful and indecent, that is morally offensive.

The Court in this case notes the ruling of the Supreme Court in Eliki Mototabua v- The State, Criminal Appeal No. CAV0004 of 2005S (Date of Judgment 29th February 2008) where Mason, Handley and Weinberg JJ stated (In paragraph 39):

"& First, it has never been the law that actual corroboration is required in cases involving sexual offence. There was only a requirement, at common law, that a warning be given of the dangers of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of complainant. Second, it has been held by the Court of Appeal that that rule of practice no longer exists in Fiji: See Sereima Balelala v- The State at p.19."

This Court takes notes of and heed of the comments by the Supreme Court Justices. 

One of the elements that the prosecution needed to prove in order to prove its case was the identity of the accused, Misiwaini Tabua. There is no doubt as to this proof of this element as the complainant pointed out the accused in the witness box as Misiwaini Tabua as the one who had indecently assaulted her. The complainant also told the court that when the alleged offence took place the outside lights were on and she could clearly see the accused. The complainant upon questioning by the Doctor when she was examined on 14th July 2008 in response to Q. D (10) of the Fiji Police Force Medical Examination Form stated: "alleged that her uncle Misiwata sexually assaulted her by licking her private part and inserting one of his finger in her vagina&" The accused was clearly identified by the complainant as the one who sexually assaulted her from the light that shone on him from the outside light. She also identified him as the same person who had sexually assaulted her when asked to do so as the accused person (Misiwaini) present in the court. The Court accepts the complainants identification as the complainant has lived with the accused for some time and they are related. The accused identity is proved by the complainant. The defence has not cast any doubt as to the identity of the accused. 
 
The Accused in his defence argues that he did not commit the act of indecent assault on the complainant. The Complainant gave vivid account of the allegation of the indecent assault. She stated in Court that on the evening of 5th July 2008 she was alone with her uncle at his home. The Uncles daughter went away for choir practice and did not return that night. After studying she fell asleep in the sitting room. Later her uncle woke her up to sleep in his room. She did so. Then her uncle came and off the light and asked her to lie on her back so that he could lie on top of her. She was frightened and moved back to the first place she was sleeping. At about 4am (6th July 2008) she felt pain on her vagina and saw her uncle, the accused licking her vagina and putting his finger in her vagina. 

In cross examination the complainant stated that when her uncle touched her she was scared and her heart was pounding. She could not run as her uncle held her. She also told the Court that her uncle did not sleep at 10pm and that she did not meet someone else. 

The accused in his defence stated that he had a basin of grog and it finished at 10pm. The electricity went out at 10pm and there was no power. He went to sleep. Before 6pm he saw the complainant and she went out and he had told her to study and she did not return home that night. He denied the incident and stated that at 3-4am in the morning he got angry with the complainant as she was missing. 

The accused next states that before power went off she (complainant) was in the house. She was missing after 6 pm. The Court noted the accused stating that power went off at 10pm and the accused stating that before power went off the complainant was in the house. Does this then mean the complainant was in the house before 10pm or before 6 pm which is sometime much earlier than his alleged time that the power went off. This evidence does not tie up as he earlier stated that before 6pm he saw complainant and she went out. This also does not add up with his subsequent evidences. The evidence by the accused that he saw the complainant before 6pm and she went out does not tally as he later states that before power went off the complainant was in the house and the fact according to him that power went out at 10pm would mean she was in the house before 10 pm. The question that comes up is did she go out before 6pm. The contradictory evidence does not assist the accused. 

The evidence of D-2, as to the lights in the house D-2, Jiutasa Nasamila was that the accused was awake at 10pm. The accused was drinking grog at 11pm and he thought he was awake at the time. D-2, in cross examination clarified that at 11pm the lights were on in the accuseds house. This witness who is the accuseds witness confirmed in court that light was on at 11pm. The complainant also states that her uncle did not sleep at 10pm. The accused is the only one stating that light went off at 10pm. 

The accused in his evidence further stated that when he woke up at 4am he saw the complainant outside and scolded her in front of his house. And he asked her where she was and told her to wait for him when he returned from the dairy farm. The 3rd witness for the accused told the Court that he remembered 4am and he did not hear any noises. He wakes up before 4am. In cross examination he stated that he did not hear accused growl at the complainant. The houses of the accused and the witnesses are about 10 metres apart and yet one witness who was awake states that he did not hear any noises or even the accused scold or tell off the complainant outside his house. The evidence by the accused and his witnesses do not add up and support his allegation that he scolded the victim and that the lights were off at 10pm. In fact his own witnesses have created doubts on his evidence. 

This case is one where the credibility of the witnesses is also an issue, whom the court believes. The court does not believe the accused. The Court has noted the demeanor of all the witnesses. The Court finds the Complainant to be truthful. She even stood by her evidence in thorough cross examination and was not discredited. The Court does not believe the accused. He is not telling the truth and the evidence he has given does not add up with his own witnesses and do not support his argument that the light was off at 10pm and that the accused scolded the complaint. D-3 was awake some 10 metres away he did not hear the accused scold the complainant at 4 in the morning. If the accused had scolded the complainant D-3 would surely have heard him. He did not hear anything because no such thing occurred. 

The prosecution has proved the elements of the offence in this case beyond reasonable doubt. The court believes the complainants version as to the accused indecently assaulting her as per the charge. 

The accused is found guilty of the offence that he is charged with.
