<p>Rights Council decision 24/117 of 27 September 2013 entitled &#8220;High-level panel on the 
</p>
<p>identification of good practices in combating female genital mutilation&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that female genital mutilation is a form of discrimination, an act of 
</p>
<p>violence against women and girls and a harmful practice that constitutes a serious threat to 
</p>
<p>their health, including their psychological, sexual and reproductive health, which can 
</p>
<p>increase their vulnerability to HIV and may have adverse obstetric and prenatal outcomes 
</p>
<p>as well as fatal consequences for the mother and the newborn, and that the abandonment of 
</p>
<p>this harmful practice can be achieved as a result of a comprehensive movement that 
</p>
<p>involves all public and private stakeholders in society, including girls and boys, women and 
</p>
<p>men, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging </i>the importance of the work undertaken by the United Nations 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies, particularly the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on 
</p>
<p>the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, in addressing the practice of female 
</p>
<p>genital mutilation, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging also </i>the relevance and importance of regional instruments and 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, including the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocols thereto and the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, in the 
</p>
<p>prevention and elimination of female genital mutilation, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that efforts at the local, national, regional and international levels 
</p>
<p>have led to a decline in the global prevalence of female genital mutilation, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> about the plight of the victims of female genital mutilation and the 
</p>
<p>continuing persistence of the practice, despite these efforts, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with profound concern</i> that the medicalization of this practice will 
</p>
<p>undermine the progress made in eliminating female genital mutilation and achieving<b> </b>zero 
</p>
<p>tolerance of the practice,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the growing global consensus regarding the need to take appropriate 
</p>
<p>measures to eliminate female genital mutilation, and understanding that this practice has no 
</p>
<p>relevant religious or cultural basis, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that the significant gap in resources continues and that the 
</p>
<p>shortfall in funding has severely limited the scope and pace of programmes and activities 
</p>
<p>for the elimination of female genital mutilation, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming </i>the holding during the twenty-sixth session of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council of the high-level panel discussion on the identification of good practices in 
</p>
<p>combating female genital mutilation, and taking note with interest of the summary report 
</p>
<p>thereon, prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights,1 
</p>
<p>1.<i> Urges</i> States to place special emphasis on education, in particular<b> </b>of youth, 
</p>
<p>parents and community leaders, about the harmful effects of female genital mutilation, and

<p>especially to encourage men and boys to become more involved in information and 
</p>
<p>awareness campaigns and become agents of change;  
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also urges</i> States to work for better dissemination and implementation of their 
</p>
<p>relevant international human rights obligations and commitments, particularly those 
</p>
<p>relating to the rights of women and girls, including by using outreach tools;  
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>3. <i>Further urges </i>States to develop and implement, at the national level, policies, 
</p>
<p>programmes, action plans and national legislation for the elimination of female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation, based on integrated multisectoral, coordinated and collective approaches at all 
</p>
<p>levels, taking into account the empowerment of former practitioners, the principles of 
</p>
<p>human rights, equality between women and men and non-discrimination, to ensure that 
</p>
<p>former practitioners abstain from resuming the exercise of this practice, and in general 
</p>
<p>taking into account the issue of respect for the basic human rights of women and girls, 
</p>
<p>while also working together with religious and traditional leaders;  
</p>

<p>from one country to another;  
</p>
<p>6. <i>Also stresses</i> the need to establish synergy between the activities of 
</p>
<p>international, regional and local organizations to provide better support to field 
</p>
<p>programmes, strengthen advocacy and ensure international support for the planning, 
</p>
<p>development and implementation of innovative long-term strategies for the effective 
</p>
<p>elimination of female genital mutilation; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Urges </i>States to strengthen support to communities, especially those that have 
</p>
<p>developed successful local models to prevent and eliminate female genital mutilation, by 
</p>
<p>encouraging them to design and utilize education programmes, information and awareness-
</p>
<p>raising tools and to make them accessible to the greatest number of people possible;  
</p>
<p>8. <i>Urges</i> States, international and regional governmental organizations and civil 
</p>
<p>society, including non-governmental organizations, to intensify research on the 
</p>
<p>consequences of female genital mutilation, the persistence of the practice and the impact of 
</p>
<p>campaigns and other initiatives to eliminate this scourge;  
</p>
<p>9. <i>Urges</i> the international community to continue and strengthen efforts to share 
</p>
<p>best practices on national and regional legislation, policies, programmes and action plans 
</p>
<p>aimed at preventing and criminalizing the practice, to mobilize resources and to enhance 
</p>
<p>international cooperation in this regard;  
</p>
<p>10. <i>Calls upon</i> States to continue to increase technical and financial assistance for 
</p>
<p>the effective implementation of policies, programmes and action plans to eliminate female 
</p>
<p>genital mutilation at the national, regional and international levels, including by 
</p>
<p>strengthening the United Nations Population Fund-United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund Joint 
</p>
<p>Programme on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: Accelerating Change, and all the other 
</p>
<p>initiatives and activities at the local, regional and international levels aimed at the 
</p>
<p>prevention and elimination of female genital mutilation; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Calls</i> <i>upon</i> States, the international community and the organizations of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations system to end the medicalization of female genital mutilation, which entails 
</p>
<p>the definition and dissemination of guidelines to medical staff, and to provide, including 
</p>
<p>through clinical guidelines, an adequate response to the chronic health problems suffered by 
</p>
<p>the millions of women and girls who have undergone female genital mutilation and that 
</p>
<p>hinder progress on health in general;  
</p>
<p>12. <i>Urges</i> the international community to keep the issue of the elimination of
