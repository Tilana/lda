</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances was the first United 
Nations human rights thematic mechanism to be established with a universal mandate. The 
original mandate derives from Commission on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 
February 1980. This resolution followed General Assembly resolution 33/173 of 20 
December 1978, in which the Assembly expressed concern at reports from various parts of 
the world relating to enforced disappearances and requested the Commission on Human 
Rights to consider the question of missing or disappeared persons.  
</p>
<p>2. The primary task of the Working Group is to assist families in determining the fate 
or whereabouts of their family members who are reportedly disappeared. In this 
humanitarian capacity, the Working Group serves as a channel of communication between 
family members of victims of disappearance and Governments.  
</p>
<p>3. Following the adoption of General Assembly resolution 47/133 on 18 December 
1992 and of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, 
the Working Group was entrusted to monitor the progress of States in fulfilling their 
obligations derived from the Declaration. The mandate was most recently extended by 
Human Rights Council resolution 7/12 of 27 March 2008. 
</p>
<p>4. Following a review of its methods of work in 2008, the Working Group decided that 
adjustments were needed. The revised methods of work, approved on 13 November 2009, 
are contained in annex I to the present report and will come into effect on 1 January 2010. 
</p>
<p>5. This report reflects communications and cases examined by the Working Group 
during its three sessions in 2009, covering the period 5 December 2008 to 13 November 
</p><p>2009. 
</p>
<p>6. A summary of activities during the reporting period is presented in a table for each 
country, with a detailed text description of the areas of activity. Where there has been no 
information from the Government or the sources, notwithstanding the annual reminder sent 
by the Working Group concerning outstanding cases, only the table is provided and a 
reference is made to the previous report dealing with those. 
</p>
<p>7. In countries where the number of newly-reported cases is less than 10, the names of 
the persons appear in the country section. If the number of newly-reported cases is greater 
than 10, the list of names appears in annex V. Concerning urgent actions, the names of all 
persons, regardless their number, appear in the country section. 
</p>
<p>8. The total number of cases transmitted by the Working Group to Governments since 
its inception is 53,232. The number of cases under active consideration that have not yet 
been clarified, closed or discontinued stands at 42,600 and concerns 82 States. The 
Working Group has been able to clarify 1,776 cases over the past five years. 
</p>
<p>9. It is recalled that recent cases of disappearance are the priority of the Working 
Group. Large volumes of cases submitted to the Working Group many years after the 
persons disappeared are reviewed by it and processed by the Secretariat as an ongoing 
process. The Working Group reports that as at the end of the present reporting period it has 
a backlog of 200 cases, due to the reduced support given to the mandate. </p>

<p><b> II. Activities of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances: 5 December 2008 to 13 November 2009 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Activities 
</b></p>
<p>10. During the period under review, the Working Group held three sessions: the eighty-
seventh session, from 9 to 13 March, in Geneva, the eighty-eighth from 26 to 28 June, in 
Rabat, Morocco, and the eighty-ninth from 4 to 13 November 2009, in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>11. Since 1 August 2009, the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group is Jeremy 
Sarkin. The other members are Santiago Corcuera, Olivier de Frouville, Darko G&#246;ttlicher 
and Osman El-Hajj&#233;, who was appointed in 2009. El-Hajj&#233; took over from Saied Lhorasani 
who was a member until 31 July 2009. 
</p>
<p>12. On 10 March 2009, the Chairman-Rapporteur presented the Working Group&#8217;s 
annual report for 2008 to the tenth session of the Council and participated in the interactive 
dialogue with its member States.  
</p>
<p>13. On 5 February 2009, the Secretariat of the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances participated in a conference titled &#8220;Conference on the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance&#8221; 
organized by the Colegio de Espa&#241;a, the Maison de l&#8217;Argentine and the Maison de l&#8217;Italie 
at the Cit&#233; internationale universitaire, in Paris. 
</p>
<p>14. On 26 and 27 February 2009, Olivier de Frouville, member of the Working Group 
on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, participated in a meeting on &#8220;governance: 
individual rights, economic development and social progress&#8221; organized by the Amadeus 
Institute in Marrakech, Morocco. As a result, a call for the ratification of the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance is included in 
the final commitment, the &#8220;Marrakech Engagement&#8221;. On 10 March 2009, he delivered a 
presentation during an event held in parallel with the tenth session of the Human Rights 
Council on &#8220;Secret detentions &#8211; strategies to end this practice&#8221; to launch a joint study on 
this issue together with other special procedures mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>15. The Chairperson attended, from 29 June to 3 July 2009, the sixteenth annual 
meeting of special rapporteurs, representatives, independent experts and chairpersons of 
working groups of the Council. 
</p>
<p>16. On 11 and 12 August 2009, Mr. Corcuera participated in the &#8220;Seminario 
Internacional Sobre Desaparici&#243;n Forzada en Am&#233;rica Latina &#8211; Pasos Hacia la 
Construcci&#243;n de la Memoria Hist&#243;rica&#8221; organized by the University of Antioquia in 
Medell&#237;n, Colombia.  
</p>
<p>17. In September and October 2009, Jeremy Sarkin delivered lectures and statements on 
the following topics: &#8220;Enforced disappearances in Africa&#8221;, Centre for the Study of Violence 
and Reconciliation workshop, Cape Town, South Africa; &#8220;Rehabilitation and reintegration 
of war-affected children: a transitional justice perspective on the need to achieve 
rehabilitation, reintegration and reconciliation for child soldiers and child victims of 
enforced disappearances&#8221;, International Conference on Rehabilitation and Reintegration of 
War-Affected Children, Brussels; and &#8220;Transitional justice&#8221; as well as &#8220;Enforced 
disappearances&#8221;, International Human Rights Academy, Cape Town, South Africa. </p>

<p><b> B. Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>18. During the period under review, the Working Group met formally with 
representatives of the Governments of Algeria, Ecuador, Iraq, Japan, Montenegro, 
Morocco, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam. A number of other informal meetings were held with 
various States during the year. Upon the initiative of the Working Group, a meeting was 
held with the African Group. The Working Group looks forward to meeting the Eastern 
European Group in the future, as part of an ongoing initiative. The Working Group also met 
with representatives of human rights non-governmental organizations and associations of 
relatives of disappeared persons and families of victims of enforced disappearances or 
witnesses thereof. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>19. During the reporting period, the Working Group transmitted 456 new cases of

<p>30. In 2009, the Working Groups sent reminders to Governments. The Governments of 
Nepal and of the Russian Federation stated that it would not be possible to schedule a visit 
by the Working Group because other special rapporteurs would be visiting the country.  
</p>
<p>31. The Working Group invites all the Governments that received a request by the 
Working Group to respond to the continued interest expressed in undertaking those visits. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Studies 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Working Group, together with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention initiated a global joint study of 
the practice of secret detention in the context of contemporary counter-terrorism efforts, as 
announced on 10 March 2009 at the tenth session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva.  
</p>
<p>33. The joint study is global in nature and examines the practice of secret detention in 
and by States from various geographical regions, taking into account recent domestic, 
regional and global efforts to counter terrorism. The study will also include chapters on the 
legal framework and on past experiences of the use of secret detention in the context of 
counter-terrorism operations.  
</p>
<p>34. It is expected that the joint report will be submitted to the thirteenth session of the 
Human Rights Council, containing factual examples, legal analysis and recommendations 
regarding these practices, aimed at curbing the resort to secret detention and the unlawful 
treatment or punishment of detainees in the context of contemporary counter-terrorism 
efforts. This study will be part of a consultative process with States.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Statements 
</b></p>
<p>35. On 19 December 2008, the Working Group issued a press release welcoming the 
report on Conflict-related Disappearances in Bardiya District, presented by the office in 
Nepal of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR-Nepal), 
thanks to which the Working Group received many cases.  
</p>
<p>36. On 21 July 2009 the Working Group issued a joint press release together with six 
other special procedures mechanisms requesting the authorities of the Russian Federation to 
extend an invitation to visit the country to assist the authorities in conducting an </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.09-17704 
</p>
<p>independent investigation into a series of killings of human rights defenders, lawyers and 
journalists in recent years. 
</p><p>37. On 7 July 2009, the Working Group issued a press released jointly with five other 
special procedures mechanisms calling upon the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran to uphold its international obligations to ensure that the human rights of all individuals 
were protected following the presidential elections in the country.  
</p>
<p>38. To commemorate the International Day of the Disappeared, which is observed by 
civil society, the Working Group issued a press release on 30 August 2009, expressing its 
concern at the measures being taken by Governments while countering terrorism and the 
implications for enforced disappearances, and stressed that arrests committed during 
military operations, arbitrary detentions and extraordinary renditions &#8220;can amount to 
enforced disappearances&#8221;. The experts called upon States to take measures to promote truth 
and reconciliation, which ought not to be used as a substitute for bringing perpetrators to 
justice. The Working Group called upon Governments to sign and ratify the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and to accept 
the competence of the Committee-to-be under articles 31 and 32 of the Convention. 
</p>
<p><b> G. General comments on enforced disappearance as a crime against 
humanity 
</b></p>
<p>39. As a result of the development of international law, the Working Group is working 
on a series of general comments, including on enforced disappearance as a continuous 
crime and continuous human rights violation. In 2009, the Working Group finalized a 
general comment on enforced disappearance as a crime against humanity, which was 
adopted at its eighty-seventh session: 
</p>
<p><b>  General comment on enforced disappearance as a crime against humanity 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Preamble 
</i></p>
<p> The 1992 Declaration for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearances affirms the connection between enforced disappearances and crimes 
against humanity. It states, in the fourth preambular paragraph, that the &#8220;systematic 
practice [of enforced disappearances] is by its very nature a crime against 
humanity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group considers that this provision needs to be interpreted in 
the view of legal developments which have occurred since 1992. 
</p>
<p> Based on the foregoing, the Working Group has decided to issue the 
following general comment: 
</p>
<p><i>  General comment 
</i></p>
<p>1. The notion of crimes against humanity has been recognized for a long time in 
international law. The connection between enforced disappearances and crimes 
against humanity was explicitly acknowledged in the 1983 Resolution 666 (XIII-
0/83) of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States, which 
described the practice of enforced disappearances <i>per se</i>, as a crime against 
humanity: in other words, any act of enforced disappearance is considered, 
according to this text, to be a crime against humanity. </p>


<p>GE.09-17704 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>2. The 1994 Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance of Persons 
reaffirms, in its sixth preambular paragraph, &#8220;that the systematic practice of enforced 
disappearances of persons constitutes a crime against humanity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>3. Article 18 of the 1996 International Law Commission draft Code of Crimes 
Against Peace and Security for Mankind defines crimes against humanity as the 
following: &#8220;A Crime against Humanity means any of the following acts, when 
committed in a systematic manner or on a large scale and instigated or directed by a 
Government or any organization or group&#8221;; this definition is applicable to all crimes 
enumerated in the article, among which enforced disappearances.  
</p>
<p>4. Article 7, paragraph 1, of the 1998 Rome Statute establishing the 
International Criminal Court also gives a general definition of the concept of crime 
against humanity, applicable to all crimes listed in the above-mentioned paragraph, 
including enforced disappearance. This definition includes several criteria: &#8220;For the 
purposes of this present Statute &#8216;crimes against humanity&#8217; means [any of the 
following] acts where committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack 
directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>5. Article 5 of the 2006 International Convention on the Protection of All 
Persons against Enforced Disappearance states: &#8220;The widespread or systematic 
practice of enforced disappearance constitutes a crime against humanity as defined 
in applicable international law and shall attract the consequences provided for under 
such applicable international law.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>6. This provision, while recalling the criteria which are similar to those 
enunciated in the draft Code of the International Law Commission, is in fact 
essentially referring to other instruments or sources of international law, by 
mentioning &#8220;crime against humanity <i>as defined in applicable international law</i>&#8221;. 
The <i>travaux pr&#233;paratoires</i> confirm that States did not intend to give a &#8220;definition&#8221; 
of enforced disappearances as a crime against humanity, but mainly to recall that, in 
accordance with other instruments and sources of international law, this qualification 
was accepted.  
</p>
<p>7. Drawing from the case law of international tribunals, as well as from the 
Statute of the International Criminal Court, it can be seen that crimes against 
humanity are crimes which are committed in a context. In other words, crimes 
against humanity are characterized by contextual elements. Those specific elements 
make it possible to differentiate, for instance, murder as a common crime from 
murder when occurring as a crime against humanity. 
</p>
<p>8. The same applies to enforced disappearances, which can only be qualified as 
crimes against humanity when committed in a certain context. 
</p>
<p>9. Thus, the fourth preambular paragraph of the 1992 Declaration is no longer in 
line with existing international law. Persuasive evidence of existing international law 
on this matter can be found in the case law of the international criminal tribunals, as 
well as hybrid tribunals and in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  
</p>
<p>10. The case law of the two ad hoc international criminal tribunals has been 
settled, among others, by the judgement of the ad hoc International Criminal 
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia Appeals Chamber in the <i>Kunarac and others</i> 
case (12 June 2002, IT-96-23 &amp; 23/1-A, see paras. 71&#8211;105), in which the Appeals 
Chamber considered that the contextual elements of the crime against humanity are 
the following: 
</p>
<p> (a) There has been an &#8220;attack&#8221;; </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.09-17704 
</p>
<p> (b) The attack was targeting any civilian population; 
 (c) This attack must have been widespread <i>or</i> systematic; 
 (d) The perpetrator had knowledge of the attack. 
11. These same elements are repeated in article 7 (1) of the Statute of the 
International Criminal Court which states: &#8220;For the purpose of this Statute, &#8216;crime 
against humanity&#8217; means any of the following acts when committed as part of a 
widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with 
knowledge of the attack.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>12. The Statute of the International Criminal Court has been ratified by more 
than 100 countries. In a landmark decision, Preliminary Chamber I of the 
International Criminal Court extensively cited the <i>Kunarac</i> judgement to interpret 
article 7 (1) (<i>The Prosecutor v. Ahmad Muhammad Harun (&#8220;Ahmad Harun&#8221;) and 
Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman (&#8220;Ali Kushayb&#8221;</i>), No. ICC-02/05-01/07, 
Decision on the Prosecutor application under article 58 (7) of the Statute, 27 April 
2007, paras. 60&#8211;62). 
13. It is also to be noted that article 7 (1) has been incorporated in the statutes of 
other international and hybrid tribunals, including those of the Sierra Leone Special 
Court, the Special Panels for Serious Crimes in Timor-Leste and the Extraordinary 
Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. 
</p>
<p>14. The Working Group is thus convinced that the definition given by article 7 
(1) of the Statute of the International Criminal Court now reflects customary 
international law and can thus be used to interpret and apply the provisions of the 
Declaration. 
</p>
<p>15. When there are claims of practices of enforced disappearances which may 
amount to crimes against humanity, the Working Group will evaluate these claims in 
the light of the criteria listed in article 7 (1) of the Rome Statute, as interpreted by 
international and hybrid tribunals, and, if appropriate, will refer them to the 
competent authorities, be they international, regional or domestic.

<p>70. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles reportedly encountered 
in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was transmitted to the 
Government after its eighty-seventh session. 
</p>
<p>71. It was reported that in 2002, the Government of Azerbaijan was involved in a 
practice of renditions and secret detention. The victims of rendition were held in prolonged 
detention in secret facilities, with no access to the International Committee of the Red Cross 
(ICRC), no notification to their families and no notification of their legal status and rights. 
There was no oversight of the conditions of detention and the treatment of the detainees. 
There was also no information about the procedures in place to decide about their detention 
and its duration. The role of the Government in this practice allegedly included the 
detention of persons inside its territory and their extrajudicial transfer overseas. This 
practice is believed to amount to enforced disappearance.

<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of the allegations 
</b></p>
<p>84. Information was submitted by sources to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
reportedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. On 15 May 2009, after its 
eighty-seventh session, the Working Group transmitted a general allegation to the 
Government.  
</p>
<p>85. It was reported that high ranking officials of Belarus are not being investigated for 
their involvement in the crime of enforced disappearance as a practice to remove political 
opponents. According to the information received, the Government is using a delaying 
technique of postponing or extending investigations to reach a 15-year statute of limitations 
after which a case can be closed. Additionally, it has been reported that the families of the 
victims of enforced disappearance have not received detailed information from the 
Government about the course of the investigations. 
</p>
<p>86. It has been further reported that in one case the Minsk Oktyabrskiy District Court 
has suspended the hearing of applications for presumption of death, even though the 
legislation establishes that if a person does not appear after three years of his or her 
disappearance, a legal presumption of death can be issued.  According to the source, the 
Minsk Oktyabrskiy District Court decided that a civil case cannot be renewed until the 
criminal case is closed. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>87. A response was received from the Government, on 5 June 2009, stating that 
investigations had started promptly for all three cases. For two of those cases the conclusion 
was reached that the victims were abducted by unidentified persons and driven away to an 
unknown destination. The Government affirmed that there is no evidence to substantiate the 
allegation made by the media and the relatives of the victims that high-level government 
officials and agents of the secret service were involved in the disappearances. It stated that 
the allegation that the investigations have been suspended is incorrect: they are ongoing but 
further details cannot be revealed until they are completed.  
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>88. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted three cases to the 
Government; all remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>89. The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligations under the 
Declaration to conduct thorough and impartial investigations &#8220;for as long as the fate of the 
victim of enforced disappearance remains unclarified&#8221; (art. 13.6) and to ensure that statutes 
of limitations, where they exist, relating to acts of enforced disappearance are substantial 
and commensurate with the extreme seriousness of the offence (art. 17.3).  
</p><p>90. The Working Group calls upon the Government to sign and ratify the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and accept the 
competence of the Committee under articles 31 and 32. </p>

this case had been submitted to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and is 
currently under consideration by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>96. On 18 November 2008, the Government of Bolivia replied to the general allegation 
sent on 16 September 2008 (see A/HRC/10/9, paras. 71 to 77) explaining that the National 
Commission on Reparations to Victims of Political Violence (CONREVIP) is comprised of 
a representative of different ministries, of the legislature, the Episcopal Conference and 
trade unions, and adopts decisions by a majority of two thirds of its members. The 
proceedings and decisions of CONREVIP, therefore, do not depend solely on the Ministry 
of Justice. 
</p>
<p>97. According to Act No. 2640 and its Regulatory Decree No. 28015, the administrative 
procedure was initiated on 1 March 2005 with the receipt of provisional applications from 
possible beneficiaries of exceptional reparations.  
</p>
<p>98. The CONREVIP had 60 working days from 5 November to adopt explicit and 
reasoned decisions on each case. By 30 January 2008, decisions had been adopted on 
roughly 20 per cent of the various acts eligible for reparations and 152 applications for 
review of the acts eligible for reparations had been received.  
</p>
<p>99. The Ministry of Justice has carried out all activities required under Act No. 2640. 
However, it has not yet completed all of its work because of the shortage of human 
resources on the technical support team and because most CONREVIP members are unable 
to work on a full-time basis.  </p>


<p>GE.09-17704 <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>100. In accordance with Act No. 2640, a financial management project that guarantees 80 
per cent of payments to beneficiaries under the Act has been elaborated. Since August 
2006, steps have been taken to obtain funds through international cooperation. Financial 
assistance has been requested from several institutions. The Inter-American Development 
Bank, USAID, the European Union and the Vice-Ministry for Public Investment and 
External Financing have turned down the request for cooperation under this heading and 
other agencies requested have not yet responded to the letters sent.

rendition were held in prolonged detention in secret facilities, with no access to the ICRC, 
no notification to their families and no notification of their legal status and rights. There

<p><b>  Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>138. On 28 April 2009, the Working Group sent a joint communication, together with 
another special procedures mechanism, regarding the intimidation suffered by a human 
rights organization due to its activities related to the investigation of enforced 
disappearances. 
</p>
<p>139. On 9 June 2009, the Working Group sent a communication regarding the 
intimidation suffered by the members of the family of a victim of enforced disappearance 
on the eve of the trial of the alleged perpetrator. The same family was the subject of a 
similar communication sent to the Government on 6 October 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of the allegations 
</b></p>
<p>140. Information was submitted by sources to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
allegedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was 
transmitted to the Government through two general allegations. 
</p>
<p>141. On the first general allegation, sources reported that, on 12 November 2008, the 
First Commission of the Colombian Chamber of Representatives approved the Draft Law 
044/08, known as the &#8220;Victims Law&#8221;, which established measures for reparations and 
protection of victims of the Colombian armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>142. According to sources, this draft law is discriminatory as victims can only benefit 
from it provided they register within two years of its approval. In this regard, sources 
alleged that the draft law fails to acknowledge that disappearances still occur in Colombia 
because of the ongoing internal conflict and that it also hampers the principle of non-
applicability of statutory limitations for crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p>143. It was also alleged that the draft law does not allow victims who received 
compensation to ask for reparation at a later date through judicial procedures. In addition, 
the draft law reportedly excludes victims of violations of international humanitarian law 
and restricts the category of perpetrators to certain members of the public forces, including 
the military and the police, and excludes other categories such as members of the 
intelligence services. 
</p>
<p>144. Furthermore, the draft law allegedly excludes from the definition of victim the 
family members of the disappeared thus preventing them from receiving compensation. It 
also fails to acknowledge the State&#8217;s responsibility in compensating victims as it provides 
that the State will compensate victims based on the solidarity principle. 
</p>
<p>145. In the second allegation, sources reported that, despite the fact that the farm &#8220;La 
Alemania&#8221;, in Sucre, is known to contain the graves of peasant farmers allegedly murdered 
in 1997 by paramilitaries, it is not possible to verify whether there are bodies buried there 
and, if there are, to identify them. It was further reported that the Attorney General&#8217;s office 
found two graves with four bodies and that these bodies had been tipped into a well and 
thrown behind a house. 
</p>
<p>146. It was also reported that the Attorney General&#8217;s office failed to inform the families 
of the victims &#8212; including the legal co-owners of the farm &#8212; that it was going to search 
for and/or exhume graves. The source further alleged that the lack of rigorous 
investigations prevents exhumed bodies from being identified thus denying families the 
possibility of recovering their loved ones. In addition, it was alleged that families do not 
know at what stage, if any, the Attorney General&#8217;s office investigations are, and they are 
concerned that the remains of the victims, if found, could be kept in boxes labelled &#8220;person 
unknown&#8221; and destroyed later, as occurred in other parts of Colombia.  </p>


<p>GE.09-17704 <b>35 
</b></p>
<p>147. The sources also alleged that paramilitaries that took over the farm in 1997, despite 
some of them being in jail, are intimidating the families who are searching for their 
relatives thus demonstrating the level of impunity and disregard for justice in Colombia. It 
was further reported that the site is not protected and therefore the bodies or other evidence 
may be destroyed. 
</p>
<p><b>  Replies from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>148. On 13 July and 24 September 2009, the Government replied to both general 
allegations. The replies could not be translated in time for inclusion in this report.  
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>149. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 1,235 cases to the 
Government; of those, 67 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
sources, 205 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 963 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>150. The Working Group thanks the Government for its report on the implementation of 
the recommendations made after its visit to the country in 2005 and hopes that this is the 
beginning of a mutual cooperation to deal with all the recommendations. The Working 
Group looks forward to start working on a follow-up report. 
</p>
<p>151. The Working Group expresses concern about the number of cases of intimidation 
and reprisals. In this connection, it reminds the Government of its obligation to protect 
against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal according to articles 13, paragraph 3 
(protection against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal) and 13, paragraph 5 (ill-treatment,

<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>153. The Government transmitted one communication to the Working Group, dated 17 
April 2009, replying to a general allegation sent in 2004 (E/CN.4/2005/65).<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>154. In a communication dated 17 April 2009, the Government of the Republic of Congo 
responded to the Working Group&#8217;s general allegation sent in 2004. It stated that in 2005, 
the return of peace and security in large towns and the restoration of administrative services 
and the judiciary enabled the Brazzaville Criminal Court to hold a session to clarify the 
&#8220;Beach Disappearances&#8221; case. In its Judgement No. 006 of 17 August 2005, the Court 
ordered the Government to pay 10 million CFA francs to each missing person&#8217;s family. 
Compensation has been paid in 84 cases in which it has been established that a person had 
gone missing. Forty-three (43) cases were dismissed because some claimants were not 
included in the list and others had not signed the declaration of good faith. The judgement 
of the Brazzaville Criminal Court was confirmed by the Supreme Court of the Congo which 
increased the compensation awarded to the survivors of the missing persons.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>155. Following the information provided by the Government on 17 April 2009, the 
Working Group looks forward to receiving the names of all those persons who disappeared 
as well as those of the 84 persons whose families received compensation. 
</p>
<p>156. The Working Group notes that the Government has signed the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and calls upon 
the Government to ratify it and accept the competence of the Committee under articles 31

<p><b>  Summary of the allegations 
</b></p>
<p>157. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles reportedly encountered 
in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was transmitted to the 
Government after its eighty-seventh session.  
</p>
<p>158. According to the reports, the Government of Cyprus was involved in 2003 in a 
practice of renditions and secret detention. The role of the Government in this practice 
allegedly consisted of allowing the use of the airports of Cyprus to transport victims of 
rendition. Those planes stopped over in those airports during the process of transferring, 
taking, delivering, or returning detainees from the rendition.  It is believed that the use of 
these planes, without the control and scrutiny of the Governments, was essential to facilitate 
and implement the rendition programme. In some cases, these planes were used to detain 
individuals in Europe, while in other cases victims of enforced disappearances were 
transported in and out of Europe. The Government allegedly allowed these planes to land 
on its territories without adopting any measure to prevent their use for secret detention and 
rendition. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>159. On 14 July 2009, a response was received from the Government regarding this 
general allegation. It stated that the Republic of Cyprus is a party to a number of 
international legal instruments which govern the transfer and extradition of sentenced 
persons and has signed a number of relevant bilateral agreements with third countries. For 
the period in question, the Government records that no suspected flights of secret renditions 
have used its airports. 
</p>
<p>160.  Regarding the measures undertaken by the Government, the Council of Ministers on 
31 August 2006 decided that for suspicious and irregular flights for which there was a 
request to use the airports in Cyprus, the authorities should request more information and 
may inspect the interior of such aircrafts.  
</p>
<p>161. Regarding the investigations undertaken by the Government, and following a request 
by the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, an inquiry was launched by the Legal 
Service of the Republic with all police departments, districts and services concerning 
unacknowledged deprivation of liberty between 2002 and 2005. No such instance has been 
ascertained; the Government has never been informed of any illegal activities by foreign 
secret services on its national territory, nor would it tolerate them. Finally, there are no 
secret detention centres in its territory nor has the Government been asked by other 
countries to grant permission for such places of detention. </p>


<p><b>38</b> GE.09-17704 
</p>
<p>162. Regarding the remedy available for victims of enforced disappearances and their 
families, the Government reported that domestic legislation provides for effective 
investigation, criminal prosecution of those responsible and compensation. There exist 
safeguards against enforced disappearances including: the prohibition of arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty, every person arrested must be brought in front of a judge within 24 
hours, a person detained illegally can be released immediately under an order of habeas 
corpus. Investigations can be carried out by independent investigators, the police, 
commissions of inquiry and the Ombudsman can lead to criminal prosecution and 
punishment. Members of foreign agencies in the territory of Cyprus are subject to all laws 
and constitutional provisions of the country. Violations of any of the rights of persons 
arrested and/or detained gives rise to a civil right to claim for compensation against the 
State and the person who perpetrated the violation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>163. The Working Group notes that the Government has signed the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and calls upon 
the Government to ratify it and accept the competence of the Committee under articles 31 
and 32.

</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>213. The Working Group received one communication from the Government on 1 
October 2009 in reply to the general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of the allegations 
</b></p>
<p>214. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles reportedly encountered 
in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was transmitted to the 
Government after its eighty-seventh session.  
</p>
<p>215. It was reported that, between 2001 and 2005, the Government of Germany was 
involved in a practice of rendition and secret detention. Victims of rendition were generally 
held in prolonged detention in secret facilities, with no access to the ICRC, no notification 
to families and no notification of their legal status and rights. There was no oversight of the 
conditions of detention and the treatment of the detainees. There was also no information 
about the procedures in place to decide about their detention and its duration. This practice 
is believed to amount to enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>216. The role of the Government in this practice allegedly included the facilitation of 
information by the national intelligence agencies to other intelligence agencies, which is 
likely to have facilitated the illegal apprehension and transfer of a number of individuals. 
</p>
<p>217. There were also allegations according to which airports in Germany were used by 
planes to transport victims of rendition. Those planes stopped over in those airports during 
the process of transferring, taking, delivering, or returning detainees from the rendition. It is 
believed that the use of these planes, without the control and scrutiny of the Government, 
was essential to facilitate and implement the rendition programme. In some cases, these 
planes were used to detain individuals in Europe, while in other cases victims of enforced 
disappearance were transported in and out of Europe. The Government allegedly allowed 
these planes to land on its territory without adopting any measure to prevent their use for 
secret detention and rendition. 
</p>
<p>218. There were also reports that the Government of Germany was allegedly informed of 
the secret detention of a number of their nationals and provided no information of their fate 
or whereabouts to their respective families. The Government did not ensure consular access 
for the victims of rendition, did not make any diplomatic representation on behalf of them 
to protect their rights, and did not seek to facilitate their return. 
</p>
<p>219. There is also concern that the Government of Germany participated in interrogations 
of detainees, held in detention in secret locations. Some of them may have been subjected 
to torture or other ill-treatment. </p>


<p><b>52</b> GE.09-17704 
</p>
<p>220. According to reports received, the Government of Germany was reluctant to 
investigate thoroughly allegations of enforced disappearance connected to renditions by 
claiming confidentiality on national security or State secrecy. Prosecutors in Germany 
investigated cases of abductions and other crimes carried out on their territories or against 
their nationals which led to extradition requests. It reportedly failed to undertake effective, 
independent and impartial investigation into the role of State officials and the use of State 
territory in connection with enforced disappearance. Reportedly, investigations and 
determinations of human rights complaints in cases of rendition and secret detention were 
blocked by the Government. No remedies have been provided for the victims and their 
families, which includes, in some cases, the establishment of the fate and whereabouts of 
people who have disappeared. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>221. On 1 October 2009, a response was received from the Government denying these 
allegations, stating that neither the German Government nor the national services under its 
control have participated in the alleged practices or approved them. 
</p>
<p>222. An independent investigation was commissioned by the Parliamentary Committee of 
Inquiry and the final report was presented to, and adopted by, the German Bundestag on 18 
June 2009. According to the conclusion, out of 20 alleged renditions, only 2 cases could be 
proved. In both cases the Government was informed only after the rendition of the persons. 
German authorities had no direct or indirect involvement in the flights or in the preceding 
arrests. Evidence of further flights could not be produced. 
</p>
<p>223. The assertion that secret detention centres existed on German federal territory could 
not be confirmed in the investigations conducted by the independent investigator and the 
Committee of Inquiry. The existence of secret detention centres on German territory must 
therefore be denied. 
</p>
<p>224. Concerning the claim that German authorities provided foreign intelligence services 
with information that resulted in people becoming victims of enforced disappearance, the 
Government of Germany stated that the exchange of information between German security 
agencies and the intelligence agencies of allied States takes place exclusively within the 
framework of the relevant legal admissibility requirements. 
</p>
<p>225. Furthermore, the Government of Germany has been informed about four cases of 
renditions or enforced disappearances concerning the Federal Republic of Germany. The 
German authorities did not directly or indirectly participate in arresting these persons or in 
rendering them for imprisonment. In two cases the German missions responsible for 
consular assistance had no knowledge of their imprisonment and were therefore unable to 
ensure that their rights were observed or guarantee consular protection; in another two cases 
the German authorities worked intensively to guarantee consular protection. However, they 
were denied access to the detainees and were thereby prevented from effectively exercising 
consular protection. 
</p>
<p>226. Regarding the measures adopted to guarantee an effective judicial remedy to people 
deprived of their liberty and the access of the competent authorities to their places of 
detention, the Government stated that the public prosecutor&#8217;s office immediately initiated a 
preliminary investigation on 19 July 2005 when suspicions emerged concerning the 
rendition of one person. This investigation not only aimed at reconstructing the facts, but 
also strove to provide the competent authorities with access to persons deprived of their 
liberty. As soon as the Government became aware that German nationals had been arrested 
by other States, it engaged in bilateral negotiations in order to guarantee their rights and to 
secure their release as soon as possible. These negotiations took place within the scope of 
public international law and primarily by exercising consular protection. </p>


<p>GE.09-17704 <b>53 
</b></p>
<p>227. Regarding the measures adopted to ensure that persons expelled to other States were 
not in danger of enforced disappearance, the Government of Germany stated that, in 
addition to the aforementioned consular protection, it campaigned on behalf of the persons 
under arrest within bilateral dialogues with the relevant States. Moreover, the Government 
indicated on several occasions, and at the highest political level, that international 
obligations and human rights standards were to be observed. 
</p>
<p>228. Regarding the measures undertaken to ensure that airports on its territory were not 
used to transport victims of rendition, the Government of Germany reiterated on several 
occasions that renditions are considered illegal and hence punishable and it officially 
protested against practices of rendition and detention contradictory to public international 
law and human rights on several occasions in 2002. The latest edition of the Federal 
Foreign Office&#8217;s circular note to all foreign embassies in Germany concerning the 
regulations on incoming State flights explicitly states that the transport of prisoners outside 
the normal mutual legal assistance procedures is not permitted. 
</p>
<p>229. The Government reported that the investigation by the public prosecutor&#8217;s office 
initially had priority. The public prosecutor&#8217;s office has much greater investigative 
competence than the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution as a national 
intelligence service. This is the desired consequence of the limited investigative powers of 
the intelligence services. The Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry also commissioned an 
independent investigator to conduct preliminary preparative inquiries, which produced an 
initial foundation for the work of the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry. 
</p>
<p>230. Regarding which remedy is available for victims of enforced disappearance and their 
families, the Government stated that it strove to achieve the prompt release of people who 
were deprived of their liberty. During this common and effective practice of consular 
protection, family members as well as the legal counsel of the persons under arrest are 
closely involved and informed. 
</p>
<p>231. Regarding possible reparation for the victims of enforced disappearances the 
Government replied that the criteria necessary to justify a claim for the State to assume 
liability have not been fulfilled and therefore no such reparation will be provided. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>232. The Working Group congratulates the Government for ratifying the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. It calls the 
Government to accept the competence of the Committee under articles 31 and 32.

<p><b>  Information from sources

<p>259. The Working Group received new information from sources on three cases, which 
did not lead to clarification. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of the allegations 
</b></p>
<p>260. The Working Group received information from sources concerning obstacles 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration in the country. This information was 
transmitted to the Government after its eighty-sixth and eighty-eighth sessions through the 
following general allegations. 
</p>
<p>261. Regarding the first general allegation, it was reported that the current legal 
provisions in India hamper the right to a prompt and effective remedy, leading to impunity 
for cases of enforced disappearances. Allegedly, it frequently requires the order of a 
Superior Court for police to register complaints against the armed forces when 
apprehending civilians and not revealing their whereabouts. In addition, investigations are 
reportedly obstructed by the unwillingness of the armed forces to cooperate with the police, 
and the reluctance of the police to carry out proper investigations of crimes purportedly 
involving military personnel. 
</p>
<p>262. There is also concern that the current legislation, including the Criminal Procedure 
Code, the Jammu and Kashmir Disturbed Areas Act, the Armed Forces Special Powers Act 
and the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act, require special sanction from executive 
authorities to proceed with investigations into alleged crimes committed by State officials. 
According to the reports received, the Jammu and Kashmir State Government made almost 
300 requests to the central Government to prosecute but none were granted. Allegedly, 
there is no single case where a sanction to prosecute has been given. 
</p>
<p>263. There were also reports that the ability of victims to have recourse to the judicial 
process is severely hampered by problems of access, expense, distance, delay and language. 
Several judges reportedly noted that delays are caused because State officials do not present 
themselves or file replies. In many cases, State authorities reportedly issue blanket denials 
or contradictory statements in response to petitions in judicial inquiries. In addition, it is 
alleged that police complaints are only registered after the Superior Court issues a decision. 
The case is then often transferred to subordinate courts, which are allegedly severely 
overburdened and unable to compel State respondents to obey orders. </p>


<p><b>60</b> GE.09-17704 
</p>
<p>264. It was also reported to the Working Group that Indian law permits members of the 
armed forces accused of crimes to be prosecuted by either the military or civilian justice 
systems. However, the existing legislation such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act 
allegedly makes trials by civilian courts unlikely in practice. Court martials are reportedly 
held in secret and provide no opportunity for families to render their testimony. 
</p>
<p>265. There is also concern that when the National Human Rights Commission receives 
complaints of human rights violations by the Armed Forces, it cannot independently 
investigate the case but can only seek a report from the central government. In addition, the 
State Human Rights Commission of Jammu and Kashmir is legally unable to order 
prosecution against members of the security forces without prior sanction by the national 
Home Ministry. 
</p>
<p>266. Finally, the Working Group was also informed of alleged harassment, intimidation 
and coercion of family members to withdraw their complaints. There are some reported 
cases of violent reprisals for those families seeking redress. In addition, families are 
allegedly not entitled to any reparation or compensation for the death or disappearances of 
their family members, even when the perpetrators are identified. The only recourse they 
have is to receive ex gratia payment, which is only awarded after the families obtain both a 
death certificate and a certificate from the district authorities indicating that the victim was 
not involved in militancy. Families are reportedly pressured to drop legal proceedings or 
withdraw complaints in order to receive ex gratia payment. 
</p>
<p>267. In a separate allegation it was reported that the Government of India failed to 
address instances of enforced disappearances in the region of Kashmir, where it is alleged 
that the number of victims of enforced disappearances is much higher than officially 
reported. 
</p>
<p>268. According to the information received, enforced disappearances are being 
committed by military and paramilitary forces. There are further allegations that these 
forces at times have informed the families of the disappeared person that the disappeared 
person has been released, but the victim never returns home. It is also alleged that, on 
occasion, the family of the disappeared person is told that the disappeared person was 
killed, while trying to escape, or while engaged in militant activity. It is alleged that some 
families of the disappeared have been subject to intimidation, and fear reprisals, when 
attempting to use various remedies to determine the fate and whereabouts of the 
disappeared person. 
</p>
<p>269. The Working Group regrets that no response was received from the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>270. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 430 cases to the 
Government; of those, 10 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by

<p><b>  Summary of the allegations 
</b></p>
<p>275. Information was submitted by sources to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
reportedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was 
transmitted to the Government after the eighty-sixth session. </p>


<p><b>62</b> GE.09-17704 
</p>
<p>276. According to the information received, retired Major General Muchdi 
Purwopranjono, former Deputy of the State Intelligence Agency, was charged with plotting 
and ordering the killing of Mr. Munir Said Thalib, former Chairman of the Asian 
Federation Against Involuntary Disappearances, who was poisoned with arsenic while he 
was aboard Garuda Airlines, on 7 September 2004, travelling to Geneva to participate in 
the Inter-Sessional Working Group established to draft the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances.  
</p>
<p>277. It was reported that Major General Muchdi Purwopranjono was arrested on 19 June 
2008, and in August 2008 the court proceedings started. On 31 December 2008, based on 
the verdict of the district Court in South Jakarta, Major General Muchdi Purwopranjono 
was acquitted of all charges and released. The court allegedly did not take into account 
important evidence brought to light by an independent investigation team formed by virtue 
of Presidential Decision No. 111/2004 which strongly suggested, through the provision of 
compelling evidences, the involvement of the State Intelligence Agency in the death of Mr. 
Munir Said Thalib.  
</p>
<p>278. Mr. Munir Said Thalib was a prominent human rights defender whose activity in the 
struggle against enforced disappearance was publicly known. The attack on Mr. Munir Said 
Thalib&#8217;s life, apart from being a violation of his rights and those of his relatives, has been 
committed as a general threat against all those struggling against enforced disappearance, 
individually or as an association. It is of the utmost importance that the circumstances 
surrounding Mr. Munir Said Thalib&#8217;s death are thoroughly and impartially elucidated and 
that all those responsible are judged by an impartial, independent and competent tribunal, 
and receive sanctions which take into consideration the gravity of their crimes.  
</p>
<p>279. The Working Group regrets that no response was received from the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>280. On 12 December 2006, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
mission to Indonesia. The Government responded that it would not be possible to receive 
the Working Group during 2007 and that greater benefit would be derived from a visit at a 
later date. A reminder letter was sent on 3 April 2008; the Government has not yet 
responded. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>281. The Working Group reiterates its observations made in previous reports, since it 
received no information from the Government thereon.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>282. The Working Group encourages the Government of Indonesia, in cooperation with 
the Government of Timor-Leste, to communicate with the Working Group to further the 
clarification of all outstanding cases.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>283. The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligations under the 
Declaration to conduct thorough and impartial investigations &#8220;for as long as the fate of the 
victim of enforced disappearance remains unclarified&#8221; (art. 13.6).<b> 
</b>284. The Working Group reiterates its request for a visit, to which the Government had 
indicated that the visit could not take place at the proposed time, and looks forward to 
receiving proposed dates as soon as possible.<b>

practice of renditions and secret detention. The role of the Government in this practice 
allegedly consisted of allowing the use of its airports to transport victims of rendition. 
Those planes stopped over in those airports during the process of transferring, taking, 
delivering, or returning detainees from the rendition. It is believed that the use of these 
planes, without the control and scrutiny of the Governments, was essential to facilitate and 
implement the rendition programme. In some cases, these planes were used to detain 
individuals in Europe, while in other cases victims of enforced disappearances were 
transported in and out of Europe. The Government allegedly allowed these planes to land 
on its territories without adopting any measure to prevent their use for secret detention and 
rendition. </p>

<p><b>  Summary of the allegations 
</b></p>
<p>310. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles reportedly encountered 
in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was transmitted to the 
Government after the Working Group&#8217;s eighty-seventh session.  
</p>
<p>311. It was reported that the Government of Italy was involved in 2003 in a practice of 
renditions and secret detention. Victims of rendition were generally held in prolonged 
detention in secret facilities, with no access by the ICRC, no notification to families and no 
notification of their legal status and rights. There was no oversight of the conditions of 
detention and the treatment of the detainees. There was also no information about the 
procedures in place to decide about their detention and its duration. This practice is 
believed to amount to enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>312. The role of the Government in this practice allegedly included the detention of 
persons inside its territory and their extrajudicial transfer overseas or to the custody of 
foreign intelligence agencies or others. 
</p>
<p>313. According to the information received, airports in Italy were used by planes that 
transported victims of rendition. Those planes stopped over in those airports during the 
process of transferring, taking, delivering, or returning detainees from the rendition. It is 
believed that the use of these planes, without the control and scrutiny of the Government, 
was essential to facilitate and implement the rendition programme. In some cases, these 
planes were used to detain individuals in Europe, while in other cases victims of enforced 
disappearances were transported in and out of Europe. The Government allegedly allowed 
these planes to land on its territory without adopting any measure to prevent their use for 
secret detention and rendition. </p>


<p>GE.09-17704 <b>69 
</b></p>
<p>314. According to reports received, the Government of Italy was reluctant to investigate 
thoroughly allegations of enforced disappearance connected to renditions by claiming 
confidentiality on national security or State secrecy. Prosecutors in Italy investigated cases 
of abductions and other crimes carried out on the Italian territory which led to extradition 
requests. It reportedly failed to undertake effective, independent and impartial 
investigations into the role of State officials and the use of State territory in connection with 
enforced disappearance. Reportedly, investigations and determinations of human rights 
complaints in cases of rendition and secret detention were blocked by the Government. No 
remedies have been provided for the victims and their families, which includes, in some 
cases, the establishment of the fate and whereabouts of people who have disappeared.

<p>315. The Working Group regrets that no response was received from the Government.

two recent ones. A summary of the situation in the country appears in document 
E/CN.4/2006/56 and Corr.1.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>379. The Government transmitted two communications to the Working Group dated 16 
June and 24 September 2009, as reported below. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of the allegations 
</b></p>
<p>380. Information was submitted by sources to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
reportedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was 
transmitted to the Government after the Working Group&#8217;s eighty-seventh session. 
</p>
<p>381. The Working Group has been informed that there were reasonable grounds to 
believe that enforced disappearances have occurred and are still occurring on a massive 
scale in Namibia. Allegedly, Namibia&#8217;s de facto state of emergency was used to create 
conditions to perpetrate enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>382. It has been reported that between 27 November 1999 and 20 December 1999, a 
group of 40 men aged between 14 and 56 disappeared soon after Namibian security forces 
rounded them up in the Kavango Region. Allegedly, Special Field Force members took 
these men and accused them of being UNITA (Unit&#227;o Nacional pela Independ&#234;ncia Total 
de Angola) sympathizers, supporters, collaborators and members. On 12 August 2000, 18 
members of the Kxoe indigenous minority disappeared without a trace. Their disappearance 
came soon after they had been jointly detained in Western Caprivi by members of the </p>


<p>GE.09-17704 <b>83 
</b></p>
<p>National Defense Force&#8217;s First Battalion, and Special Field Force members. They were also 
accused of sympathizing, supporting and collaborating with UNITA. However, it has been 
reported that no positive proof has ever been produced and no charges have ever been 
brought against those disappeared in a court of law as contemplated in article 12 (1) (a) of 
the Namibian Constitution. 
</p>
<p>383. The Working Group has also been informed that on 16 August 2000, another group 
of more than 30 Kxoe San villagers disappeared without a trace following sweeps by 
Namibian security forces. Reportedly, the villagers were rounded up at Chetto, Bwabwata, 
Omega, Mutjiku and Bagani villages after they had been accused of &#8220;collaborating with 
UNITA&#8221; and/or Caprivi Liberation Army (CLA) guerrillas. 
</p><p>384. It has been further reported that individual persons have allegedly disappeared in the 
Kavango and Caprivi regions, some at the hands of the National Defense Force&#8217;s First 
Battalion members. 
</p>
<p>385. As a result, it is alleged that several gravesites can be found on the Namibian 
territory, with the remains of disappeared persons. Gravesites were allegedly found near 
Oidilona village in the Omulunga area; at Omamwandi village, some 15 kilometres north of 
the Namibian border; in the bush at Okakango Kongolo area, some 10 kilometres north of 
the Namibian border; in Oluungu forest near Olupale Village; in the Odila village area; and 
inside Namibia, between Ohauwanga and Oshingadu villages.  
</p>
<p><b>  Replies from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>386. On 16 June and 24 September 2009, the Government replied to this general 
allegation. In the first communication it requested more time as the reply required the input 
of several departments. In the second communication the Government stated that the 
Constitution of the country clearly lays out the framework for the protection of human 
rights of Namibian citizens and that there are enforceable and readily available remedies 
open to any citizen or resident of Namibia who alleges or feels that any of the rights 
guaranteed by the Namibian Constitution have been violated. Individuals, unhindered in 
any way, can seek redress in civil courts or in criminal courts, if the violation amounts to a 
criminal act, including for the crime of enforced or involuntary disappearance. In criminal 
cases, individuals can lodge complaints with the police without any expenses involved. 
Extrajudicial remedies are available through the Office of the Ombudsman at expenses. 
</p><p>387. Namibian police and other law enforcement agencies give serious attention to the 
crime of enforced or involuntary disappearances through investigations. When the police 
have reasons to believe that such an act has been committed, the case is properly 
investigated to enable the criminal process to take its course through courts. Even if the 
case is dismissed in a trial, it is a possibility to hold an inquest, presided over by a judicial 
officer. It is clear therefore that Namibia, as a country founded on the principles of the rule 
of law and democracy, has more than enough remedies available to aggrieved persons. 
</p>
<p>388. The Government also stated that both the rights to freedom of expression and to life 
are entrenched in the Namibian Constitution. Referring to the allegations made, the 
Government stated that a case was brought before the High Court of Namibia by the Legal 
Assistance Centre on behalf of the relatives of the missing persons, seeking their immediate 
release. The High Court ruled that the Government could not be held liable to release 
people that it did not have in custody.  
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>389. Since its establishment, the Working Group transmitted three cases to the 
Government; all remain outstanding. </p>


<p><b>84</b> GE.09-17704 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>390. The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligations under the 
Declaration: no State shall practice, permit or tolerate enforced disappearances (art. 2), each 
State shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent 
and terminate acts of enforced disappearance in any territory under its jurisdiction (art. 3), 
the obligation to investigate all cases of enforced disappearances (art. 13.1), each State shall 
ensure that the competent authority shall have the necessary powers and resources to 
conduct the investigation effectively, including powers to compel attendance of witnesses 
and production of relevant documents and to make immediate on-site visits (art. 13.2), 
protection against ill-treatment and reprisals (art. 13.3), and to conduct thorough and 
impartial investigations &#8220;for as long as the fate of the victim of enforced disappearance 
remains unclarified&#8221; (art. 13.6). 
</p><p>391. The Working Group calls upon the Government to sign and ratify the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and accept the 
competence of the Committee under articles 31 and 32.

<p>395. On 19 December 2008, the Working Group issued a press release welcoming the 
report on Conflict-related Disappearances in Bardiya District, presented by the United 
Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal (OHCHR-Nepal) 
thanks to which the Working Group received many cases. The Working Group underlined 
one of the main recommendations of the report, concerning the creation of a commission of 
inquiry to look into disappearances. It took the opportunity to acknowledge the positive 
steps taken by the Government of Nepal since its country visit in December 2004. However 
it underlined that there is still work to be done in the implementation of the 
recommendations made by the Working Group, such as the criminalization of enforced 
disappearances in domestic law. It reiterated its request for a follow-up visit to Nepal, in an 
effort to assist the Government in preventing future disappearances and to address the 
issues of impunity and reparations (the full text of the press release can be consulted at: 
http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/D5EE2B6E0334A714C125752400541

</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>396. On 12 May 2006, the Working Group requested to undertake a follow-up mission to 
Nepal. A reminder letter was sent on 20 July 2009. On 2 October 2009, the Government 
informed the Working Group that, due to the limited capacities of the country and other 
engagements, it is unable to extend an invitation to visit the country.  
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>397. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 672 cases to the 
Government; of those, 79 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
sources, 135 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 458 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>398. The Working Group reiterates its previous observation regarding the Government&#8217;s 
obligations under the Declaration, &#8220;to bring to justice all persons presumed responsible for 
an act of enforced disappearance&#8221; (art. 13), that &#8220;persons alleged to have committed any 
acts referred to in article 4, paragraph 1, shall be suspended from any official duties during 
the investigation&#8221; (art. 16.1) and persons &#8220;shall be tried only by the competent ordinary 
courts in each State, and not by any other special tribunal, in particular military courts&#8221; (art. 
16.2). 
</p><p>399. The Working Group sent a letter on 19 September 2008 to the Government of Nepal 
requesting a written report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Working 
Group following its country visit in 2004. The Working Group regrets that no written report 
was received. 
</p>

<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>414. The Working Group received three communications from the Government, dated 20 
November 2008, 2 February and 3 June 2009. The first two concerning one case: the 
information was considered insufficient to clarify it. The third communication was sent in 
reply to a communication sent on 29 August 2008, jointly with other three special 
procedures mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>415. Information was received from sources concerning one case, which did not lead to a 
clarification. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of the allegations 
</b></p>
<p>416. The Working Group received information from sources concerning reported 
obstacles encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was 
transmitted to the Government after its eighty-sixth session through the following general 
allegation. 
</p>
<p>417. It was reported that notwithstanding the large number of disappearances in the 
Philippines, the Court of Appeals recently dismissed <i>amparo</i> petitions for the supposed 
failure of the petitioners to prove that their rights to life, liberty or security were violated or 
under threat. According to the information received, the burden to obtain visible or apparent 
evidence of threats is being placed on the victims rather than on government agencies. </p>


<p><b>90</b> GE.09-17704 
</p>
<p>418. There is also concern that one petition was dismissed on the ground that the subjects 
purportedly chose to remain in the custody of the military. However, if there is no arrest 
warrant, the Court cannot order that a victim remain in the custody of the Armed Forces. 
</p>
<p>419. It is alleged that this spate of decisions will only encourage the ongoing impunity. 
</p>
<p>420. The Working Group regrets that no reply was received from the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>421. On 24 May 2006, the Working Group requested to undertake a mission to the 
Philippines. A reminder was sent on 3 April 2008. No response has been received from the 
Government. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>422. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 780 cases to the 
Government; of those, 35 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
sources, 126 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 619 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>423. The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligations under the 
Declaration, to prevent ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal against those involved in the 
investigation (art. 13.3), to take steps &#8220;to ensure that any ill treatment, intimidation, reprisal 
or any other form of interference on the occasion of the lodging of a complaint or during 
the investigation procedure is appropriately punished&#8221; (art. 13.5) and that &#8220;investigations 
should be conducted for as long as the fate of the victim of enforced disappearance remains 
unclarified&#8221; (art. 13.6). 
</p><p>424. The Working Group calls upon the Government to sign and ratify the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and accept the 
competence of the Committee under articles 31 and 32.

<p><b>  Summary of the allegations 
</b></p>
<p>425. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles reportedly encountered 
in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was transmitted to the 
Government after the Working Group&#8217;s eighty-seventh session.  
</p>
<p>426. It was reported that between 2001 and 2005 the Government of Poland was involved 
in a practice of renditions and secret detention. Victims of rendition were generally held in 
prolonged detention in secret facilities, with no access to the ICRC, no notification to 
families and no notification of their legal status and rights. There was no oversight of the 
conditions of detention and the treatment of the detainees. There was also no information 
about the procedures in place to decide about their detention and its duration. This practice 
is believed to amount to enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>427. According to the information received, Poland allowed secret detention facilities in 
its territory. 
</p>
<p>428. It was also reported to the Working Group that airports in Poland were used by 
planes that transported victims of rendition. Those planes stopped over in those airports 
during the process of transferring, taking, delivering, or returning detainees from the 
rendition. It is believed that the use of these planes, without the control and scrutiny of the 
Government, was essential to facilitate and implement the rendition programme. In some 
cases, these planes were used to detain individuals in European territory, while in other 
cases victims of enforced disappearances were transported in and out of European space. 
The Government of Poland allegedly allowed these planes to land on its territory without 
adopting any measure to prevent their use for secret detention and rendition. 
</p>
<p>429. According to reports received, the Government of Poland was reluctant to 
thoroughly investigate allegations of enforced disappearance connected to renditions. The 
Government reportedly failed to undertake effective, independent and impartial 
investigation into the role of state officials and the use of state territory in connection with 
enforced disappearance. No remedies have been provided for the victims and their families, 
which includes, in some cases, the establishment of the fate and whereabouts of people who 
have disappeared. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>430. On 15 June 2009, the Government replied to this general allegation stating that on 
11 March 2008, the District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in Warsaw instituted proceedings on the 
alleged existence secret prisons in Poland as well as the illegal transport and detention of 
persons suspected of terrorism. On 1 April 2009, as result of the reorganization of the 
Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office the investigation was referred to the Appellate Prosecutor Office 
in Warsaw. In the course of investigation the prosecutors gather evidence which is 
considered as classified or secret. In order to secure the proper course of proceedings the 
prosecutors who conduct the investigation are bound by the confidentiality of the case. In 
this connection it is impossible to present any information regarding the findings of the 
investigation. Once the proceedings are completed and its results and findings are made 
public the Government of Poland will present and submit all necessary or requested </p>

<p>information to any international body. The Government of Poland disagrees with statement 
included in the general allegation that it was reluctant to investigate thoroughly the cases of 
enforced disappearances connected to renditions and that it reportedly failed to undertake 
effective, independent and impartial investigation into the role of the state officials and the 
use of state territory in connection with enforced disappearances.

<p>432. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles reportedly encountered 
in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was transmitted to the 
Government after the Working Group&#8217;s eighty-seventh session.  
</p>
<p>433. It was reported that the Government of Portugal was involved in 2003 in a practice 
of renditions and secret detention. The role of the Government in this practice allegedly 
consisted of allowing the use of the airports of Portugal by planes operated that transported 
victims of rendition. Those planes stopped over in those airports during the process of 
transferring, taking, delivering, or returning detainees from the rendition.  It is believed that 
the use of these planes, without the control and scrutiny of the Governments, was essential 
to facilitate and implement the rendition programme. In some cases, these planes were used 
to detain individuals in Europe, while in other cases victims of enforced disappearances </p>


<p>GE.09-17704 <b>93 
</b></p>
<p>were transported in and out of Europe. The Government allegedly allowed these planes to 
land on its territories without adopting any measure to prevent their use for secret detention 
and rendition. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>434. On 21 June 2009, the Government replied to this general allegation stating that it is 
baseless. The alleged involvement of the Government in the practice of rendition and secret 
detention has been raised previously in two enquiries conducted in 2006 respectively by the 
Secretary-General of the Council of Europe and by the European Parliament.  
</p>
<p>435. The Portuguese authorities never issued nor received any request for an overflight or 
landing authorization of an aircraft of the type allegedly used to transport victims of 
rendition. There is no evidence that any aircraft of such a type has entered and used 
Portuguese airspace. 
</p>
<p>436. Regarding the measures undertaken to ensure that airports in Portuguese territory 
were not used to transport victims of rendition, the Government replied that strict control 
mechanisms are in place regarding transiting aircrafts and that they are strictly adhered to 
although the procedures and the authorities responsible differ in case of civil or military 
aircrafts. 
</p>
<p>437. Regarding the investigations which were undertaken, the Government affirmed that 
in addition to those carried out to reply to the Council of Europe and the European 
Parliament, which involved several ministries, a specific investigation was undertaken by 
the Public Prosecution Service from February 2007 to June 2009 and concluded for lack of 
evidence. The Service is a branch of the Magistracy which is autonomous from the 
executive power. 
</p>
<p>438. As for the existence of prompt and effective remedy for victims of enforced 
disappearances and their families, the Government stated that the Constitution provide 
those guarantees, specifically in article 27. Those victims who cannot afford a legal 
representative can rely on the Public Prosecution Service to prepare on their behalf an 
application for compensation. No victim of enforced disappearances has ever requested 
reparation by the Portuguese Government. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>439. The Working Group notes that the Government has signed the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and calls upon 
the Government to ratify it and accept the competence of the Committee under articles 31 
and 32.

</p>
<p>441. According to the information received, between 2001 and 2005 the Government of 
Romania was involved in a practice of renditions and secret detention. Victims of rendition 
were generally held in prolonged detention in secret facilities, with no access to the ICRC,

</p>
<p>444. According to reports received, the Government of Romania was reluctant to

claiming confidentiality on national security or state secrecy. The Government reportedly 
failed to undertake effective, independent and impartial investigation into the role of state 
officials and the use of state territory in connection with enforced disappearance. 
Reportedly, investigations and determinations of human rights complaints in cases of 
rendition and secret detention were blocked by the Government. No remedies have been 
provided for the victims and their families, which includes, in some cases, the 
establishment of the fate and whereabouts of people who have disappeared.

<p>479. The Working Group transmitted to the Government one newly-reported case 
concerning <b>Abel Ballart Sans</b>, last seen in March 1946 in the military barracks of Portant 
(Vall de Aran). 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>480. The Government of Spain transmitted three communications dated 5 and 26 
February and 18 June 2009. In the first communication, the Government requested more 
information on three of the outstanding cases. The second communication included a reply 
to the general allegation sent on 16 January 2009, and the third a reply to the general 
allegation sent on 15 May 2009.  
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of the general allegations 
</b></p>
<p>481. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles reportedly encountered 
in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was transmitted to the 
Government in two separate allegations after the Working Group&#8217;s eighty-sixth and eighty-
seventh sessions. 
</p>
<p>482.  In the first allegation, it was reported that there have been no investigations into 
disappearances that took place during the Spanish Civil War and General Francisco 
Franco&#8217;s regime even though, under the continuous crimes doctrine for disappearances that 
remain unresolved, they continue to be committed. Allegedly, the Amnesty Law, adopted in 
1977, applied statutory limitations for all crimes committed during the above-mentioned 
periods, including enforced disappearances. This law reportedly prevents any investigations 
from taking place. In addition, information was provided about the Historical Memory Law, 
adopted in 2007, alleging that it fails to address the crime of enforced disappearance, and 
does not provide victims with an effective remedy, undermining their rights to truth, justice 
and reparation. 
</p>
<p>483. It was also reported that thousands of children disappeared in Spain between 1940 
and 1954. Some of these children were allegedly placed in orphanages and given up for 
adoption, and in many cases had their names changed in the National Registry.  
</p>
<p>484. There is also concern that family members of the disappeared face recurring 
obstacles and harassment by the authorities when trying to exhume corpses found in 
clandestine graves that have been uncovered. 
</p>
<p>485. In a separate allegation, it was reported that the Government of Spain was involved 
in 2003 in a practice of renditions and secret detention. The role of the Government in this 
practice allegedly consisted of allowing the use of the airports of Spain by planes to 
transport victims of rendition. Those planes stopped over in those airports during the 
process of transferring, taking, delivering, or returning detainees from the rendition. It is 
believed that the use of these planes, without the control and scrutiny of the Government, 
was essential to facilitate and implement the rendition programme. In some cases, these 
planes were used to detain individuals in Europe, while in other cases victims of enforced 
disappearances were transported in and out of Europe. The Government allegedly allowed </p>


<p>GE.09-17704 <b>103 
</b></p>
<p>these planes to land on its territories without adopting any measure to prevent their use for 
secret detention and rendition. 
</p>
<p><b>  Replies from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>486. The Government replied to the first allegation on 26 February 2009, rejecting the 
substance of the allegations made and underlining the manifest lack of exactness and 
precision of the information on which they are based. Regarding the allegation that there 
have been no investigations into disappearances that took place during the Spanish civil war 
and General Franco&#8217;s regime, the Government quoted a number of measures that have been 
taken since 2004, including the creation of the Historical Memory Documentation Centre, 
and the passing of a law in 2007, which recognizes and expands rights and establishes 
measures for persons who suffered persecution or violence during the civil war and 
dictatorship. The Government further indicated that an order handed down by a judge and a 
communication of the Directorate-General of Registers and Notaries state the obligation for 
all those in charge of municipal and consular civil registries and the Central Civil Registry 
to &#8220;allow access to the main and subsidiary Civil Registry of the judicial police designated 
by the aforementioned Central Investigating Court, for the purpose of identifying possible 
victims who disappeared after 17 July 1936&#8221;. The General Commissariat of Judicial Police 
was created within the Directorate-General of the Police and Civil Guard as the competent 
body to ascertain whether any cases of criminal liability arose during the civil war and the 
period of General Franco&#8217;s dictatorship.  
</p>
<p>487. Regarding the allegation about the Amnesty Law, the Government replied that while 
it is provided in certain cases as a form of extinction of criminal liability, there is a need to 
differentiate between amnesty and pardon, the latter being release from punishment for a 
previously sanctioned offence, which has first been subject to the process of being brought 
to trial and criminal proceedings instituted. A distinction should also be made between 
amnesty and the application of statutory limitations. The latter is based on the premise in 
law that penalization is deemed inappropriate after a certain amount of time has elapsed if 
the principle of legal certainty and immediacy is applied rationally in the prosecution and 
penalization of offences. The application of statutory limitations is not a pardon but a 
decision not to punish an offence for practical reasons, due to the acceptance by the public 
authorities of the ineffectiveness of criminal proceedings after a certain lapse of time. 
</p>
<p>488. The Amnesty Law cannot, and must not, be confused with the so-called &#8220;Clean Slate 
Acts&#8221;. Moreover, and in conformity with article 9 of the Amnesty Law, its implementation 
will, in all cases, fall exclusively to the relevant judges, courts and judicial authorities, who 
will make final decisions on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the procedural laws in 
force. Investigations into enforced disappearances have been carried out in all cases where 
a request has been made by an interested party and no decision has ever been handed down 
based on the Amnesty Law.  
</p>
<p>489. Regarding the allegation that the Historical Memory Law fails to address the crime 
of enforced disappearance, the Government replied that its purpose is not to criminalize and 
penalize the crime of enforced disappearance but to promote measures that might contribute 
to us learning more about our history and fostering the democratic memory, all in the 
framework of the spirit of reconciliation.  
</p>
<p>490. Furthermore, the Historical Memory Law does not specifically focus on the crime of 
enforced disappearances, since there are already more than 80 existing legislative and 
regulatory measures to cover this kind of offence and offer forms of moral reparation and 
compensation (a list of current measures adopted is attached).  
</p><p>491. Regarding the allegation that thousands of children were allegedly placed in 
orphanages and given up for adoption, and in many cases had their names changed in the </p>


<p><b>104</b> GE.09-17704 
</p>
<p>National Registry, the Government replied that it is a too general statement. It is true that 
during the civil war, children were given up for adoption and changes of name were 
recorded in the Civil Registry in cases where these children were declared orphans. 
However, it is also true that the particular circumstances, procedures, and especially the 
reasons, varied enormously from case to case. 
</p>
<p>492. Regarding the allegation that family members of the disappeared face harassment 
when trying to exhume corpses in clandestine graves that have been uncovered, the 
Government states that the statement is false given that, as explained above, the authorities 
took a number of legislative and administrative measures to facilitate the process.  
</p>
<p>493. Regarding the conduct of specific investigations the Government stated that a 
number of specific investigations have been conducted by the judiciary and the 
Government has also implemented a number of measures for the purpose of carrying out 
such investigations.  
</p>
<p>494. Regarding compensations and reparations for the victims of enforced 
disappearances, the Government stated that there exist a series of instruments for that. 
</p>
<p>495. Regarding the specific measures to assist the family members of victims in locating 
disappeared persons and to compensate them with the due reparations, the Government 
stated that the legislation includes various provisions for measures and instruments for 
public administrations to make it easier for interested parties to locate and identify 
disappeared persons, as a final mark of respect for them. It includes a protocol on 
exhumations and a mapping of the respective territories where the remains of disappeared 
persons may be located, provides for the possibility of public authorities to authorize 
searches for victims and establishes procedures for the direct descendants of the victims to 
recuperate the remains buried in the communal graves in order to identify them and, where 
appropriate, transfer them to another location. 
</p>
<p>496. The Government replied to the second general allegation on 18 June 2009 stating 
that it has conducted a thorough investigation into allegations that, since 2002, some 
Spanish airports have been used for the transfer of prisoners. According to all available 
information, there is nothing to indicate that flights used by Spanish military bases involve 
acts contrary to Spanish legislation or to Spain&#8217;s international obligations. 
</p>
<p>497. The Government of Spain has also requested assurances regarding the use of 
Spanish civilian airports for stopovers of covert flights for the purpose of transferring 
prisoners of the &#8220;extraordinary rendition&#8221; programme. 
</p>
<p>498. In addition, the Government has requested all possible information concerning 
stopovers of alleged covert flights and transmitted it to the competent judicial authority: the 
National High Court (Audiencia Nacional) and has complied with all requests made by that 
authority. 
</p>
<p>499. The Government of Spain has made public the results of its investigations and 
conclusions in this area. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Spain 
appeared before the Congress of Deputies in 2005 and 2008 and before the European 
Parliament in 2006 in order to testify on this matter. 
</p>
<p>500. The Government is unequivocal in its condemnation of the use of such methods and 
in its commitment to investigate and clarify the alleged events. Likewise, Spain takes a 
clear and firm position on the need for scrupulously applying national and international law 
and respecting human rights in all actions taken by the Government and its agents, and 
especially with regard to efforts to combat terrorism.  </p>

<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of the allegation 
</b></p>
<p>535. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles reportedly encountered 
in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was transmitted to the 
Government after its eighty-seventh session. 
</p>
<p>536. It was reported that in 2001 the Government of Sweden was involved in a practice of 
renditions and secret detention. The victims of rendition were held in prolonged detention 
in secret facility, with no access to the ICRC, no notification to their families and no 
notification of their legal status and rights. There was no oversight of the conditions of </p>


<p><b>110</b> GE.09-17704 
</p>
<p>detention and the treatment of the detainees. There was also no information about the 
procedures in place to decide about their detention and its duration. This practice is 
believed to amount to enforced disappearance and to involve other serious human rights 
violations, including torture or other ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>537. The role of the Government in this practice allegedly includes the detention of 
persons inside its territory and their extrajudicial transfer to the custody of foreign 
intelligence agencies. 
</p>
<p>538. There were also reports that the Government of Sweden was allegedly informed by 
the secret detention of a number of persons falling under its jurisdiction or protection and 
provided no information of their fate or whereabouts to their respective families. The 
Government did not seek to facilitate their return.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>539. On 8 July 2009, the Government replied to the general allegation stating that it noted 
that the Working Group made general reference to information received from sources 
without any further specification concerning the nature of these sources. Unfortunately, 
based on the general and unspecified information provided by the Working Group, the 
Government is not in a position to provide substantive answers to the questions posed by 
the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>540. With the view to investigate earlier allegations put forward in Swedish media 
regarding the Government&#8217;s involvement in renditions, the Government instructed the 
Swedish Civil Aviation Authority and the LFV Group (Swedish Airports and Air 
Navigation Services) to carry out an investigation into the exact circumstances of all flights 
made by aircrafts suspected of being allegedly used to carry out renditions between 1 
January 2002 and 17 November 2005. The results of the investigations have been presented 
in two reports of 7 December 2005 and 15 December 2005 and included more than 19,000 
flights, both arrivals and departures. The finding of the reports is that it cannot be 
concluded that any of these flights were connected to the alleged practice of rendition. 
These reports have inter alia been submitted to the Secretary General of the Council of 
Europe. Finally, the Government assures that no enforced disappearances have been 
sanctioned by the Government of Sweden or Swedish authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>541. The Working Group notes that the Government has signed the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and calls upon 
the Government to ratify it and accept the competence of the Committee under articles 31 
and 32.

<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of the allegations 
</b></p>
<p>559. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles reportedly encountered 
in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was transmitted to the 
Government after the Working Group&#8217;s eighty-seventh session.  
</p>
<p>560. According to the reports, in 2004 the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia was involved in a practice of renditions and secret detention. Victims of 
rendition were generally held in prolonged incommunicado detention in secret facilities, 
with no access to the ICRC, no notification to families and no notification of their legal 
status and rights. There was no oversight of the conditions of detention and the treatment of 
the detainees. There was also no information about the procedures in place to decide about 
their detention and its duration. This practice is believed to amount to enforced 
disappearance. 
</p>
<p>561. The role of the Government in this practice allegedly included the detention of 
persons inside its territory and their extrajudicial transfer overseas or to the custody of 
foreign intelligence agencies or others. 
</p>
<p>562. According to reports received, the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia was reluctant to investigate thoroughly allegations of enforced disappearance 
connected to renditions. The Government reportedly failed to undertake effective, 
independent and impartial investigation into the role of state officials and the use of state 
territory in connection with enforced disappearance. No remedies have been provided for 
the victims and their families, which includes, in some cases, the establishment of the fate 
and whereabouts of people who have disappeared. 
</p>
<p>563. The Working Group regrets that no response was received from the Government.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>564. The Working Group notes that the Government has signed the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and calls upon 
the Government to ratify it and accept the competence of the Committee under articles 31 
and 32. </p>

</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of the allegations 
</b></p>
<p>594. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles reportedly encountered 
in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was transmitted to the 
Government after its eighty-seventh session.  
</p>
<p>595. It was reported that between 2002 and 2003 the Government of the United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was involved in a practice of renditions and secret 
detention. Victims of rendition were generally held in prolonged detention in secret 
facilities, with no access to the ICRC, no notification to families and no notification of their 
legal status and rights. There was no oversight of the conditions of detention and the 
treatment of the detainees. There was also no information about the procedures in place to 
decide about their detention and its duration. This practice is believed to amount to 
enforced disappearance and to involve other serious human rights violations, including 
torture or other ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>596. The role of the Government in this practice allegedly included the detention of 
persons inside its territory and their extrajudicial transfer overseas or to the custody of 
foreign intelligence agencies or others.  
</p>
<p>597. Reportedly, national intelligence agencies have also facilitated information, which is 
likely to have facilitated the illegal apprehension and transfer of a number of individuals. 
</p>
<p>598. According to the information received, airports in the United Kingdom were used by 
planes to transport victims of rendition. Those planes stopped over in those airports during 
the process of transferring, taking, delivering, or returning detainees from the rendition. It is 
believed that the use of these planes, without the control and scrutiny of the Government, </p>


<p>GE.09-17704 <b>125 
</b></p>
<p>was essential to facilitate and implement the rendition programme. The mentioned 
Government allegedly allowed these planes to land on its territory without adopting any 
measure to prevent their use for secret detention and rendition.  
</p>
<p>599. There were also reports that the Government of the United Kingdom was allegedly 
informed of the secret detention of a number of their residents and provided no information 
of their fate or whereabouts to their respective families. The Government did not ensure 
consular access for the victims of rendition and did not seek to facilitate their return.  
</p>
<p>600. It was also reported to the Working Group that the United Kingdom allowed the 
operation of secret detention facilities in Diego Garcia, a United Kingdom overseas 
territory in the Indian Ocean. It is alleged that this practice facilitated the occurrence of 
enforced disappearances.  
</p>
<p>601. According to reports received, the Government of the United Kingdom was reluctant 
to investigate thoroughly allegations of enforced disappearance connected to renditions. 
The Government reportedly failed to undertake effective, independent and impartial 
investigation into the role of state officials and the use of State territory in connection with 
enforced disappearance. No remedies have been provided for the victims and their families, 
which includes, in some cases, the establishment of the fate and whereabouts of people who 
have disappeared. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>602. On 17 August 2009 the Government of the United Kingdom replied to this general 
allegation stating that it unreservedly condemns any practice of &#8220;extraordinary rendition&#8221; to 
torture and any deprivation of liberty that amounts to placing individuals outside the 
protection of the law. Since 2001 it has not given permission for any rendition flights to 
pass through United Kingdom territory or airspace. Contrary to previous assurances, the 
British Government was informed that in February 2008 two cases of rendition flights 
refuelled at the United Kingdom Overseas Territory of Diego Garcia.  
</p>
<p>603. The Government was not aware of the flights at the time, and did not give 
permission for them to use British territory. It would only grant such permission if it was 
satisfied that the rendition would accord with United Kingdom law and our international 
obligations.  
</p>
<p>604. With regard to allegations of a detention facility on Diego Garcia, the British 
Government was informed that they have not interrogated any terrorist suspect or terrorism-
related detainee on Diego Garcia in any case since 11 September 2001, and that allegations 
of a holding facility on the island are inaccurate. 
</p>
<p>605. Regarding the investigations undertaken into issues related to rendition, the 
Government provided copies of a report on detention, dated 2005, and a report on rendition, 
dated 2007, which were produced by the Intelligence Security Committee (ISC), the United 
Kingdom body charged with oversight of the policy of the intelligence and security 
Agencies. The Committee concluded, and the Government agreed, that &#8220;where there is 
sufficient evidence of unlawful activity on board an aircraft in United Kingdom airspace, be 
it a rendition operation or otherwise, this would be investigated by United Kingdom 
authorities&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>606. The Working Group calls upon the Government to sign and ratify the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and accept the 
competence of the Committee under articles 31 and 32.  </p>

<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of the allegations 
</b></p>
<p>631. Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
reportedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was 
transmitted to the Government after the eighty-sixth session through the following general 
allegation. 
</p>
<p>632. The Working Group has been informed of the escalating phenomenon of enforced or 
involuntary disappearances of political party members and human rights defenders in 
Zimbabwe. 
</p>
<p>633. Allegedly, victims have been abducted from their homes or other locations by 
known or unknown individuals or groups. Sources inform that the silence of authorities in 
the face of such atrocities can only be perceived as acquiescence and a fuelling of impunity 
in regard to such violations. 
</p>
<p>634. It has been reported that victims of enforced disappearance have been subjected to 
systematic attacks, arrests, detention and persecution by state agents before they 
disappeared. It has further been reported that some victims were tortured in police custody 
and denied access to legal practitioners. 
</p>
<p>635. Sources report that there is an urgent need for the authorities to take concerted and 
visible action to identify the perpetrators of the crime of enforced or involuntary 
disappearances and hold them accountable. 
</p>
<p>636. The Working Group has been informed that the Zimbabwe Republic Police needs to 
take immediate, concrete and visible measures to minimize the occurrence of enforced or 
involuntary disappearances and its associated impunity. 
</p>
<p>637. The Working Group regrets that no response was received from the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>638. On 20 July 2009, the Working Group requested the Government for an invitation to 
undertake a mission to Zimbabwe. No reply has yet been received. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>639. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted six cases to the

sources, one case has been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and four remain outstanding. 
</p>

<p>641. All outstanding cases were retransmitted and regrettably no response was received 
from the Government. A summary of the situation in the country appears in document 
E/CN.4/2006/56 and Corr.1. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Areas of concern, conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>642. In 2009, the Working Group transmitted 456 newly-reported cases of disappearance 
to 25 Governments, 54 of which allegedly occurred during 2009. The Working Group used 
the urgent action procedure in 60 of these cases, which allegedly occurred within the three 
months preceding the receipt of the report by the Working Group. During the reporting 
period, the Working Group was able to clarify 36 cases of disappearance. 
</p>
<p>643. The Working Group is grateful for the cooperation received from a number of 
Governments. Nevertheless, it remains concerned that of the 82 States with outstanding 
cases, some Governments have never replied to the Working Group&#8217;s communications. 
Some Governments provide responses that do not contain relevant information. The 
Working Group urges those Governments to fulfil their obligations under the Declaration 
and the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights and its 
successor, the Human Rights Council. The cooperation of States is indispensable for 
discovering the fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons around the globe. 
</p>
<p>644. The Working Group acknowledges the efforts<b> </b>of States, many human rights 
defenders, non-governmental organizations, lawyers and others who untiringly work to 
know the fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons in very adverse circumstances in all 
parts of the world and reiterates its solidarity with the victims of enforced disappearance 
and their families.  </p>


<p><b>134</b> GE.09-17704 
</p>
<p>645. The Working Group continues to express its concern over the growing number of 
cases of enforced disappearances around the world. 
</p>
<p>646. The Working Group continues to be concerned about measures being taken while 
addressing terrorism and its implications for enforced disappearances. These include the 
enactment of legislation that restricts personal freedoms and weakens due process, random 
arrests committed during military operations, arbitrary detentions and extraordinary 
renditions, which amount to enforced disappearances. The Working Group calls upon 
States to take legislative, judicial and administrative or other measures to deal with this 
issue. The Working Group would like to reiterate its general comment on article 10 of the 
Declaration which states that &#8220;under no circumstances, including states of war or public 
emergency, can any State interests be invoked to justify or legitimize secret centres or 
places of detention which, by definition, would violate the Declaration, without exception&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>647. The Working Group is concerned that in many instances the military forces are 
allegedly responsible for many cases of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>648. The Working Group reminds States<b> </b>that enforced disappearance is a continuing 
offence and a continuous human rights violation for as long as the fate or whereabouts of 
the victim remains unclarified. States therefore should bear this in mind when enacting 
statutes of limitation. 
</p>
<p>649. The Working Group calls upon States to take specific legislative, administrative, 
judicial or other measures to prevent and eradicate enforced disappearances. States should 
also take specific measures under their criminal law to define enforced disappearances as an 
autonomous criminal offence and to bring their existing legislation in line with the 
Declaration. 
</p>
<p>650. The Working Group notes that in certain parts of the world impunity for enforced 
disappearance remains a problem. For this reason, the Working Group reminds States of 
their obligations under the Declaration to prevent impunity by taking lawful and 
appropriate steps to bring to justice those alleged to have committed enforced 
disappearances. The Working Group calls upon States to prosecute individuals who have 
committed enforced disappearances by competent ordinary courts at all stages of the legal 
process. 
</p>
<p>651. In the general comment that it adopted this year, the Working Group recognized 
&#8220;that the definition given by Article 7(1) of the Statute of the International Criminal Court 
now reflects customary international law and can thus be used to interpret and apply the 
provisions of the Declaration&#8221;. It calls on States, competent international organizations and 
tribunals to fully acknowledge this conclusion and draw all the legal consequences flowing 
from it.  
</p>
<p>652. The Working Group would like to emphasize the right to truth, which should be 
enjoyed by all victims of enforced disappearance. The Working Group recommends that 
States adopt measures to promote truth and reconciliation in their societies, as a means of 
implementing the right to truth and the right to integral reparation of victims of enforced 
disappearances. Based on its experience, the Working Group acknowledges that such 
processes are often crucial to prevent repetition of enforced disappearances and to clarify 
cases, by uncovering the truth of the fate or the whereabouts of disappeared persons. 
However, the Working Group underlines that reconciliation between the State and the 
victims of enforced disappearance cannot happen without the clarification of each 
individual case. The Working Group also stresses that measures taken to promote 
reconciliation should not be used as a substitute for bringing perpetrators to justice, in 
accordance with the principles provided for in the general comment on article 18.  </p>


<p>GE.09-17704 <b>135 
</b></p>
<p>653. The Working Group also reminds States of its general comment referring to article 
19 of the Declaration, which states that &#8220;in addition to the punishment of the perpetrators 
and the rights to monetary compensation, the right to obtain redress for acts of enforced 
disappearance under article 19 of the Declaration also includes the &#8216;means for as complete a 
rehabilitation as possible&#8217;&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>654. The Working Group notes a pattern of threats, intimidation and reprisals against 
victims of enforced disappearances, including family members, witnesses and human rights 
defenders working on such cases and calls upon States<b> </b>to take specific measures to prevent 
such acts, punish the perpetrators and protect those working on enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>655. As it is men who are usually the direct victims of enforced disappearances, it is the 
wives, mothers and children who often bear the consequences of the enforced 
disappearances and who are the persons most affected. The Working Group calls upon 
States to provide sufficient support to those affected by enforced disappearances. For this 
reason, the Working Group intends to explore and study the effect of enforced 
disappearances on women and children.  
</p>
<p>656. Country visits are an integral part of the fulfilment of the Working Group&#8217;s mandate, 
as they allow the Working Group to highlight country practices in addressing enforced 
disappearances, to assist States in reducing obstacles to the implementation of the 
Declaration, and to ensure access to those family members who might not be able to attend 
the Working Group&#8217;s sessions in Geneva. The Working Group would like to thank the 
Governments that have extended invitations to visit their countries or have hosted the 
Working Group&#8217;s sessions. However, because informal confirmations and even standing 
invitations are not sufficient, the Working Group invites all the Governments that received 
a request by the Working Group for a visit to respond with specific dates as soon as 
possible. 
</p>
<p>657. The Working Group notes with satisfaction that, as of November 2009, 81 States 
have signed and 16 States have ratified the International Convention for the Protection of 
all Persons from Enforced Disappearance. It reiterates that the Convention&#8217;s entry into 
force will help strengthen the capacities of States to reduce the number of disappearances. 
The Convention will bolster the hopes and the demands for justice and truth by victims and 
their families. The Working Group once again calls upon Governments that have not signed 
and/or ratified the Convention to do so as soon as possible so that the Convention can enter 
into force in the near future. It also calls upon States, when ratifying the Convention, to 
accept the competence of the Committee to receive individual cases, under article 31, and 
inter-State complaints under article 32 of the Convention.  
</p>
<p>658. Noting that the Working Group celebrates its thirtieth anniversary in 2010, it 
believes that the International Day of the Disappeared, traditionally observed by civil 
society on 30 August, ought to be commemorated by the United Nations and by all people 
around the world. Therefore the Working Group calls upon the United Nations to proclaim 
30 August United Nations International Day of the Disappeared, with a view to the 
eradication of enforced disappearances.  
</p>
<p>659. In the past two years, the Working Group has more than doubled its volume of work 
both in terms of number of cases processed and the number of communications sent to the 
Governments while having its staff reduced in 2009. Should the Working Group want to 
keep its present level of capacity to handle cases, not increase the small backlog that it 
presently has, continue the fruitful dialogue with Governments, and deal with a specific 
range of issues like women and children, it will clearly need more support. The Working 
Group calls upon the United Nations to secure additional appropriate resources and an 
increase in the level of staffing. </p>

<p><b>Annexes 
</b></p>
<p><b>Annex I 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Revised methods of work of the Working Group on Enforced 
or Involuntary Disappearances 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Adopted on 14 November 2009 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Legal basis for the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances&#8217; methods of work 
are based on its mandate as stipulated originally in Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 20 (XXXVI) and as developed by the Commission<b> </b>and its successor the Human 
Rights Council in numerous further resolutions. The parameters of its work are laid down in 
the Charter of the United Nations, the International Bill of Human Rights, Economic and 
Social Council resolution 1235 (XLI) and the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced or Involuntary Disappearance, adopted by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992 (hereinafter referred to as &#8220;the Declaration&#8221;).  
</p>
<p><b>  Humanitarian mandate 
</b></p>
<p>2. The basic mandate of the Working Group (WGEID) is humanitarian in nature, 
aimed at assisting families in determining the fate and whereabouts of their disappeared 
relatives who are placed outside the protection of the law. To this end, the WGEID 
endeavours to establish a channel of communication between the families and the 
Governments concerned, with a view to ensuring that sufficiently documented and clearly 
identified individual cases which families, directly or indirectly, have brought to the 
Group&#8217;s attention are investigated with a view to clarifying the fate or whereabouts of the 
disappeared persons. In transmitting cases of disappearance, the WGEID deals exclusively 
with Governments, basing itself on the principle that Governments must assume 
responsibility for any violation of human rights on their territory.  
</p>
<p><b>  Monitoring mandate  
</b></p>
<p>3. In addition to its original mandate, WGEID has been entrusted by the General 
Assembly, the former Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council with 
various tasks. In particular, WGEID is to monitor States&#8217; compliance with their obligations 
deriving from the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance<b> </b>and to provide to Governments with assistance in its implementation.  
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group reminds the Governments of their obligations not only in the 
context of clarifying individual cases but also that of taking action of a more general nature. 
It draws the attention of Governments and non-governmental organizations to general or 
specific aspects of the Declaration, it recommends ways of overcoming obstacles to the 
realization of the Declaration, it discusses with representatives of Governments and non-
governmental organizations how to solve specific problems in the light of the Declaration, 
it assists Governments by carrying out on-the-spot visits, organizing seminars and 
providing similar advisory services. WGEID also makes observations on the 
implementation of the Declaration when the concerned Government has not fulfilled its </p>


<p>GE.09-17704 <b>137 
</b></p>
<p>obligations related to the rights to truth, justice and reparation. The WGEID adopts general 
comments whenever it considers that a provision of the Declaration requires further 
clarification or interpretation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Definition of enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>5. As defined in the preamble of the Declaration, enforced disappearances occur when 
persons are arrested, detained or abducted against their will or otherwise deprived of their 
liberty by officials of different branches or levels of Government or by organized groups or 
private individuals acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or 
acquiescence of the Government, followed by a refusal to disclose the fate or whereabouts 
of the persons concerned or a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of their liberty, which 
places such persons outside the protection of the law.  
</p>
<p><b>  Definition of perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Working Group operates for purposes of its work on the basis that, in 
accordance with the definition contained in the Preamble of the Declaration, enforced 
disappearances are only considered as such when the act in question is perpetrated by State 
actors or by private individuals or organized groups (e.g. paramilitary groups) acting on 
behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or acquiescence of the 
Government. Based on the above, WGEID does not admit cases when they are attributed to 
persons or groups not acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or 
acquiescence of the Government, such as terrorist or insurgent movements fighting the 
Government in its own territory. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Handling of cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent procedures 
</b></p>
<p>7. Cases of enforced disappearances that occurred within the three months preceding 
receipt of the report by the Working Group are transmitted to the Minister for Foreign 
Affairs of the country concerned by the most direct and rapid means. Their transmission 
can be authorized by the Chairperson on the basis of a specific delegation of power given to 
him by the Working Group. Cases which occurred prior to the three-month limit, but not 
more than one year before the date of their receipt by the Secretariat, provided that they had 
some connection with a case which occurred within the three-month period, can be 
transmitted between sessions by letter, upon authorization by the Chairperson. WGEID 
notifies sources that an urgent action has been sent to the concerned Government, thus 
helping it to enter into communication with the authorities about the specific case.  
</p>
<p><b>  Standard procedures 
</b></p>
<p>8. Cases of enforced disappearances that are reported after three months are placed 
before WGEID for detailed examination during its sessions. Those which fulfil the 
requirements outlined above are transmitted, upon the Working Group&#8217;s specific 
authorization, to the Governments concerned with the request that they carry out 
investigations in order to clarify the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, and 
inform the Working Group of the results. These cases are communicated by letter from the 
Group&#8217;s Chairperson to the Government concerned through the Permanent Representative 
to the United Nations Office at Geneva. 
</p>
<p>9. Any substantive additional information which the sources submit on an outstanding 
case is placed before the Working Group and, following its approval, transmitted to the 
Government concerned.  </p>


<p><b>138</b> GE.09-17704 
</p>
<p><b>  Admissibility of cases of enforced or involuntary disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>10. Reports of disappearances are considered admissible by the Working Group when 
they originate from the family or friends of the disappeared person. Such reports may, 
however, be channelled to WGEID through representatives of the family, Governments, 
intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and other reliable 
sources. They must be submitted in writing with a clear indication of the identity of the 
sender; if the source is other than a family member, it must have direct consent of the 
family to submit the case on its behalf, and it must also be in a position to follow up with 
the relatives of the disappeared person concerning his or her fate.  
</p>
<p>11. The Working Group does not deal with situations of international armed conflict. 
</p>
<p><b>  Elements for admissibility 
</b></p>
<p>12. In order to enable Governments to carry out meaningful investigations, the Working 
Group provides them with information containing at least a minimum of basic data. In 
addition, WGEID constantly urges the senders of reports to furnish as many details as 
possible concerning the identity of the disappeared person and the circumstances of the 
disappearance. The Working Group requires the following minimum elements:  
</p>
<p> (a) Full name of the disappeared person and, if possible, age, gender, nationality, 
and occupation or profession; 
</p>
<p> (b) Date of disappearance, i.e. day, month and year of arrest or abduction, or day, 
month and year when the disappeared person was last seen. When the disappeared person 
was last seen in a detention centre, an approximate indication is sufficient (for example, 
March or spring 1990); 
 (c) Place of arrest or abduction, or where the disappeared person was last seen 
(indication of town or village, at least); 
 (d) Parties, acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or 
acquiescence of the Government, presumed to have carried out the arrest or abduction or to 
be holding the disappeared person in unacknowledged detention;  
</p>
<p> (e) Steps taken by the family to determine the fate or whereabouts of the 
disappeared person, or at least an indication that efforts to resort to domestic remedies were 
frustrated or have otherwise been inconclusive; 
</p>
<p> (f) A case should be submitted to the Working Group by a reliable source, 
which, if other than a family member, must indicate whether the reported victim&#8217;s family 
has given their direct consent that this case be submitted to WGEID on their behalf. 
</p>
<p>13. If a case is not admitted, the Working Group sends a response to the source 
indicating that the information received did not fulfil the established requirements, in order 
to permit the source to provide all relevant information. 
</p>
<p><b>  Situations of vulnerability 
</b></p>
<p>14. With respect to reported cases of disappearances, the Working Group highlights the 
condition of people in situations of vulnerability, including women, children, the elderly, 
persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p><b>  Pregnancy 
</b></p>
<p>15. In the case of the disappearance of a pregnant woman, the child presumed to have 
been born during the mother&#8217;s captivity should be mentioned in the description of the case </p>


<p>GE.09-17704 <b>139 
</b></p>
<p>of the mother. The child would be treated as a separate case when witnesses reported that 
the mother had actually given birth to a child during detention. 
</p>
<p><b>  Cases concerning two or more countries 
</b></p>
<p>16. Reports on a disappearance indicating that officials from one country are directly 
responsible for or involved in a disappearance in another country, or in cases where 
officials from more than one country were directly responsible for or involved in the 
disappearance would be communicated to all Governments concerned. However, the case 
would only be counted in the statistics of the country in which the person was reportedly 
arrested, detained, abducted or last seen. The same principles are applied with respect to the 
transmission of urgent appeals, general allegations and prompt interventions. 
</p>
<p><b>  Outstanding cases 
</b></p>
<p>17. The WGEID considers cases as outstanding for as long as they have not been 
clarified, closed or discontinued in accordance with the methods of work. This principle is 
not affected by changes of Government in a given country nor in the event of State 
succession. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reminders 
</b></p>
<p>18. The WGEID reminds every Government concerned once a year of the cases which 
have not yet been clarified and three times a year of all urgent action cases transmitted 
since the previous session. On request, the WGEID provides to the Government concerned 
or the source, to the extent possible, updated information on specific cases.  
</p>
<p><b>  Government replies 
</b></p>
<p>19. All replies received from Governments concerning reports of disappearances are 
examined by the WGEID and summarized in the Group&#8217;s annual report to the Human 
Rights Council. Any information given on specific cases is forwarded to the sources of 
those reports, who are invited to make observations thereon or to provide additional details 
on the cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  The six-month rule 
</b></p>
<p>20. Any reply of the Government containing detailed information on the fate or 
whereabouts of the disappeared person is transmitted to the source. If the source does not 
respond within six months of the date on which the Government&#8217;s reply was communicated 
to it, or if it contests the Government&#8217;s information on grounds which are considered 
unreasonable by the WGEID, the case is considered clarified and is accordingly listed 
under the heading &#8220;Cases clarified by the Government&#8217;s response&#8221; in the statistical 
summary of the annual report. If the source contests the Government&#8217;s information on 
reasonable grounds, the Government is so informed and invited to comment. 
</p>
<p><b>  Clarification  
</b></p>
<p>21. Clarification occurs when the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared persons are 
clearly established as a result of investigations by the Government, inquiries by non-
governmental organizations, fact-finding missions by the WGEID or by human rights 
personnel from the United Nations or from any other international organization operating in 
the field, or by the search of the family, irrespective of whether the person is alive or dead. </p>


<p><b>140</b> GE.09-17704 
</p>
<p><b>  Closed cases 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Working Group may decide to stop pursuing a case when the competent 
authority specified in the relevant national law issues a declaration of absence as a result of 
enforced disappearance or, alternatively, a declaration of presumption of death, and the 
relatives or other interested parties have manifested, freely and indisputably, their desire not 
to pursue the case any further. These conditions should at all times respect the right to 
integral reparation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Discontinuation of cases 
</b></p>
<p>23. In exceptional circumstances, the WGEID may decide to<b> </b>discontinue the 
consideration of cases where the families have manifested, freely and indisputably, their 
desire not to pursue the case any further, or when the source is no longer in existence or is 
unable to follow up the case and steps taken by the WGEID to establish communication 
with other sources have proven unsuccessful.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reopening of cases 
</b></p>
<p>24. If sources provide well-documented information that a case has been considered 
clarified, closed or discontinued erroneously, because the Government&#8217;s reply referred to a 
different person, does not correspond to the reported situation or has not reached the source 
within the six-month period referred to above, the WGEID transmits the case to the 
Government anew, requesting it to comment. In such instances, the case in question is again 
listed among the outstanding cases and a specific explanation is given in the Group&#8217;s report 
to the Human Rights Council, describing the above-mentioned errors or discrepancies. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Other protection mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeals  
</b></p>
<p>25. When credible allegations are received that a person has been arrested, detained, 
abducted, or otherwise deprived of his liberty and has been enforcedly disappeared or is at 
risk of being disappeared, the Working Group will transmit those allegations to the Minister 
for Foreign Affairs of the Government concerned by the most direct and rapid means 
requesting said Government to carry out investigations to clarify the fate or whereabouts of 
the person(s) concerned and to inform the Working Group about the results. The 
transmission of urgent appeals is authorized by the Chairperson on the basis of a specific 
delegation of power given to him by the Group. 
</p>
<p>26. Urgent appeals will be reflected in the annual report of the Working Group, but will 
not be counted in the statistics of the Government concerned. However, should the 
information contained therein be provided in accordance with the requirements listed under 
&#8220;Admissibility of cases of enforced or involuntary disappearances&#8221; and &#8220;Elements for 
admissibility&#8221;, the urgent appeal will become a standard or urgent case as appropriate in 
which case the Government concerned will be informed by separate communication. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Prompt interventions 
</b></p>
<p>27. Cases of intimidation, persecution or reprisal against relatives of disappeared 
persons, witnesses to disappearances or their families, members of organizations of 
relatives and other non-governmental organizations, human rights defenders or individuals 
concerned with disappearances are transmitted to the pertinent Governments, with the 
appeal that they take steps to protect all the fundamental rights of the persons affected. 
Cases of that nature, which require prompt intervention, are transmitted directly to the </p>


<p>GE.09-17704 <b>141 
</b></p>
<p>Ministers for Foreign Affairs by the most direct and rapid means. To that end, the WGEID 
has authorized its Chairperson to transmit such cases between sessions.  
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p>28. The WGEID regularly transmits to the Governments concerned a summary of 
allegations received from relatives of disappeared persons and non-governmental 
organizations with regard to obstacles encountered in the implementation of the Declaration 
in their respective countries, inviting them to comment thereon if they so wish. 
</p>
<p><b>  Cooperation with other mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>29. If a case or allegation contains information relevant to other thematic mechanisms of 
the Human Rights Council, the information is transmitted to the mechanism concerned.  
</p>
<p>30. Where appropriate, the WGEID may join other mechanisms in the actions they take 
within the scope of their respective mandates. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Activities of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Country missions 
</b></p>
<p>31. The WGEID carries out visits to countries on invitation, but also takes the initiative 
of approaching Governments with a view to carrying out visits to countries,<b> </b>when<b> 
</b>considered appropriate. Such visits are intended to enhance the dialogue between the 
authorities most directly concerned, the families or their representatives and the WGEID, 
and to assist in the clarification of the reported disappearances. The WGEID also 
undertakes visits to examine the practices carried out by Governments to clarify cases of 
enforced disappearances, as well as the programmes and measures adopted to implement 
the Declaration and to guarantee the rights of the victims, including the right to integral 
reparation. The WGEID reports to the Council on its country visits in an addendum to its 
annual report. 
</p>
<p><b>  Follow-up 
</b></p>
<p>32. With regard to countries in which visits have been carried out, the WGEID 
periodically reminds the Governments concerned of the observations and recommendations 
formulated in the respective reports, requesting information on the consideration given to 
them, and the steps taken for their implementation or the constraints which might have 
prevented their implementation. The WGEID may also take the initiative to carry out 
follow-up visits. 
</p>
<p><b>  Sessions 
</b></p>
<p>33. The WGEID meets three times a year to consider the information brought to its 
attention since its previous session. Its sessions are held in private. However, the WGEID 
works intersessionally and regularly meets with representatives of Governments, non-
governmental organizations, family members and witnesses.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reports 
</b></p>
<p>34. The WGEID reports annually to the Human Rights Council on the activities which it 
has carried out from the end of Council&#8217;s previous session up until the last day of the 
WGEID&#8217;s third annual session. It informs the Council of its communications with 
Governments and non-governmental organizations, its meetings and missions. Reports on 
missions are contained as addenda to the main report. The WGEID reports on all cases of </p>


<p><b>142</b> GE.09-17704 
</p>
<p>disappearance received by the Group during the year, on a country-by-country basis, and on 
the decision it has taken thereon. It provides the Council with a statistical summary for each 
country of cases transmitted to the Government, clarifications, and the status of the person 
concerned on the date of clarification. It includes graphs showing the development of 
disappearances in countries with more than 100 transmitted cases as of the date of the 
adoption by the WGEID of its annual report. The WGEID includes conclusions and 
recommendations in its report and makes observations on the situation of disappearances in 
individual countries. The WGEID further reports on the implementation of the Declaration 
and the obstacles encountered therein, and periodically reports on broader issues 
surrounding the phenomenon of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p><b>  Participation of experts 
</b></p>
<p>35. When the information under consideration concerns a country to which one of the 
members of the WGEID is a national, that member does not participate in the discussion.
