Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Unaudited
(US dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
1. Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q. In compliance with those instructions, certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("US
GAAP") have been condensed or omitted. This report should be read in conjunction with the
Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc. ("TCM," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our") consolidated
financial statements and notes contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 (the "2015 Form 10-K") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC"). The information reflects all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management,
necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods reported. Operating results for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for any other quarter or for the year ending December 31, 2016.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. TCM bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may differ
significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TCM and its subsidiaries.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Financial amounts
are presented in United States ("US") dollars unless otherwise stated. References to C$ are
Canadian dollars.
The Copper-Gold operations consist of Mount Milligan Mine, a conventional truck-shovel open-pit
copper and gold mine and concentrator in British Columbia. The US operations for molybdenum
include the Thompson Creek Mine ("TC Mine") (mine and mill) in Idaho and the Langeloth
Metallurgical Roasting Facility (the "Langeloth Facility") in Pennsylvania. The Canadian operations
for molybdenum consist of a 75% joint venture interest in the Endako Molybdenum Mine Joint
Venture ("Endako Mine") (mine, mill and roaster) in British Columbia. As previously disclosed in
TCM's 2015 Form 10-K, due to continued weakness in the molybdenum market Endako Mine was
placed on temporary suspension effective December 31, 2014 and subsequently placed on care
and maintenance effective July 1, 2015. TC Mine was placed on care and maintenance in
December 2014 after the processing of stockpiled ore from Phase 7 was completed. During the first
seven months of 2015, TC Mine conducted limited stripping for the next phase of mining (“Phase
8”). As part of TCM's cost reduction measures, further stripping at TC Mine ceased effective August
6, 2015. As of January 2016, TCM is operating a commercial molybdenum beneficiation circuit at
TC Mine to treat molybdenum concentrates to supplement the concentrate feed TCM sources
directly for the Langeloth facility.
The costs related to the Endako Mine temporary suspension and care and maintenance and TC
Mine care and
maintenance are reflected in costs for idle mining operations in the Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. The costs related to the molybdenum
beneficiation circuit are reflected in operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income.
TCM also has a 100% interest in a copper and molybdenum exploration property located in British
Columbia (the “Berg property”) and a 0.51% net smelter return royalty and a 10.2% net profits
interest in a zinc and lead exploration project located in Canada (the "Howards Pass property").

(US dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
1. Basis of Presentation (Continued)
New Accounting Standards
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new accounting guidance
on revenue recognition, which provides for a single five-step model to be applied to all revenue
contracts with customers. The new standard also requires additional financial statement disclosures
that will enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash
flows relating to customer contracts. Companies have an option to use either a retrospective
approach or cumulative effect adjustment approach to implement the standard. In June 2015, the
FASB agreed to defer by one year the mandatory effective date of this standard but will also provide
entities the option to adopt the new guidance as of the original effective date. The provisions of the
new guidance will be effective as of the beginning of our 2018 fiscal year but TCM has the option to
adopt the guidance as early as the beginning of our 2017 fiscal year. TCM is evaluating the impact
of the new guidance on our financial statements and have not yet selected either a transition
approach to implement the standard or an adoption date.
In April and August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Updates ("ASUs") to simplify the
presentation of debt issuance costs. These ASUs require that debt issuance costs related to a
recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. For public entities, these ASUs are
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. TCM adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2016. Upon adoption, TCM retrospectively
adjusted its December 31, 2015 balance sheet by decreasing its other assets by $9.8 million and
decreasing its long-term debt by $9.8 million.
In June 2014, the FASB issued an ASU to provide clarity on how to account for certain share-based
payment awards where the terms of an award may provide that the performance target could be
achieved regardless of whether the employee is rendering service on the date the performance
target is achieved. The amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting and that
could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition and
should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. The total amount of
compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the
number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that
ultimately vest. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. TCM
adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2016, and it had no impact on its results of operations.
In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to amend certain aspects of recognition, measurement,
presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. This ASU eliminates the requirement to
disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to
be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, requires
the use of an exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure
purposes and requires a separate presentation in other comprehensive income for the portion of the
total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit
risk. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. TCM is evaluating the
impact of this ASU on our financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to simplify accounting for share-based payment
transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016. TCM is evaluating the impact of this ASU on our financial
statements.

5. Financial Instruments
TCM enters into various derivative financial instruments in the normal course of operations to
manage exposure to the market prices of copper and gold and foreign exchange risk with respect to
its Canadian operations. TCM does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative instruments.
Accordingly, changes in fair value of derivative instruments are recorded in the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income, except those contracts
for which TCM has elected to apply the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception.
The following table sets forth the fair values of TCM's derivative assets and liabilities:

(1) TCM's derivative assets are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts
receivable, and derivative liabilities are included in other current liabilities in the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets. TCM is exposed to credit risk when counterparties with whom it has
entered into derivative transactions are unable to satisfy their obligations. To reduce counterparty
credit exposure, TCM deals primarily with large, credit-worthy financial institutions and companies.
TCM believes the counterparties to the contracts to be credit-worthy entities and, therefore, TCM
believes credit risk of counterparty non-performance is relatively low, and, as such, the fair value of
the derivatives has not been adjusted.

Gold Hedges Related to Gold Stream Arrangement and Other Commodity Contracts
TCM must satisfy its obligation under the Gold Stream Arrangement (discussed in Note 9) by
delivering gold to Royal Gold after TCM receives cash payment from third-party purchasers,
including offtakers and traders, that purchase concentrate from Mount Milligan Mine ("MTM
Customers").
In order to hedge its gold price risk that arises when physical purchase and concentrate sales
pricing periods do not match, hereafter referred to as the Gold Stream Risk, TCM has entered into
certain forward gold purchase and sales contracts pursuant to which it purchases gold at an
average price during a quotational period and sells gold at a spot price. TCM records its forward
commodity contracts at fair value using a market approach based on observable quoted market
prices and contracted prices.
In addition to the Gold Stream Risk and in connection with the sale of concentrate from Mount
Milligan Mine, TCM is exposed to copper and gold price fluctuations between the dates of
concentrate shipment, provisional payment and final payment. In order to hedge the price risk for the
metals contained in concentrate, TCM has entered into certain forward copper and gold purchase
and sale contracts pursuant to which it purchases copper or gold at an average price during a
quotational period and sells copper or gold at a spot price. Additionally, TCM has entered into
put/call collars pursuant to which it agrees with a counterparty to a floor and ceiling relative to future
prices of gold and copper. If the gold or copper price is below the floor, the counterparty pays TCM
the difference between the price and the floor. If the gold or copper price is above the ceiling, TCM
pays the counterparty the difference between the ceiling and the price. TCM records its copper and
gold commodity contracts at fair value using a market approach based on observable quoted market
prices and contracted prices. These activities are intended to protect against the price risk related to
the MTM Customer purchase contracts. Additionally, TCM also enters into fuel hedges to manage
its exposure to price fluctuations in the cost of diesel purchased for use in operations.

Provisionally-Priced Contracts
TCM's copper and gold sales contracts provide for provisional pricing. These sales contain an
embedded derivative related to the provisional-pricing mechanism, which is bifurcated and
accounted for as a derivative. TCM also enters into provisionally-priced molybdenum purchase
contracts that also contain an embedded derivative, which is bifurcated and accounted for as a
derivative.

5. Financial Instruments (Continued)
TCM determines the fair value of its provisionally-priced contracts using a market approach based
upon observable inputs from published market prices and contract terms. Changes to the fair values
of the embedded derivatives related to provisionally-priced molybdenum purchases are included in
operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
(Loss) Income as the product inventory is sold.

Forward Currency Contracts
TCM transacts business in various currencies in the normal course of its operations and for capital
expenditures. In addition, although TCM's revenues are denominated in US dollars, TCM has
ongoing foreign exchange risk with respect to its Canadian operations. To help mitigate this risk,
TCM has entered into foreign currency forward contracts pursuant to which it has agreed to buy
Canadian dollars at an agreed-upon rate. TCM records its currency contracts at fair value using a
market approach based on observable quoted exchange rates and contracted notional amounts. As
of June 30, 2016, TCM had 11 open foreign currency option contracts.
The following table provides details of TCM's forward currency contracts as of June 30, 2016:
 
Forward currency contracts C$30,000,000
Fixed-Priced Contracts
TCM enters into certain sales contracts pursuant to which it sells molybdenum products at certain
times in the future at fixed prices. These fixed prices may be different than the quoted market prices
at the date of sale. TCM has elected to treat these contracts as normal sale contracts.
The Gold Stream Arrangement contains an agreement to sell gold at a fixed price, but it does not
meet the definition of a derivative instrument. See discussion of the Gold Stream Arrangement in
Note 9.

6. Fair Value Measurement
US GAAP includes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3
inputs). TCM's policy is to recognize transfers into and out of Level 3 as of the actual date of the
event or change in circumstances. There were no transfers into or out of Level 1, 2 or 3 during the
three or six months ended June 30, 2016.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, TCM held certain items that were required to be
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These included derivative assets and liabilities which
consist of commodity and foreign currency derivative instruments and provisionally priced contracts.
In addition to the fair value disclosure requirements related to financial instruments carried at fair
value, TCM has provided disclosures regarding the fair value of all of TCM's financial instruments in
accordance with US GAAP. The methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair
value of these financial instruments have also been disclosed. As of June 30, 2016, there have
been no significant changes to these methods or assumptions. As required, financial instruments
are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement.

As of June 30, 2016, the carrying values of the 9.75% senior secured notes, the 7.375% senior
unsecured notes and the 12.5% senior unsecured notes were higher than their fair values of $311.5
million, $237.6 million and $130.0 million, respectively. TCM determined the fair value of the notes
using a discounted cash flow valuation model, consisting of inputs such as risk-free interest rates
and credit spreads. See Note 8 for more information regarding the debt. As of December 31, 2015,
the carrying values of the 9.75% senior secured notes, the 7.375% senior unsecured notes and
the 12.5% senior unsecured notes were higher than their fair values of $257.6 million, $61.1
million and $35.6 million, respectively.

6. Fair Value Measurement (Continued)
As of June 30, 2016, the carrying values of TCM's financial instruments approximated their fair
values. TCM determined the fair value of its financial instruments using LME or COMEX copper and
gold forward prices and option pricing models using the counterparties' and TCM's credit quality.

TCM entered into an equipment financing facility, as amended from time to time (the "Equipment
Facility"), pursuant to which Caterpillar Financial Services Limited ("Caterpillar") agreed to
underwrite up to $132.0 million in mobile fleet equipment financing for Mount Milligan Mine. Each
borrowing under the Equipment Facility represents a capital lease or a sale leaseback arrangement
and has a term of 48 or 60 months. Interest on the amounts borrowed under the Equipment Facility
is payable at either floating or fixed rates, at TCM's option. At the end of each 48 or 60 month lease
period, TCM has the option to purchase the underlying equipment for a nominal sum. The
Equipment Facility includes non-financial covenants, and as of June 30, 2016, TCM was in
compliance with these covenants. TCM's ability to finance additional equipment under the
Equipment Facility expired in September 2015 per the amended terms of the Equipment Facility
agreement. TCM did not enter into any new capital leases pursuant to the Equipment Facility during
the three or six months ended June 30, 2016. In May 2016, TCM posted $2.6 million in cash
collateral to a surety company in connection with the $10.4 million surety bond for the Equipment
Facility with Caterpillar.
With respect to certain equipment pursuant to the Equipment Facility, TCM entered into three leases
with Caterpillar, of which two are considered sale-leaseback transactions. Interest payments are
based on a fixed rate of 5.50%.
Separate from the Equipment Facility, during 2013, TCM entered into a sale-leaseback transaction
with Caterpillar with respect to 75% of certain Endako Mine equipment. Interest payments are based
on a fixed rate of 5.85%. During 2015, TCM assumed the lease for the remaining 25% of the
equipment and subsequently transferred this equipment to Mount Milligan Mine.
Interest and debt issuance costs on TCM's equipment financings, as described above, consisted of

9. Gold Stream Arrangement
Pursuant to TCM's agreement with a subsidiary of Royal Gold, Inc. ("Royal Gold") ("Gold Stream
Arrangement"), TCM agreed to sell to Royal Gold 52.25% of the refined gold production from Mount
Milligan Mine for a total upfront payment of $781.5 million, plus $435 per ounce, or the prevailing
market rate if lower than $435 per ounce, when the gold is delivered. The upfront cash payments
received under the Gold Stream Arrangement ("Record of Deposit") were recorded as deferred
revenue and classified as a liability on TCM's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of
June 30, 2016, the outstanding Record of Deposit under the Gold Stream Arrangement totaled
$618.6 million. In the event of any default under the Company's agreement with Royal Gold, Royal
Gold could require TCM to repay the outstanding Record of Deposit. For more information regarding
the Gold Stream Arrangement, see Note 10 within Item 8 of TCM's 2015 Form 10-K.
The following table presents the revenue under the Gold Stream Arrangement for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in the form of (i) cash receipts based on gold
sales during the applicable period, and (ii) deferred revenue for gold ounces delivered and deferred
revenue to be recognized upon final settlement during the applicable period:

(1) The three and six months ended June 30, 2016 included $10.3 million and $16.3 million,
respectively, of revenue for gold ounces delivered, and $1.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively, in
future reduction of deferred revenue liability ultimately to be recognized upon delivery of gold. The
three and six months ended June 30, 2015 included $12.8 million and $16.9 million, respectively of
revenue for gold ounces delivered partially offset by $2.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively in
future reduction of deferred revenue liability ultimately to be recognized upon delivery of gold.
(2) The six months ended June 30, 2016 included a $1.5 million reduction related to five provisional
invoices from 2015. The decrease resulted from a downward revision to the rate at which the
deferred revenue liability resulting from the Gold Stream Arrangement was amortized. This rate is
calculated based on the remaining deferred revenue liability and total ounces of refined gold owed
to Royal Gold.

(2) In March 2016 TCM entered into a program (the "BC Hydro Program") offered by the government
of British Columbia to certain copper and coal producers. The BC Hydro Program amended the
terms of TCM's existing utility agreement with British Columbia’s crown corporation, BC Hydro. As a
participant in this program, TCM can defer payment on up to 75% of electrical obligations to BC
Hydro, with the percentage deferral and repayment being dependent upon levels of copper prices
and Canadian foreign exchange rates. The BC Hydro Program is a five-year program, with a two-
$ 19.2
13.6
year deferral period. All amounts outstanding must be repaid by the end of the five-year period or if
copper prices are above C$3.40. The deferred balance will accrue interest at an annual rate of
Prime (as set by the Bank of Canada) +5%, compounded monthly. As of June 30, 2016, TCM
continued to elect to participate in the program. TCM can elect to end its participation in the BC
Hydro Program at any time by paying the then outstanding obligations in full.
(3) See Note 11 for further discussion.
11. Cash-Based Incentive Plan    
On March 31, 2016, the Board of Directors of TCM approved the framework for the Thompson Creek
Metals Company Inc. Cash-Based Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”), which was finalized and
approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board on April 6, 2016. Pursuant to the Incentive
Plan, the Compensation Committee approved grants of certain cash-based awards that vest over
2.75 years (the “Performance and Inducement Awards”) and other cash-based awards (the
“Incentive Awards”), subject in each case to the terms and conditions of the Incentive Plan and the
applicable award agreements, to TCM’s named executive officers and key employees.
Pursuant to the Incentive Plan, $3.3 million of Incentive Awards were granted to TCM’s named
executive officers and key employees of which $2.2 million in Incentive Awards were paid to named
executive and key officers in April 2016. This payment is subject to an obligation to repay to TCM
the total amount of the Incentive Award if the participant’s employment with TCM terminates under
certain circumstances, subject to the conditions contained in the applicable award agreement.
The Performance and Inducement Awards of $3.6 million to named executive officers and key
employees will be accrued and expensed over the vesting period, commencing in April 2016.
As of June 30, 2016, we had expensed $1.5 million in connection with these Performance and
Inducement Awards and Incentive Awards. In accordance with GAAP, in expectation of the
consummation of the Arrangement (as defined and discussed in Note 21), the expense related to
the Performance and Inducement Awards and Incentive Awards will be accelerated and recognized
in full prior to the date of the consummation of the Arrangement.

As of June 30, 2016, TCM has outstanding stock options, PSUs and RSUs, as discussed below.
Stock Options
The expiration date and vesting provisions of stock options granted are established at the time an
award is made. Stock options vest over 3 years and are exercisable over a period of time not to
exceed 10 years from the grant date but generally expire 5 years from the grant date. When an
option is exercised, TCM may issue the requisite shares from authorized but unissued common
stock, or from treasury stock. The exercise price of options granted is equal to the volume weighted-
average trading price of the underlying shares on the TSX over the five consecutive trading days
immediately before the grant date, converted to U.S. dollars at the noon exchange rate of the Bank
of Canada on the grant date.

(1) The aggregate intrinsic value of these exercisable awards was nil as of June 30, 2016.
As of June 30, 2016, approximately 0.4 million outstanding options had not vested and were not
exercisable. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to these options was $0.2 million as
of June 30, 2016 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.41 years.
See Note 21 for additional information.
Performance Share Units (PSUs)
The vesting of the outstanding PSUs granted subsequent to January 1, 2012 and prior to January 1,
2014 is contingent upon two metrics: 1) TCM's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to the
Russell 2000 Index during the three-year performance period; and 2) the proven and probable mine
reserves replaced by TCM during the three-year performance period as measured by the
replacement reserves percentage determined by the plan administrator. The PSUs cliff vest three
years from the date of issuance upon achievement of the above metrics. Any PSUs not vested at
such time will expire.
The vesting of the outstanding PSUs granted subsequent to January 1, 2014 is contingent upon two
metrics: 1) TCM’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to the S&P TSX Global Base Metals
Index during the three-year period commencing on January 1 of the year in which the grant was
made (the “performance period”); and 2) cash flow from operations, defined as TCM’s aggregate
“cash generated by (used in) operating activities” less aggregate “capital expenditures,” as reported
in the Statements of Cash Flows in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for each fiscal year
in the performance period. The PSUs cliff vest approximately three years from the date of grant, or
on the date in the first quarter of the fiscal year immediately succeeding the performance period on
which the plan administrator determines and certifies the achievement of the above metrics. Any
PSUs not vested at such time will expire.

12. Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)
All PSUs granted are accounted for at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model on
the date of grant. The Monte Carlo model is based on random projections of stock price paths.
Expected volatility is calculated using a weighted average of historical daily volatilities and implied
volatility and represents the extent to which TCM's stock price performance is expected to fluctuate
during the three-year terms of the respective award.
As of June 30, 2016, unrecognized compensation expense related to PSUs totaled $3.7 million and
will be recognized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of 1.42 years. See Note
21 for additional information.

Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)
TCM accounts for RSUs at fair value, which is based on the market value of TCM's common shares
on the day of grant and recognized over the vesting period of three years. Upon vesting, TCM may
issue the requisite shares from authorized but unissued common stock, or from treasury stock.
As of June 30, 2016, unrecognized compensation expense related to RSUs totaled $1.5 million and
will be recognized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of 1.39 years. See Note
21 for additional information.

13. Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Matters
TCM is from time to time involved in or subject to legal proceedings related to its business. While it
is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, it is the opinion of
management that the resolution of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse
effect on TCM's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Concentrate Sales Agreements
As of June 30, 2016, TCM has multi-year concentrate sales agreements with four counter parties for
the sale of concentrate produced at Mount Milligan Mine. Pursuant to these agreements, TCM has
agreed to sell an aggregate of the copper and gold concentrate produced at Mount Milligan Mine of
approximately 136,000 dry tonnes in 2016, 100,000 dry tonnes in 2017, 80,000 dry tonnes in 2018
and 40,000 dry tonnes of concentrate in 2019. Pricing under these concentrate sales agreements
will be determined by reference to specified published reference prices during the applicable
quotation periods. Payment for the concentrate will be based on the price for the agreed copper and
gold content of the parcels delivered, less smelting and refining charges and certain other
deductions, if applicable. The copper smelting and refining charges will be negotiated in good faith
and agreed by the parties for each contract year based on terms generally acknowledged as
industry benchmark terms. The gold refining charges are as specified in the agreements.
Remaining concentrate produced at Mount Milligan Mine will be sold under short-term contracts or
on a spot basis.

13. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)
Molybdenum Purchases
In the normal course of operations, TCM enters into agreements for the purchase of molybdenum to
utilize the upgrading capabilities at its Langeloth facility and generate saleable upgraded
molybdenum products. As of June 30, 2016, TCM had commitments to purchase approximately 7.0
million pounds of unroasted molybdenum concentrate and 1.4 million pounds of molybdenum oxide
from 2016 to 2017, to be priced at the time of purchase at a set discount to the market price.
Molybdenum Sales
In the normal course of operations, TCM enters into certain molybdenum sales contracts pursuant to
which it sells future production at fixed prices. As of June 30, 2016, TCM had commitments to sell
approximately 255.5 thousand pounds of molybdenum oxide from 2016 to 2019 at an average price
of $11.23 per pound.
Capital Purchase Commitments
As of June 30, 2016, TCM had open capital purchase commitments of $12.7 million related to the
Mount Milligan Mine, which are expected to be incurred throughout 2016.
14. Income and Mining Tax Expense (Benefit)
Income and mining tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.6
million and $5.1 million, respectively. Income and mining tax expense (benefit) for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was an expense of $8.1 million and a benefit of $11.6 million,
respectively.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the tax expense did not contain significant
unusual items. Usual drivers of differences between our effective rate and from applying the
Canadian federal and provincial income tax rates are due to foreign exchange, which largely have
no tax impact due to valuation allowances on the associated deferred tax assets, and the British
Columbia mineral taxes for Mount Milligan. Furthermore, as a result of a change in the legal
structure in late 2015, which will facilitate future consolidation of our Canadian tax reporting entities,
the non-foreign exchange income and expenses from the Canadian tax reporting entities largely
have no federal and provincial tax impact due to valuation allowances on the associated deferred
tax assets.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the tax expense (benefit) did not contain
significant unusual items. Usual drivers of differences between our effective rate and from applying
the Canadian federal and provincial income tax rates are due to pre-tax losses from the Endako
Mine and foreign exchange, which largely have no tax impact due to valuation allowances on the
associated deferred tax assets, and the British Columbia mineral taxes for Mount Milligan.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, approximately 1.1 million options

exceeded the price of the common stock. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
respectively, approximately 3.4 million PSUs were excluded from the computation of diluted
weighted-average shares because the underlying market and performance metrics are highly
probable of not being met. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively,
approximately 1.5 million RSUs were excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average
shares as the hypothetical repurchase of shares exceeded the number of unvested units.

shares as the hypothetical repurchase of shares exceeded the number of unvested units. For the
three and six months ended June 30, 2015, approximately 4.3 million PSUs have been excluded
from the computation of diluted weighted average shares because the underlying market and
performance metrics had not been met.
16. Transactions with our Endako Mine Joint Venture Partner
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, sales to Sojitz, TCM's Endako Mine joint
venture partner were nil. Total sales by TCM to Sojitz, TCM's Endako Mine joint venture partner,
were $1.4 million and $7.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively.
These sales represented 1.0% and 2.9% of TCM's total revenues for these respective periods.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, TCM recorded insignificant
amounts for management fee income and selling and marketing costs from Sojitz.
TCM's related accounts receivable owed from Sojitz were nil as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015.

18. Concentration of Credit Risk
TCM is exposed to counterparty risk from its cash and cash equivalent balances and its reclamation
deposits held by financial institutions and governmental entities. TCM monitors its positions with,
and the credit quality of, the financial institutions and companies in which it invests its cash and
cash equivalents, and that hold its reclamation deposits. Counterparties to cash balances and
reclamation deposits, other than balances maintained in various bank operating accounts, are US
and Canadian institutions and the US and Canadian governments.
TCM manages its credit risk from its accounts receivable through its collection activities. As of
June 30, 2016, TCM had four customers who owed TCM more than $3.0 million each and
collectively accounted for approximately 61.4% of total accounts and other receivables outstanding.
As of June 30, 2016, TCM had five customers who owed TCM more than $1.0 million each but less
than $3.0 million. As of June 30, 2016, all of the customers discussed above were compliant with
credit terms and scheduled payment dates.
TCM's maximum counterparty and credit risk exposure is the carrying value of its cash and cash
equivalents and accounts receivable. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts
payable, accrued liabilities and fixed-rate debt, excluding the 2017 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2019
Notes, as discussed in Note 6, approximate fair value as of June 30, 2016.
19. Segment Information
TCM has three reportable segments, based on products and geography: Copper-Gold, US
Molybdenum and Canadian Molybdenum. The Copper-Gold segment represents the Mount Milligan
Mine and includes the sale of copper-gold products, net of refining costs and all expenditures,
including all mining, milling, on-site general and administration, transportation and warehousing.
The US Molybdenum segment includes all US molybdenum sales and tolling and calcining
revenue, all Langeloth roasting and on-site general and administration expenditures and all
expenditures from TC Mine, which was placed on care and maintenance in December 2014,
including all mine site general and administration and stripping costs and costs for idle mining
operations. The Canadian Molybdenum segment which consists of the 75% owned Endako Mine,
which was placed on temporary suspension effective December 31, 2014 and care and
maintenance effective July 1, 2015, includes 75% of all Canadian molybdenum sales as well as
TCM's 75% share of expenditures from the Endako Mine, including all site general and
administration costs, transportation costs, and costs for idle mining operations. The costs related to
care and maintenance at TC Mine for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and
our 75% share of the temporary suspension and care and maintenance costs at Endako Mine for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are reflected in costs for idle mining
operations in the statements of operations. The inter-segment represents the elimination of
intercompany transactions between the Langeloth Facility and the corporate entity for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
TCM's chief operating decision makers (President and CEO, CFO) evaluate segment performance
based on segment revenue less costs and expenses. TCM attributes other income and expenses to
the reporting segments if the income or expense is directly related to segment operations, as
described above. TCM does not allocate corporate expenditures such as general and
administrative, exploration and interest income and expense items to its reporting segments, unless
such expenditures are directly related to segment operations. Gains and losses on foreign
exchange are calculated on transactions denominated in a different currency than the segment's
functional currency; the Copper-Gold segment's unrealized foreign exchange balance is primarily
comprised of its intercompany notes.

20. Guarantor Financial Information
TCM has not presented separate combined financial statements of subsidiary guarantors that
guarantee the 2017 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes, because (1) each of the subsidiary
guarantors is wholly owned by TCM; (2) the guarantees are full and unconditional; (3) the
guarantees are joint and several; and (4) TCM has no independent assets and operations, and all
subsidiaries of TCM other than the subsidiary guarantors are immaterial.
Pursuant to the indentures governing the 2017 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes, a guarantor may
be released from its guarantee obligations only under certain customary circumstances specified in
the indentures, namely upon (1) the sale or other disposition (including by way of merger,
amalgamation or consolidation) of such guarantor, (2) the designation of such guarantor as an
unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the indentures, (3) a legal defeasance or
covenant defeasance or (4) the full satisfaction of TCM's obligations under the respective indenture.

21. Subsequent Events
On July 5, 2016, TCM entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) and
an accompanying letter agreement with Centerra Gold Inc. (“Centerra”), pursuant to which Centerra
will acquire all of the outstanding common shares of TCM (the “TCM common shares”) pursuant to a
statutory plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the
“Arrangement”).
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Arrangement Agreement, at the effective time of the
Arrangement, each outstanding TCM common share, other than TCM common shares with respect
to which dissent rights have been properly exercised and not withdrawn, will be exchanged for
0.0988 (the “Exchange Ratio”) of a common share of Centerra (a “Centerra common share”).
Pursuant to the Arrangement, (i) all outstanding restricted stock unit awards and performance stock
unit awards will be accelerated and exchanged for Centerra common shares at the Exchange Ratio,
and (ii) each outstanding stock option to purchase TCM common shares, whether vested or
unvested, will be converted automatically at the effective time of the Arrangement into a stock option
denominated in Centerra common shares based on the Exchange Ratio and subject to terms and
conditions substantially identical to those in effect at the effective time of the Arrangement. In
addition, on or about the effective time of the Arrangement, the 2017 Notes, the 2018 Notes and the
2019 Notes (collectively, the “ Senior Notes”) will be redeemed, or otherwise satisfied and
discharged, in their entirety for cash pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement and the
respective indentures for the Senior Notes.
The closing of the Arrangement is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among
others, approval of the Arrangement by TCM’s shareholders, approval by the Supreme Court of
British Columbia, receipt of any regulatory or stock exchange approvals, including approval of the
Toronto Stock Exchange, and other customary closing conditions. The Arrangement Agreement
contains certain customary termination rights for both TCM and Centerra, including, among other
things, a termination right for either party if the transaction is not consummated by October 31, 2016
or if Centerra’s financing to fund the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement is
terminated. In addition, upon termination of the Arrangement Agreement under specified
circumstances, including a change in the recommendation of the Company’s board of directors or in
order to enter into an alternative transaction, the Company will be required to pay a cash termination
fee to Centerra of $35 million. In connection with the successful consummation of the Transaction,
an estimated success fee of $10.0 million (net of previously paid amounts of approximately $1
million) will be paid by TCM to its financial advisors. In addition, the costs related to the Incentive
Plan discussed in Note 11 and the remaining expense related to stock-based compensation for
PSUs and RSUs, discussed in Note 12 will be accelerated and recognized in connection with the
consummation of the Arrangement. We anticipate that the Arrangement will be consummated in the
second half of 2016.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (Continued)
Overview
We are a North American mining company. In 2015, we shifted the core focus of our business to
copper and gold while at the same time developing a strategy to maintain the optionality of our
molybdenum business. This shift in core focus was primarily the result of expected ongoing
weakness in the molybdenum market. As discussed above, on July 5, 2016, TCM entered into an
Arrangement Agreement and an accompanying letter agreement with Centerra, pursuant to which,
subject to certain closing conditions, Centerra will acquire all of the outstanding common shares of
TCM pursuant to a statutory plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British
Columbia).
We have three reportable segments, based on products and geography: Copper-Gold, US
Molybdenum and Canadian Molybdenum. The Copper-Gold segment represents the Mount Milligan
Mine and includes the sale of copper-gold products, net of refining costs, and all expenditures,
including all mining, milling, mine site general and administration, transportation and warehousing.
The US Molybdenum segment includes the sale of third party sourced molybdenum, tolling and
calcining revenue from Langeloth, all roasting and on-site administrative expenditures from
Langeloth, molybdenum beneficiation costs and costs for idle mining operations from TC Mine. The
Canadian Molybdenum segment includes all 2015 molybdenum sales from the 75% owned Endako
Mine, which was placed on care and maintenance effective July 1, 2015, and our 75% share of
expenditures from Endako Mine, including all mine site general and administration costs, severance
costs, transportation costs, and costs for idle mining operations. Our 75% share of the care and
maintenance and temporary suspension costs at Endako Mine along with the care and
maintenance costs at TC Mine are reflected in costs for idle mining operations in the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016.
Copper-Gold
During the second quarter of 2016, we completed four shipments of copper-gold concentrate and
recorded four sales, compared to three shipments of copper-gold concentrate and four sales in the
second quarter of 2015. During each of the first half of 2016 and 2015, we completed seven
shipments of copper-gold concentrate and recorded seven sales.
For the second quarter of 2016, compared to the second quarter of 2015, payable copper production
decreased 27.1% primarily due to lower copper grades and recoveries, partially offset by improved
throughput. Non-GAAP copper cash costs on a by-product basis decreased 22.9% quarter over
quarter, primarily due to a 14.7% increase in gold sales together with a favorable Canadian
exchange rate, which were somewhat offset by higher operating costs in the second quarter of
2016. Quarter over quarter, on a co-product basis, non-GAAP copper unit cash costs increased by
18.7% primarily due to significantly lower payable copper production and higher operating costs in
the second quarter of 2016. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for the definition and
reconciliation of non-GAAP cash costs.
For the first half of 2016, payable copper production decreased 5.1% compared to the first half of
2015, with a 20.0% decrease in non-GAAP copper cash costs on a by-product basis for the first half
of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015. The period over period decrease in the non-GAAP copper
cash costs on a by-product basis was primarily due to a 19.1% increase in gold sales in the first half
of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015, which was partially offset by higher operating costs in the
comparative 2016 period. On a co-product basis, non-GAAP copper cash costs for the first half of
2016 remained the same as the first half of 2015. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for the
definition and reconciliation of non-GAAP cash costs.
For the second quarter of 2016, compared to the second quarter of 2015, payable gold production
decreased 22.6% due to lower gold grades and recoveries, and gold non-GAAP cash costs on a co-
product basis increased 67.7%. Quarter over quarter, the increase in gold non-GAAP unit cash
costs on a co-product basis was primarily due to higher cash costs related to temporary secondary
crushing, a decrease in capitalized costs related to the tailings storage facility, increase in power
usage, a decrease in payable gold production together with an increase in cash costs allocated to
gold due the sharp decline in copper market sales prices in the second quarter of 2016 compared to
the second quarter of 2015. Payable gold production for the first half of 2016 decreased 6.0%
compared to the first half of 2015, with a 33.8% increase in non-GAAP cash costs on a co-product
basis period over period. Period over period, the increase in the cash cost of gold on co-product
basis was due primarily due to a decrease in payable gold production together with an increase in
cash costs allocated to gold due to the sharp decline in copper market sales prices. See “Non-
GAAP Financial Measures” for the definition and reconciliation of non-GAAP cash costs.

Results of Operations (Continued)
Average daily throughput for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016 significantly improved
to 49,980 tonnes, and 54,040 tonnes, respectively compared to 44,940 tonnes and 42,269 tonnes
for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. Various modifications and
enhancements that were made in 2015 to remedy operational challenges proved to be successful
which resulted in daily mill throughput increases of 11.2% and 27.8%, respectively in the second
quarter and first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. However, copper
payable production decreased by 27.1% and 5.1%, respectively, and gold payable production
decreased by 22.6% and 6.0%, respectively, over the same comparative periods in 2015, primarily
due to a decrease in ore grades and recoveries. Quarter over quarter, copper ore grade and
recovery decreased by 28.6% and 9.7%, respectively, and gold ore grade and recovery decreased
by 16.9% and 16.9%, respectively. For the first half of 2016, compared to the first half of 2015,
copper ore grade decreased by 18.5% and copper recovery decreased by 8.2%. For the first half of
2016, compared to the first half of 2015, gold ore grade decreased by 14.1% and gold recovery
decreased by14.6%. Copper and gold recoveries for the quarter and six months June 30, 2016 were
lower as compared to the same periods in 2015 as a result of changes in operational conditions
primarily from increased throughput together with lower ore grades due to pit sequencing and
transitioning from phase 2 to phase 3 mining. During 2015, our primary focus at Mount Milligan was
to increase daily mill throughput. For 2016, our primary focus is to optimize the mine and mill
throughput with expected increase in recoveries.
As discussed in our 2015 Form 10-K, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we made the decision to order the
long-lead items for the permanent crusher and take additional steps in preparation for construction,
and in February 2016 we made the decision to commence construction. We believe that a
permanent secondary crushing circuit will enable us to consistently achieve average daily
throughput of approximately 62,500 tonnes per day ("tpd") and allow for reliable increases in mill
throughput at lower operating cost than what we could achieve with the temporary secondary
crushing circuit. The total estimated capital cost for the project is expected to be less than $60
million, inclusive of approximately $22.5 million incurred during the first half of 2016 and $15.0
million incurred in 2015. Capital costs incurred for the permanent secondary crusher through June
30, 2016 related to engineering, design/supply of major equipment, placement of schedule-critical
concrete and delivery of initial loads of structural steel and conveyors. As of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, we had accruals related to the permanent crusher of $6.0 million and $6.2
million, respectively. Activities in connection with the construction of the permanent secondary
crushing circuit remain on schedule and we expect to complete construction and commissioning by
the end of 2016.
See “Selected Condensed Consolidated Financial and Operational Information” and “Operating
Segment Discussion” in this MD&A for additional information for our copper-gold operations during
the second quarter and first half of 2016 and 2015.
Molybdenum
We provide tolling services for customers by converting molybdenum concentrates to molybdenum
oxide powder and briquettes and ferromolybdenum products. Additionally, we also purchase
molybdenum concentrates to convert to upgraded products which are then sold in the metallurgical
and chemical markets. We expect Langeloth to generate sufficient cash flow to continue to
substantially cover the annual costs of care and maintenance at our two molybdenum mines,
enabling us to hold our molybdenum business on a cash neutral basis and allowing us to retain the
optionality to re-start our mines if a more favorable market presents itself. Additionally, as of January
2016, we are operating a commercial molybdenum beneficiation circuit at our TC Mine to treat
molybdenum concentrates to supplement the concentrate feed we source directly for our Langeloth
facility. This beneficiation process at TC Mine has allowed us to process high copper molybdenum
concentrate, which is then transported to Langeloth for processing.
During the second quarter and first half of 2016, the molybdenum business generated net cash
flows (net of capital expenditures and costs of idle operations for TC Mine and Endako Mine) of $2.6
million and used net cash flows of $1.9 million, respectively, primarily as a result of the change in
the molybdenum working capital accounts driven by the business cycle of receivables, payments
and inventory. During the second quarter of 2016, we incurred approximately $1.7 million and $0.7
million of care and maintenance costs at TC Mine and Endako Mine, respectively. During the first
half of 2016, we incurred approximately $3.5 million and $1.3 million of care and maintenance costs
at TC Mine and Endako Mine, respectively.
Commodity Prices
Our financial results can vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in the market prices of copper,
gold and molybdenum and fluctuations in our production. World market prices for our products have
fluctuated historically and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Any significant
fluctuation in demand or prices may have a material effect on our operating results, cash flows and
financial condition.

Liquidity
Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $119.7 million at June 30, 2016, compared to $176.8
million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in our cash balance was primarily due to debt service
payments, capital expenditures (primarily related to the Mount Milligan permanent secondary
crusher) and payments related to our strategic initiatives (which includes activities related to the
proposed Arrangement and our prior debt refinancing/restructuring efforts), which were somewhat
offset by the cash flow from the copper and gold sales, net of operating cash costs.
Refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section in this MD&A for a discussion of important
risks to our liquidity if the Arrangement is not consummated.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 (Unaudited)
Net Income (Loss)
Net loss for the second quarter of 2016 was $27.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to
net income of $0.3 million, or nil per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2015. The net loss for
the second quarter of 2016 was primarily due to interest and finance fees of $20.5 million, operating
loss of $3.8 million, non-cash foreign exchange losses of $1.4 million and consolidated income and
mining tax expense of $0.6 million. The net income for the second quarter of 2015 was due primarily
to operating income of $12.1 million and non-cash foreign exchange gains of $16.9 million, partially
offset by a consolidated income and mining tax expense of $5.1 million and interest and finance
fees of $22.3 million. Quarter over quarter, the decrease in operating income is primarily due to a
$16.5 million increase in cost of sales for our copper-gold operations, a $3.4 million decrease in
copper and gold sales, a $3.4 million decrease in tolling and calcining, a $4.9 million increase in
strategic initiative related costs, partially offset by a $9.7 million decrease in the costs for idle mining
operations.
Non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the second quarter of 2016 (which excluded foreign exchange
losses related to intercompany notes, net of tax impacts) was $26.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted
share. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the second quarter of 2015 (which excluded foreign
exchange gains related to intercompany notes, net of tax impacts) was $13.5 million, or $0.06 per
share.
Revenues
Revenues in the second quarter of 2016 were $128.7 million, down 4.0% compared to revenues of
$134.1 million for the second quarter of 2015. The quarter over quarter decrease in revenues was
driven primarily by lower copper sales due to an 18.3% decline in the average realized sales price
for copper and a decrease in tolling and calcining revenues, partially offset by an increase in gold
and molybdenum sales revenue. Copper sales decreased by $11.7 million during the second
quarter of 2016, as compared to the second quarter of 2015, with the sale of 20.3 million pounds of
copper at an average realized sales prices of $2.15 per pound of copper. Gold sales increased by
$8.3 million quarter over quarter, with the sale of 62,314 ounces of gold at an average realized price
of $1,041 per ounce of gold. During the second quarter of 2015, we sold 21.2 million pounds of
copper and 57,920 ounces of gold at average realized sales prices of $2.63 per pound of copper
and $975 per ounce of gold.
In the second quarter of 2016, we sold approximately 3.0 million pounds of molybdenum sourced
entirely from third party purchased product at an average realized sales price of $7.38 per pound. In
the second quarter of 2015, we sold approximately 2.3 million pounds of molybdenum, primarily
from third party purchased product, at an average realized sales price of $9.23 per pound.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2016 were $86.4 million, up 14.7% from the same
quarter in 2015. Quarter over quarter, the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher
operating expenses at our Mount Milligan Mine in connection with the temporary secondary crusher
circuit, a lower amount of capitalized waste in connection with the construction of the tailings dam,
and higher diesel costs, grinding media costs and power usage for our copper-gold operations,
partially offset by favorable Canadian foreign exchange rates.
Lower-of-cost-or-market product inventory adjustments reported within operating expenses for the
US molybdenum segment during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (Continued)
Molybdenum product inventory adjustments in the second quarter of 2016 were related to third party
purchased product and were primarily the result of recovering prices during the quarter.
Molybdenum product inventory write-downs in the second quarter of 2015 were a combination of
write-downs on third party purchased product and inventory from our molybdenum mines and were
primarily the result of declining prices.
Quarter over quarter, operating expenses were impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The foreign exchange rate averaged US$1.00 = C$1.29 for the second quarter of 2016, compared
to an average rate of US$1.00 = C$1.23 for the same period in 2015.
The non-GAAP financial measure of cash cost per pound produced from Mount Milligan Mine in the
second quarter of 2016 was $0.37 per pound of payable copper produced on a by-product basis
(net of gold credits), $1.84 per pound of payable copper produced on a co-product basis and $728
per ounce of payable gold produced on a co-product basis. The non-GAAP financial measure of
cash cost per pound produced from Mount Milligan Mine in the second quarter of 2015 was $0.48

per pound of payable copper produced on a by-product basis, $1.55 per pound of payable copper
produced on a co-product basis and $434 per ounce of payable gold produced on a co-product
basis. Quarter over quarter, the decrease in non-GAAP copper cash costs on a by-product basis
was primarily related to by an increase in ounces of gold sold and an increase in the average
realized price of gold in the second quarter of 2016 together with a favorable Canadian exchange
rate. See our Operating Segment Discussion for the further details on other non-GAAP cash cost
metrics.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expense ("DD&A")
DD&A in the second quarter of 2016 was $29.1 million, compared to $26.8 million in the second
quarter of 2015. Quarter over quarter, the increase in DD&A is primarily related to the timing of
assets placed in service for our copper-gold operations and an increase in gold sales volume in the
second quarter of 2016, compared to the second quarter of 2015.
Lower-of-cost-or-market molybdenum product inventory adjustments within DD&A for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:
 
 
US Molybdenum
Canadian Molybdenum—
 
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expense in the second quarter of 2016 was $5.0 million, compared to
$4.9 million in the second quarter of 2015. General and administrative expense for the second
quarter of 2016 and 2015 included $0.7 million and $0.7 million in stock-based compensation
expense, respectively. Under US GAAP, stock-based compensation is included in the specific
operating statement categories that include the compensation costs of the employees, officers and
directors for which the stock-based award applies.
Strategic Initiative Related Costs
In connection with the evaluation of strategic and financial alternatives, we incurred fees and other
related costs of $4.9 million during the second quarter of 2016. No such expense was incurred in
the second quarter of 2015.
Costs for Idle Mining Operations
Costs for idle mining operations in the second quarter of 2016 were $2.4 million, compared to $12.1
million in the second quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016 and 2015, we incurred $1.7
million and $1.8 million, respectively, in care and maintenance costs at TC Mine and $0.7 million
and $10.3 million, respectively, in care and maintenance and temporary suspension costs at
Endako Mine. Quarter over quarter, the decrease in costs for idle operations is due primarily to a
$6.7 million decrease in one-time severance costs at Endako Mine incurred in the second quarter of
2015. The Endako Mine was placed on care and maintenance effective July 1, 2015. See our 2015
Form 10-K for further discussion.

Interest and Finance Fees
Interest and finance fees were $20.5 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $22.3
million in the second quarter of 2015. Quarter over quarter, the decrease in interest expense was
primarily due to debt reductions related to repurchases of our Senior Notes in 2015. See our 2015
Form 10-K for additional details on these repurchases. In the second quarter of 2016 and 2015, we
capitalized $0.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of interest and amortization of debt issuance
costs. We capitalize interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to
construct new facilities until assets are ready for their intended use. This capitalized interest will be
amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the ore body based on
recoverable quantities to be mined from proven and probable reserves.
Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses
For the second quarter of 2016 and 2015, we recognized $1.4 million of foreign exchange losses
and $16.9 million of foreign exchange gains, respectively. The foreign exchange losses in the
second quarter of 2016 consisted of $1.7 million of unrealized foreign exchange losses on
intercompany notes, $2.4 million of unrealized losses on forward currency contracts, partially offset
by $2.7 million in realized foreign exchange gains related to forward currency contracts. The foreign
exchange gains in the second quarter of 2015 included approximately $16.0 million in unrealized
foreign exchange gains on intercompany notes, $0.7 million in realized foreign exchange gains
related to forward currency contracts and $0.2 million in realized foreign exchange gains related to
other operating items.
The primary driver of the increase in non-cash foreign currency losses were the intercompany notes
that are C$ denominated and were entered into as part of a strategy to manage cash balances to
fund our operations and provide future tax benefits. Quarter over quarter, the increase in foreign
exchange losses was primarily due to the weakening of the C$ against the US$ in the second
quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. The foreign exchange rate at which the
notes were revalued was US$1.00 = C$1.30 at June 30, 2016 compared to US $1.00 = C$1.30 at
March 31, 2016. The foreign exchange rate at which the notes were revalued was US$1.00 =
C$1.25 at June 30, 2015 compared to US$1.00 = C$1.27 at March 31, 2015.
Other
Other expense in the second quarter of 2016 was $1.7 million, compared to other income of $1.8
million in the second quarter of 2015. Other expense of $1.7 million for the second quarter of 2016
comprised unfavorable mark-to-market losses on our commodity price hedges of which $1.2 million
were realized, $0.3 million were unrealized and $0.2 million related to certain tax items. Other
income of $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2015 included overall favorable mark-to-market
income related to copper and gold commodity price hedges, of which $0.3 million was realized and
$1.5 million was unrealized income.
Income and Mining Tax Expense (Benefit)
Tax expense in the second quarter of 2016 was $0.6 million compared to $5.1 million for the second
quarter of 2015. Quarter over quarter, the difference in our tax expense is primarily due to the effect
of a small foreign exchange loss in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a large foreign
exchange gain in the second quarter of 2015. Additionally, the tax expense for the second quarter of
2016 and 2015 included nil and $0.3 million in gains, respectively, related to foreign exchange on
deferred tax assets.

Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 (Unaudited)
Net Loss
Net income for the first six months of 2016 was $7.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to
a net loss of $86.9 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the first six months of 2015. The net
income for the first half of 2016 was due primarily to operating income of $3.6 million and non-cash
foreign exchange gains of $58.0 million, partially offset by interest and finance fees of $41.6 million
and a consolidated income and mining tax expense of $8.1 million. The net loss for the first half of
2015 was due primarily to non-cash foreign exchange losses of $71.3 million and interest and
finance fees of $44.9 million, which were somewhat offset by operating income of $17.3 million and
a consolidated income and mining tax benefit of $11.6 million. Period over period, the decrease in
operating income reflects a decrease in copper sales due to a decline in average realized sales
prices and slightly lower sales volume for copper, decreased molybdenum sales due to the care
and maintenance status of our mines which were somewhat offset by an increase in average
realized sales price and sales volume for gold.
Non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the first six months of 2016 was $46.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted
share, compared to non-GAAP adjusted net loss of $27.7 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the
first six months of 2015 (which excluded foreign exchange losses related to intercompany notes, net
of tax impacts). See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for the definition and reconciliation of non-
GAAP adjusted net income.
Revenues
Revenues in the first six months of 2016 were $226.1 million, down 12.1%, compared to revenues
of $257.1 million for the first six months of 2015. Period over period, the decrease in revenues was
primarily driven by lower sales from our molybdenum mines, which are currently on care and
maintenance, lower copper sales revenue due to a decrease in the market price of copper and
slightly lower copper sales volumes, partially offset by higher gold sales revenue. During the first six
months of 2016, we sold 35.3 million pounds of payable copper and 106,705 ounces of payable
gold at average realized sales prices of $2.16 per pound of copper and $1,035 per ounce of gold.
During the first half of 2015, we sold 36.0 million pounds of payable copper and 94,670 ounces of
payable gold at average realized sales prices of $2.56 per pound of copper and $979 per ounce of
gold.
We sold approximately 6.1 million pounds and 6.5 million pounds of molybdenum in the first six
months of 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which nil and 3.1 million pounds, respectively, were from
our mines. Substantially all molybdenum sales from our mines in the first six months of 2015
represented sales of molybdenum inventory from 2014. In the first six months of 2016, the average
realized sales price for molybdenum was $6.92 per pound compared to $9.73 per pound in the
comparable period in 2015.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the first six months of 2016 were $143.9 million, down 9.1% from the
comparable period in 2015. Period over period, the decrease in operating expenses is primarily due
to the care and maintenance status of our molybdenum mines in 2016 together with favorable
Canadian foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased costs for the temporary secondary
crusher circuit, a lower amount of capitalized waste in connection with the construction of the
tailings dam, and higher diesel costs, grinding media costs and power usage at our Mount Milligan
Mine.
Lower-of-cost-or-market product inventory adjustments within operating expenses for each
reportable segment during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

Period over period, operating expenses were impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The foreign exchange rate averaged US$1.00 = C$1.33 for the first half of 2016, compared to an
average rate of US$1.00 = C$1.24 for the same period in 2015.
The non-GAAP financial measure of cash cost per pound produced from Mount Milligan Mine in the
first six months of 2016 was $0.60 per pound of payable copper produced on a by-product basis,
$1.59 per pound of payable copper produced on a co-product basis and $618 per ounce of payable
gold produced on a co-product basis. The non-GAAP financial measure of cash cost per pound
produced from Mount Milligan Mine in the first six months of 2015 was $0.75 per pound of payable
copper produced on a by-product basis, $1.59 per pound of payable copper produced on a co-
product basis and $462 per ounce of payable gold produced on a co-product basis. Period over
period, the unit by-product cash cost for copper was positively impacted by an increase in gold
ounces sold and average realized sales of gold, which was somewhat offset by higher operating
costs, as discussed above. See our Operating Segment Discussion for the further details on other
non-GAAP cash cost metrics.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expense ("DD&A")
DD&A in the first six months of 2016 was $48.9 million compared to $46.8 million in the comparable
period in 2015. DD&A increased primarily due to the timing of assets placed in service for our
copper-gold operations and an increase in gold sales volume in the first half of 2016 compared to
the first half of 2015.
Lower-of-cost-or-market molybdenum product inventory adjustments within DD&A for the six

General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expense in the first six months of 2016 was $9.1 million compared to
$10.5 million in the first six months of 2015. Lower general and administrative expense in the first
six months of 2016 was primarily due to lower compensation, travel, consulting and listing fee
expense. General and administrative expense for the first six months of 2016 and 2015 included
$1.6 million and $1.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, respectively.

Strategic Initiative Related Costs
In connection with the evaluation of strategic and financial alternatives, we incurred fees and other
related costs of $8.3 million during the first half of 2016. No such expense was incurred in the first
half of 2015.
Costs for idle mining operations
Costs for idle mining operations in the first six months of 2016 was $4.8 million compared to $17.7
million in the first six months of 2015. In the first six months of 2016 these costs included $3.5
million in care and maintenance expense at TC Mine and $1.3 million in care and maintenance at
Endako Mine. In the first six months of 2015 these costs included $4.2 million in care and
maintenance expense at TC Mine, $6.8 million in suspension costs at Endako Mine and $6.7
million in one-time severance costs at Endako Mine.

Interest and Finance Fees
Interest and finance fees were $41.6 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to $44.9 million
in the first six months of 2015. Interest expense was lower in the first six months of 2016 primarily
due to debt reductions related to repurchases of our Senior Notes and the tMEDS exchange and
final settlement in the first six months of 2015. In the first six months of 2016 and 2015, we
capitalized $1.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of interest and amortization of debt issuance
costs. We capitalize interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to
construct new facilities and equipment until assets are ready for their intended use. This capitalized
interest will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the ore
body based on recoverable quantities to be mined from proven and probable reserves.
Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses
For the first six months of 2016 and 2015, we recognized $58.0 million of foreign exchange gains
and $71.3 million of foreign exchange losses, respectively. The foreign exchange gains in the first
six months of 2016 included approximately $52.6 million of unrealized foreign exchange gains on
intercompany notes, $3.0 million in unrealized foreign exchange gains related to forward currency
contracts, $2.2 million in realized foreign exchange gains related to forward currency contracts and
$0.2 million in realized foreign exchange gains related to other operating items. The foreign
exchange losses in the first half of 2015 included $70.5 million in unrealized foreign exchange
losses on intercompany notes, $0.9 million in realized foreign exchange losses related to forward
currency contracts offset by $0.1 million in realized foreign exchange gains related to other
operating items.
Period over period, the increase in non-cash foreign currency gains were primarily unrealized and
related to intercompany notes that were entered into as part of a strategy to manage cash balances
to fund our operations and provide future tax benefits. The increase in foreign exchange gains was
primarily due to the weakening of the C$ against the US$. The foreign exchange rate at which the
notes were revalued was US$1.00 = C$1.30 at June 30, 2016 compared to US $1.00 = C$1.38 at
December 31, 2015. The foreign exchange rate at which the notes were revalued was US$1.00 =
C$1.25 at June 30, 2015 compared to US$1.00 = C$1.16 at December 31, 2014.
Other
Other expense in the first six months of 2016 was $4.9 million compared to other income of $3.1
million in the first six months of 2015. The $4.9 million of other expense for the first six months of
2016 primarily comprised unfavorable mark-to-market losses on our commodity price hedges, of
which $2.1 million were realized losses, $2.1 million were unrealized losses, $0.3 million were fees
paid in connection with a gold collar and $0.4 million related to certain tax items. The $3.1 million of
other income during the first six months of 2015 represented overall favorable mark-to-market
income related to copper and gold commodity price hedges, of which $3.7 million was realized
income and $0.6 million was unrealized loss.
Income and Mining Tax (Benefit) Expense
Tax expense in the first half of 2016 was $8.1 million compared to a tax benefit of $11.6 million for
the first half of 2015. The difference between our tax expense in the first half of 2016 and tax benefit
in the first half of 2015 is primarily due to the effect of foreign exchange gains in the first half of 2016
as compared to foreign exchange losses in the first half of 2015. Additionally, the tax expense for
the first half of 2016 and 2015 included a $1.2 million gain and a $1.3 million loss, respectively,
related to foreign exchange on deferred tax assets.

Copper and Gold Production and Cash Costs
For the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015,
there was an 18.3% decrease in concentrate production (dry tonnes), a 27.1% decrease in payable
copper production, a 22.6% decrease in payable gold production and an 11.2% increase in mill
throughput. During the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015, there was a 3.6% increase
in concentrate production (dry tonnes), a 5.1% decrease in payable copper production, a 6.0%
decrease in payable gold production and a 27.8% increase in mill throughput.

THOMPSON CREEK METALS COMPANY INC.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (Continued)
Quarter over quarter, copper and gold recoveries were lower due to lower ore grades primarily due
to pit sequencing and transitioning from phase 2 to phase 3 mining, regrind and flotation circuits
associated with increased throughput and scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. Period over
period, copper and gold recoveries were lower due primarily to the 2016 operational performance of
the ball mill, lower ore grades primarily due to pit sequencing and transitioning from phase 2 to
phase 3 mining, regrind and flotation circuits associated with increased throughput and scheduled
and unscheduled maintenance.
Non-GAAP unit cash costs for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015
were $0.37 per pound, compared to $0.48 per pound of copper on a by-product basis, respectively,
$1.84 per pound, compared to $1.55 per pound of copper on a co-product basis, respectively, and
$728 per ounce compared to $434 per ounce of gold on a co-product basis, respectively. By-
product cash costs for the second quarter of 2016 were favorably impacted by an increase in
ounces of gold sold and an increase in the average realized price of gold in the second quarter of
2016, compared to the second quarter of 2015 which were somewhat offset by higher operating
costs as previously discussed. Quarter over quarter, co-product unit cash costs for copper were
unfavorably impacted by significantly lower payable copper production, due to lower ore grades and
recoveries discussed previously. Quarter over quarter, the significant increase in gold unit cash
costs on a co-product basis was primarily due to an increase in overall cash costs due to factors
discussed above as well as a higher proportion of cash costs allocated to gold in the second quarter
of 2016 due to lower payable copper production and copper prices together with a decrease in
payable gold production and higher operating costs in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the
second quarter of 2015.
Non-GAAP unit cash costs for the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015 were $0.60 per
pound, compared to $0.75 per pound of copper on a by-product basis, respectively, $1.59 per
pound of copper for both periods on a co-product basis and $618 per ounce compared to $462 per
ounce of gold on a co-product basis, respectively. By-product cash costs for the first half of 2016
were favorably impacted by an increase in ounces of gold sold and an increase in the average
realized price of gold in the first half of 2016, compared to the first half of 2015, which were
somewhat offset by higher operating costs as previously discussed. Period over period, co-product
unit cash costs for copper remained the same. Period over period, the significant increase in gold
unit cash costs on a co-product basis was primarily due to an increase in cash costs allocated to
gold due to the sharp decline in copper market prices together with lower payable gold production
and higher operating costs.
Operating expenses for our copper-gold operations were higher for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 due primarily to an
increase in costs related to temporary secondary crushing, grinding media, power, diesel and labor
usage and a decrease in capitalized costs related to our tailings storage facility. Operating
expenses were positively impacted by favorable foreign exchange rates, as the US$ strengthened
against the C$ in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the three and six
months ended June 30, 2015. The average foreign exchange rate was US$1.00 = C1.29 for the
second quarter of 2016 and US$1.00 =1.33 for the first half of 2016, compared to US$1.00 = C1.23
for the second quarter of 2015 and US$1.00 = C1.24 for the first half of 2015, resulting in a favorable
impact on operating costs of approximately $6.4 million and $6.6 million for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.
Copper and Gold Sold
During the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, copper sales volumes
decreased by 4.2% and gold sales volumes increased by 7.6%. Quarter over quarter, for copper, the
18.3% lower average realized sales price and a decrease in copper sales volumes resulted in an
overall decrease in copper sales revenue. Quarter over quarter, for gold, the increase in sales
volumes in addition to a 6.8% higher average realized sales price resulted in an increase in gold
sales revenue.
During the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015, copper sales volumes decreased by
2.0% and gold sales volumes increased by 12.7%. While we made seven shipments and
recognized seven sales in each of the first halves of 2016 and 2015, due to the relative copper and
gold content of our 2016 shipments, we recognized higher sales volumes for gold and slightly lower
sales volumes for copper in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015. Period over
period, the average realized price for copper decreased by 15.6% and the average realized price for
gold increased by 5.7%.
Quarter over quarter and period over period, the average realized prices for copper and gold were
impacted by falling copper prices and recovering gold prices. The fluctuations in metals prices
resulted in adjustments to the final settlement of certain provisional payments together and mark-to-
market adjustments for prior period provisional payments not yet final. See “Non-GAAP Financial
Measures” for the definition and reconciliation of the non-GAAP average realized sales prices.

Capital Expenditures
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we made C$20.3 million of capital expenditures for
Mount Milligan Mine, consisting of C$15.6 million related to the permanent secondary crushing
circuit, C$4.2 million related to the tailings storage facility and C$0.5 million for ongoing operations.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we made C$41.2 million of capital expenditures for

circuit, C$9.6 million related to the tailings storage facility and C$1.5 million for ongoing operations.
During the three months ended June 30, 2015, we made C$11.3 million of capital expenditures for
Mount Milligan Mine, consisting of C$10.1 million for ongoing operations, C$0.6 million for
engineering work for the secondary crusher and C$0.6 million related primarily to the payment of
accruals from 2014. During the first half of 2015, we made C$26.8 million of capital expenditures for
Mount Milligan Mine, consisting of C$22.7 million for ongoing operations, C$2.9 million for
engineering work for the secondary crusher and C$1.2 million related to the payment of accruals
from 2014.
US Molybdenum Operating Activities
Langeloth Facility
Operating results for the Langeloth Facility represent activities related to the roasting and
processing of third-party concentrate and other metals at the Langeloth Facility. However, the
molybdenum pounds and the costs for the molybdenum beneficiation circuit at TC Mine, treating
molybdenum concentrates to supplement the concentrate feed we source directly for our Langeloth
facility, are included in the Langeloth Facility operating results.

During the second quarter and first half of 2016, our debt and liquidity positions were primarily
affected by the following:
Cash generated by operating activities of $6.3 million during the second quarter of 2016 and cash
used in operating $9.4 million for the first half of 2016 reflects four shipments of concentrate and
four provisional payments in the second quarter of 2016 and seven shipments of concentrate and
seven provisional payments in the first half of 2016;
•Lower average realized prices for copper;
Payments of $4.9 million in the second quarter of 2016 and $8.3 million in the first half of 2016
related to our strategic initiatives (which includes activities related to the sale of the company and
debt refinancing/restructuring efforts);
Interest payments of $24.4 million and $40.6 million on our Senior Notes for the second quarter of
2016 and first half of 2016;
Capital expenditures of $15.9 million for the second quarter of 2016 and $31.5 million for the first
half of 2016, primarily related to our Mount Milligan Mine permanent secondary crushing circuit;
and
Equipment financing repayments of $6.5 million and $12.8 million for the second quarter and first
half of 2016, respectively.
We monitor our exposure to the prices of our products as well as the currencies in which we
operate. During the second quarter and first half of 2016, we entered into hedges to manage
exposure to fluctuations in the prices of copper and gold and also purchased gold to satisfy our
obligations under the Gold Stream Arrangement; we also entered into hedges to manage exposure
to the potential strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar. See Note 5 within Item 1
for further discussion.
As of June 30, 2016, we have provided the appropriate regulatory authorities in the US and Canada
•
•
with approximately $74.5 million in reclamation financial assurance in the form of surety bonds for
our share of mine closure obligations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As of June 30, 2016,
the surety bonds required cash collateral of $10.0 million. We have been notified by one of the
surety bond providers that they will not renew the surety bond on the Endako reclamation
obligation, which expires on August 18, 2016. We continue to look for alternatives to satisfy the
Endako reclamation financial assurance, of which our share is $8.9 million, which may include cash
deposits with the appropriate regulatory authority in Canada for the full amount. Additionally, during
the second quarter, we were required to post $2.6 million of cash collateral related to a $10 million
surety bond related to our equipment lease obligations and $0.5 million of cash related to a surety
bond to our electricity provider for TC Mine. Any continued perceived challenges to our liquidity in
the short or long term could cause regulatory authorities and contractual counterparties to require
additional financial assurances with respect to our obligations to them. To the extent that the value
of any security provided to regulatory authorities is or becomes insufficient to cover the amount of
financial assurance we are required to post, we would be required to replace or supplement the
existing security with more expensive forms of security, which might include further cash deposits,
which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Refer to Part I, Item 1.A “Risk Factors”
in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional discussion.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (Continued)
Copper and gold prices, the operating performance of our Mount Milligan Mine, the US$ to C$
foreign exchange rate and the scheduled maturities of our outstanding Senior Notes are the critical
drivers of our liquidity and credit quality. We believe that estimated cash flow from our Mount
Milligan Mine, together with cash on hand as of June 30, 2016, will provide sufficient liquidity to
fund our planned capital expenditures, working capital needs, scheduled debt and interest
payments and $8.9 million in Endako reclamation financial assurance (discussed above) until our
outstanding Senior Notes (outlined above) come due, beginning in December 2017. This liquidity
outlook is based on the following assumptions: (i) estimated copper and gold production and
operating and capital costs for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 based on our current mining plan; (ii)
spot prices ranging from $2.00 to $2.40 per pound for copper; (iii) spot prices ranging from $1,000 to
$1,300 per ounce for gold; (iv) foreign exchange rates ranging from US$1.00 = C$1.25-$1.30; and
(v) financial assurance obligations, including assurances related to our reclamation obligations,
substantially consistent with our current obligations. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business.
As discussed above, on July 5, 2016, we entered into an Arrangement Agreement with Centerra,
pursuant to which Centerra will acquire all of our outstanding common shares pursuant to a
statutory plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). In addition,
pursuant to the Arrangement, our outstanding Senior Notes will be redeemed, or otherwise satisfied
and discharged, in their entirety for cash. The closing of the Arrangement is subject to applicable
regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary conditions, including shareholder approval.
If approved, the Arrangement is expected to close in the second half of 2016. In connection with the
successful consummation of the Transaction, an estimated success fee of $10 million (net of
previously paid amounts of approximately $1 million) will be paid by us to our financial advisors. In
addition, upon termination of the Arrangement Agreement under specified circumstances, including
a change in the recommendation of our board of directors or in order to enter into an alternative
transaction, we will be required to pay a cash termination fee to Centerra of $35 million.
We cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the required closing conditions will be
satisfied and there is no assurance that the Arrangement will be completed. In the event the
Transaction is not successfully completed, it is highly likely that we may not have sufficient time to
refinance or restructure our current debt prior to December 31, 2016 at which time the 2017 Notes
will be classified as current. This factor would raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern at year end. A going concern opinion will likely trigger stricter credit terms from
our suppliers and requirements to replace or supplement existing security for our financial
assurance obligations,  including those related to reclamation liabilities, with more expensive forms
of security or cash collateral, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. If we are
unable to continue as a going concern, we may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection against our
debt obligations and our securityholders could lose their entire investment in our company. Please
refer to Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our 2015 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in
this report for further discussion.
The following table summarizes the scheduled maturities and interest rates of our Senior Notes

Operating Cash Flows
Cash generated by operating activities for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $6.3 million
and cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $9.4 million
compared to cash generated by operating activities of $23.9 million and $18.6 million for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. Quarter over quarter, the decrease in cash flow
from operations was primarily a result of the timing of provisional payments for our concentrate,
higher operating cash costs at our Mount Milligan Mine due to higher costs related to temporary
secondary crushing, grinding media, power, diesel and labor usage and a decrease in capitalized
costs related to our tailings storage facility and costs associated with our strategic initiatives,
discussed previously. Period over period the decrease in cash flow from operations is due to a
decrease in molybdenum sales revenue due to the care and maintenance status of our
molybdenum mines together with the timing of provisional payments for our concentrate, higher
cash costs at our Mount Milligan Mine in connection with temporary secondary crushing, grinding
media, power, diesel and labor usage and a decrease in capitalized costs related to our tailings
storage facility and costs associated with our strategic initiatives. For the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 cash flow from operations benefited $5.5 million and $15.6 million,
respectively and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 cash flow from operations
benefited $5.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively in net payables related to the Gold Stream
Arrangement for undelivered ounces.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $19.3
million and $35.2 million, respectively compared to cash used in investing activities of $9.9 million
and $16.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. During the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016, we spent $15.9 million and $31.5 million, respectively on
property, plant, equipment and development expenditures primarily related to the permanent
secondary crushing circuit and the tailings storage facility at our Mount Milligan Mine. During the
three and six months ended June 30, 2015, we spent $9.7 million and $22.9 million, respectively on
property, plant, equipment and development expenditures primarily related to ongoing operating
capital and the construction of the secondary crusher. Payments of capitalized interest primarily
related to the Mount Milligan Mine were $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively during the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $0.3 million and $1.0 million for the
comparable periods in 2015.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 we posted $2.6 million in cash collateral on
certain surety bonds and we posted $0.5 million in other cash collateral, discussed previously.
There were no reclamation deposit payments or refunds in the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015.
Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $6.5 million
and $12.7 million, respectively compared to cash used in financing activities of $41.1 million and
$55.4 million, respectively for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. Quarter over quarter
and period over period, the decrease in cash used in financing activities was due primarily to
certain senior note repurchases in 2015 periods. For descriptions of our debt and lease obligations,
see Notes 7 and 8 within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of June 30, 2016, we have commitments to purchase approximately 7.0 million pounds of
molybdenum sulfide concentrate and 1.4 million pounds of molybdenum oxide from 2016 to 2017 to
be priced at the time of purchase. In addition, we have fixed-priced contracts, under which we have
committed to sell approximately 87.8 thousand pounds of molybdenum in 2016 to 2019 at an
average market price of $7.45 per pound.
Transactions with our Endako Mine Joint Venture Partner
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, TCM did not make any sales to Sojitz,
TCM's Endako Mine joint venture partner.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with
US GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess our operating performance for
the reasons described further below. These measures do not have standard meanings prescribed
by US GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The
presentation of these measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute
for, or as superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with
US GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of
the amounts associated with the results of operations as determined in accordance with US GAAP.
Adjusted Net (Loss) Income, Adjusted Net (Loss) Income Per Share—Basic and Diluted
Management of the Company uses adjusted net (loss) income and adjusted net (loss) income per
share—basic and diluted to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and for planning and
forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the use of these measures allows
investors and analysts to compare results of the continuing operations of the Company to similar
operating results of other mining companies, by excluding unusual or infrequent items that are
considered non-core to our business.
Adjusted net (loss) income represents the (loss) income prepared in accordance with US GAAP,
adjusted for significant non-cash items.
For the first three and six months of 2016 and 2015 and for the five quarters ended June 30, 2016,
the significant items were the net gains and losses related to the impact of foreign exchange due
primarily to intercompany notes and related tax effects. Additionally, for the fourth quarter of 2015, in
connection with a change in our legal structure we also had a significant non-cash release of tax
valuation allowances which were generated in prior years primarily as a result of asset impairments.
In connection with our strategy to manage cash balances, fund our operations and provide future tax
benefits, we may enter into intercompany loan arrangements. At times, the loans are denominated
in currencies other than the measurement currency of one of the parties. US GAAP requires that
notes that are intended to be repaid should not be considered a capital contribution, and, therefore,
the foreign exchange fluctuations related to these loans impact net (loss) income each period. At
each period end, we compare the exchange rate between the Canadian and US dollars to the
exchange rate at the end of the prior reporting period. The difference between those rates is
recorded as an unrealized gain or loss on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations
and Comprehensive (Loss) Income at each period end. Settlement of these intercompany loans
results in realized foreign exchange gains or losses recorded on the Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The loans between the parent
company and its subsidiaries are the primary driver of our foreign exchange gains and losses, as
discussed above, management does not consider gains or losses on foreign exchange in its
evaluation of our financial performance. We believe that presentation of our non-GAAP measures
excluding these gains or losses provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial
condition and results of operations.
Adjusted net (loss) income per share (basic and diluted) is calculated using adjusted net (loss)
income, as defined above, divided by the weighted-average basic and weighted-average diluted
shares outstanding during the period as determined in accordance with US GAAP. If the
adjustments to net loss on a US GAAP basis result in non-GAAP adjusted net income, we calculate
weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in accordance with US GAAP and use that to
calculate adjusted net income per share—diluted. If the adjustments to net income on a US GAAP
basis result in non-GAAP adjusted net loss, we utilize weighted-average basic shares outstanding
to calculate adjusted net income per share—diluted, in accordance with US GAAP.
The following tables reconciles net (loss) income presented in accordance with US GAAP to the
non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted net (loss) income and adjusted net (loss) income per
share—basic and diluted, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and for the
previous four quarters. All figures within the tables are unaudited and are presented in US$ in
millions, except shares and per share amounts.

Copper-Gold Operations - Unit Cash Cost and Average Realized Price per Payable Pound or
Payable Ounce Sold
Unit cash cost on a by-product and co-product basis are considered key measures in evaluating
operating performance in our Copper-Gold operations, as well as measures of profitability and
efficiency on a consolidated basis. Although unit cash cost on a by-product and co-product basis
are not measures of financial performance, do not have standardized meaning prescribed by
US GAAP, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, we
believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information to investors.
Unit cash cost on a by-product and co-product basis represent the mining, milling, on-site general
and administration, truck and rail transportation, warehousing, refining and treatment, and ocean
freight and insurance costs; and exclude the effects of changes in inventory; other non-cash
employee benefits such as stock-based compensation, depreciation, depletion, amortization and
accretion.
On a by-product basis, sales of by-product metals are deducted when computing cash costs in
accordance with the cash cost standard endorsed by the World Gold Council and, previously, the
Gold Institute.
On a co-product basis, cash costs are allocated between copper and gold based on production.
Copper production is stated in thousands of pounds. Gold production has been converted to
thousands of copper equivalent (Cu eq.) pounds using the gold production for the periods
presented, as well as the most recent quarterly average prices for copper and gold. The price used
for copper is the most recent quarterly average of the Metals Bulletin Daily published price for LME
settlement per tonne. The price used for gold is a weighted average of the most recent quarterly
average of the Metals Bulletin Daily published prices for daily average London price per ounce
adjusted for the fixed price established under the Gold Stream Arrangement ($435 per oz).
The following tables provide a reconciliation of cash costs, unit cash costs, and operating expenses
for Copper-Gold operations included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive (Loss) Income in the determination of net (loss) income for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and the five quarters ended June 30, 2016.

(1) The six months ended June 30, 2016 reflect a $1.5 million reduction related to five provisional
invoices from 2015. The decrease resulted from a downward revision of $27/oz. to the rate at which
the deferred revenue liability resulting from the Gold Stream Arrangement was amortized. This rate
is calculated based on the remaining deferred revenue liability and total ounces of refined gold
owed to Royal Gold.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Change in Estimate
The critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed
consolidated financial statements are set forth in our 2015 Form 10-K and have not changed.

Table of Contents
ITEM 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Commodity Price Risk
Our consolidated revenues include the sale of copper and gold concentrate from Mount Milligan
Mine and the sale of molybdenum in various forms from third-party material that is purchased,
processed and sold from the Langeloth Facility. Our financial results can vary significantly as a
result of fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold and molybdenum.
Copper and Gold
Substantially all of our concentrate sales contracts provide final pricing in a specified future month
(generally one to four months from the shipment date) based primarily on quoted LBMA monthly
average spot gold prices or quoted LME monthly average spot copper prices. We receive market
prices based on prices in the specified future period, which results in price fluctuations recorded
through revenues until the date of settlement. To the extent final prices are higher or lower than
what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to revenues is recorded each
reporting period until the date of final pricing. Accordingly, in times of rising copper and gold prices,
our revenues benefit from adjustments to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to
contracts entered into in prior periods; in times of falling copper and gold prices, the opposite
occurs.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we had copper sales totaling 20.3 million
pounds and 35.3 million pounds, respectively, recorded at an average realized price of $2.15 per
pound and $2.16 per pound, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, 25.3 million pounds of copper are
subject to final pricing over the next several months. We estimate that each $0.10 per pound change
in the price realized from the June 30, 2016 provisional price recorded would have a net impact on
consolidated revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 of approximately $2.1
million and $3.5 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, we had no derivative contracts related to
copper hedging.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we had gold sales totaling 62,314 ounces and
106,705 ounces, respectively, at an average realized price of $1,041 per ounce and $1,035 per
ounce, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, 50,506 ounces of gold are subject to final pricing over the
next several months. We estimate that each $25 per ounce change in the price realized from the
June 30, 2016 provisional price recorded would have a net impact on our share of the consolidated
revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 of approximately $0.7 million and $1.2
million, respectively.
To satisfy our obligation under the Gold Stream Arrangement, we purchase unallocated refined gold
and arrange for delivery to Royal Gold's designated account. We are currently required to pay Royal
Gold upon receipt of final payment from the applicable offtakers. We receive final payments in cash,
thus requiring the purchase of gold in order to satisfy the obligation to pay Royal Gold in gold.
In order to hedge our gold price risk that arises when physical purchase and concentrate sales
pricing periods do not match, we enter into certain forward gold purchase and sales contracts where
we purchase gold at an average price during a quotational period (QP) and sell gold at a spot price.
We record our commodity contracts at fair value using a market approach based on observable
quote market prices and contracted prices.
At June 30, 2016, under derivative contracts designed to hedge gold price risk, we had contracts to
purchase 39,470 ounces of gold at prices to be determined and we had entered into forward gold
sales and gold collars for approximately 35,600 ounces in total with a sell price of $1,310 per
ounce, buy price to be determined, a put price range of $1,050 - $1,200 per ounce and a call price
range of $1,164 - $1,350 per ounce.

_____________________________________________________________________________
As of June 30, 2016, we had 1,021.2 thousand pounds of purchased molybdenum subject to final
(1) 
pricing.
In the normal course of operations, we enter into agreements for the purchase of molybdenum to
provide product for our Langeloth facility. As of June 30, 2016, we had commitments to purchase
approximately 7.0 million pounds of unroasted molybdenum concentrate and 1.4 million pounds
of molybdenum oxide from 2016 to 2017, to be priced at the time of purchase at a set discount to
the market price.
As of June 30, 2016, for our fixed-priced molybdenum sales contracts the average price per
(2)
(3) pound is $11.23.
As outlined in the table above, we enter into molybdenum purchase contracts to purchase future
molybdenum production at provisional prices. To the extent final prices are higher or lower than
what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to inventory is recorded each
reporting period until the date of final pricing. In times of falling molybdenum prices, molybdenum
purchases benefit from lower prices paid for contracts priced at current market rates and also from a
decrease related to the final pricing of provisionally-priced purchases pursuant to contracts entered
into in prior years; in times of rising molybdenum prices, the opposite occurs. The future pricing
mechanism of these agreements constitutes an embedded derivative, which is bifurcated and
separately marked to estimated fair value at the end of each period. Changes to the fair values of
the embedded derivatives related to provisionally-priced molybdenum purchases are included in
operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
(Loss) Income as the product is sold. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we
estimate that for each $1 per pound change in the price realized for molybdenum purchases,
our operating income remains largely unchanged as the change in market price affects both our
operating expense and sales revenue. Our molybdenum business consists of roasting and
processing of third-party concentrate and other metals, as such our exposure to price fluctuation is
minimized if our inventory level remain stable.
We also enter into certain molybdenum sales contracts to sell future molybdenum production at
fixed prices. We have elected to treat these contracts as normal purchase and normal sale
contracts.
Other
In the normal course of operations, we enter into agreements for the purchase of natural gas for use
at the Langeloth facility. As of June 30, 2016, we had commitments to purchase approximately 22.6
thousand dekatherms (dt) from April 2016 - September 2016 at prices ranging from $3.07 - $3.13.
In April 2015, we entered into an agreement to purchase specified amounts of diesel fuel during
2015 and 2016. As of June 30, 2016, we had commitments to purchase 0.8 million from July 2016
through December 2016 at a price of $2.00 per gallon.

Table of Contents
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We transact business in various currencies in the normal course of operations. All of our revenues
are denominated in the US$; however, we pay certain expenses attributable to our Canadian
operations in the C$. As a result, we have ongoing foreign exchange translation risk with respect to
our Canadian operations. A decrease of 10% in the value of the US$ relative to the C$ would have
lowered operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 by approximately $14.7 million.
To help mitigate this risk, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time, in which
we have agreed to buy Canadian dollars at an agreed-upon rate. Please refer to Note 5 within Item
1 of this Form 10-Q for further discussion. We record our currency contracts at fair value using a
market approach based on observable quoted exchange rates and contracted notional amounts. As
of June 30, 2016, we had 11 open foreign currency contracts. The following table provides details of
our open forward currency contracts as of July 29, 2016:

ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
TCM's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports that are filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to TCM's management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from management, have evaluated the
effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that TCM's disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months
ended June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

PART II
PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are involved in or subject to legal proceedings from time to time related to our business. While it
is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of such proceedings, it is the opinion of
management that the resolution of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS
Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes
information relating to important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition or operating results. Except as set forth below, there have been no
material changes to the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.
There is no assurance when or if the Arrangement will be completed.
        
The completion of the Arrangement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions
as set forth in the Arrangement Agreement, including, among others (i) approval by our
shareholders of the Arrangement, (ii) obtaining certain regulatory and governmental approvals, and
(iii) the absence of legal restraints prohibiting the completion of the Arrangement. There can be no
assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, or that other events will
not intervene to delay or result in the failure to close the Arrangement. In addition, Centerra has the
ability to terminate the Arrangement Agreement if certain equity and debt financing arrangements
are terminated for any reason. Although the Centerra equity and debt financing arrangements are
committed, we can provide no assurance that it will not be terminated and such termination is
outside of our control.
We and Centerra may be unable to obtain the court approval required to complete the Arrangement
or, in order to do so, we and/or Centerra may be required to comply with material restrictions or
conditions that may negatively affect the combined company after the Arrangement is completed or
cause them to abandon the Arrangement. Failure to complete the Arrangement could negatively
affect the future business and financial results of Centerra and Thompson Creek.
    
Completion of the Arrangement is contingent upon, among other things, the receipt of the required
court approval under Division 5 of Part 9 of the BCBCA. We can provide no assurance that the
required court approval will be obtained or that the approval will not contain terms, conditions or
restrictions that would be detrimental to the combined company after completion of the
Arrangement.
After completion of the Arrangement, Centerra may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the
Arrangement, which could adversely affect the value of Centerra common shares, its business and
results of operations.
        
The success of the Arrangement will depend, in part, on Centerra’s ability to integrate effectively the
businesses of Centerra and TCM and realize the anticipated benefits from such combination. There
is a risk that some or all of the expected benefits of the Arrangement may fail to materialize, or may
not occur within the time periods anticipated by Centerra. The realization of such benefits may be
affected by a number of factors, many of which may be beyond the control of Centerra.
       
 In addition, the combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and
resources to integrating its business practices and support functions. The diversion of
management's attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the
Arrangement and the integration of the two companies' operations could have an adverse effect on
the business, financial results, financial condition or share price of Centerra following the
Arrangement. The integration process may also result in greater than anticipated or unforeseen
expenses.
        
Completion of the Arrangement may take longer than, and could cost more than, Centerra and TCM
expect. Any delay in completing or any additional conditions imposed in order to complete the
Arrangement may materially adversely affect the synergies and other benefits that Centerra and
TCM expect to achieve from the Arrangement and the integration of their respective businesses.
Failure to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Arrangement may impact the financial
performance of Centerra, the combined company and the price of Centerra’s common shares.

Table of Contents
The announcement and pendency of the Arrangement could adversely affect our business, results
of operations and financial condition.
        
The announcement and pendency of the Arrangement could cause disruptions in and create
uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and
future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition, regardless of whether the Arrangement is completed.
In particular, we could potentially lose important personnel as a result of the departure of employees
who decide to pursue other opportunities in light of the Arrangement. In addition, we have
expended, and continue to expend, significant management resources in an effort to complete the
Arrangement, which are being diverted from our day-to-day operations.
       
 In addition, parties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the
Arrangement, including with respect to current or future business relationships. These disruptions
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
The adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the
Arrangement or termination of the Arrangement Agreement.
If the Arrangement is not consummated, our share price will likely fall, and if we are otherwise
unable to refinance or restructure our 2017 Notes by the end of 2016, we will be unable to continue
as a going concern, and we may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection.
        
If the Arrangement is not completed, our share price will likely fall to the extent that the current
market price of our common shares reflects an assumption that a transaction will be completed.
Further, failure to complete the Arrangement may result in negative publicity and/or a negative
impression of us in the investment community and may affect our relationship with employees,
customers, lenders and other partners in the business and financial community.
In addition, at the end of 2016, our 2017 Notes will be designated as current debt. If the
Arrangement is not successfully consummated, and we are otherwise unable to
refinance/restructure our 2017 Notes, in either case, by the end of 2016, we will be unable to
continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may be forced to
seek bankruptcy protection against our debt obligations, and our shareholders could lose their
entire investment in our company.
The Arrangement Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Arrangement, including if
the Arrangement is not completed.
        
The Arrangement Agreement contains provisions that may make it more difficult for us to sell our
business to a party other than Centerra or pursue other strategic alternatives, including refinancing
of our debt. These provisions include a general prohibition on our soliciting any acquisition
proposal or offer for a competing transaction and the requirement that we pay a termination fee if the
Arrangement Agreement is terminated in specified circumstances. Our board of directors is also
limited in its ability to change its recommendation with respect to the arrangement-related
proposals.
        
While we believe these provisions are reasonable and not preclusive of other offers, these
provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant
part of TCM from considering or proposing such an acquisition, even if such third party were
prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the consideration
proposed to be received or realized in the Arrangement, or might result in a potential acquirer
proposing to pay a lower price than it would otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added
expense of the termination fee that may become payable. In addition, these provisions may prevent
or delay us from having adequate time and ability to refinance our outstanding debt, including our
2017 Notes, in order to avoid liquidity problems and continue as going concern, which will be
necessary if the Arrangement is terminated.
We may have difficulty motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the
Arrangement.
Uncertainty about the effect of the Arrangement on our employees may have an adverse effect on
us and consequently Centerra. This uncertainty may impair our ability to retain and motivate key
personnel until the Arrangement is completed. Employee retention may be particularly challenging
during the pendency of the Arrangement, as employees may experience uncertainty about their
future roles with Centerra. If our key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty
and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become employees of Centerra, Centerra's ability to
realize the anticipated benefits of the Arrangement could be reduced.

Mine closure and reclamation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have
made and our inability to provide reclamation bonding or maintain insurance could adversely affect
our operating results and financial condition.
We are required by US federal and state laws and Canadian federal and provincial laws to provide
financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation
plans if we are unable to do so. These laws are complex and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
The laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations
and the amount and forms of financial assurance. The amount and nature of the financial
assurances are dependent upon a number of factors, including our financial condition and
reclamation cost estimates.
As of June 30, 2016, we have provided the appropriate regulatory authorities in the US and Canada
with approximately $74.5 million in reclamation financial assurance in the form of surety bonds for
our share of mine closure obligations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As of June 30, 2016,
the surety bonds required cash collateral of $10.0 million. As our operations expand or reclamation
expenses increase, our reclamation obligations and the financial assurances that we are required to
provide may increase accordingly.
In addition, any perceived challenges to our liquidity may cause our surety bond holders to increase
the amount of cash collateral required or refuse to provide the same level of surety bonding going
forward. For example, we have been notified by one of the surety bond providers that they will not
renew the surety bond on the Endako reclamation obligation, which expires on August 18, 2016.
We continue to look for alternatives for the Endako reclamation financial assurance, of which our
share is $8.9 million, which may include cash deposits with the appropriate regulatory authority in
Canada for the full amount. Any continued perceived challenges to our liquidity in the short or long
term could cause regulatory authorities and contractual counterparties to require additional financial
assurances with respect to our obligations to them. To the extent that the value of the security
provided to the regulatory authorities is or becomes insufficient to cover the amount of financial
assurance we are required to post, we may be required to replace or supplement the existing
security with more expensive forms of security, which might include cash deposits, which would
reduce our cash available for operations and financing activities.
We have initiated discussions with relevant US federal and state agencies concerning additional
bonding or funding of a trust agreement to cover long-term water treatment at TC Mine, although we
are not currently under any requirement to do so. The amount of funding required is subject to
numerous variables, potentially including an appropriate discount rate, and cannot be determined at
this time. We may be required to engage in a similar discussion with provincial authorities in British
Columbia with respect to the Endako Mine.
In addition, the costs of surety bonds and financial assurance have fluctuated in recent years while
the market terms of such bonds and financial assurance have generally become less favorable to
mine operators. These changes in the terms of the bonds and financial assurance have been
accompanied at times by a decrease in the number of companies willing to issue surety bonds and
financial assurance. Increased costs related to surety bonds and financial assurance, especially in
connection with our current financial condition and restructuring efforts, could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.
