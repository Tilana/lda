<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. In his introductory statement, the Minister for Human Rights and Coordination of 
Humanitarian Action, the head of delegation, began by introducing the delegation of the 
Central African Republic. On behalf of the delegation he expressed the gratitude of the 
people of the Central African Republic and of the leaders of the transitional Government to 
the members of the Human Rights Council for their concern about the situation in the 
Central African Republic and about defending and promoting human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p>6. The Minister for Human Rights then turned to the process of preparing the country&#8217;s 
periodic report and the difficult conditions under which it had been drafted, and expressed 
his Government&#8217;s gratitude to the United Nations system. He also highlighted the efforts 
the Government had made. Lastly, he recalled the undertakings the Central African 
Republic had made to the Human Rights Council in 2009 and explained what had been 
done thus far to meet those commitments. He outlined the concerns and future prospects 
regarding human rights and humanitarian issues and gave the floor to the Minister of 
Justice to introduce the report. </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.14-10056 
</p>
<p>7. The Minister of Justice who was responsible for judicial reform, first gave an 
overview of the State&#8217;s geographical situation, its administrative organization, its economy 
and the succession of regimes that had governed it. He then outlined the institutional and 
legal framework for the promotion and defence of human rights in the Central African 
Republic, specifying that those institutions had always existed, although there had been 
some changes during the transition period. The Minister emphasized the importance of the 
Transitional Constitutional Charter, which had been adopted by the Transitional National 
Council and promulgated on 18 July 2013 on the basis of a broad consensus, and which 
incorporated all the provisions of the 2004 Constitution. The Constitutional Charter 
enshrined the principle of separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary. 
</p><p>8. The delegation reaffirmed that the Central African Republic had acceded to 
international human rights instruments and cited the main ones ratified by the State. The 
establishment of a Ministry of Human Rights and Coordination of Humanitarian Action 
was an additional step forward that reflected the Government&#8217;s desire to ensure that 
individuals were protected. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation outlined the main measures taken to give effect to civil and political 
rights, as well as the advances made through the new Criminal Code and Code of Criminal 
Procedure adopted in 2010, which included several provisions promoting human rights. The 
adjusted length of police custody and the provision concerning the presence of a doctor and 
a lawyer within the first few hours of custody constituted significant progress. 
</p>
<p>10. On 2 August 2013 the Head of State mandated to lead the transition had signed the 
instrument of ratification of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment and had submitted it to the depositary. 
</p>
<p>11. With regard to freedom of the press, no journalists had been imprisoned since the 
political change that had taken place on 24 March 2013, and the transitional Head of State 
had publicly stated that no journalists would be imprisoned and no one would be detained 
for their opinions during his term of office. 
</p>
<p>12. The Government paid particular attention to the rights of refugees and internally 
displaced persons and had ratified several international and regional legal instruments. 
</p>
<p>13. A bill on compensation for victims of serious human rights violations was being 
drafted, following the establishment of a joint commission of inquiry to investigate human 
rights-related crimes, offences and other violations as well as damage to property. 
</p>
<p>14. A bill to simply abolish the death penalty had already been drafted; all that remained 
was to initiate the legislative process for its adoption by the Transitional National Council. 
</p>
<p>15. As to the realization of the right to culture in the Central African Republic, the 
delegation said that significant progress had been made with regard to culture and heritage, 
as a ministry for the arts and culture had been established in 2013. 
</p>
<p>16. Concerning the rights of vulnerable persons and solidarity rights, the Government&#8217;s 
political commitment to the elderly and persons with disabilities had been translated into 
legal instruments and framework documents, and measures taken with support from the 
NGO Handicap International, to enable those persons to participate fully in public life. 
</p>
<p>17. The Government of the Central African Republic had embarked on a series of legal 
reforms to promote and protect the women&#8217;s rights, including a bill on parity, revision of 
the Family Code s to bring it into line with international standards, and involving women in 
the conflict resolution process in accordance with Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). 
Women were still poorly represented in political life. </p>


<p>GE.14-10056 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Government paid particular attention to children, who were the subject of 
various provisions of the Constitutional Charter and the new Criminal Code. Various 
measures had been taken to protect and promote the rights of the child. 
</p>
<p>19. The rights of minorities were recognized, including the rights of the Aka or Bayaka 
Pygmies, the Mbororo Fulani and albinos, and the Government also devoted particular 
attention to those groups. On 30 August 2010, the Central African Republic had ratified the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 
(No. 169). 
</p><p>20. In the emergency programme devised by the transitional Government of national 
unity, priority was given to restoring peace and security and addressing the humanitarian 
emergency, notably by disarming, demobilizing and reintegrating former combatants, 
reforming the security sector and promoting community participation in the consolidation 
of peace. 
</p>
<p>21. The delegation of the Central African Republic highlighted the political, economic 
and social difficulties and constraints the country faced in the promotion and protection of 
human rights, and concluded by calling on the international community to provide the 
Government with technical and financial support for its efforts to improve the security and

</p>
<p>94. The rapidly deteriorating security situation was being resolved, despite the lack of 
financial resources, through the establishment of the International Support Mission 
(MISCA). The meeting of the Security Council held the previous week had been devoted to 
evaluating the redeployment of security structures throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>95. As to impunity, firm measures had been taken and some 50 members of the former 
S&#233;l&#233;ka coalition and a dozen of its &#8220;colonels&#8221; had been arrested; some had been tried and 
sentenced while others were still on trial. 
</p>
<p>96. A bill abolishing the death penalty was being prepared. The Government and Action 
by Christians for the Abolition of Torture (ACAT) were working to abolish the death 
penalty, and it would be removed from the Criminal Code by the end of the transition 
period. 
</p>
<p>97. As for the ratification of various international legal instruments, the Government had 
arranged to draw up a list of all the remaining international legal instruments that the State 
had not yet ratified. The Government planned to proceed with ratification according to its 
priorities and with the support of its technical and financial partners. 
</p>
<p>98. Regarding cooperation with the Human Rights Council, the Government had issued 
a standing invitation to the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the Council&#8217;s twenty-
fourth session. 
</p>
<p>99. A first wave of child soldiers had already been demobilized, with support from the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), and others were being prepared. 
</p><p>100. The Government needed technical and financial assistance so that it could quickly 
emerge from the cycle of violence and resolve the severe human rights problem in the 
country. Several ministers insisted that the security situation had shown a marked 
improvement &#8212; especially in the capital Bangui &#8212; ever since disarmament operations had 
begun, the S&#233;l&#233;ka coalition had been dissolved and the forces had been confined to their 
bases. Similarly, the reorganization of the defence and security forces administration should 
make it possible to resume awareness-raising activities on human rights, including on the 
rights of minorities. 
</p>
<p>101. Regarding the National Human Rights Commission, the procedure had been 
initiated. 
</p>
<p>102. Concerning violence against women, several initiatives were mentioned, including a 
prevention campaign currently being developed by the Ministry of Human Rights and the </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.14-10056 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Social Affairs and a project on prosecutions that was being carried out with the 
Ministry of Justice. Several measures had been taken to implement Security Council 
resolution 1325 (2000), including the adoption in 2005 of a national policy on equality and 
equity and an accompanying action plan, and the adoption in December 2006 of Act No. 
06.032 on protection of women against violence in the Central African Republic. In 
addition, women had been involved in the peace process from the signing of the Libreville 
Agreements until the establishment of the Transitional National Council. 
</p>
<p>103. Lastly, the delegation thanked all the country representatives who had spoken for 
their understanding of the specific situation in the Central African Republic, for their frank 
comments and for their call for international aid to the Central African Republic. 
</p>
