<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report contains my findings as Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences following my official mission to Sweden from 11 to 21 June 2006.  I 
undertook this mission to address the discrepancy between the apparent progress in achieving 
gender equality and the reports of continued violence against women in the country. 
</p>
<p> Gender equality is a highly valued principle in the Swedish society.  Public discourse and 
public policy in this regard is firmly established within an equal opportunity framework, which 
has led to impressive advances towards the achievement of equality between women and men in 
the public sphere, although challenges remain.  For example, while women are overrepresented 
in service sector, part-time and low-paid jobs, they remain underrepresented in senior 
management positions in private business and in some important public institutions such as the 
police and the Armed Forces.  Women also still earn less than their male counterparts in 
comparable positions. 
</p>
<p> While the equal opportunity agenda has paved the way for significant advances in the 
public representation of women, it was not effective in addressing the deeply rooted unequal 
power relations between women and men which underlie the continuation of diverse forms of 
violence against women.  The increased recognition of this contradiction is reflected in the 
1990 Government Bill on Gender Equality, which sees violence against women as an expression 
&#8220;of the prevailing imbalance of power relations between the sexes&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Overall, the penal law framework addressing violence against women is excellent, but 
low prosecution and conviction rates are indicative of the need for further improvements in its 
implementation.  Some deficiencies in protecting women exposed to violence remain and a 
number of municipalities clearly have to raise the standards of their protection policies.<b>  </b>The 
prevention of violence against women remains a challenge that must be dealt with diligently to 
make the highly valued norm of gender equality in the Swedish society an uncompromised 
reality. 
</p>
<p> In view of the remaining challenges, the report calls on the Government to reinforce its 
institutional framework on gender equality, to ensure the protection for all women at risk of 
violence and to ensure that authorities actively investigate, prosecute and punish perpetrators.  
The Government, together with civil society and the media, should also strengthen existing 
efforts to prevent violence against women by addressing its root causes and work to expand the 
knowledge base of women at risk of violence. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, I carried out an official fact-finding mission in 
Sweden from 11 to 21 June 2006.  The mission was motivated by a seeming contradiction:  
despite the apparent marked progress towards gender equality Sweden was reported to retain a 
considerable level of violence against women.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>2. During the course of my mission, which took me to Stockholm, Uppsala, Malm&#246;, Lund 
and Lule&#229;, I held consultations with government officials, members of the Armed Forces, civil 
servants, local authorities, experts, researchers, and civil society representatives.  I also visited 
the Emergency Unit for Rape Victims at S&#246;dersjukhuset Hospital in Stockholm, the National 
Centre for Battered and Raped Women in Uppsala and several shelters for women exposed to 
violence, where victims and staff members shared with me their experiences and valuable 
insights.  I would like to commend the Government and civil society actors for the 
professionalism with which they received the mission and thank them for their excellent 
cooperation and support. 
</p>
<p>3. This report focuses on various facets of violence against women, including 
intimate-partner violence, sexual violence and violence in the context of prostitution.  It  
also discusses the special vulnerabilities of immigrant, refugee, minority and indigenous  
Saami women.  Sweden, in complying with its international commitments related to violence 
against women, has created a very good legal framework with few deficiencies.  There are, 
however, still some discrepancies between the quality of the framework itself and its practical 
implementation.  The report also demonstrates that the Swedish experience was less effective in 
countering the unequal power relations between women and men in the private sphere, thus 
resulting in the normalization of violence.  In my conclusions and recommendations, I hope to 
offer tangible recommendations on how to further Sweden&#8217;s efforts to eradicate violence against 
women and related forms of discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b>II.</b> <b> THE CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.</b> <b> Gender equality:  policy and practice 
</b></p>
<p>4. Since the 1970s, the feminist movement has played an important role in Swedish society 
and politics.  It created a broad social consensus on the principles of gender equality and 
prepared the ground for the current official government policy, which seeks to ensure that 
women and men have equal opportunities to shape society and their own lives.  The government 
policy sets four specific objectives:  (i) an equal distribution of power and influence in 
decision-making; (ii) economic equality and equal access to education; (iii) an equal sharing  
of unpaid care and household work; and (iv) an end to men&#8217;s violence against women.<b>2</b>

</p>
<p>5. A combined strategy of women-focused approaches and gender mainstreaming (the 
incorporation of a gender equality perspective in all policies and programmes of each ministry) 
is the principal model for gender equality work in Sweden.  This dual strategy is complemented 
by efforts to establish gender budgeting practices and sex-disaggregated data.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>6. Gender mainstreaming initiatives are coordinated and monitored by the Minister of 
Gender Equality, who is advised by a Council on Gender Equality Issues, representing various 
stakeholders from the political sphere, civil society and the private sector.  The county 
administrative board (the regional entities supervising and advising the municipalities) also 
employ experts on gender equality.  Furthermore, there is an Equal Opportunities Ombudsman 
and an Equal Opportunities Commission.  These independent government authorities derive their 
mandates from equal opportunity legislation and can therefore only intervene in discrimination 
cases related to employment or education.  
</p>
<p>7. Initially, the women&#8217;s movement and the Swedish Government focused strongly 
on ensuring equal opportunities for women and men in the public sphere.  This equal 
opportunity agenda has led to some very impressive achievements.  Today, Sweden ranks third 
among 80 countries assessed by the Gender Empowerment Measure of the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) <i>Human Development Report 2005</i>.  More than half 
(58 per cent) of all students enrolling in higher education institutions are women.<b>4</b>  In 2005, 
almost four out of five women in Sweden were in the labour force and the economic activity rate 
for women (80 per cent) was only slightly lower than that of men (86 per cent). 
</p>
<p>8. Differences remain, however, with regard to the types of employment women and men 
have.  Women tend to work in professions that are less well paid and they are six times more 
likely than men to work part-time.<b>5</b>  A large part of the women in part-time work are actually 
underemployed, as they lack longer work-hour options.  Albeit small, a genuine gender pay gap 
also continues to exist.  Even if one takes into account differences between men and women 
with regard to age, level of education, working hours, sector and occupational group, a gap of 
about 8 per cent seems to be explainable only by sex.<b>6</b>  The Government is undertaking sustained 
efforts to eradicate the pay gap between the sexes.  The Equal Opportunities Act, for example, 
requires all employers to carry out a survey and analysis of wage disparities between men and 
women to assess whether they result from discrimination. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  The Official Statistics Ordinance requires that all statistics be disaggregated by sex, unless 
</p>
<p>there are specific reasons for not doing so.  In practice, sets of statistical information on a given 
subject always have at least one sex-disaggregated table.  However, in many sets the information 
is still not consistently broken down by sex in all tables and diagrams.  See Statistics Sweden,

</p>
<p>9. A glass ceiling is particularly evident in the private sector as women move up the career 
ladder.  Only about 16 per cent of all senior managers in business are female.  In 2004, a mere 
4 out of 300 companies listed on the Swedish stock exchange had female managing directors.  
The previous Government had considered imposing gender quotas for boards of directors, but 
these plans are apparently no longer pursued by the current Government.  
</p>
<p>10. Equal representation is much more pronounced in the public sector, particularly in 
elected office.  Almost half of all Swedish parliamentarians (47 per cent) and Cabinet-level 
ministers (9 out of 22) are women.  Women remain grossly underrepresented though in some 
traditionally male-dominated public institutions such as the National Police or the Swedish 
Armed Forces.  Only 20 per cent of all police officers and 4.4 per cent of all military officers  
are women.  Both security institutions are trying to improve the gender imbalance - for example 
by actively promoting networks and mentoring relationships for female officers. 
</p>
<p>11. During the 1970s and early 1980s, many in the Swedish feminist movement hoped that 
equality between men and women could be reached by removing the obstacles that prevented 
women from accessing educational opportunities, participating in the labour market, and 
assuming political functions.  It was assumed that women would transform existing gender 
power relations once they had the necessary political clout and economic independence.  Over 
the years, it became increasingly clear that the equal opportunity agenda is a necessary, but not a 
sufficient element of a successful gender equality strategy, since a gender power hierarchy is 
reproduced in the private sphere.  This turned attention to critically examining the construction 
and perpetuation of deeply rooted patriarchal gender roles and their continued impact on gender 
relations.  Violence against women, which remained a significant problem despite women&#8217;s 
visible advancements, moved to the centre stage of the gender agenda.  The dominant 
explanations of gender-based violence, which had emphasized the psychological abnormality, 
violent upbringing or alcoholism of the perpetrators, came under scrutiny.  The critics 
highlighted how violence against women was used to uphold and perpetuate unequal gender 
power relations.  
</p>
<p>12. Gradually, these insights have also influenced the political agenda.  The 1990 
Government Bill on Gender Equality recognized violence as an expression &#8220;of the prevailing 
imbalance of power relations between the sexes&#8221;.<b>7</b>  Three years later, the Government 
established a Commission on Violence against Women, charged with the task of scrutinizing 
issues related to violence against women from a feminist perspective and to propose measures to 
counteract such violence.  The main report of the Commission, published in 1995,<b> </b>reflected a 
change in Swedish political thinking and emphasized that violence against women must be 
viewed from a perspective of gendered power.  The Government formally adopted this view in 
the 1998 Law on Violence against Women.

</p>
<p>13. In recent years, activists and policy initiatives that address remaining gender inequalities 
have faced some backlash.  The feminist movement in particular has been openly attacked by 
some media and civil society actors.  In May 2005, for instance, the Swedish National Television 
broadcast the documentary &#8220;Battle of the sexes&#8221; (&#8220;<i>K&#246;nskriget</i>&#8221;), which depicted the women&#8217;s 
shelter movement as extremist and hostile towards men as a group.  The Swedish Broadcasting 
Commission, an official media watchdog, eventually published a formal report that criticized 
some of the programme&#8217;s segments as misleading and inaccurate.  Some circles have also tried 
to reframe the issue of gender inequality as an integration problem - a problem reimported into 
equal Sweden through immigration from developing countries. 
</p>
<p><b>B.</b> <b> Changing demographics:  &#8220;old&#8221; and &#8220;new&#8221; Swedes 
</b></p>
<p>14. The composition of Sweden&#8217;s population has significantly diversified since the Second 
World War.  Today, one in five persons living in Sweden is either an immigrant or has at least 
one foreign-born parent.  Immediately after the war and during the economic boom years of 
the 1960s and 1970s, Sweden experienced an influx of migrant workers from other Nordic 
countries and Southern Europe, whose integration into mainstream society was largely 
unproblematic.  Since the 1980s, immigration trends have changed.  Newcomers are more  
likely to be non-European and/or non-Christian with many coming as asylum-seekers.  
According to the Swedish Migration Board, between 1984 and 2005, Sweden received almost 
500,000 asylum-seekers.  Countries such as Bosnia, Iraq, the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
Afghanistan have emerged as major countries of origin for newcomers. 
</p><p>15. Today, family reunification is the main reason for immigration flows into the country.  
The provisions in Swedish immigration law on family reunification have attracted much public 
debate in recent years.  Critics argue that they are used to bring new immigrants into the country 
through arranged marriages between Swedish nationals or permanent residents with foreign roots 
and individuals in their country of origin, which in many instances may be forced marriages.  
Another form of arranged, transnational marriage is also on the rise:  matchmaking agencies 
broker marriages between Swedish men and women from poor countries in Eastern Europe, 
Asia, Africa and Latin America.  The phenomenon, which some have chosen to label &#8220;mail order 
brides&#8221;, exists throughout Sweden, but reliable estimates of its size are not obtainable.  
</p>
<p>16. The religious and ethnic diversification of immigration constitutes an ongoing challenge 
for Swedish society.  While few &#8220;old Swedes&#8221; perceive the newcomers as an outright threat or 
hold openly racist attitudes, a large majority expresses support for diversity, but at the same time 
often expects the &#8220;new Swedes&#8221; to quickly adopt the values of Sweden&#8217;s consensus society.  
Subtle, unstated prejudices have emerged towards ethnic and religious minorities that are not 
prepared to readily assimilate, rather than only integrate. 
</p>
<p>17. These prejudices translate into tangible discrimination on the labour market and other 
key areas.  Non-European immigrants have considerably higher unemployment rates and earn 
less than native Swedes.  Numerous studies demonstrate that the problems in the labour market 
do not result only from language or educational deficits.  One extensive study from 2003, for 
instance, concluded that men both of whose parents were born in a non-European country </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.3 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>earn 17 per cent less than native Swedes with a comparable education, marital status and choice 
of residential location and that they have an 11 per cent higher probability of being unemployed.<b>8</b>  
The respective figures for women with foreign parents were 10 and 13 per cent. 
</p>
<p>18. On the basis of their concrete experiences of discrimination, many persons belonging to 
religious or ethnic minorities feel excluded from Swedish society and therefore reject ethical 
norms that are very often presented to them as &#8220;Swedish virtues&#8221;, which in fact may constitute 
universal human rights values.  This becomes particularly obvious with respect to attitudes 
towards gender equality.  In an effort to preserve their identity, second-generation immigrants 
from marginalized backgrounds, especially young men and boys, adopt very intransigent views 
on what constitutes appropriate behaviour for women.  In some cases, women are viewed as 
&#8220;lacking virtue&#8221; for merely engaging with native Swedish culture.  Interlocutors also drew my 
attention to another gender dimension of immigration:  male immigrants from non-Western 
countries experience a severe status loss with migration whereas the process opens new options 
for women.  This becomes a source of tension and often results in heightened control over 
women.  
</p>
<p><b>III.</b>  <b>MANIFESTATIONS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN SWEDEN 
</b></p>
<p>19. Significant levels of violence against women persist in Sweden despite a concerted effort 
on the part of the Government and society at large to eliminate it.  Ending what is termed &#8220;men&#8217;s 
violence against women&#8221;<b>9</b> in Sweden is a priority objective of the Government&#8217;s gender equality 
strategy.  
</p>
<p>20. Official crime statistics can indicate trends over time, but they never reveal the actual 
prevalence of violence against women since they only reflect reported crime.  Therefore, it is 
commendable that the Swedish Government commissioned a comprehensive prevalence survey 
on violence against women.  This National Survey, published in 2001,<b>10</b> revealed a shockingly 
high prevalence of violence against women.  Almost half of all responding women (46 per cent) 
had experienced physical and/or sexual violence committed by a man since their fifteenth 
birthday.  One in every eight women (12 per cent) had been subjected to physical or sexual 
violence, including threatening behaviour, in the last year prior to answering the survey 
questionnaire.

</b>  Official government documents use the term &#8220;men&#8217;s violence against women&#8221; to make the

reservations about the term, fearing that it may stigmatize men as a group and that it does not 
take into account the participation of individual women in acts of patriarchal violence.

</p>
<p><b>A.</b> <b> Intimate-partner violence 
</b></p>
<p>21. Women in Sweden are at the greatest risk of violence when they are in their own home, 
especially if their husbands or other intimate partners are present.  According to the National 
Survey on Violence against Women, more than one third (35 per cent) of all women who were 
married to or had cohabited with a man at least once in their life had been subjected to violence 
by a partner; 11 per cent reported to have suffered violence at the hands of their present husband 
or cohabitant partner.  Physical violence was the most common form of violence reported.  
Official statistics on reported crime paint a similar picture:  the vast majority of assaults on 
women take place indoors and are perpetrated by a person with whom the victim is acquainted. 
</p>
<p>22. There is still a widespread perception in Sweden that &#8220;normal&#8221; Swedish men do not 
abuse their partners.  Instead, the perpetrators are assumed to be somehow &#8220;deviant&#8221; - 
unemployed men without education, men who are alcoholics or have a criminal history, men of a 
non-Western cultural background, etc.  
</p>
<p>23. While men of low social status and men with high levels of previous criminal 
involvement indeed appear to be relatively overrepresented among perpetrators of 
intimate-partner violence,<b>11</b> they only constitute a small segment of the population.  In absolute 
numbers, the vast majority of the perpetrators of intimate-partner violence are &#8220;ordinary&#8221; 
Swedish men.  The National Survey on Violence against Women, for instance, demonstrated that 
the majority of women who were subjected to violence by their husbands or cohabitant partner 
lived with Swedish-born men who did not have an alcohol problem.  Two thirds of these women 
reported that their partner had employment.  Almost a quarter of the abusive husbands or 
cohabitant partners had even completed a university education.  
</p>
<p>24. Likewise, there are no typical victims.  A large number of victims can be found among 
well-educated women with a career and a high income.  One study from 2002, conducted by the 
National Council for Crime Prevention, calculated that there must be at least 25,000 gainfully 
employed women who had suffered violence at the hands of their current or former partner in the 
year prior to the study.<b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>25. Contrary to commonly held expectations, women&#8217;s public-sphere empowerment has not 
led to the eradication of intimate-partner violence in Sweden.  A closer look at the dynamics of 
the phenomenon reveals why.  Studies show that the perpetrators very often do not commit 
violence against their partners in a sudden spurt of rage.  Instead, the use of physical violence, 
systematic emotional abuse, isolation strategies and other forms of controlling behaviour are 
combined in a strategy to gradually undermine the victim&#8217;s self-confidence, take away her 
autonomy and prove the perpetrator&#8217;s masculine superiority.  Starting at a relatively minor level, 
the violence and controlling behaviour incrementally increases in intensity and the limits of what 
constitutes acceptable behaviour in the eyes of both perpetrator and victim are gradually shifted.

</p>
<p>At the end of a long normalization process, the victim often perceives the violence as the 
partner&#8217;s justified reaction to her personal deficits.  She becomes mentally unable to leave her 
tormentor despite her educational and economic autonomy.  The fear of public shame - being 
regarded as a tragic failure in a country of supposed gender equality - is said to pose an 
additional obstacle that prevents especially well-educated and economically successful Swedish 
women from reporting intimate-partner violence.  
</p>
<p>26. Intimate-partner violence has disastrous long-term consequences that go far beyond the 
physical harm done to the women.  The victims often develop depression or psychosomatic 
problems, including sleeping or eating disorders.  The National Survey on Violence against 
Women also indicated that exposure to intimate-partner violence increases suicide risk.  Another 
Swedish survey showed that more than two thirds (70 per cent) of all female mental patients who 
had suffered violence in their lifetime linked their psychiatric problems to the violence.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>27. The victim&#8217;s children very often suffer severe negative consequences too - even before 
they are born.  A study undertaken at the Uppsala Centre for Raped and Battered Women 
indicated that about 1.3 per cent of all women had been abused during or shortly after 
pregnancy.<b>14</b>  Such antenatal abuse can cause miscarriages, premature labour or direct injuries 
to the foetus.  Studies have also shown that women who had been subjected to violence during 
their pregnancy were more likely than non-abused women to give birth to a child with low 
birthweight.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>28. Children are likely to be aware of and witness violence committed against their mothers.  
UNICEF estimates that 46,000 children in Sweden are exposed to intimate-partner violence 
committed against their mother.<b>16</b>  Exposure to violence within an important and intimate 
environment is a traumatic experience for children, who feel helpless, unable to control the 
situation and fear that a loved one might be killed.  According to professionals, the child may 
suffer a post-traumatic stress disorder that can seriously affect the child&#8217;s cognitive and 
emotional development.  Children who grow up in a violent environment are more likely to 
become victims of child abuse themselves and are also more likely to continue the cycle of 
domestic violence (as perpetrators or victims) when they grew up.<b>17</b>

<p><b>B.</b> <b> Rape and sexual coercion 
</b></p>
<p>29. Women in Sweden continue to face a substantial risk of sexual violence.  The National 
Survey on Violence against Women indicates that more than a third (34 per cent) of all Swedish 
women have experienced sexual violence at least once since their fifteenth birthday; 7 per cent 
experienced such violence in the year prior to the survey.  The most likely perpetrators are 
men with whom the victims have an intimate relationship.  However, the perpetrators may also 
be colleagues, friends, neighbours, casual acquaintances or complete strangers.  A shocking 
5 per cent of all women who took part in the National Survey reported to have been forced into 
some form of sexual activity by a man with whom they did not have a prior sexual relationship. 
</p>
<p>30. Sexual violence has steadily risen over the last two decades despite all legislative 
attempts to strengthen women&#8217;s protection.  Between 1994 and 2004 alone, reported cases 
of sexual offences increased by 35 per cent; reported rapes and attempted rapes increased 
by 45 per cent.<b>18</b>  In 2005, a new peak of almost 3,800 reported cases of completed or attempted 
rape was reached.<b>19</b>  Experts and law enforcement officials informed me that this trend had 
continued in 2006. 
</p>
<p>31. Some have argued that the growth of sexual violence only reflects the general rise in 
violent crime that Sweden has experienced over the last decade.  Official crime statistics 
demonstrate, however, that the increase in reported sexual offences has outpaced that of offences 
against life and health.  Most experts I spoke with indicated that two developments were 
underlying the rise in reports of rape.  Firstly, sexual violence may have become more visible. 
Government and civil society initiatives to raise awareness about sexual violence and 
improvements of the legal frameworks seem to have encouraged more women to come forward 
and report the crime.  Secondly, and more worryingly, there also seems to be a genuine increase 
in the prevalence of sexual violence.<b>20</b>  Moreover, a growing number of sexual offenders are 
boys or very young men.  In 2005 alone, there were 187 cases of sexual crimes in which the 
suspect identified by the police was younger than 15 years old; 190 males suspected of sexual 
crimes were aged between 15 and 17 years. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Violence against women of immigrant, asylum-seeker or refugee background 
</b></p>
<p>32. Swedish crime statistics are generally not broken down by the nationality or ethnicity of 
the perpetrators or victims.  However, some studies suggest that women in Sweden with an 
immigrant, asylum-seeker or refugee background face a higher risk of violence than native

</b>  All statistics on reported crimes, prosecutions, convictions and restraining orders are based on 
</p>
<p>Swedish National Council on Crime Prevention figures (available at www.bra.se). 
<b>19
</b></p>
<p>  This constitutes a rise of 44 per cent compared with 2004.  Part of this drastic increase, 
however, has resulted from a legal reclassification of certain acts of sexual coercion and sexual 
exploitation as rape.

the Police:  English Summary (2005). </p>

</p>
<p>Swedish women.<b>21</b>  Special vulnerabilities within this group of women result to some extent 
from their residence status.  Immigrant or asylum-seeking women without a valid residence 
permit are often naturally reluctant to approach State authorities for protection and remain 
trapped in violent relationships.  Women whose legal residence status in Sweden depends on 
their relationship with a Swedish national or permanent resident face similar problems. 
</p>
<p>33. A lack of familiarity with the Swedish language, institutions and law, sometimes coupled 
with a general distrust towards State authorities, may pose additional obstacles for non-native 
women.  Women coming to Sweden on the basis of arranged marriages are particularly affected 
by these problems.  Swedish privacy protection legislation prohibits the Swedish Migration 
Board, which processes entry visas, to match and link their computer files with local authorities.  
Therefore, the local authorities often do not know about foreign women moving into their 
community and cannot provide them with information on available language courses, legal 
literacy programmes or other integration support measures.  Women who have no other 
connection to Sweden than their arranged husband and his family are therefore often isolated and 
vulnerable to entrapment in violent relationships. 
</p>
<p>34. While these types of vulnerabilities are generally not disputed and to some extent are 
also addressed by special legal provisions (see below), it is hotly debated whether cultural 
specificities contribute to the vulnerability of women with a foreign background.  In this context, 
the phenomenon of &#8220;honour-related violence&#8221; has commanded much public attention, especially 
after the murder of Fadime &#350;ahindal in January 2002.<b>22</b>  The term - widely used by Swedish 
policymakers, researchers and practitioners without being clearly defined (which is a problem) - 
is generally employed to describe cases in which women or girls are subjected to, or threatened 
with, violence because they are seen as defying their family&#8217;s expectations of &#8220;honourable&#8221; 
social or sexual behaviour.  Some also use the term to refer to cases concerning homosexual or 
bisexual boys and men suffering violence at the hands of homophobic family members.  The 
Swedish National Police Board calculates that about 400 cases of honour-related violence come 
to the attention of the authorities every year. 
</p>
<p>35. Parts of the feminist movement in Sweden have cautioned about treating honour-related 
violence in isolation from other forms of violence against women, which in all its manifestations 
serves to uphold male superiority and subordinate women.  Other feminists, including many 
women who are themselves from immigrant or refugee backgrounds, argue that women with an 
immigrant or refugee background have to live up to gender-specific expectations that are far 
more extensive than those directed towards native Swedish women; therefore, women&#8217;s 
oppression should not be generalized. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>relationships:  An Overview (2002). 
<b>22
</b></p>
<p>  Fadime, who grew up in a Kurdish family of Turkish origin, refused to enter into a marriage 
arranged by her family and had a Swedish boyfriend.  She publicly spoke out against patriarchal 
oppression in immigrant families and also addressed the Parliament in this context.  In 
January 2002 her father shot and killed her in the family&#8217;s home in Uppsala.  He claimed to  
have committed the crime to restore the family&#8217;s honour. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/34/Add.3 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>36. From a pragmatic perspective, the decisive question is not why, but how honour-related 
violence is committed, because the means and methods of honour-related violence pose specific 
challenges to law enforcement authorities, social workers and other practitioners.  Whereas 
perpetrators of many other forms of gender-based violence prevalent in Sweden tend to act alone 
to avoid social opprobrium, honour-related violence, in its most distinct form, distinguishes itself 
by the involvement of several family members (often condoned by other community members) 
who collude to enforce social norms shared by the group.  This collective element makes it 
extremely difficult to separate the victim from actual or potential perpetrators, unless she is 
willing to break off all relations with her family and begin a new life outside her social frame of 
reference. 
</p>
<p>37. Honour-related violence cases in immigrant communities are also gaining a transnational 
dimension.  The murder of 19-year-old Pela Atroshi, which was related to me personally by her 
younger sister Breen, illustrates the specificities.  Pela and her family moved in 1995 from 
northern Iraq to Sweden.  Unwilling to accept the extremely oppressive rule that her father 
exerted on her and her sisters, Pela temporarily left the family home.  When rumours emerged 
that she had engaged in extramarital sex with a boyfriend, a family council of male relatives 
living in Sweden and in Australia decided that Pela had to die to cleanse the family honour.  
Under a pretext, Pela and her sister Breen were lured to Iraq in 1999, where one of her uncles 
murdered Pela before the eyes of her younger sister.  Breen was only able to return unharmed to 
Sweden due to high-level political manoeuvring and the dedicated work of a special unit in the 
Swedish National Criminal Investigation Department that has unfortunately since been 
disbanded.  She testified against the perpetrators and the Stockholm City Court was able to 
sentence two of her uncles living in Sweden for murder since the crime had been planned in 
Sweden.  The grandfather and another uncle, both in Australia, as well as the father, who 
remained in Iraq, escaped prosecution.  Breen lives today under a protected identity at an 
undisclosed location as threats to her life continue. 
</p>
<p>38. Some Swedish researchers also classify female genital mutilation as a form of 
honour-related violence since it purports to protect the victim&#8217;s honour, but actually serves to 
control her sexuality in a violent and gender-discriminatory manner.  The Government&#8217;s Action 
Plan on Female Genital Mutilation considers that immigrant or refugee girls from countries 
where the practice is highly prevalent could be at risk.  There are no reliable figures though on 
how many female genital mutilations are actually carried out in or organized from Sweden. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Violence against Saami women 
</b></p>
<p>39. The very north of Sweden is also home to about 20,000 Saami (Sami), an indigenous 
people that can also be found in northern Finland, Norway and north-western Russia.  No survey 
has ever been conducted on violence against Saami women in Sweden.  Anecdotal accounts  
I received from Saami women suggest that they may face significant levels of violence within 
their communities. 
</p>
<p>40. Saami culture has very different manifestations and it develops in a dynamic fashion.  
This being said, many Saami communities retain strong patriarchal structures and in some 
communities divorce is reportedly still not a socially accepted option to escape a violent  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.3 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>relationship.  Saami women&#8217;s groups also reported that Saami women exposed to violence are 
often also hesitant to obtain help from mainstream Swedish institutions and authorities, which 
they consider alien to their culture and language. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Violence in the context of prostitution 
</b></p>
<p>41. In Sweden, including in official government documents, it is widely considered that 
prostitution constitutes in and of itself a form of male violence against women, regardless of the 
consent of the women involved.<b>23</b>  Consequently, the Swedish Parliament has enacted the Law 
Prohibiting the Purchase of Sexual Services, which entered into force on 1 January 1999.  The 
legislation regards women in prostitution as victims of male violence and therefore they do not 
face criminal sanctions under Swedish Law.  However, anyone who purchases sexual relations 
for himself or a third person in exchange for payment is liable to a fine or imprisonment for up to 
six months.<b>24</b>  The policy enjoys widespread public support in Sweden and the Government has 
dedicated considerable resources to enforce it.  A special prostitution surveillance unit targets 
buyers of sexual services from prostitutes.  Between 1999 and February 2006, more than 
1,300 men were reported for buying sex.  Many of the reported men pleaded guilty to avoid a 
lengthy trial.  In other cases evidence incidentally collected in anti-trafficking investigations, 
which employed wiretap and other intensive surveillance techniques, was used to prove the 
transaction between the sex buyer and the woman. 
</p>
<p>42. The Government considers that the new legislation has considerably decreased the 
number of both women in prostitution and male sex buyers in Sweden.  While most observers 
widely concur that street prostitution has decreased, some who are sceptical about the law have 
asserted that prostitution has merely shifted from the streets to less visible indoor locations or to 
escort services that make use of the Internet and mobile phones to arrange contacts between 
women and sex buyers.  It remains unclear whether the Law has increased or decreased the 
buying of sex by Swedish men abroad.  Government officials and other supporters of the Law 
expressed the hope that in the long run it would transform attitudes towards the buying of sex 
and the construction of male sexuality in general. 
</p>
<p>43. At the time of my visit, a comprehensive review of Sweden&#8217;s prostitution policy, 
prepared by independent researchers, had yet to be undertaken.  It is therefore not entirely certain 
what effect the policy has had on the types of violence often connected to prostitution.  The

<p><b>23
</b>  See Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communications, Prostitution and Trafficking in 
</p>
<p>Human Beings:  Fact Sheet, April 2005:  &#8220;In Sweden, prostitution is regarded as an aspect of 
male violence against women and children &#8230;  In the legislation on gross violation of a woman&#8217;s 
integrity (<i>Kvinnofridslagstiftningen</i>), the Swedish Government and Riksdag (the Parliament) 
defined prostitution as a form of male violence against women and children.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> In a response to a draft version of this report, the Swedish Government clarified that 
Swedish penal legislation does not regard women in prostitution to be victims of male violence. 
<b>24
</b></p>
<p>  The production of commercial pornography remains legal.  Interlocutors explained that this 
seeming contradiction is due to the Swedish Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression, which 
also protects pornography involving consenting adults. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/34/Add.3 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>National Criminal Investigation Department and the National Rapporteur on Trafficking in 
Human Beings have both come to the conclusion that the trafficking of women from abroad has 
become less profitable for the traffickers, since it is more difficult to establish contact between 
potential buyers and foreign victims.  Human trafficking flows to Sweden have therefore 
reportedly decreased. 
</p>
<p>44. However, local women who remain in street prostitution, especially women addicted to 
heroin and other hard drugs, report increased vulnerability to violence and infection with 
sexually transmitted diseases.  Now often operating alone to avoid detection by the police, 
women in prostitution can no longer offer each other information on and protection against the 
so-called &#8220;problem buyers&#8221;.  Since the overall number of men buying sex in the streets has 
diminished, drug-addicted women are also under much more pressure to accept those clients, 
who are known to be violent or demand high-risk sexual practices, so that they can finance the 
immense costs (up to SKr 2,000 per day) of their daily drug consumption. 
</p>
<p>45. In the first years of its abolitionist prostitution policy, the Swedish Government largely 
neglected to address the situation of drug-addicted women in prostitution.  This problem has 
somewhat improved in recent years.  There are now institutions in the big cities, such as the 
NAVET centre in Malm&#246;, which provide support and advice to women in prostitution.  They 
also offer access to drug treatment programmes.  However, waiting periods are said to be far too 
long. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. STATE AND CIVIL SOCIETY INITIATIVES WITH  
RESPECT TO VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 
</b></p>
<p>46. States have an international obligation to exercise due diligence to prevent violence 
against women, prosecute and punish the perpetrators, compensate the victims and protect 
women from all forms of violence.  Sweden&#8217;s efforts to comply with these obligations are quite 
advanced.  Nevertheless, in some areas significant improvements are still possible and necessary.  
As I emphasized in my thematic report addressing the due diligence standard (E/CN.4/2006/61), 
which I have presented to the Human Rights Council, States have done relatively little with 
respect to their obligation to prevent violence against women by adopting measures to transform 
patriarchal gender roles and hierarchies.  This also applies to Sweden where significant gains 
have been achieved towards gender equality in the public sphere.  The most effective and model 
measures so far undertaken by the Swedish Government are in the areas of protection and 
prosecution.  While interventions to protect and punish may have transformative impact, 
innovative strategies of prevention remain a challenge that need to be met to make the highly 
valued norm of gender equality an uncompromised reality. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Prosecution and punishment of perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>47. In 1998 and 2005, Swedish Penal Law saw major reforms to enhance the protection of 
women against violence.  A number of innovative norms that must be regarded as good practices 
have been enacted into law.  In 1998, for instance, the offence of &#8220;gross violation of integrity&#8221; 
was introduced into the Penal Code.  A person who commits crimes such as assault or unlawful 
coercion against another person with whom he has or has had a close relationship is liable to 
imprisonment for between six months and six years, if the acts form part of a repeated violation 
of the victim&#8217;s integrity and are suited to severely damage the victim&#8217;s self-confidence.  If the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.3 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>acts were committed by a man against his present/former wife or co-habitant partner, the man is 
guilty of a gross violation of a woman&#8217;s integrity and liable to the same punishment.  These 
criminal provisions encapsulate the peculiar nature of protracted intimate-partner violence 
situations and serve to ensure that the criminal sanction fits the severity of the crime. 
</p>
<p>48. The number of reported cases of gross violations of integrity/women&#8217;s integrity has 
steadily increased:  2,690 cases in 2005 (538 reported offences concerned gross violations of 
integrity and 2,152 were for gross violations of a woman&#8217;s integrity).  In 2005 the overall 
clearance rate for gross violations of integrity/woman&#8217;s integrity was only 50 per cent, of which 
70 per cent were prosecuted.  Observers point out that some police stations have still not adopted 
the proactive policing practices and meticulous recording routines that are necessary to prove 
systematic patterns of violence occurring over a long period of time and &#8220;build&#8221; cases of gross 
violation of a woman&#8217;s integrity.  For example, police officers often fail to videotape a victim&#8217;s 
testimony immediately after an assault, even though it is well known that many victims refuse to 
eventually testify against their partners in court because they either fear their tormentor or 
develop a false sense of loyalty to him (the so-called battered person syndrome). 
</p>
<p>49. With respect to sexual violence, there are similar discrepancies between the high quality 
of the existing penal law framework and its actual implementation.  The penal law provision on 
rape extends to non-consensual penetrative intercourse and also to other acts that are comparable 
to such intercourse, bearing in mind the nature of the violation and the general circumstances.  
Moreover, since 2005 a person can also be convicted of rape if he inappropriately exploits the 
fact that the victim is in a helpless state due to, for example, unconsciousness, intoxication, drug 
influence or mental disturbance.  The latter amendment facilitates the prosecution of rapes using 
so-called date-rape drugs, because the prosecution no longer has to prove that the perpetrator 
himself administered the drug to render his victim helpless. 
</p>
<p>50. In practice, however, the majority of reported cases still result in impunity for the 
perpetrators.  In 2005, the alleged perpetrators of only 835 cases of rape or aggravated rape 
were prosecuted, a mere 32 per cent of all cases reported in 2004.  The approximate conviction 
rate for 2005 (also based on cases reported in 2004) was even lower, at only 8 per cent. 
</p>
<p>51. Physical evidence of sexual violence such as vaginal lacerations or DNA traces often 
disappears within hours.  Many cases therefore do not even reach the prosecution stage due to a 
lack of evidence, a situation that could have been avoided if the police or medical personnel who 
had first contact with the victim had been better trained in gathering and recording evidence of 
sexual violence.  In response to this problem, some Swedish cities have taken the positive step of 
creating emergency units for rape victims that are specialized in gathering and documenting 
evidence while providing immediate care to the traumatized victim. 
</p>
<p>52. Modules on gender equality and gender sensitivity form an important part of mandatory 
training for Swedish judges, prosecutors and police officers.  These training programmes have 
helped to change the gender-based perspectives, norms and biases that often have an impact on 
the investigation, prosecution and adjudication of gender-related crimes.  Nevertheless, some 
problems persist.  Women&#8217;s groups reported that some justice sector officials still display a 
gender bias in contested sexual violence cases.  I was informed, for example, about a 2004 
decision of the Sollentuna District Court concerning a 22-year-old man who had had a sexual 
relationship of three months&#8217; duration with a 13-year-old girl.  The man met the girl through a </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/34/Add.3 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>dating site for young teenagers and lied to her about his own age.  The Court held that the man 
could not have known that the girl was younger than the legal age of consent and found him not 
guilty of a sexual offence. 
</p>
<p>53. Sweden has taken special measures to prosecute and punish violence specifically 
affecting women with a foreign background.  As early as 1982, it passed the Act on the 
Prohibition of the Circumcision of Women and further strengthened it in 1999.  The legislation 
prohibits, regardless of the consent of the victim or her parents, all operations on the external 
female genital organs, which are designed to mutilate or produce other permanent changes in 
them.  The crime, which is punishable by a minimum of two years&#8217; imprisonment, has been 
made exempt from the principle of dual criminality.  A person with a connection to Sweden can 
be prosecuted in Sweden for involvement in acts of female genital mutilation committed in 
another country, even if that country does not prohibit female genital mutilation.<b>25</b>  In June 1999, 
the Gothenburg District Court convicted a Swedish national of Somali origin for having 
authorized and participated in the female genital mutilation of his 14-year-old daughter, even 
though the acts had taken place in Somalia.  The man was sentenced to four years of 
imprisonment.  The decision was upheld on appeal. 
</p>
<p>54. In 2004, Sweden introduced changes to enhance the protection of women and girls 
against forced and early marriages conducted in Sweden and abroad.  The legal age of marriage 
is 18 years and exceptions are only possible with a special permit issued only under very narrow 
circumstances.  Child marriages and forced marriages that have been concluded abroad are not 
valid in Sweden.  There is no legislation specifically criminalizing early or forced marriages, but 
Penal Code provisions on unlawful coercion, illegal threats, sexual crimes and trafficking can be 
applied.  The penal legislation is currently under review. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Protection of women at risk of violence 
</b></p>
<p>55. Women at risk of violence have recourse to various protective instruments and 
institutions in Sweden.  The Act on Restraining Orders allows a woman at risk to obtain a court 
order prohibiting a potential perpetrator of violence, persecution or serious harassment to 
approach or otherwise contact her.  Violations can be sanctioned with fines or imprisonment of 
up to one year.  If special circumstances indicate a clear risk that the person served with the 
restraining order will commit a crime against the life, health, freedom or integrity of his 
cohabiting partner, the potential perpetrator can be ordered to temporarily leave and stay away 
from the couple&#8217;s joint domicile.  This provision enhances women&#8217;s protection and is an 
expression of the basic principle of justice according to which negative consequences of violence 
ought to be borne by the perpetrator and not his victim. 
</p>
<p>56. Restraining orders are meant to prevent future crimes that are anticipated on the basis  
of a forward-looking risk assessment.  In practice, however, the authorities very often issue 
restraining orders only in reaction to crimes already committed, especially in cases involving 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>25
</b>  The double criminality requirement has also been waived for sexual offences committed 
</p>
<p>abroad against a minor younger than 18 years, if the perpetrator has a connection to Sweden. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.3 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>intimate-partner violence.<b>26</b>  The National Police Board has acknowledged the problem and 
in 2005 published new guidelines on risk and threat assessment relating to domestic violence and 
restraining orders. 
</p>
<p>57. There are also continued problems with the enforcement of restraining orders.  It is 
estimated that at least one in three restraining orders are breached and repeat breaches are not 
uncommon.<b>27</b>  Unfortunately, the continuous and active follow-up work, which is necessary to 
ensure that restraining orders are respected, often is put back behind other policing priorities.  
Police often do not have the personnel resources to document all detected breaches and initiate 
sanctions proceedings.  Against this backdrop, the question has been considered in Sweden 
whether to employ electronic devices to monitor the movement of persons subject to a 
restraining order.  However, the practical feasibility and effectiveness of using such intrusive 
measures on a large scale seems to be questionable.<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>58. Restraining orders, even if diligently issued and properly enforced, are only one part of a 
comprehensive protection strategy.  Victims must also have access to safe and adequate shelter, 
if they cannot (or do not want to) remain in their home.  According to the Social Services Act, 
the municipal social welfare services &#8220;should&#8221; (not &#8220;shall&#8221;) strive to ensure that victims of  
crime are given help and support and specifically take into account that women victims of 
intimate-partner violence need help and support.  However, only a minority of Sweden&#8217;s 
municipalities operate a shelter that can provide emergency support to women exposed to 
violence.  Most municipalities rely on a national network of about 150 non-governmental 
women&#8217;s shelters.  Apart from often being the only option available, non-governmental women&#8217;s 
shelters are frequently also the preferred option of women exposed to violence since they offer 
anonymous support and the victims do not have to decide immediately whether to get the State 
authorities involved. 
</p>
<p>59. Some of the non-governmental shelters employ paid staff.  Most rely on dedicated 
volunteers.  Many shelters have to operate under severe budget constraints, because a large 
number of municipalities fail to fund the non-governmental institutions they use in order to fulfil 
their own legal responsibilities.  A 2005 survey compiled by Amnesty International found that 
more than a third of Sweden&#8217;s municipalities give no or only symbolic funding to women&#8217;s 
shelters.<b>29</b>  The same survey also showed that many municipalities had not established 
coordinated inter-agency approach to violence against women based on meaningful and 
periodically reviewed local action plans.  Many municipalities also failed to provide adequate 
information material on available assistance and protection resources.

</p>
<p>60. In 2006, a government-commissioned inquiry into the shelter situation came to similar 
conclusions, finding that support to women exposed to violence does not seem to be a priority to 
many municipalities.  The Inquiry Panel recommended that women exposed to violence and their 
children should be legally entitled to receive adequate support (including access to shelter).  It 
also advised that municipalities should assess each case in accordance with national guidelines 
and that a fatality review be carried out whenever a woman dies from violence, so as to identify 
remaining deficiencies in the public system. 
</p>
<p>61. At the time I finalized my report, it was not clear whether and how the Inquiry Panel&#8217;s 
recommendations would be implemented.  Hopefully, the Government will recognize the 
essential role of non-governmental shelters in the protection framework and ensure that their 
core activities are funded.  In 2006, the Government already took an ad hoc step in the right 
direction by earmarking SKr 81.5 million to directly support women&#8217;s shelters. 
</p>
<p>62. Reforms in the institutional protection framework also have to address the situation of 
women with special needs.  In recent years, the shelter movement has created specialized 
institutions for young women and teenage girls exposed to violence.  Other groups with special 
needs are still underserved.  For example, women with severe alcohol or drug problems are 
usually not given access to existing shelters if they face violence.  Unless they agree to enter an 
addiction rehabilitation programme (and actually find a place), they face a protection gap.  
Therefore, I was pleased to learn that the Swedish Association of Women&#8217;s Shelters (SKR) has 
established an open house in G&#246;teborg, where these women can find safe shelter without being 
required to enter a rehabilitation programme. 
</p>
<p>63. Additional progress also has to be made with regard to the particular protection needs of 
women facing honour-related violence, who often encounter particular security risks because of 
the collective nature of the threat against them.  The county administrative boards estimate that 
sheltered housing facilities with enhanced security arrangements are needed for 150-300 women 
facing honour-related violence.<b>30</b>  So far, the Government has created just over 100 places.  
Non-governmental initiatives such as the Somayah Women&#8217;s Shelter, which I visited, or the 
Terrafem Network, have filled the gap. 
</p>
<p>64. The authorities often resort to witness protection practices normally used in cases 
involving organized criminal syndicates to provide long-term protection for young women and 
girls at risk of honour-related violence.  Some victims are given housing in undisclosed locations 
or even receive completely new identities.  Yet, a comprehensive long-term strategy is still 
lacking to address the specific needs of young women and girls who are suddenly deprived of 
their family support network.  Women at risk of honour-related violence often need hands-on 
guidance and support on how to start a new life.  Furthermore, special security arrangements 
have to be made to ensure that young women and girls can safely maintain the contact with those 
family members that do not want to harm them.  Unfortunately, the authorities do not always 
seem to be willing to dedicate the necessary resources.  Breen Atroshi, the sister of murdered 
Pela Atroshi, for instance, told me that the authorities are not willing to provide her with security 
arrangements necessary to meet with her mother - contrary to what was promised when she 
agreed to testify against her sister&#8217;s murderers.

</p>
<p>65. Sweden has introduced specific legislation to address the vulnerabilities of non-Swedish 
women stemming from their non-permanent resident status.  Under the Aliens Act, a foreign 
woman who holds a temporary residence permit that depends on her marriage to a Swedish 
national or a permanent residence can only receive a permanent residence permit after two years 
of marriage.  This dependency can trap women in violent relationships.  For this reason, a special 
provision has been introduced into the Aliens Act which allows women to receive a residence 
permit of her own in cases where the relationship with the partner ended before two years had 
passed because she or her children suffered substantial violence or other violations of freedom 
and integrity at the hands of her partner.  It is sufficient that the victim document the violence 
through reports from a hospital or a shelter; she does not have to take the often difficult - and 
sometimes dangerous - step of reporting her former partner to the police in order to legalize her 
status.  Women&#8217;s organizations and local officials have informed me that this excellent norm is 
unfortunately still underused, because foreign women exposed to violence are either not aware of 
its existence or are afraid to pursue this option. 
</p>
<p>66. On 1 October 2004, a new provision was introduced into the Aliens Act that allows the 
authorities to provide victims of human trafficking and other crimes with a temporary residence 
permit for the duration of the criminal process.  The victim is also entitled to social security 
benefits.  At the time of my visit, 23 foreigners, all women, had received such a permit.  
Additional amendments were about to be introduced to bring Swedish laws into compliance with 
European Union Directive 2004/81 on residence permits for trafficking victims and the Council 
of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, which Sweden has 
signed but not yet ratified. 
</p>
<p>67. In March 2006, Sweden reformed its refugee legislation substantially, enhancing the 
protection of women coming to Sweden due to a well-founded fear of gender-related 
persecution.  In the past, women who feared persecution solely on the basis of gender were not 
entitled to refugee status; they could only obtain a subsidiary protection status.  The new 
legislation abolishes this two-tier system and expands the refugee definition to include women 
and men who have a well-founded fear of persecution in their country of origin because of their 
gender or sexual orientation.  Unfortunately, some problems may persist with regard to cases 
involving gender-related persecution by non-State actors (i.e. the typical cases).  The official 
commentary on the new refugee legislation indicates that it does not suffice that a private actor 
persecutes a woman due to her gender.  In addition, the State of origin has to fail in adequately 
protecting the woman precisely due to her gender (or one of the grounds outlined in the 
1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees:  race, nationality, etc.).  A woman who has 
suffered gender-related persecution by a non-State actor because the State cannot protect her due 
to lack of resources or inefficiency would therefore not be regarded as a refugee.  This 
interpretation of the law, which would introduce a double persecution requirement, diverges 
from the Guidelines on Gender-Related Persecution of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR).<b>31</b>  It is to be hoped that Swedish officials and courts will not follow this 
restrictive interpretation.

<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Sweden has firmly established a strong equal opportunity framework, which has led 
to very impressive advances towards the achievement of equal opportunities for women 
and men in the public sphere.  At the same time, however, unequal power relations 
between women and men in Sweden continue to be fuelled by deeply rooted patriarchal 
gender norms, which will gradually erode provided that the Government and society at 
large sustain their strong commitment to transform relations between the sexes. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>Owing to the survival of these hidden social norms, there are still significant levels 
of violence against women in Sweden.  The ongoing rise in sexual violence is a particular 
matter of concern.  The perpetrators and victims can be found in all segments and at all 
levels of society, although some women, including immigrant, refugee and minority women 
as well as women in prostitution, face particular vulnerabilities. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Overall, the Government and society appear to be determined to combat and 
eradicate violence against women.  The penal law framework addressing violence against 
women is excellent, but low prosecution and conviction rates give a clear indication that its 
implementation must be further improved.  Some deficiencies in protecting women exposed 
to violence remain and a number of municipalities clearly have to raise the standards of 
their protection policies.  There is room for further innovative strategies to effectively 
respond to the remaining inequalities.  Such strategies would need to address not only the 
reproduction of gender hierarchies in the private sphere, but would also have to remove 
the existing obstacles to the equal participation of immigrants and refugees in society. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>In view of the measures already taken and the remaining deficiencies, I would like 
to make the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) To the Government: 
(i) Enhance and reinforce the institutional framework on gender equality 
</b></p>
<p><b>by: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Strengthening efforts to establish and implement gender 
budgeting practices and expand them to all levels of State 
institutions; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Broadening the competences of the Equal Opportunities 
Ombudsman to allow for addressing individual complaints from 
persons exposed to gender-related violence; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Developing guidelines and indicators to enhance the institutional 
capacity of municipalities in better fulfilling their obligation to 
protect women; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Considering ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on 
Action against Trafficking in Human Beings; </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.3 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p><b>(ii) Address root causes of violence against women by: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Strengthening efforts to address the perpetuation of unequal 
gender power relations in the private sphere, including through 
measures at the school and preschool levels, to foster the 
development of male and female identities that break with notions 
of inequality and use of force; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Strengthening efforts, including those outlined in the National 
Action Plan to Combat Racism, Xenophobia, Homophobia and 
Discrimination, to protect persons belonging to ethnic or religious 
minorities from discrimination in the labour market, the justice 
sector and other key areas.  Special measures should be considered 
to facilitate the equal participation of women and men with an 
immigrant, refugee or minority background in the educational 
system and the labour market.  The Government should also 
strongly consider signing and ratifying the International 
Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members 
of Their Families; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Acknowledging the diverse voices within different cultural groups 
and supporting those that respect and promote women&#8217;s rights 
within their communities.  Gender equality policies and efforts 
should avoid cultural essentialism and stigmatization by 
promoting gender equality as a universal culture that has emerged 
in response to a universal history of gender inequality; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Prosecute and punish perpetrators of violence against women by: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Pursuing a policy of zero tolerance of gender-based violence and 
sexual harassment, particularly in law enforcement.  The police 
should adopt a proactive approach in investigating and 
documenting cases of intimate-partner violence, especially those 
amounting to a gross violation of a woman&#8217;s integrity.  Good 
practices in this regard should be documented and disseminated; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensuring specialized training for the police, medical personnel 
and other professionals who may have first contact with women 
exposed to violence on how to gather and document evidence in 
gender-based violence cases; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Fostering international cooperation in cases of violence against 
women with a transnational dimension, especially honour-related 
violence, and consider re-establishing a special unit on such 
violence in the National Criminal Investigation Department which 
can coordinate Sweden&#8217;s work with that of other countries.  At the 
same time, local police and justice sector personnel should </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/34/Add.3 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p><b>continue to receive special training on the specific challenges 
related to particular manifestations of violence against women in 
different communities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Protect women at known risk of violence by: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Issuing restraining orders against potential perpetrators of 
violence against women on the basis of a comprehensive, 
forward-looking risk assessment to prevent violence before it 
occurs.  The police need to dedicate adequate resources to follow 
up restraining orders, detect breaches and initiate sanctions 
proceedings.  Breaches should be consistently sanctioned with 
appropriate penalties; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Implementing the recommendations of the Inquiry on Social 
Services Support for Women Exposed to Violence.  In particular, 
the Social Services Act should be amended to give women at risk 
of violence a legally enforceable claim against their local 
municipality to have their case comprehensively assessed and to 
receive all necessary protection and support (including, if needed, 
access to a safe and adequate shelter place); 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recognizing, along with the municipalities, the important role of 
non-governmental women&#8217;s shelters and providing them with 
adequate funding for their core activities.  Particular attention 
should be paid to the protection requirements of women with 
special needs, including women with substance-abuse problems, 
physically or mentally disabled women, young women and girls, 
and elderly women; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Developing a long-term protection and support strategy for 
women under threat or at continued risk of violence, including 
providing them with access to housing with suitable security 
arrangements and special security provisions to allow for their 
contact with non-hostile family members.  Guidance and 
psychological counselling should also be made available for 
victims in enabling them to establish a sustainable and safe life on 
their own; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Offering special protection and support to all women who remain 
in prostitution.  Existing projects to support women in prostitution 
with strong substance-abuse problems should be maintained and 
expanded.  If they choose, these women should be provided with 
immediate access to a drug addiction rehabilitation programme; </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.3 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p><b>(v) Expand the knowledge base on violence against women and related 
factors by: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Strengthening efforts to implement the Official Statistics 
Ordinance&#8217;s requirement of sex-disaggregated statistics.  Unless 
there are special reasons for not doing so, sets of statistical 
information should be broken down by sex consistently in all 
tables and diagrams with sex as a primary and overall 
classification; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Commissioning a comprehensive study, conducted by independent 
researchers, of the Swedish policy on prostitution and its impact 
on human trafficking and other types of violence often occurring 
in the context of prostitution.  The study should also consider the 
policy&#8217;s long-term effects and its potential impacts outside of 
Sweden; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Commissioning a study on violence against Saami women, 
preferably through a joint initiative with the Governments of 
other countries with a Saami population; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) To the municipalities and non-State actors: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>All municipalities, supported by the county administrative boards, 
should adopt action plans on violence against women that lay down clear 
objectives, identify shortcomings, suggest relevant measures and point 
out areas for development and enhanced cooperation between 
authorities and civil society.  The action plans should be tailored to the 
local situation taking into account the specific manifestations of violence 
against women actually occurring in the municipality.  Adequate 
resources must be dedicated to implement the plans.  The plans and 
their state of implementation should be annually reviewed; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The women&#8217;s movement should continue and strengthen efforts to 
integrate other constituencies into the struggle to achieve gender 
equality.  Men who are genuinely willing to participate in appropriate 
initiatives should always be given the option to do so; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The media, as set forth in the Beijing Platform for Action, must avoid 
gender stereotypes, show sensitivity for the needs of victims and their 
families when reporting on violence against women, and base reports on 
empirical facts.  The media, in collaboration with other civil society 
actors, should work towards overcoming discriminatory social attitudes 
towards women.
