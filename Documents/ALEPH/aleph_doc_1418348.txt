CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2014 contains “forward-looking statements”. Generally, the words 
“believes,” “anticipates,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “continue,” and similar expressions or the negative thereof or comparable 
terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements which include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the Company’s expectations regarding 
its working capital requirements, financing requirements, business prospects, and other statements of expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated 
events or trends, and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts and those related to the proposed merger of Paramount and Coeur Mining, 
Inc. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including the matters set forth in this Quarterly Report or other reports or documents the Company 
files with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those projected, including 
Paramount’s and Coeur’s ability to consummate the merger and satisfy the conditions to complete the merger, including the receipt of approval of both Paramount’s 
and Coeur’s stockholders.
These forward-looking statements were based on various factors and were derived utilizing numerous assumptions and other factors that could cause our
actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, economic, political and market conditions 
and fluctuations, the prevailing market price for gold and silver, government and industry regulation, interest rate risk, U.S. and global competition, and other factors. 
Most of these factors are difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond our control. You should consider the areas of risk described in connection with any 
forward-looking statements that may be made herein.
Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Except for our ongoing obligations to 
disclose material information under the Federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to 
report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events. For any forward-looking statements contained in any document, we claim the protection of the safe 
harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
When used in this report, the terms “Paramount,” the “Company,” “we,”, “our,” and “us” refers to Paramount Gold and Silver Corp., a Delaware corporation.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements For the Six Month Period Ended December 31, 2014 
(Expressed in United States dollars, unless otherwise stated) 
(Unaudited)

Principal(cid:160) Accounting Policies:
(cid:160) The condensed consolidated interim financial
(cid:160) The Company is in the process of exploring its mineral properties
Paramount Gold and Silver Corp. (the “Company”), incorporated under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are 
engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of(cid:160) precious metal properties. The Company ’s wholly owned subsidiaries include Paramount Gold de Mexico 
S.A. de C.V., Magnetic Resources Ltd, Minera Gama SA de CV, and Paramount Nevada Gold Corp.(cid:160)
in both the United States and Mexico.(cid:160) The Company ’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure additional funding to 
advance its projects and to date has not yet determined whether its properties contain reserves that are economically recoverable. 
 
Basis of Presentation and Preparation 
 
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles for 
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.(cid:160) Accordingly, they do not include all of the disclosures required 
by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements.(cid:160) In the opinion of management, all of the normal and recurring 
adjustments necessary to fairly present the interim financial information set forth herein have been included.(cid:160) The results of operations for interim periods are not 
necessarily indicative of the operating results of a full year or of future years. 
 
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and 
follow the same accounting policies and methods of their application as the most recent annual financial statements.(cid:160)
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.(cid:160) All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in 
consolidation.(cid:160) These condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related 
footnotes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Paramount Gold and Silver Corp. for the year ended June 30, 2014. 
 
Marketable Securities 
 
The Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale securities.(cid:160) The securities are measured at fair market value in the financial statements with 
unrealized gains and temporary losses on investments classified as available for sale are included within accumulated other comprehensive income, net of any related 
tax effect. Upon realization, such amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income, net, realized gains and losses and other 
than temporary impairments, if any, are reflected in the statements of operations as other income or expenses. The Company does not recognize changes in the fair 
value of its investments in income unless a decline in value is considered other than temporary. 
 
Use of Estimates 
 
The preparation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of 
the condensed consolidated interim financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ 
from those estimates. 
 
Significant estimates made by management in the accompanying financial statements include collectability of amounts receivable, the adequacy of the Company’s 
asset retirement obligations and fair value of stock based compensation. 
 
Stock Based Compensation 
 
The Company has adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 718, “Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”), which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged 
for employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the 
award, and is recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant).(cid:160) New shares of the Company ’s 
Common Stock will be issued for any options exercised or awards granted.

1.
Principal(cid:160) Accounting Policies (Continued):
Mineral Properties 
 
Mineral property acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred and will be amortized using the units –of – production method over the estimated life of the reserve 
following the commencement of production.(cid:160) If a mineral property is subsequently abandoned or impaired, any capitalized costs will be expensed in the period of 
abandonment or impairment. 
 
Acquisition costs include cash consideration and the fair market value of shares issued on the acquisition of mineral properties. 
 
Exploration Costs 
 
Exploration costs, which include maintenance, development and exploration of mineral claims, are expensed as incurred.(cid:160) When it is determined that a mineral deposit 
can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred after such determination will be capitalized and amortized 
over their useful lives.(cid:160) To date, the Company has not established the commercial feasibility of its exploration prospects; therefore, all exploration costs are being 
expensed. 
 
Net Loss per Share 
 
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each period.(cid:160) 
Diluted loss per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common 
stock. 
 
Concentration of Credit Risk and Amounts Receivable 
 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and amounts receivable.(cid:160) 
We deposit our cash with financial institutions which we believe have sufficient credit quality to minimize risk of loss. 
 
Impuesto al Valor Agregado taxes (IVA) are recoverable value-added taxes charged by the Mexican government on goods sold and services rendered at a rate of 
16%.(cid:160) Under certain circumstances, these taxes are recoverable by filing a tax return and as determined by the Mexican taxing authority.(cid:160) Each period, receivables are 
reviewed for collectability.(cid:160) When a receivable is determined to not be collectable we allow for the receivable until we are either assured of collection or assured that a 
write-off is necessary.(cid:160) Allowances in association with our receivable from IVA from our Mexico subsidiaries are based on our determination that the Mexican 
government may not allow the complete refund of these taxes.(cid:160) The Company believes that all amounts recorded as a receivable from the Mexican government will be 
recovered. 
 
Foreign Currency 
 
The parent company’s functional currency is the United States dollar. The functional currencies of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries are the U.S. Dollar and 
the Canadian Dollar.(cid:160) Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the consolidated balance 
sheet date.(cid:160)
loss for the six month period ended December 31, 2014 is $104,780. 
 
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are translated to United States dollars in accordance with ASC 830 using period-end rates of exchange for assets and 
liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the period for revenues and expenses. Translation gains (losses) are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive 
income (loss) as a component of stockholders’ equity. 
(cid:160)
(cid:160) Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The aggregate foreign transaction

During the six month period ended December 31, 2014, the Company sold marketable securities with a cost basis of $430,100 for net proceeds of $462,075.(cid:160) The gain 
on sale of securities of $31,975 was recorded on the statement of operations.(cid:160) As a result of the transaction, the Company reversed from comprehensive income 
$106,631 it had previously recorded as an unrealized gain. The Company also recorded an unrealized loss of $18,217 (2013 – $39,989 gain).(cid:160) The marketable securities 
reflected in the table above includes stock purchase warrants of a single entity involved in the exploration of precious metals.(cid:160) The Company performs a quarterly 
assessment on its marketable securities with unrealized losses to determine if the security is other than temporarily impaired. 
 
3. Fair Value Measurements:
 
Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date.(cid:160) Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the 
categorization with the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: 
 
The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
(Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below:
Level 1
Level 2
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement 
date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including 
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not 
active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally 
from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
Level 3
Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

Marketable Securities 
(cid:160)  
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted 
market prices. The cash and cash equivalents that are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets are primarily comprised of commercial paper, short-term 
certificates of deposit and U.S. Treasury securities. 
 
The Company’s marketable securities are comprised of stock purchase warrants. The stock purchase warrants’ fair value is recorded using a Black Scholes options 
model using inputs such as contractual terms, stock volatility and implied interest rates. The Company’s marketable securities are classified within Level 3 of the fair 
value hierarchy. 
 
4. Non-Cash Transactions:
 
During the six month period ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not enter into non-cash activities.

shares for future issuance.(cid:160) The stockholders also approved the re -pricing of the exercise price of all outstanding stock options to $0.65 per share.
On December 2, 2011, the stockholders approved the 2011/2012 Stock Incentive & Equity Compensation Plan thereby reserving an additional 4,000,000 common 
shares for future issuance to employees, directors and consultants.
Stock Based Compensation
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to value stock options granted. The Black-Scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair 
value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The model requires management to make estimates which are subjective and may 
not be representative of actual results. Changes in assumptions can materially affect estimates of fair values.
The Company did not grant options for the six month periods ending December 31, 2014 and 2013.
Changes in the Company’s stock options for the period ended December 31, 2014 are summarized below:

10. Reclamation and Environmental:
 
The Company holds an insurance policy related to its Sleeper Gold Project that covers reclamation costs in the event the Company defaults on payments of its 
reclamation costs up to an aggregate of $25 million.(cid:160) The unamortized insurance premium is being amortized to December 31, 2016 and the current and non -current 
prepaid insurance balance at December 31, 2014 is $98,084 (June 30, 2014 - $122,607). 
 
As a part of the policy, the Company has funds in a commutation account which is used to reimburse reclamation costs and indemnity claims.(cid:160) The balance of the 
commutation account at December 31, 2014 is $2,535,580(June 30, 2014 - $2,626,538). 
 
Reclamation and environmental costs are based principally on legal requirements.(cid:160) Management estimates costs associated with reclamation of mineral properties and 
properties under mine closure.(cid:160) On an ongoing basis the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual amounts could differ from those based 
on estimates and assumptions.(cid:160)   
 
The asset retirement obligation at the Sleeper Gold Project has been measured using the following variables:(cid:160) 1)Expected costs for earthwork, re -vegetation, in-pit 
water treatment, on-going monitoring, labor and management, 2)Inflation adjustment, and 3) Market risk premium.(cid:160) The sum of the expected costs by year is 
discounted using the Company’s credit adjusted risk free interest rate from the time it expects to pay the retirement obligation to the time it incurs the obligation.(cid:160) (cid:160) 
The reclamation and environmental obligation recorded on the balance sheet is equal to the present value of the estimated costs. 
 
The current undiscounted estimate of the reclamation costs for existing disturbances at the Sleeper Gold Project is $3,915,626 as required by U.S Bureau of Land 
Management and the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection. Assumptions used to compute the asset retirement obligations for the year ended June 30, 
2014 for the Sleeper Gold Project included a credit adjusted risk free rate and inflation rate of 9.76% (2013 – 9.76%) and 2.0% (2013 – 2.0%), respectively. Expenses are 
expected to be incurred between the years 2014 and 2053. 
 
Changes to the Company’s asset retirement obligations for the six month period ended December 31, 2014 are as follows:

11.(cid:160) Commitments and Contingencies:
Coeur Mining, Inc.
On December 16, 2014, Paramount Gold and Silver Corp. (“Paramount”), Paramount Nevada Gold Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Paramount (“SpinCo”), Coeur 
Mining, Inc. (“Coeur”) and Hollywood Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coeur, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the 
“Merger Agreement”), providing for the acquisition of Paramount by Coeur and, prior to such acquisition, the spin-off of Paramount’s mining assets in Nevada to 
Paramount’s stockholders.(cid:160) Specifically, (1) Merger Sub will merge with and into Paramount, with Paramount surviving as a wholly -owned subsidiary of Coeur (the 
“Merger”), and (2) immediately prior to the Merger, Paramount will dividend to its stockholders all of the shares that it then holds in SpinCo (the “Spin-Off”).(cid:160)  At the 
time of the Spin-Off, SpinCo will hold Paramount’s mining assets in Nevada.
Spin-Off
The Merger Agreement provides that, prior to the Spin-Off, (1) Coeur will make a loan to Paramount in the principal amount of $8,530,000 and Paramount will 
contribute all of the proceeds of such loan to SpinCo as an equity contribution, and (2) SpinCo will issue to Coeur, in exchange for a cash payment by Coeur in the 
amount of $1,470,000, newly issued shares of SpinCo common stock amounting to 4.9% of the outstanding SpinCo common stock after issuance.(cid:160) Paramount and 
SpinCo will then enter into a separation agreement, and Paramount will effect the Spin-Off by paying a dividend to Paramount’s stockholders on a pro rata basis all of 
the shares of SpinCo common stock then held by Paramount.(cid:160) After effectuating the Spin -Off, Paramount’s stockholders will own approximately 95.1% of SpinCo, 
which will be a standalone, publicly traded company, and Coeur will own the remaining 4.9%.
Merger
Immediately following the completion of the Spin-Off, the parties will consummate the Merger, pursuant to which each issued and outstanding share of Paramount’s 
common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.2016 shares of common stock of Coeur.(cid:160) After giving effect to the Merger, it is projected that Paramount ’s 
stockholders will also own approximately 24% of Coeur’s common stock, while existing stockholders of Coeur will continue to own the remaining 76%.(cid:160) No fractional 
shares of Coeur’s common stock will be issued in the Merger, and Paramount’s stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any such fractional shares.
Litigation
Since the announcement of the merger on December 17, 2014, the Company was named as a defendant in(cid:160)six putative stockholder class action, brought by a 
purported stockholders of Paramount, challenging the proposed merger (the “Complaints”). The Complaints were filed in the Court of Chancery in the State of 
Delaware.(cid:160) The plaintiffs generally claim that the board of directors of our Parent breached their fiduciary duties to Paramount stockholders by authorizing the merger 
with Coeur Mining for what the plaintiffs assert is inadequate consideration and pursuant to an allegedly inadequate process.(cid:160) Paramount, members of the Paramount 
board and the Company deny any wrongdoing and are vigorously defending all of the actions.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following information should be read in conjunction with (i) our accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related notes (included
elsewhere in this report) and (ii) our consolidated financial statements, related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of 
operations included in our June 30, 2014 annual report filed on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 9, 2014.
We are an exploratory stage mining company that currently has mining concessions in Mexico and mining claims in Nevada, USA. We have no proven
reserves at our San Miguel project in Mexico or at our Sleeper Gold project in Nevada but are currently exploring both projects. The following discussion updates our 
planned operations for this fiscal year. It also analyzes our financial condition and summarizes the results of operations for the three and six month periods ended 
December 31, 2014 and compares those results to the three and six months period ended December 31, 2013. 
 
Merger Agreement
On December 16, 2014, we entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Coeur Mining, Inc. (“Coeur”) that provides
for Paramount to merge with and into a subsidiary of Coeur (the “Merger Sub”), with Paramount surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Coeur, 
following the spin-off of Paramount’s mining assets in Nevada to Paramount’s stockholders (the “Spin-Off”). The Merger Agreement provides that, prior to the Spin-
Off, (1) Coeur will make a loan to Paramount in the principal amount of $8,530,000 and Paramount will contribute all of the proceeds of such loan to Paramount Nevada 
Gold Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Paramount (“SpinCo”), as an equity contribution, and (2) SpinCo will issue to Coeur, in exchange for a cash payment by 
Coeur in the amount of $1,470,000, newly issued shares of SpinCo common stock amounting to 4.9% of the outstanding SpinCo common stock after issuance. 
Paramount and SpinCo will then enter into a separation agreement, and Paramount will effect the Spin-Off by paying a dividend to Paramount’s stockholders on a pro 
rata basis all of the shares of SpinCo common stock then held by Paramount. After effectuating the Spin-Off, Paramount’s stockholders will own approximately 95.1% 
of SpinCo, which will be a standalone, publicly traded company, and Coeur will own the remaining 4.9%.
Immediately following the completion of the Spin-Off, the parties will consummate the merger, pursuant to which each issued and outstanding share of
Paramount’s common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.2016 shares of common stock of Coeur. After giving effect to the merger, it is projected that 
Paramount’s stockholders will also own approximately 24% of Coeur’s common stock, while existing stockholders of Coeur will continue to own the remaining 76%. 
No fractional shares of Coeur’s common stock will be issued in the merger, and Paramount’s stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any such fractional shares.
The proposed merger has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of Paramount and Coeur, and is supported by the management teams of
both companies. We currently expect the merger to close in the second calendar quarter of 2015, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, 
including the approval of the shareholders of both companies. 
 
Royalty Agreement
On December 16, 2014, Paramount, Paramount Gold de Mexico S.A. de C.V., Minera Gama S.A. de C.V., and Coeur Mexicana S.A. de C.V entered into a
royalty agreement (the “Royalty Agreement”) whereby Couer Mexicana was granted a royalty right for a 0.7% net smelter returns royalty in respect of the San Miguel 
Project in consideration for paying $5,250,000 to Paramount and Paramount Gold de Mexico.

Plan of Operation:
Exploration activities for the next three months at our San Miguel Project will primarily focus on reviewing the results of our most recently completed drill
program. The Company drilled 27 holes totaling over 36,000 feet and sent over 5,000 drill core samples for lab analysis. The Company’s exploration plan and budget 
for the San Miguel Project will be managed by its in-house technical staff. It will be funded by the Company’s cash on hand. We have budgeted approximately $1.5 
million for the next three month period.
(cid:160)  
In Nevada, our plan for the next three months is to continue focusing on our Sleeper Gold Project. Our budget for this period is approximately $0.2 million.
The main budget activities will include consulting, material modeling and metallurgical testing analysis.
Our work at both the San Miguel Project and Sleeper Gold Project is consistent with Paramount’s strategy of expanding and upgrading known, large-scale
precious metal occurrences in established mining camps, defining their economic potential and then partnering them with nearby producers. 
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7,062,141 compared to $5,107,691 as at June 30, 2014. The increase of $1,954,450 was the result 
of offsetting our cash used in our operating activities with the proceeds from the sale of a net smelting returns royalty from our San Miguel project, cash provided by 
the issuance of our common stock and proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities.
At December 31, 2014, approximately $77,000 of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents was held in Mexico and Canada by its wholly owned subsidiaries.
These amounts held in Mexico and Canada are not required to fund the Company’s U.S. operations.
During the(cid:160)six month period ended December 31, 2014, the Company continued to sell shares of its common stock through its sales agent, Cantor Fitzgerald 
& Co. (“Cantor”) pursuant to a Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement it entered with Cantor on April 11, 2014. Under the market offering program (“ATM”), 
pursuant to which, we may, at our discretion, sell up to $30.0 million of our common stock through Cantor. Sales of common stock made under the ATM are made 
under our previously filed and currently effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-194411) by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions at market 
prices.
During the six month period ended December 31, 2014, we received net proceeds of approximately $2,611,156 from sales of approximately 2,856,563 shares of our 
common stock at an average sales price of approximately $0.91 per share under a market offering program (‘ATM’). At December 31, 2014 we had approximately $23.7 
million available under the ATM.
At December 31, 2014, we had a net working capital of $7,613,121. We anticipate our cash expenditures to fund exploration programs in both Mexico and
Nevada and general corporate expenses to be approximately $0.53 million per month for the three month period ended March 31, 2015. Anticipated cash outlays will 
be funded by our available cash reserves.
At December 31, 2014, the amounts receivable amount of $1,491,572 primarily consisted of value added tax due from the Mexican government. 
(cid:160)
(cid:160)

Index
During the six months ended December 31, 2014, we sold marketable securities and received proceeds of $462,075.
Historically, we have funded our exploration and development activities through equity financing arrangements. We continue to assess our needs for
additional capital to ensure sufficient financial resources are available to fund our exploration and working capital needs. We believe that our access to additional 
capital, together with our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our needs for the next twelve months. If, however, we are unable to obtain additional 
capital or financing, our exploration and development activities will be significantly affected. 
 
Comparison of Operating Results for the six month period ended December 31, 2014 as to the six month period ended December 31, 2013
Net Loss
Our net loss for the six month period ended December 31, 2014 was $7,477,155 compared to a loss of $4,491,217 in the comparable period in the prior year.
The increase in net loss of approximately 67% was a result of our exploration drilling program at our San Miguel project and expenses related to the Merger 
Agreement between the Company and Coeur. We expect we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.
Expenses
Our level of exploration expenditures for the six month period ended December 31, 2014 increased by 66%, or by $2,048,898, from the comparable prior year
period. This increase was mainly due to the increase in drilling activity at the San Miguel Project.

Expenses
Our exploration expenses for the three month period ended December 31, 2014 compared to the comparable prior period increased by 69%, or by $1,285,180.
This increase was a result of drilling activity at our San Miguel Project.

Critical Accounting Policies
Management considers the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the Company’s consolidated 
financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our financial statements are affected by the 
accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. Management believes the Company’s critical accounting 
policies are those related to mineral property acquisition costs, exploration and development cost, stock based compensation, derivative accounting and foreign

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements and notes in conformity to U.S. GAAP and requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing 
basis, management evaluates these estimates, including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and long-lived assets. Management bases these 
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis 
of making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates 
under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
Mineral property acquisition costs
The Company capitalizes the cost of acquiring mineral properties and will amortize these costs over the useful life of a property following the commencement
of production or expense if it is determined that the mineral property has no future economic value or the properties are sold or abandoned. Costs include cash 
consideration and the fair market value of shares issued on the acquisition of mineral properties. Properties acquired under option agreements, whereby payments are 
made at the sole discretion of the Company, are recorded in the accounts of the specific mineral property at the time the payments are made.
The amounts recorded as mineral properties reflect actual costs incurred to acquire the properties and do not indicate any present or future value of
economically recoverable reserves.

Exploration expenses
The company expenses exploration costs as incurred. When it is determined that precious metal resource deposit can be economically and legally extracted
or produced based on established proven and probable reserves, further exploration expenses related to such reserves incurred after such a determination will be 
capitalized. To date, the Company has not established any proven or probable reserves and will continue to expense exploration expenses as incurred. 
 
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. Transactions involving foreign currencies for items included in operations are translated into U.S.
dollars using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of transaction and monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
consolidated balance sheet date and all other consolidated balance sheet items are translated at historical rates applicable to the transactions that comprise the 
amounts. Translation gains and losses are included in the determination of other comprehensive loss and gains in the Statement of Operations. 
 
Reclassification
Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the current quarter presentation.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We are not currently a party to, or otherwise involved with, any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. 
 
Item 3. (cid:160) Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
The Company’s market risk profile has not changed significantly from its year ended June 30, 2014.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
(cid:160)
The Company holds cash balances in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. We transact most of our business in US and Canadian dollars. Some of our expenses,
including labor and operating supplies are denominated in Mexican Pesos. As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact our operating costs. We do not 
manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of financial or derivative instruments, forward contracts or hedging activities.
(cid:160)  
In general, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar or Canadian dollar will positively impact our expenses transacted in Mexican Pesos. Conversely, any
weakening of the U.S dollar or Canadian dollar will increase our expenses transacted in Mexican Pesos. We do not believe that any weakening of the U.S. or Canadian 
dollar as compared to the Mexican Peso will have an adverse material effect on our operations. 
 
Interest Rate Risk
The Company’s investment policy for its cash and cash equivalents is focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of 
the Company. The Company’s interest earned on its cash balances is impacted on the fluctuations of U.S. and Canadian interest rates. We do not use interest rate 
derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. We do not believe that interest rate fluctuations will have any effect on our operations.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and determined that our disclosure controls and 
procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The evaluation considered the procedures designed to ensure 
that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the 
time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
(b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(d) and 13d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial 
reporting. 
 
(c)
Inherent Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation or
effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
(cid:160)  
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Since the announcement of the merger on December 17, 2014, Paramount, members of the Paramount board, SpinCo, Coeur, and Merger Sub have been
named as defendants in six putative stockholder class action suits brought by purported stockholders of Paramount, challenging the proposed Merger (the 
“Complaints”). The Complaints were filed in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (Fernando Gamboa v. Paramount Gold and Silver Corp., et al., No.: 10499; 
Jerry Panning v. Paramount Gold and Silver Corp., et al., No.: 10507; Jonah Weiss v. Christopher Crupi, et al., No.: 10517; Justin Beaston v. Paramount Gold and Silver 
Corporation, et al., No.: 10538; Rob Byers v. Christopher Crupi, et al., No.: 10551; James H. Alston v. Paramount Gold and Silver Corp., et al., No.: 10531. 
 
(cid:160)The plaintiffs generally claim that the Paramount board members breached their fiduciary duties to Paramount stockholders by: (i) authorizing the merger with Coeur 
for what the plaintiffs asserts is inadequate consideration and pursuant to an allegedly inadequate process, and (ii) failing to disclose sufficient information in its 
Form S-4 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow the shareholders to make an informed vote. The plaintiffs also claim that Paramount, Coeur, 
SpinCo and Merger Sub aided and abetted the other defendants’ alleged breach of duties. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, to enjoin the Merger, rescind the 
transaction or obtain rescissory damages if the Merger is consummated, obtain other unspecified damages and recover attorneys’ fees and costs. 
 
(cid:160)We, members of the Paramount board, Coeur, SpinCo and Merger Sub deny any wrongdoing and are vigorously defending all of the actions.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period
ended June 30, 2014.
Risk Factors Relating to the Merger.
The merger may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all. Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our
stock prices and our future business and financial results.
The merger may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all. Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our stock
price and our future business and financial results.
The completion of the merger is subject to certain conditions, including (1) approval by Coeur stockholders and Paramount stockholders, (2) the
authorization from the Mexican Federal Economic Competition Commission, (3) the absence of certain legal impediments, (4) the effectiveness of certain filings with 
the SEC, (5) receipt of opinions from legal counsel regarding the intended tax treatment of the transaction, (6) the consummation of the Spin-Off and (7) other 
customary closing conditions. We cannot assure you that the merger will be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. We have 
expended and will continue to expend a significant amount of time and resources on the merger, and a failure to consummate the merger as currently contemplated, or 
at all, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations.
If the merger is not completed, our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including the following:
ö
ö
ö
ö
ö
ö
being required, under certain circumstances, to pay Coeur a breakup fee of $5 million and/or being required, under certain circumstances, to 
reimburse Coeur for certain expenses up to $1.5 million;
having to pay substantial other costs and expenses relating to the proposed merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing, printing and 
mailing fees and integration costs that have already been incurred and will continue to be incurred until closing;
under the Merger Agreement, being subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, which may adversely affect our ability to execute 
certain business strategies while the merger is pending;
the focus of management on the transaction instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to Paramount;
the market price of Paramount common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger 
will be completed; and
if the Merger Agreement is terminated and our board of directors seeks an alternative strategic transaction, stockholders of Paramount cannot be 
certain that we will be able to find a party willing to enter into a strategic transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that 
the other party has agreed to in the Merger Agreement;
in each case, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of having the merger completed. In addition, if the transaction is not completed, we may experience 
negative reactions from the financial markets and from our employees and other stakeholders. We could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete 
the merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the transaction is not completed, we 
cannot assure our stockholders that these risks will not materialize and will not materially affect our business, financial results and stock price.
If the merger does not qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the stockholders of Paramount may be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on the merger.
Although Coeur and Paramount intend that the merger qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, it is possible that the
Internal Revenue Service may assert that the merger fails to qualify as such. If the Internal Revenue Service were to be successful in such assertion, or if for any other 
reason the merger were to fail to qualify as a “reorganization,” each U.S. holder of Paramount common stock would recognize gain or loss with respect to its shares of 
Paramount common stock based on the difference between (i) that U.S. holder’s tax basis in such shares and (ii) the fair market value of the Coeur common stock 
received (and any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Coeur common stock).
(cid:160)
(cid:160)

Index
The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in either Coeur’s or Paramount’s stock price.
Upon closing of the merger, each share of Paramount common stock (other than shares owned by Paramount, Coeur or Merger Sub, which will be cancelled)
will be converted into the right to receive 0.2016 shares of Coeur common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. This exchange ratio was fixed in the 
Merger Agreement and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either Coeur common stock or Paramount common stock. Changes in the price of Coeur 
common stock prior to the merger will affect the market value that Paramount stockholders will receive on the date of the merger. Stock price changes may result from 
a variety of factors (many of which are beyond our control), including the following:
ö
ö
ö
ö
ö
changes in Coeur’s or Paramount’s businesses, operations, performance and prospects;
changes in market assessments of the business, operations and prospects of Coeur or Paramount;
investor behavior and strategies, including market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed, including related considerations 
regarding regulatory clearance of the merger;
interest rates, metals prices, general market and economic conditions and other factors generally affecting the price of Coeur’s and Paramount’s 
common stock; and
federal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the businesses in which Paramount and Coeur operate.
The price of Coeur common stock at the closing of the merger may vary from its price on the date the Merger Agreement was executed, on the date of the
joint proxy statement/prospectus of Coeur and Paramount(cid:160)and on the date of the special meetings of Coeur and Paramount. As a result, the market value represented 
by the exchange ratio will also vary.
As a result of the Spin-Off and any “when-issued and “ex-spin-off” trading that may develop, we expect the market price of shares of our common stock to 
decline because the market price will no longer include the value of our Nevada business. The value of Paramount common stock to be exchanged for Coeur common 
stock will reflect only our Mexico business and will not include the value of our United States business as the market price of Paramount’s common stock currently 
does. We cannot predict the amount of this decline, as the market price of shares of Paramount common stock may fluctuate based on the perceived values of the 
common stock of the combined company and SpinCo in anticipation of the Spin-Off and the merger, and it may not be possible to estimate the value of common stock 
of either the combined company or SpinCo in advance. Therefore, current and historical market prices of Coeur common stock and Paramount common stock are not 
reflective of the value that Paramount stockholders will receive in the merger.
We cannot assure you that, following the Spin-Off and the merger, the combined market prices of the common stock of the combined company and the
SpinCo will equal or exceed what the combined market price of Coeur common stock and Paramount common stock would have been in the absence of the Spin-Off 
and the merger. It is possible that after the Spin-Off and the merger, the combined equity value of the combined company and SpinCo will be less than the combined 
equity value of Coeur and Paramount before the Spin-Off and the merger.
Any delay in completing the merger may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits from the merger.
In addition to the required regulatory clearance and stockholder approvals, the merger is subject to a number of other conditions beyond Coeur’s and
Paramount’s control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. We cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will 
be satisfied. Furthermore, the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals could delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of 
time or prevent it from occurring.

Index
The Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquiror of Paramount or could result in any competing
proposal being at a lower price than it might otherwise be.
The Merger Agreement contains “no shop” provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict Paramount’s ability to solicit, initiate or knowingly
facilitate or encourage competing third-party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of Paramount, and Paramount does not have a unilateral right to terminate 
the Merger Agreement in order to accept an alternative business combination proposal that might result in greater value to its stockholders than the transactions. 
Further, even if the Paramount board withholds or withdraws (or modifies in a manner adverse to Coeur) its recommendation of the merger proposal, Paramount will 
still be required to submit the matter to a vote of its stockholders at the special meeting unless the Merger Agreement is otherwise terminated in accordance with its 
terms. In addition, Coeur generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the merger and the Merger Agreement in response to any competing acquisition 
proposals that may be made before Paramount’s board may withhold or withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to the other party) its recommendation. In some 
circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, Paramount may be required to pay a termination fee to Coeur and/or reimburse Coeur for certain 
expenses..
These provisions could discourage a potential competing acquiror that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Paramount from 
considering or proposing that acquisition, even if we were prepared to(cid:160) offer greater value than provided for under the Merger Agreement, or might result in a 
potential competing acquiror proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the $5 million breakup fee 
and/or reimbursement of certain expenses up to $1.5 million that may become payable in certain circumstances, which would represent an additional cost for a 
potential third party seeking a business combination with us.
The merger will involve substantial costs.
We have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial costs and expenses relating directly to the merger, including fees and expenses payable to
legal, accounting and financial advisors and other professional fees relating to the transaction, insurance premium costs, fees and costs relating to regulatory filings 
and notices, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing costs and other transaction-related costs, fees and expenses.
Paramount’s executive officers and directors have interests in the transactions that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Paramount’s
stockholders generally.
Executive officers of Coeur and Paramount negotiated, with oversight and input provided by their respective boards of directors, the terms of the Merger
Agreement. The Coeur board approved the Merger Agreement and the issuance of shares of Coeur common stock to Paramount stockholders in connection with the 
merger and determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and the issuance of shares of Coeur common 
stock to Paramount stockholders in connection with the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Coeur and its stockholders. The Paramount board 
approved the Merger Agreement and determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions, including the Spin-Off and the merger, are advisable, fair to and in 
the best interests of Paramount and its stockholders. Paramount’s executive officers and directors may have interests in the transactions that may be different from, 
or in addition to, the interests of Paramount’s stockholders.
Paramount stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the merger.
Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders, in connection with certain mergers, to demand that the corporation 
pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in connection with 
the merger. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders do not have appraisal rights if the shares of stock they hold, at the record date for 
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting of stockholders to act upon the merger or consolidation, are either (i) listed on a national securities 
exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appraisal rights are available if stockholders are required by the terms of 
the Merger Agreement to accept for their shares anything other than (a) shares of stock of the surviving corporation, (b) shares of stock of another corporation that 
will either be listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, (c) cash instead of fractional shares or (d) any combination of 
clauses (a)-(c).
(cid:160)
(cid:160)
30
Index
Because our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, a national securities exchange, and is expected to continue to be so listed on the record date, and
because in the merger the Paramount stockholders will receive shares of Coeur common stock which is listed on the NYSE, and is expected to be listed after the 
merger and the merger otherwise satisfies the foregoing requirements, holders of Paramount common stock will not be entitled to dissenters’ or appraisal rights in the 
merger with respect to their shares of Paramount common stock.
(cid:160)  
In connection with the announcement of the Merger Agreement, putative class action lawsuits have been filed and are pending as of the date hereof,
seeking, among other things, to enjoin the merger, and an adverse ruling in any of these lawsuits may prevent the merger from being effective or from becoming 
effective within the expected time frame.
(cid:160)  
While Paramount’s and Coeur’s respective directors and management teams believe that the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to 
defend vigorously against these allegations, we cannot assure you as to the outcome of these, or any similar future lawsuits, including the costs associated with 
defending these claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation or settlement of these claims. If any plaintiffs are successful in 
obtaining an injunction with respect to the merger, such an injunction may prevent the completion of the merger on the agreed upon terms, in the expected time frame 
or altogether. Whether the plaintiffs’ claims are successful, this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources, which could 
adversely affect the operation of the businesses of Coeur and Paramount.
