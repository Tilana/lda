<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 15/17, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to prepare an analytical 
compilation of good or effective practices in adopting a human rights-based approach to 
eliminating preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, that included (a) an identification 
of how such initiatives embodied a human rights-based approach; (b) the elements of these 
initiatives that succeeded in achieving a reduction in maternal mortality and morbidity 
through a human rights-based approach; and (c) ways in which similar initiatives could give 
effect more fully to a human rights-based approach. For the purpose of the present report, a 
note verbale was addressed in January 2011 to States, United Nations agencies and the 
World Bank, national human rights institutions, all United Nations special procedures, the 
Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and civil 
society organizations. Written contributions1 were received from 54 States,2 three<b> </b>United 
Nations agencies (the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations 
Population Fund (UNFPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO)), five<b> </b>national 
human rights institutions,3 the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, and 14<b> </b>civil society organizations.4

</p>
<p><b> II. A human rights-based approach to maternal mortality and 
morbidity  
</b></p>
<p>2. In its resolution 11/8, the Human Rights Council called on States to integrate a 
human rights perspective into their initiatives to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity. 
Other instruments requesting such an approach to address maternal mortality and morbidity 
over the past year include resolution 24/5 of the Commission on the Status of Women on 
eliminating preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and the empowerment of women; 
the report of the Secretary-General entitled &#8220;Keeping the promise: a forward-looking 
review to promote an agreed action agenda to achieve the Millennium Development Goals 
by 2015&#8221; (A/64/665) and the Global Strategy for Women and Children&#8217;s Health.  
</p>

mortality and morbidity was laid out thoroughly by the treaty bodies, other international

<p>experts and regional bodies, and summarized in the OHCHR report on preventable maternal 
mortality and morbidity and human rights (A/HRC/14/39). State obligations are 
underpinned by seven specific human rights principles: equality and non-discrimination, 
participation, empowerment, transparency, sustainability, international cooperation and 
accountability. Giving effect to these principles is at the core of a human rights-based 
approach to the elimination of maternal mortality and morbidity and to achieve Millennium 
Development Goal 5 on maternal health.  
</p>
<p>4. International human rights treaties and their interpretation by human rights bodies 
have made clear that many of the obligations that States must undertake to prevent maternal 
mortality and morbidity are not subject to progressive realization but are of immediate 
effect.5 The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognizes 
that the Covenant also imposes certain core obligations; the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, in its general comment no. 14, emphasized that a State party 
could not, under any circumstances whatsoever, justify its non-compliance with the core 
obligations, which are non-derogable. In the same comment, the Committee stated that the 
provision of maternal health services is a core obligation: States have the immediate 
obligation to take deliberate, concrete and targeted steps towards fulfilling the right to 
health in the context of pregnancy and childbirth. In its general recommendation, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women emphasized that States are 
required to ensure services for maternal health and equality in access to health services: 
denying services that only women need is a form of discrimination. Moreover, the right to 
life and other civil and political rights, and the right to non-discrimination, are not subject 
to progressive realization.6  
</p>
<p><b> III. Common features of good and effective practices to reduce 
maternal mortality and morbidity using a human rights-
based approach 
</b></p>
<p>5. The current rate of global decline is insufficient to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goal target of reducing maternal mortality ratios by three quarters between 
1990 and 2015.7 Good and effective practices to eliminate mortality and morbidity using a 
human rights-based approach may be complex and specific to the local situation, but, an 
analysis of all responses to the note verbale sent by OHCHR reveal that they share five 
features:  
</p>
<p>(a) Broad social and legal changes to enhance women&#8217;s status by promoting 
gender equality and eliminating harmful practices;  
</p>
<p>(b) Increasing access to contraception and family planning to enable women and 
adolescent girls to make decisions regarding their sexuality and fertility, including 
delaying and limiting childbearing and preventing sexually-transmitted infections,  
including HIV/AIDS, supported by access to education on sexuality and sexual and 
reproductive health;

</p>
<p><b> A. Enhancing the status of women by removing barriers to an effective 
human rights-based approach to eliminate maternal mortality and 
morbidity  
</b></p>
<p>6. Maternal mortality and morbidity is a consequence of gender inequality, 
discrimination, health inequity and a failure to guarantee women&#8217;s human rights. The slow 
progress with regard to Millennium Development Goal 5 is testimony to the low value 
placed on women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; lives and to their limited voice in setting public priorities. 
The inequality and discrimination suffered by women throughout their lifetimes is 
perpetuated by formal laws, policies and harmful social norms and practices. Women, 
especially young women, those living in poverty, and/or socially marginalized women, are 
often unable to have access to care because of harmful, stigmatizing or discriminatory laws 
and practices. Consequently, many women and adolescent girls cannot obtain the full range 
of sexual and reproductive health services and information to which they are entitled.8 
</p>
<p>7. Poor and less educated women and girls and those living in rural areas are far less 
likely to have access to health services or to give birth in the presence of a skilled health 
worker owing to physical inaccessibility and the prohibitive costs of a birthing facility, 
restrictive abortion services, patriarchal household decision-making processes and poor 
quality and/or disrespectful care, including poor health-care provider attitudes towards 
pregnant women living with HIV. 
</p>
<p>8. The risk increases further for women facing intersecting discrimination, for 
example, on the basis of age, marital status, disability, HIV/AIDS status, women of lower 
caste or socio-economic status, living in rural areas or slum dwellings, or indigenous, 
minority, migrant, displaced or refugee women. A human rights-based approach requires 
taking measures to identify and address reasons behind specific women&#8217;s heightened 
inability to have access to adequate and timely health-care interventions and services.  
</p>
<p>9. A comprehensive human rights-based approach to maternal mortality and morbidity 
must ensure women&#8217;s equality in decision-making through a series of interventions, 
including legislative, policy and operational measures. Political commitment, enabling 
policies and the promotion of cross-sectoral linkages are needed to reduce poverty, improve 
women&#8217;s education and nutritional status, improve water and sanitation, infrastructure and 
transportation, empower women and address gender-based violence and harmful practices. 
</p>
<p>1<b>.  Early marriage 
</b></p>
<p>10. Early marriage exposes young girls to greater risk of maternal mortality and 
morbidity. According to WHO, although not all childbearing occurs within marriage, age at 
marriage is closely linked to first birth due to cultural norms and expectations, and due to 
</p>
<p>  
8 UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO, <i>Addressing the human rights dimension of preventing maternal mortality 
and morbidity: a joint report to the Human Rights Council</i>, UNICEF submission, p. 1. </p>


<p>the fact that contraception is less commonly used to delay first births than it is to delay later 
births.&#8221;9 
</p>
<p>11. Pregnancy-related complications are the main cause of death for young women, with 
girls being twice as likely to die from childbirth as women in their twenties.10 The average 
age of obstetric fistula patients is below 25 years old, with many as young as 13 or 14 
years.11  
</p>
<p>12. Marriage often entails an expectation to start a family. A woman&#8217;s right to choose if, 
when and whom to marry is a fundamental human right, secured under a number of 
international human rights instruments. According to the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, the minimum age of marriage should be 18 years, an idea 
supported by other treaty bodies.12 While most countries claim that national laws comply, 
however, customs and tradition in reality do not, and laws on minimum age of marriage are 
not enforced.  
</p>
<p>13. Reflecting the correlation between early pregnancy and risk, a human rights-based 
approach involves promoting secondary school education, preventing early marriage by 
enforcing a set minimum legal age of marriage of at least 18 years, and delaying first births 
by postponing the onset of sexual activity and by using effective methods of contraception.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Inadequate nutrition 
</b></p>
<p>14. Inadequate nutrition can greatly increase the risks of preventable maternal mortality 
and morbidity.<b>13</b> In many countries, women and girls are greatly affected by lack of food, 
and family feeding patterns often leave women and girls last to be fed. Malnourishment 
hinders their pelvic growth, leading to obstructed labour, causing maternal mortality and 
obstetric fistula. A human rights-based approach requires States to address any traditional 
practice not allowing women to eat until men are fully fed,14 and requires States to respect, 
protect and promote the right of women and girls to nutritional well-being.15  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>15. Violence against women and girls is a consistent barrier to good maternal health 
outcomes. Violence during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, 
stillbirth, abortion and low birth weight.16 A human rights-based approach requires States to 
eliminate such violence and to provide training to recognize its signs using appropriate 
approaches for treatment and counselling, and involving communities.

<p><b>  4. Female genital mutilation 
</b></p>
<p>16. Female genital mutilation and cutting is a form of violence against women and a 
violation of women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; rights. Girls and women who have undergone such 
mutilation experience a higher prevalence of infections, psychological and psychosexual 
trauma, infertility and obstetric complications,17 which lead to an increased need for 
emergency obstetric care. A human rights-based approach advocates for the eradication of 
this harmful practice with strong support from international and regional human rights 
treaties and consensus documents.18  
</p>
<p><b> B. Sexual and reproductive health rights  
</b></p>
<p>17. The International Conference on Population and Development recognized 
reproductive rights as fundamental human rights and held contraceptive information and 
services to be essential for ensuring reproductive health and rights.19 These rights are 
grounded in the right to life, the right to the highest attainable standard of health,20 the right 
to decide the number and spacing of one&#8217;s children,21 the right to privacy,22 the right to 
information23 and the right to equality and non-discrimination.24 Guaranteeing access to 
available, acceptable and good-quality contraceptive information and services free from 
coercion, discrimination and violence is critical for achieving gender equality and ensuring 
that women can participate as full members of society. 
</p>
<p>18. To achieve gender equality and non-discrimination, States are obligated to ensure 
that their laws, policies and practices meaningfully address the specific needs of women, 
including an obligation to ensure women&#8217;s access to sexual and reproductive health 
information and services.25  
</p>
<p>19. Governments are obligated to take affirmative steps to ensure access to the full range 
of contraceptive methods by removing legal, financial, informational and other barriers.26

<p>Restrictions on access to certain contraceptive methods and coercive family planning 
policies impair the ability of women to make informed, autonomous decisions and to 
determine the number, spacing and timing of their children. 
</p>
<p>20. Many barriers prevent young people, married and unmarried, from obtaining 
contraception and having access to services, including HIV prevention, denial that young 
people may be sexually active, requirements of parental or spousal consent, cost and 
location of services, and lack of privacy and confidentiality. The Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, in its general comment No. 4, found that the realization of the right to health 
of adolescents was dependent on the development of youth-sensitive health care that 
respects confidentiality and privacy and includes appropriate sexual and reproductive health 
services. 
</p>
<p><b>     C.  Strengthening health systems to increase access to and use of skilled 
care 
</b></p>
<p>21. While many factors contribute to maternal deaths and disabilities, one of the most 
effective means of preventing them is to improve health systems and primary health care to 
ensure the availability of skilled attendance at all levels and access to 24-hour emergency 
obstetric care. Most maternal deaths and disabilities could have been prevented had the 
women been assisted by a health-care professional with the necessary skills, equipment and 
medicines to prevent and manage complications. 
</p>
<p>22. Interventions have traditionally been neglected in favour of increasing the supply of 
skilled birth attendants, whereas a human rights-based approach to reduce maternal 
mortality and morbidity recognizes that the availability of services alone is insufficient; 
they must also be accessible and affordable to all, of high quality, and should be provided 
in a way that is both culturally acceptable and responsive to women&#8217;s needs. Overcoming 
such obstacles necessitates a human rights-based approach, as it requires creating an 
environment that is conducive the empowerment of women to demand these rights. 
Families and communities need to be able to recognize when complications arise and be 
able to take action. 
</p>
<p>23. A functioning health system requires adequate supplies, equipment and 
infrastructure, as well as an efficient and effective system of communication, referral and 
transport. The strengthening of these systems, however costly, is beneficial to all citizens, 
not just women, thereby illustrating the interlinkages among development, human rights 
and public health.  
</p>
<p>24. According to the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to health gives rise to 
a responsibility of international assistance and cooperation on developed States to assist 
developing States to realize the right to health. Developed States should support developing 
States efforts&#8217; to reduce maternal mortality. This responsibility is reflected in Millennium 
Development Goal 8, which is a commitment to develop a global partnership for 
development,27 and is further articulated in the Global Strategy for Women&#8217;s and 
Children&#8217;s Health. Accountability thus begins with State obligations, but the global 
community also has a responsibility to provide international cooperation and assistance to 
strengthen health systems. 
</p>
<p>  
27 A/61/338, para. 19. </p>


<p><b> D. Addressing unsafe abortion  
</b></p>
<p>25. In his Global Strategy for Women&#8217;s and Children&#8217;s Health, the Secretary-General 
pointed out that unsafe abortion accounts for one out of every eight maternal deaths;<b> </b>in a 
statement made on 14 June 2010, the High Commissioner declared that States had 
obligations to address unsafe abortion. Unsafe abortion is one of the five major causes of 
maternal deaths.28 Each year, there are around 47,000 deaths and between 5 and 8.5 million 
women with temporary or permanent disability or injury due to complications.29  
</p>
<p>26. On the basis of existing international law, several human rights bodies have called 
on Governments to review and amend restrictive abortion laws.30 In its general 
recommendation 24 on women and health, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women emphasized that the barriers to women&#8217;s access to 
appropriate health care include laws that criminalize medical procedures only needed by 
women and that punish women who undergo those procedures, and recommended that 
legislation criminalizing abortion should be amended in order to withdraw punitive 
provisions imposed on women who undergo abortion. Similarly, other human rights treaty 
bodies have declared restrictive abortion laws and failure to ensure access to abortion when 
it is legal incompatible with international human rights law and amounting to violations of, 
inter alia, the rights to life and health and the principle of non-discrimination arising from 
the denial of access to safe and legal abortion and post-abortion care, with a discriminatory, 
disproportionate impact of restrictive abortion laws on poor, rural women.31 The denial of 
safe abortion or the penalization of abortion have also been deemed to, in certain 
circumstances, constitute a violation of the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman 
and degrading treatment.32  
</p>
<p>27. According to WHO, the degree of legal access to abortion co-determines the 
frequency and related mortality of unsafe abortions, and evidence shows that women who 
seek abortion do so regardless of legal restrictions. Where there are few restrictions on the 
availability of safe abortion, deaths and injuries are significantly reduced.  
</p>
<p>28. According to the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, the absolute prohibition of abortion is an example of how State action can 
lead to violence against women and have a direct impact on maternal mortality and 
morbidity, as well as teenage suicides. Women and girls who are forced to continue with 
unwanted pregnancies commonly face re-victimization by family and society. In cases of 
pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, women and girls often resort to unsafe and 
clandestine abortion practices, sometimes with fatal consequences. In some cases, women 
who have suffered miscarriages or have had complicated deliveries resulting in the death of 
the child have automatically been accused of homicide and penalized under criminal law.33 
</p>
<p>29. When practiced by skilled medical professionals in a safe environment, abortion 
poses very little risk to a woman&#8217;s life and health. The obligations of the State include that

<p>of ensuring that adolescent girls and women are not forced to resort to unsafe abortion.34 
Ensuring contraception and access to safe abortion and post-abortion care will reduce the 
need for women to seek unsafe abortions. In particular, access to contraceptive goods and 
services, and comprehensive, evidence-based information about them, are essential to avoid 
unwanted pregnancies but do not preclude the need for the provision of safe abortion 
services. Annually, it is estimated that 33 million unintended pregnancies occur owing to 
failures in contraceptive methods. Women who experience contraceptive failures, for 
example, need access to safe services. According to WHO, the numbers of unsafe abortions 
are likely to continue to increase unless women&#8217;s access to safe abortion and contraception  
are put in place and strengthened.35 Regardless of the legality of abortion, humane post-
abortion services must be provided, including guidance on contraceptive methods to avoid 
unwanted pregnancies.  
</p>
<p>30. A human rights-based approach implies that States must take steps to eliminate such 
barriers to the provision of abortion services and that lead women to resort to unsafe 
abortions, including eliminating unacceptable delays in providing medical attention; the 
existence of laws that require health personnel to report women who undergo abortion; and 
requirements for third-party consent for a woman to obtain abortion, even when her life is 
in danger. They must organize health services so that the exercise of conscientious 
objection by health professionals does not prevent women from obtaining access to health 
services. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Improved monitoring and evaluation 
</b></p>
<p>31. Accountability is at the core of the enjoyment of all human rights, and has two main 
components: (a) addressing past grievances; and (b) correcting systematic failure to prevent 
future violations. Accountability determines what is working (so it can be repeated) and 
what is not (so it can be adjusted).36 The absence of human rights-based accountability 
mechanisms for maternal deaths and disability caused by health system failures, socio-
economic disparities and discriminatory social practices is a major impediment to reducing 
maternal mortality and morbidity.  
</p>
<p>32. When States implement a national public health strategy and plan of action, they 
should also develop appropriate indicators to monitor progress made, and to highlight 
where policy adjustments may be needed.37 Monitoring helps States to understand the 
problems and shortcomings encountered in realizing rights, providing them with the 
framework within which more appropriate policies can be devised.38 States should establish 
accessible, effective, independent and transparent accountability mechanisms at the national 
level, operating in public and private sectors, constantly improving existing programmes 
and policies to ensure redress and reparations when pregnancy-related violations occur. 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur on the right to health has strongly recommended that all 
States introduce, as a matter of urgency, a comprehensive, effective registration system and 
a system of maternal death audits in order to determine why deaths occurred. Such maternal

<p>death audits should be a non-judicial review that goes beyond medical reasons to identify 
the social, economic and cultural reasons that led or contributed to the death.39 
</p>
<p>34. Accountability is the cornerstone of the Global Strategy for Women&#8217;s and 
Children&#8217;s Health, which calls on all stakeholders to support improved monitoring and 
evaluation to ensure the accountability of all actors for results. The Commission established 
to provide oversight of the Strategy proposes a &#8220;monitor-review-act&#8221; framework for 
accountability.40 In order to fulfil their human rights commitments made at the High-level 
Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals,41 States must ensure that their 
national accountability mechanisms are consistent with their human rights treaty 
obligations. Human right mechanisms such as the universal periodic review, the treaty 
bodies and regional mechanisms are crucial to a comprehensive accountability framework. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Examples  
</b></p>
<p>35. The most effective examples involve the combination of sustained efforts to address 
the underlying causes of maternal mortality and morbidity while strengthening Government 
commitments to ensuring better access to quality health care and fostering the 
empowerment of women. The examples below have produced demonstrable results at 
reducing maternal mortality and morbidity by giving effect, to varying degrees and in 
different ways, to certain principles of a human rights-based approach: equality and non-
discrimination, participation, transparency, empowerment, sustainability, accountability and 
international cooperation. These examples do not review the overall human rights situation 
in each State, especially in relation to women or girls, nor do they provide a comprehensive 
human rights evaluation of maternal mortality reduction programmes or seek to evaluate 
whether all aspects of these are consistent with a human rights-based approach. As seen 
above, standards are well developed by international human rights bodies and all States can 
improve their efforts to implement these norms and standards and to adopt an integrated 
human rights-based approach to preventable maternal mortality and morbidity. The 
examples below give effect to certain principles of such an approach, but are not cited as 
examples of a holistic and comprehensive approach to maternal mortality and morbidity. 
The fact that few examples of how the human rights principles of sustainability and 
transparency exist is evidence of how much more needs to be done. While some excellent 
examples of mechanisms have been outlined, they also demonstrate the need to incorporate 
further, through consistent and systematic efforts, other human rights principles into 
strategies if they are to be considered in line with a human rights-based approach. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Africa 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Efforts to abandon female genital mutilation and cutting  
</b></p>
<p>36. Throughout Africa, UNICEF and UNFPA have been working with Governments 
and partners to address female genital mutilation and cutting, using an approach that does 
not focus on individual behaviour but instead supports discussions and debates regarding 
the issue and human rights principles; for example, the Saleema campaign in the Sudan 
involves and mobilizes communities, religious leaders and families using mass media to 
spread its message as widely as possible. This human rights-based approach has resulted in

40 Commission on Information and Accountability for Women&#8217;s and Children&#8217;s Health, <i>Keeping 
Promises, Measuring Results: Final Report</i>, 2011. 
</p>
<p>41 See General Assembly resolution 65/1. </p>


<p>a significant rate of abandonment of mutilation and cutting at scale in a number of 
countries, including Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-
Bissau, Kenya, Senegal and Uganda.  
</p>
<p>37. The approach recognizes that mothers do not have their daughters cut with the intent 
to harm but to secure their marriage ability and the honour of the family. It also recognizes 
that the practice persists because of a social norm whereby people&#8217;s behaviours are 
conditioned by the behaviour of others and encourages communities to decide themselves 
to end the practice. Fundamental issues, including gender inequality, are raised, which lead 
to other positive results in terms of the status of women. Similar initiatives could more fully 
give effect to a human rights-based approach by understanding and appreciating the social 
dynamics behind harmful practices and empowering people to abandon them rather than 
passing a negative judgement on individuals and communities upholding these practices.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Programmes to engage men as partners in healthy sexual relationships 
</b></p>
<p>38. The International Planned Parenthood Federation implements programmes to engage 
young men in promoting gender equality through acknowledging that men can promote 
safer sexual practices and support their partner in healthy pregnancy and safe delivery. 
Such programmes have a strong influence on maternal health outcomes: young women able 
to negotiate condom use with their partner can better protect themselves against unwanted 
pregnancies, sexually-transmitted infections and HIV. Male partners who are engaged in 
these issues often provide better support during pregnancy and childbirth and are less likely 
to be violent towards women during pregnancy. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Maternal death reviews 
</b></p>
<p>39. Since 2003, UNFPA, UNICEF and WHO and other development partners have been 
supporting African ministries of health to institutionalize maternal death reviews. Five 
methods were introduced: verbal autopsy, facility-based reviews, near-miss review of 
severe morbidity, confidential enquiries into maternal deaths and criterion-based clinical 
audits.42  
</p>
<p>40. Overall, the development of national policies and guidelines for maternal death 
reviews has significantly improved, particularly in Comoros, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, 
Rwanda and Uganda. By 2010, 65 per cent of African countries reported that maternal 
deaths were reviewed and analysed.43 
</p>
<p>41. Similar initiatives to institutionalize maternal death reviews could give effect more 
fully to a human rights-based approach by involving communities in the planning, design, 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation to inform and ensure ownership of the design; 
expanding coverage from pilot to district to national scale, ensuring dissemination of the 
guidelines and programme support at the provincial and district levels; and establishing an 
active advocacy group at the national level to ensure civil society engagement and to build 
capacity. A specific budget line for the review in the health sector helps to ensure it is not 
lost among competing priorities. 
</p>
<p>42. Egypt has integrated child health and family planning programmes, upgraded 
facilities to strengthen safe motherhood programmes, combined oral rehydration 
programmes with the expansion of water and sanitation systems, and trained health-care 
workers in parallel with community outreach programmes in order to be on track to reach 
Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5.

<p>43. The National Human Rights Commission of Kenya shows the role that quasi judicial 
bodies can play in ensuring Government accountability for maternal health. The 
Commission initiated a public inquiry into reproductive health care, providing a forum for 
the discussion of reproductive health services; to identify root causes of poor quality and 
inadequate services; to establish causes for high rates of maternal mortality and to find 
practical solutions; provide victims with an opportunity to express their opinions; raise 
public awareness, promote public debate; and make recommendations.44 
</p>
<p>44. The Government of Malawi and its partners have a sector-wide approach funding 
mechanism whereby annual planning is undertaken with all stakeholders, avoiding 
duplications and reducing dependency on single donors, helping to achieve a 44 per cent 
drop in its maternal mortality rate between 1990 and 2008. 
</p>
<p>45. Community-based health surveillance assistants, employed and trained by the 
Ministry of Health, undertake outreach in communities, register pregnancies, carry out 
maternal health audits and verbal autopsies, and address young people&#8217;s sexual and 
reproductive health issues. Interventions at the community level focus on the monitoring of 
maternal deaths and promoting community participation by establishing audit committees 
and advocating local authorities (through meetings for community leaders and chiefs and 
popular theatrical performances). 
</p>
<p>46. Improved accountability has been instrumental in Rwanda. In 2008, the 
Government, with UNFPA support, adopted a strategy that includes maternal death 
reviews, using facility-based death audits, confidential enquiries into maternal deaths, and 
verbal autopsies. Delegations of local community leaders conduct investigations, which the 
Government then monitors. Reproductive health, including family planning, has been 
prioritized, and Government ministries are required to have women-centred plans of action 
and gender budgeting. The health system has been strengthened through innovative 
programmes to train and retain new health workers, and international assistance. Joint 
UNICEF/UNFPA/WHO support has increased local resource mobilization, improved 
family planning services at the community level, provided ambulances and piloting a rapid 
text message service, which has empowered community health workers in one district with 
a telephone that allows them to respond quickly.45  
</p>
<p>47. In Sierra Leone, the free health care service scheme, funded mainly by the British 
Department for International Development, aims to increase access to health care for 
230,000 pregnant women by removing user fees and graduated improvement in the quality 
of services provided.46 Food support for pregnant women is given by WFP in some clinics, 
and the Ministry of Health has nutritionists in each district to advise pregnant and lactating 
mothers. 
</p>
<p>48. UNICEF and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine are implementing an 
innovative competency-based training programme for health personnel using mannequins 
to train health professionals in just four days (rather than the usual 10). This approach is 
ideal for countries where there is an urgent need to address a lack of skills among health 
workers, where the case load may not be sufficient or the overall human resources may not 
exist to support competency-based training.

<p>49. Action Aid and Marie Stopes implement a human rights-based approach programme 
focusing on rural women, by empowering them about sexual and reproductive rights; 
training traditional birth attendants as community health workers and supporting mobile 
outreach clinics; using the media to increase awareness of the Government&#8217;s free health-
care scheme; and establishing women&#8217;s forums in local communities to be active in 
monitoring access to health services and cases of violence against women.  
</p>
<p>50. In the remote west of the United Republic of Tanzania, Pathfinder International and 
the Women&#8217;s Refugee Commission have worked to reduce maternal deaths caused by post-
partum haemorrhaging in internally displaced and refugee populations. They have 
developed an innovative model that guides stakeholders at the national, facility and 
community levels in addressing the underlying causes. This model combines community 
engagement with clinical interventions and Government advocacy. Pathfinder International 
is also pioneering new life-saving technologies, such as a non-pneumatic anti-shock 
garment that allows women to be stabilized and transported long distances, thus extending 
essential services to women in poor, rural underserved areas.  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Asia 
</b></p>
<p>51. In Bangladesh, the status of women and maternal mortality and morbidity were 
addressed at the national policy level as human rights and prioritized in 1990;47 since then, 
the role of husbands, family and community are recognized as being essential to improve 
maternal health and, as a result, strategies to improve community engagement were 
developed.48 The Community Support Systems initiative mobilizes and empowers by 
educating women and their families. They have identified several ways to decrease delays 
in getting to services that provide emergency obstetric care. Antenatal check-ups, deliveries 
by skilled birth attendants and referral for complications have increased. 
</p>
<p>52. In Tamil Nadu in southern India, there has been significant progress towards 
Millennium Development Goal 5 owing to improved literacy, reduced incidence of early 
marriage, early pregnancy and frequent pregnancies, and greater public awareness of family 
planning and good nutrition. These advances were also due to social reform and political 
commitment to improve maternal and newborn health and to establish women-centred 
health policies.49 
</p>
<p>53. The reductions in maternal mortality were achieved through a three-pronged 
strategy: (a) prevention and termination of unwanted pregnancies; (b) accessible high-
quality antenatal care and institutional childbirth, with routine essential obstetric care and 
emergency obstetric first aid at the primary level; and (c) accessible high-quality 
emergency obstetric care at the first referral level.50  
</p>
<p> 54. Quality of services was addressed through initiatives to create a more welcoming 
environment, including tours of the facility; a birth companionship programme to 
encourage women to have support during labour and childbirth; and Valaikappus 
ceremonies held in primary health centres to integrate tradition and culture into service 
provision. Community leaders and village officials were brought together to participate in 
the planning and implementation of health programmes. Finally, street theatre has been

<p>used to explore the issues of dowries, early marriage, violence against women, maternal 
mortality and morbidity and gender equality in decision-making. 
</p>
<p>55. Ensuring accountability is another important strategy used in India. Advocates in 
domestic courts have successfully drawn on constitutional and human rights law to argue 
that the State is not fulfilling its legal obligations to prevent maternal mortality and 
morbidity.51 For example, in the 2010 decision of <i>Laxmi Mandal v Deen Dayal Hari Nager 
Hospital &amp; Ors</i>, the Delhi High Court recognized a constitutionally protected right to 
maternal health care and ordered compensation for human rights violations experienced by 
two impoverished women who died during childbirth. The High Court recognized the 
State&#8217;s failure to implement various programmes to reduce maternal mortality and infant 
mortality and directed it to remedy deficiencies in, and improve monitoring of, public 
health programmes. 
</p>
<p>56.<i> Snehelata &#8220;Salenta&#8221; Singh v. The State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Ors</i> is the first known 
public interest case filed with a high court to deal with pregnancy-related morbidity. 
Salenta Singh suffered a debilitating injury after she went to a public hospital in Uttar 
Pradesh to give birth, where she was left alone while in labour. Owing to the poor quality of 
care provided, she developed an obstetric fistula. Her situation worsened when her 
condition went undiagnosed and then untreated for months. The lawsuit argues that 
pregnancy-related injury and illness resulting from medical negligence violates a woman&#8217;s 
right to live with dignity and her right to health &#8211; rights that are recognized by both the 
Constitution and international human rights treaties that India has ratified.52 These are two 
examples of legal remedies to assist in ensuring accountability for violations of human 
rights in the context of maternal mortality and morbidity. 
</p>
<p>57. Despite many efforts, the maternal mortality rate in the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic 
Republic remains high,53 and infant and maternal mortality rates among ethnic minorities 
are higher than national averages. In 2007, UNFPA supported a qualitative research study 
using the Participatory Ethnographic Evaluation and Research (PEER) approach, a 
methodology particularly suitable for gathering data from hard-to-reach, illiterate people. 
The study explored reproductive health among vulnerable ethnic communities and provided 
detailed qualitative data on risk factors relating to maternal health and barriers of access to 
service. As a result, among other initiatives, community representatives are responsible for 
providing feedback to service providers and helping to address linguistic and cultural 
misunderstandings. 
</p>
<p>58. The Vietnam Family Planning Association operates an outreach project in more than 
100 secondary schools, delivering youth-friendly services to all students who want them. 
They provide information about sex, sexual and reproductive health, counselling, 
contraception, testing for sexually-transmitted infections, and referrals. The Association 
also trains young people to deliver education to their peers. By having access to services, 
and as peer educators, young people are empowered and their knowledge improved. The 
Association&#8217;s experiences were shared with other co-organizations, helping others to refine 
their youth-friendly services and outreach initiatives.

<p>59. In Armenia, sexual and reproductive health education is included in the school 
curriculum for eighth and ninth grades as part of a healthy lifestyle course; since 2010, with 
UNFPA support, sexual and reproductive health is also integrated into tenth and eleventh 
grades. Since 2005, there has not been a single maternal death due to unsafe abortion. 
</p>
<p>60. UNFPA has provided support for the establishment of travelling gynaecologist and 
emergency obstetric care teams for hard-to-reach and poor areas,54 as barriers to health-care 
access primarily include poverty and geography, with many women experiencing 
challenges associated with cost and availability of transport. 
</p>
<p>61. In the Republic of Moldova, the &#8220;Beyond the Numbers&#8221; programme focused on 
near-miss case reviews in referral-level facilities and confidential enquiries into maternal 
death at the national level. Together with ongoing maternal death audits, this has helped 
identify the causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, including such socio-economic 
factors as migratory lifestyle and rural residency. 
</p>
<p>62.  In 2005, a strategic assessment of policies and quality of services for contraception 
and abortion care revealed disparities between institutions and service providers. Since 
2009, contraception costs are covered for women who cannot otherwise afford services, and 
national standards for safe abortion have been developed. Medication for medical abortions 
were registered in 2000 on the national list for essential medicines.

<p>63. Bolivia (Plurinational State of) has established cultural protocols for motherhood 
and newborn care, and created a model in July 2008 aimed at reinvigorating native 
indigenous rural medicine and ensuring its linkage and complementarity with Western 
medicine. It is intended to provide health services that take the person, family and the 
community into consideration by accepting, respecting, appraising and articulating 
indigenous rural people&#8217;s biomedical and traditional health knowledge. Working with local 
actors and interacting with representatives of the community is a key requirement of the 
model.55 
</p>
<p>64. In Brazil, a legislative investigation commission was created specifically to 
investigate maternal mortality. It explicitly made references to human rights principles and 
norms, international conferences and human rights treaties.56 The commission 
acknowledged that the devaluation of women in society, poverty and women&#8217;s lack of 
access to education and justice were central factors contributing to the high rate or maternal 
mortality. The commission made many recommendations, including to the Ministry of 
Health, for the establishment of maternal mortality committees and to give priority to 
family-planning programmes to prevent unsafe abortion. 
</p>
<p>65. Enhanced legal accountability was sought through the case of <i>Alyne da Silva 
Pimental v Brazil</i> filed before the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against

<p>enforcing protocols and improving care in vulnerable communities. This case, still pending, 
is the first individual communication on maternal mortality filed before a United Nations 
treaty body and is part of a strategy to ensure that rights-holders have access to international 
mechanisms when domestic remedies fail. 
</p>
<p>66. In Chile, the UNICEF guide <i>Growing together</i> was prepared, in partnership with 
local stakeholders, to assist Mapuche indigenous women during pregnancy and childbirth 
who face inequality and discrimination in their access to health care.58 The guide highlights 
Mapuche customs relating to maternal health and contains relevant information for daily 
practices for pregnant women and their families. 
</p>
<p>67. In 2008 and 2009, two non-governmental organizations partnered with health rights 
activists to develop a rights-based framework for holding the Government accountable for, 
inter alia, the high rates of maternal death and for its failure to use its resources to fulfil 
progressively the rights to reproductive health.59 The strategy aimed at (a) articulating the 
human rights obligations that should guide maternal mortality prevention efforts; (b) 
showing how the State&#8217;s maternal health interventions and fiscal policies were falling short 
of these; and (c) pushing for specific measures to bring health, budget and tax policy into 
line with human rights standards in the context of the Government&#8217;s ongoing health reforms 
and the 2010 budget process. A compelling picture of non-compliance emerged and 
detailed recommendations were made to the Government on the need for increased, 
equitable spending on maternal health. Specific budget and tax reforms, as well as 
enhancing citizen participation in the decision-making process, were also recommended.  
</p>
<p>68. The project forced institutions in Guatemala to bring a human rights-based approach 
to policy-making and monitoring. It succeeded in linking fiscal policy and preventable 
maternal mortality and morbidity and drawing the attention of United Nations treaty bodies, 
including the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Human Rights Committee. It prompted a 
commitment to increase social spending for maternal health, and to implement the 
necessary fiscal reforms to enable this. It also enabled a joint congressional and civil 
society accountability mechanism to operationalize a human rights-based approach in their 
policy monitoring role at both the national and local levels. The monitoring framework has 
also been welcomed by donors and United Nations specialized agencies in the context of 
monitoring progress on Millennium Development Goal 5.

Partnership (a tripartite agreement signed by the European Community, African, Caribbean 
and Pacific Island countries and WHO, as well as by national ministries of eight countries, 
including Haiti, to support Millennium Development Goal 5), provided payment to 50 
health institutions to offer pregnancy, childbirth and post-partum/post-natal care. Women 
are also reimbursed for their transport costs, and payments are made to traditional birth 
attendants. The system is also used to monitor performance. The project supports the 
rehabilitation of health institutions, purchase of equipment, training of providers and 
provision of supplies and essential drugs. In some areas, community members have been 
recruited and trained to support women. These community agents also serve on maternal 
mortality surveillance committees, referring women with potential complications and 
conveying feedback to hospitals. As a result, a decline in maternal deaths, a six-fold

abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Whereas adolescent and adult women 
previously sought expensive clandestine abortions in the District, today public hospitals and 
clinics provide women residing in the district with free and safe legal abortion care; women 
from other parts of the country can also receive services according to a sliding payment 
scale.60 
</p>
<p><b>  </b>71. In the 2009 case of <i>X&#225;kmok K&#225;sek Indigenous Community v Paraguay</i>, the Inter-
American Court of Human Rights found human rights violations where the absence of 
special measures to protect pregnant women contributed to the pregnancy-related deaths of 
indigenous women. The Court rebuked Paraguay for it failure to implement policies to train 
skilled birth attendants, provide pregnancy-related care and document cases of maternal 
mortality. It ordered the State to establish immediate measures to provide health care for 
pregnant women and directed it to conduct a study with community involvement, 
identifying means for adapting maternal care to community needs. The Court mandated 
broad stakeholder participation in developing policies to combat maternal death. 
</p>
<p>72. In Peru, the Vertical Childbirth Care/Delivery project supported by UNICEF aims to 
increase access to institutionalized services for indigenous pregnant women. An integrated 
strategy was developed to address the financial, geographical and cultural barriers that 
historically limited the access of rural and indigenous communities to health care.61 
Financial barriers were addressed by creating a health insurance strategy and providing 
subsidies for individuals under the age of 18, pregnant women and targeted groups of 
adults. To address geographical distances, maternal waiting homes were established and 
services were adapted to users&#8217; cultural preferences regarding childbirth. 
</p>
<p>73. Similar initiatives could give effect more fully to a human rights-based approach by 
targeting women and girls most at risk, involving indigenous local leaders, traditional care 
providers and community women&#8217;s organizations in identifying the required interventions 
to increase utilization of health services, as well as ensuring culturally appropriate care for 
indigenous communities and seeking an alternative and more acceptable model. 
</p>
<p>74. The Ombudsman of Peru also has a dedicated women&#8217;s rights unit to investigate and 
document complaints against health-care centres and hospitals for irregularities; for 
example, it has investigated violations of the right to contraceptive services free from 
coercion.62

<p><b>75. The present report has identified key interventions known to reduce maternal 
mortality and morbidity. The examples demonstrate that  interventions are more 
effective when stakeholders apply principles of a human rights-based approach to 
address the needs of the most poor and marginalized in their societies. They also 
demonstrate the need to incorporate fully, through consistent and systematic actions, 
an even more holistic and comprehensive human rights-based approach, covering all
