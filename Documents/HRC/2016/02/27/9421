I. PURPOSE AND DESCRIPTION OF THE MISSION 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping 
of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights visited 
Ukraine from 22 to 30 January 2007.  This preliminary note provides initial information 
on the visit of the Special Rapporteur.  A full report of the mission and formulated 
recommendations will be submitted subsequently to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Ukraine for its 
invitation, which can be seen as a promising sign of openness and commitment to human 
rights and environmental matters. The Special Rapporteur wishes in particular to thank 
the Ministry of Environmental Protection for having opened its doors and given him the 
possibility to meet all relevant public authorities. The objective of the visit was to 
examine the situation regarding illicit traffic in toxic and dangerous products and wastes 
and the enjoyment of human rights, namely Ukraine&#8217;s regulations and policies dealing 
with this matter as well as following up on relevant communications sent to the Special 
Rapporteur in accordance with his mandate.      
</p>
<p>3. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur had the honour to meet several senior 
government officials, including the Deputy Minister of Environment and the Deputy 
General Prosecutor. He also met with representatives from the Ministry of Justice, of the 
Ombudsman&#8217;s Office and members of the Committee on Ecological Policy of the 
Verkhovna Rada (Parliament). At the regional level the Special Rapporteur met the 
Governor of Lviv Oblast and the Deputy Head of the Regional Administration of 
Zakarpattya. In these regions he also met representatives from regional departments of 
environmental protection, district and municipal officials and local parliamentarians.  The 
Special Rapporteur also held meetings with civil society, non-governmental 
organizations, academics and researchers.  The Special Rapporteur visited a number of 
sites where toxic and dangerous products are stored, including functioning and 
abandoned industrial sites, as well as some villages. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>II. OBSERVATIONS AND PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur noted that there exists in Ukraine at all levels of 
Government and civil society a recognition of the urgent problem posed by the 
accumulation of toxic and dangerous products and wastes. Many of the interlocutors he 
met seemed motivated and willing to try to find solutions to some of the problems.  There 
is agreement amongst the interlocutors with whom the Special Rapporteur met that some 
of the main environmental challenges faced by Ukraine result from the presence of 
significant quantities of toxic and dangerous products and wastes, which are the 
consequence notably of the large industrial sector developed in a previous era. A large 
number of these facilities have become obsolete or were abandoned during the 1990s. 
Another important environmental problem is that of obsolete pesticides. Ukraine having 
an important agricultural activity, huge quantities (close to 20,000 tons) of obsolete  </p>

<p>A/HRC/5/5/Add.1 
Page 3 
</p>
<p>pesticides are present all over the territory. Although some of theses pesticides are stored 
in some 110 centralized storage warehouses, the main problem lies with the several 
thousand privately owed storage sites, of which a large number do not offer adequate 
storage facilities which could pose significant health risks. The Special Rapporteur was 
made aware that funding and availability of adequate technologies were the main 
challenges in solving the overall problem of accumulation of toxic and dangerous 
products and wastes.   
</p>
<p>5. Following up on communications received the Special Rapporteur examined in 
more details the issue of illicit import of toxic wastes into Ukraine, with a particular focus 
on the case of two products, &#8220;premix&#8221; in Zakarpattya and acid tars in the Lviv region. 
These two cases underline the importance of adequate border controls of shipments of 
raw materials and the requirement for importers to declare the exact composition of raw 
materials being imported. The Special Rapporteur believes that existing regulations on 
this matter might need to be reinforced and strictly implemented. Despite legislation 
banning the import of toxic waste, the Special Rapporteur believes that these two cases 
are not the only cases of illicit transfer of toxic wastes and that this remains an ongoing 
problem. It is important that Ukraine implement all necessary measures in order to put an 
end to further imports, which would only worsen the existing problem.  
</p>
<p>6. Although the Special Rapporteur recognizes that in many cases of illicit transfer of 
toxic wastes the ultimate responsibility lies with the corporations involved, in urgent 
cases, action by the authorities might be required. This does not exclude that the 
authorities seek compensation from these corporations through legal action. This is the 
case namely of the acid tars which were dumped in an abandoned quarry of the State 
enterprise &#8220;Sirka&#8221; in the Lviv region. The Special Rapporteur recommends, in order to 
avoid the potential pollution of the waters of the Dniester, that the authorities take action 
to remove the acid tars and dispose of them in an environmentally sound manner before 
the water that fills the quarry reaches the acid tars. 
</p>
<p>7. In the course of his visit the Special Rapporteur specifically tried to look into the 
adverse consequences of the illicit movement and dumping of these products on the 
human rights of the local population. In the two cases, he examined in more details the 
Special Rapporteur was informed by health officials that no adverse effects on the health 
of the local population had been observed. However, he was not able to obtain more 
detailed information concerning the monitoring of the health impact on the local 
population. The Special Rapporteur believes that, in cases of alleged illicit dumping of 
toxic or dangerous products and wastes, the sanitary authorities should monitor the health 
of the local population in a stringent manner. The Special Rapporteur realizes that it is 
difficult to establish scientifically conclusive links between the toxic wastes and health 
problems of the affected population. However, past experiences have shown that products 
with identical levels of toxicity can be presumed to have adverse health effects. For this 
reason, the Special Rapporteur believes that the precautionary principle should guide the 
response of the authorities, even if the complete scientific results are not yet conclusive.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur was informed of legislation protecting the right to 
information concerning the environment. In the case of nuclear waste the law provides  </p>

<p>A/HRC/5/5/Add.1 
Page 4 
for public participation in decision-making through a referendum. He also noted the high 
level of public awareness on this matter. In contrast, in the particular cases of premix, 
acid tars and obsolete pesticides, the public may not have received sufficient information 
that would have allowed the local population to take appropriate preventive measures. 
Access to information regarding environmental issues and their potential consequences 
for human rights thus appears to require some improvement. Furthermore, the Special 
Rapporteur believes that providing full information on these issues will contribute to 
further improving the existing trust and understanding between the Government and civil 
society on environmental issues.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur notes that there exists an adequate legal framework to deal 
with the particular issue of the import of toxic and dangerous products and wastes. The 
Special Rapporteur was informed of discrepancies between Ukrainian and European 
legislation in the areas of waste management, namely differences in the lists of products 
qualified as wastes. There are indications that the proximity of the European Union and 
the existence of these discrepancies may lead to some exports of dangerous products and 
wastes towards Ukraine. The Special Rapporteur was informed that legislative 
developments are planned to make this framework regulating waste management and 
environmental protection even more stringent, to improve access to information in these 
matters and to implement environmental awareness programmes.  The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes the work of both the Government and Parliament in this area. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur believes that, even with a very well developed legal 
framework, proper enforcement is essential to limit instances of illicit movements and 
dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes. During his visit the Special 
Rapporteur has had an excellent impression of the work of the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in the 
particular area of environmental crimes. In particular, he finds it encouraging that the 
Office has established a specialized branch in this area. The Special Rapporteur notes, 
however, that investigations, at least in the cases he examined, were very long, which 
could be detrimental to the affected populations, as often little or no remedial action is 
taken whilst investigations are ongoing. Although he realizes that the complexity of such 
cases requires time, the Special Rapporteur believes that, if provided with more funding 
and improved training, the Office could deal with these in a more timely fashion. This 
would lead to a better protection of the human rights of the affected populations as well 
as a greater accountability of corporations and individuals involved in the illicit 
movement and dumping.   
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur will elaborate a full report of his mission for subsequent 
presentation to the Human Rights Council.  This report will also include his final 
recommendations.
