<p><i> Guided also </i>by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted on 25 June

 2 See A/CONF.177/20/Rev.1, chap. I. 
 3 See A/CONF.189/12 and Corr.1, chap. I. 
</p>

<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>the challenges still faced by all countries throughout the world to 
overcome inequality between men and women, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly 
entitled &#8220;Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first 
century&#8221;, the declaration adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women at its forty-
ninth session and the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2000/13 of 17 April 2000, 
2001/34 of 23 April 2001 and 2003/22 of 22 April 2003, as well as Council resolution 6/30 
of 14 December 2007 on integrating the human rights of women throughout the United 
Nations system and Council resolution 12/17 of 2 October 2009 on the elimination of 
discrimination against women,  
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>that international human rights treaties, including the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender and include guarantees 
to ensure the enjoyment by women and men, and girls and boys, of their civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights on a basis of equality, 
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>Deeply concerned</i> by the fact that women everywhere are still subject to significant 
disadvantage as the result of discriminatory laws and practices and that de jure and de facto 
equality has not been achieved in any country in the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that women, in particular those belonging to vulnerable groups, face 
multiple forms of discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating </i>the need to intensify efforts to eliminate all forms of discrimination 
against women throughout the world, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing </i>that the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of life is 
essential for the full and complete economic and social development of a country, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also</i> that the elimination of discrimination against women, in law and in 
practice, is primarily the responsibility of States, and that the United Nations human rights 
system plays an important role in contributing to these efforts,  
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful </i>of the fact that the elimination of discrimination against women requires the 
consideration of women&#8217;s specific socio-economic context, and recognizing that laws, 
policies, customs and traditions that restrict women&#8217;s equal access to full participation in 
development processes and public and political life are discriminatory and may contribute 
to the feminization of poverty, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>its resolution 5/1 on institution-building of the Council and resolution 5/2 
on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the Council, of 18 June 
2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her duties in accordance 
with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms </i>the obligation of States to take all appropriate measures to 
eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organization or enterprise; 
</p>
<p> 2<i>. Welcomes </i>the commitments made by the international community to fully 
implement the Millennium Development Goals, and stresses, in that context, the resolve of 
Heads of State to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women as effective 
ways to combat poverty, hunger and disease and to stimulate development that is truly 
sustainable; </p>


<p> 3. <i>Also welcomes </i>the efforts made by States around the world to reform their 
legal systems in order to remove obstacles to women&#8217;s full and effective enjoyment of their 
human rights; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses concern </i>at the fact that, despite the pledge made at the Fourth 
World Conference on Women and the review conducted by the General Assembly at its 
twenty-third special session to modify or abolish remaining laws that discriminate against 
women and girls, many of these laws are still in force and continue to be applied, thereby 
preventing women and girls from enjoying the full realization of their human rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon </i>States to fulfil their international obligations and commitments to 
revoke any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex and remove gender bias in 
the administration of justice, taking into account the fact that those laws violate the human 
right of women to be protected against discrimination; 
</p>
<p> 6<i>. Recognizes </i>that women&#8217;s inequality before the law has resulted in the lack of 
equal opportunities for women in education, access to health, economic participation and 
access to labour markets and disparities in, inter alia, salaries and compensation, public and 
political participation, access to decision-making processes, inheritance, ownership of land, 
financial services, including loans, and nationality and legal capacity, as well as increased 
vulnerability to discrimination and violence, and that all countries face challenges in these 
areas; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Acknowledges </i>the work undertaken by the Commission on the Status of 
Women, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Special 
Rapporteurs of the Council on violence against women, its causes and consequences, on 
trafficking in persons, especially in women and children, and on contemporary forms of 
slavery and other relevant United Nations bodies, agencies and mechanisms to eliminate 
discrimination in law and in practice throughout the world; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Emphasizes </i>the significant role that women play in economic development 
and in the eradication of poverty, and stresses the need for promoting equal pay for equal 
work or work of equal value and for promoting the recognition of the value of women&#8217;s 
unremunerated work, as well as for developing and promoting policies that facilitate the 
reconciliation of employment and family responsibilities; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure full representation and full and equal 
participation of women in political, social and economic decision-making as an essential 
condition for gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and a critical factor 
in the eradication of poverty; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Welcomes</i>,  in particular, the work undertaken by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women on women&#8217;s equality before the law; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recognizes </i>the important role played by the Council in addressing the issue 
of discrimination against women, both in law and in practice; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Welcomes </i>the convening of a panel on equality before the law during the 
eleventh session of the Council; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Notes </i>that, although human rights treaty bodies and special procedures do, to 
some extent, address discrimination against women within their mandates, their attention to 
such discrimination is not systematic; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Also notes </i>the work undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue; </p>


<p> 15. <i>Welcomes</i> the thematic study on discrimination against women, in law and in 
practice, and on how the issue is addressed throughout the United Nations human rights 
system, prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner;<footnote name="4">A/HRC/15/40. </footnote>  
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Also welcomes</i> the half-day panel discussion on discrimination against 
women in law and in practice;  
</p>
<p><b> </b>17. <i>Calls upon</i> States to pay particular attention to discrimination against women 
in situations of vulnerability, such as migrant women, women with disabilities, women 
belonging to minorities and women facing multiple forms of discrimination; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Decides</i> to appoint, for a period of three years, an independent expert on the 
issue of human rights commitments related to the discrimination against women based on 
law, whose tasks will be: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To develop a dialogue with Governments, including parliamentarians and the 
judiciary, the relevant United Nations entities, national human rights institutions and civil 
society organizations to identify, promote and exchange views on best practices related to 
the elimination of legislation that discriminates against women or is discriminatory to 
women in terms of implementation or impact and, in that regard, to prepare a compendium 
of best practices; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To undertake a study, in cooperation with and reflecting the views of 
Governments and relevant United Nations entities, national human rights institutions and 
civil society organizations, on the ways and means in which the mandate holder can 
cooperate with States to fulfil their commitments to eliminate discrimination against 
women in law and in practice; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To make recommendations on the improvement of legislation and the 
implementation of the law, to contribute to the realization of the Millennium Development 
Goals, in particular goal 3 on the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of 
women; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) To work in close coordination with other special procedures and subsidiary 
organs of the Council, relevant United Nations entities, in particular UN Women, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and other treaty bodies, 
and to take all measures necessary to avoid unnecessary duplication with those 
mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) To take into account the views of other stakeholders, including relevant 
regional human rights mechanisms, national human rights institutions and civil society 
organizations;  
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) To submit an annual report to the Council, starting at its eighteenth session, 
on laws that discriminate against women or are discriminatory to women in terms of 
implementation or impact, and on good practices in eliminating such laws, drawing upon 
the findings of the United Nations human rights machinery and the broader United Nations 
system; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to cooperate with and assist the independent expert in 
his or her task, to supply all necessary information requested by him or her and to give 
serious consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the independent expert to 
visit their countries, to enable him or her to fulfil his or her mandate effectively; 
</p>

<p> 20. <i>Invites</i> relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, treaty 
bodies and civil society actors, including non-governmental organizations, as well as the 
private sector, to cooperate fully with the independent expert in the fulfilment of his or her 
mandate; 
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Decides </i>to continue consideration of this question in conformity with the 
annual programme of work of the Council.
