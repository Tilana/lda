WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016
1
Chairman and 
CEOs’ Review
Welcome to the WorleyParsons Annual Report for financial year 2016.
We made substantial progress during the year on our near-term priorities including 
improving our level of customer satisfaction, reducing internal costs, streamlining our 
service delivery and strengthening our balance sheet.
Our cost reduction program lowered overheads by $170 million 
when compared to the prior year. By the end of June we have 
achieved annualized cost reductions of $200 million, 
exceeding our target of $120 million. These savings reduced 
the impact of lower revenues on our underlying EBIT margin.
Our customers continue to face difficult market conditions. 
The ongoing weakness in commodity prices has led to further 
declines in capital expenditure across the resources and 
energy sectors. 
Importantly in this environment, our customer feedback results 
are the best we have ever achieved, validating the action we 
have taken over the last 12 months including the realignment 
of the business into the four business lines of Services, Major 
Projects, Improve and Advisian.  While significant progress has 
been made, continuing to adapt and innovate will be a 
necessary and integral part of doing business. The Company is 
now leaner and better able to meet the challenges in 
the market.
In order to improve our service delivery, specific offerings were 
developed to deliver further value to WorleyParsons’ 
customers. We launched the Advisian business line, integrated 
the Breakthrough Project Delivery model into the Project 
Management Consulting (PMC) offering and accelerated work 
process transfers to the Global Delivery Centers (GDC). 
We closed 30 offices with an associated floor space reduction 
of 73,000 square meters. We maintain a presence in 
42 countries. In addition, we finalized the sale of Exmouth
2  WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016
power station and we identified non-core assets to be held for 
sale including the South African public infrastructure business 
and the Company’s interest in Cegertec WorleyParsons 
in Quebec.
We have made progress in strengthening our balance sheet.  
Efforts to date have achieved an improvement in day sales 
outstanding by 4 days, with more than half our locations 
showing improvement from December to June.  However, we 
still have more to do if we are to achieve our target of industry 
average of 65 days. Cash outflows were reduced by 
approximately $255 million through a combination of lower 
capital expenditure, reduced capital spending on acquisitions 
and no interim dividend.
While we are making progress towards our near term goals, 
and in most cases exceeding our own targets, we still have 
considerably more to do. Our management and organization as 
a whole remain focused on doing what is necessary to align 
our business with the prevailing marketing conditions, while 
also looking for opportunities where we can grow into the long 
term sustainable markets of the future.
Realize our future
At the core of the longer term sustainability of the business 
are the five strategic themes we introduced during financial 
year 2015, focused on defending and growing our business 
through the development of enhanced capabilities and 
offerings.  With our local operations, the objective is to free 
them up to focus on excellence in delivery so they are able to 
make the most out of the opportunities in their markets. Refer 
to pages 10 and 11 of this Annual Report to read more on our 
journey to Realize Our Future.
The Company continues to defend and strengthen its 
leadership position in upstream oil and gas.  We continue to 
expand our capability in the growing sub sectors of chemicals, 
power and water. Key focus areas are the development of the 
Company’s emerging digital and new energy capabilities. 
Geographically, Saudi Arabia and China’s “One Belt, One Road” 
initiative continue to represent significant opportunities for 
the Company.
Financial performance
The Group reported an improved statutory result with net 
profit after tax of $23.5 million (NPAT) after last financial 
year’s statutory loss of $54.9 million. The underlying net profit 
after tax of $153.1 million (excluding $129.6 million of one off 
costs) was down 37% on our restated financial year 2015 
underlying result of $243.1 million. The Group delivered a 
positive operating cash flow of $192.0 million, with cash 
conversion at 125% of underlying NPAT compared with 103% 
in the prior year. Our gearing was 29.2% and remains within 
our target range. Our net debt to EBITDA is 2.4 times. The 
Board has resolved not to pay a final dividend for financial year 
2016 as the Company focuses on its balance sheet.
Health, Safety and Environment (HSE)
We are committed to our vision of Zero Harm to people and 
assets and zero environmental incidents. This year, our Total 
Recordable Case Frequency Rate (per 200,000 manhours) 
reduced to 0.07 from 0.12. Notwithstanding this improvement, 
we are deeply saddened to report four fatal incidents involving 
our contractors. Three individuals lost their lives in vehicle 
related accidents in Turkey and another person was fatally 
injured while working at height in Saudi Arabia. Vehicle 
operation and working at heights remain the greatest risks to 
the safety of our employees and contractors. These will 
continue to be focus areas for the business. 
People
It has been a difficult year for our people, as we adapted to the 
changing needs of our customers and the dynamics of our 
markets. This year we reduced the workforce by a further 
6,900 to its current level of 24,500. We have made, and will 
continue to make, tough decisions that balance the 
requirements to maintain capability and local presence to 
support our customers, with the longer term interests of our 
shareholders.
Both the Board and Group Leadership Team would like to 
express their appreciation for the commitment and 
contribution of our people to WorleyParsons during what has 
been an extremely trying year.

Board changes
After joining the Board on 1 July 2015, Jagjeet (Jeet) Bindra 
assumed the role of Remuneration Committee Chairman 
following the 2015 Annual General Meeting. Jeet succeeds 
John Green who held the position of Remuneration Committee 
Chairman since 2008. We thank John for his strong guidance 
and leadership.
Ethics and corporate responsibility
We recognize that WorleyParsons’ reputation for honesty, 
integrity and ethical dealings is one of its key business assets 
and a critical factor in ensuring the Company’s ongoing 
success. All of WorleyParsons’ people and our agents, are 
required to maintain the standard of ethical behavior outlined 
in our Code of Conduct and as expected by our customers, 
suppliers and shareholders.
The Company fulfills its corporate responsibilities across all the 
parts of the world where we do business. We ensure that our 
programs are as effective and efficient as possible in 
delivering value to the communities we support. The 
Australian Council of Superannuation Investors awarded 
WorleyParsons the rating of “Leading” in corporate 
responsibility reporting practices.  We also received the award 
for “Best Improvement in Climate Disclosure at the Australian 
Climate Leadership Forum”. 
This year, we also launched the Group’s Diversity and Inclusion 
Expectations supported by local campaigns and unconscious 
bias training. The Corporate Responsibility section of this 
Annual Report provides detail of these activities.
Corporate governance
The Board remains confident that the Company has in place a 
strong corporate governance system, and that this system is 
well maintained, reviewed and updated. The Group maintains a 
comprehensive, independent, internal audit program that 
reports directly to the Audit and Risk Committee. This function 
not only focuses on specific areas of interest, but provides 
assurance annually to the Audit and Risk Committee on the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls.
The Corporate Governance Statement 2016 can be found on 
the Company’s website. 
Conclusion
We would like to thank the directors, the Group Leadership 
Team, and our people for their contribution in what has been 
another difficult year in our markets and organization. We 
would like to thank our shareholders for their continuing 
support and look forward to realizing the future of 
WorleyParsons together.

Realize Our Future
During financial year 2015, we unveiled our strategy to return the Company to growth. As 
the resources and energy sectors undergo significant transformation driven by prolonged low 
commodity prices, WorleyParsons continues to transform to respond and reposition the business for 
future success.
The five strategic themes, first introduced in financial year 2015, remain the platform for 
transformation of the business.
01  Build a world class consulting business and dominate the
early project phases
We established the Advisian business line just one year ago to 
pursue the white space of management consulting advice based 
on deep technical knowledge. Advisian remains a core element of 
our strategy as the global vehicle to help our customers meet the 
complex challenges they face in the resources and energy sectors.
Customer
02    Be the global PMC
provider of choice
We continue to expand 
our PMC offering with the 
promotion and application 
of the Breakthrough 
Project Delivery Model.
05    Use Global Delivery
Centers to apply digital 
technology to the delivery 
of future services
Through financial year 2016, we 
focused on standardization and 
simplification of processes 
including the transitioning of two 
processes to the Global Delivery 
Centers. The GDC currently offers 
each of our offices the 
opportunity to be competitive 
though the incorporation of

Where we are heading
Today, the revenue of the business is 
concentrated in the hydrocarbons 
sector and the provision of 
engineering services. We are 
deploying traditional go–to–market 
strategies, payment models and 
service delivery methods. Our 
ambition is to transform the 
business by:
•   growing our exposure to selected
attractive markets while defending 
our position in hydrocarbons
•   offering a range of solutions that
increase our market share
•   having a differentiated
digital capability
•   deploying our global capabilities,
including increased use of our 
Global Delivery Centers.
In addition, we will have evolved our go–to–market strategies 
to more solution based selling with commercial models more 
focused on the value delivered.
Enhancing our exposure to growth
The current priorities for financial year 2017 are to defend and 
strengthen our leadership position in onshore conventional, 
offshore and heavy oil and oil sands. We see opportunities to 
expand into the attractive sub sectors of chemicals and new 
energy or renewables and the prospective geography of Saudi 
Arabia, across all sectors. A key focus will be the development 
of our digital capability across all service offerings.
In the near term, we see opportunities in the power sector, 
supporting investments aligned to China’s One Belt One Road 
regional development plan and industrial water. 
Reducing our costs and strengthening the balance sheet
In February 2016, we announced targets to reduce our internal 
costs by $300 million, with initiatives to deliver the first 
$120 million in annualized benefits already in place. During 
financial year 2016 we exceeded our target of cost reductions 
and reduced our annualized overhead costs by $200 million.
We identified initiatives to generate the further $150 million in 
annualized benefits from the current baseline through a 
combination of cost reduction and revenue improvement 
initiatives. A structured program is in place with actions

underway in a wide range of areas across the business 
including: restructuring our support functions and general 
management, improving our resource utilization, increasing 
utilization of our GDC, assessing remuneration against local 
markets and adjusting where appropriate, rationalizing office 
space utilization, exiting unprofitable or non-strategic 
locations, aggressive management of our spend with third 
parties, review of underperforming projects to improve margins 
and a restructure of the information technology platform and 
support organization.
 We restructured business development into a global sales and 
marketing group with an acute focus on leveraging our global 
scale and capability more effectively with a more aggressive 
pursuit in our current markets and the growth markets of 
tomorrow. The combination of structure, focus and reduced 
costs is expected to increase our market share.
We also announced our commitment to strengthen the balance 
sheet by targeting an improvement in cash position by 
$300 million. Through a focused short term effort across the 
Group, we have reduced our net debt by $115 million and 
reduced our day sales outstanding to 78 days. By implementing 
a number of system and process changes into the business, we 
expect to continue our performance improvement towards 
industry average of 65 days.

communities through local employment and corporate responsibility 
projects. Contributing to the success of these projects have been the 
Group’s overarching support and the willingness of our personnel to 
volunteer their time and make donations in support of their local

expectations related to supplier selection processes and ethical conduct. 
The Group sees this as an opportunity to lead our contractors and 
suppliers to increased ethical, social and environmental performance.

Our energy target for FY2016 is set at 2.5% reduction of total carbon 
dioxide equivalents (tCO2-e) against base year FY2014. In FY2015, a 
reduction of 17% is well ahead of the two year target. Business 
downsizing and subsequent consolidation of office area have 
contributed to this reduction.

CASE STUDIES
The WorleyParsons Foundation, Collaborating with Red Cross on Disaster Recovery Programs
The WorleyParsons Foundation collaborated with Red Cross to integrate our skilled volunteers into their 
international disaster recovery projects, whereby WorleyParsons has been awarded the status of a 
'National Community Partner' with Australian Red Cross.
This collaboration is the first of its kind for the Red Cross and will provide innovative support to its 
partner organizations. The WorleyParsons Foundation supported two engineers to work on a waste 
management project in northern Philippines. Collecting and managing waste are very difficult due to the 
remote location and a lack of infrastructure.
The engineers were supported by a number of remote volunteers that meant that WorleyParsons 
resources could be utilized for the greater good of disadvantaged communities.
"The WorleyParsons collaboration has been great for Australian Red Cross. The expertise and extra 
support WorleyParsons has provided has really helped the project progress and they've helped our 
partners in the Philippines find solutions to this difficult problem." Catherine Harris, International 
Volunteer Partner, Australian Red Cross.
This collaboration is the first of its kind 
for the Red Cross.
Advisian Volunteers and Technology Helping Refugees in Kenya, Canada
Seven Advisian employees, led by Principal Geophysicist, Paul Bauman, volunteered their time to find 
safe groundwater for approximately 185,000 refugees living in the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR) Kakuma Camp near the borders of Uganda, South Sudan, and Ethiopia.
Using electrical resistivity tomography and seismic refraction surveys, the team located new and safer 
sources of drinkable groundwater to supply the local community, which are currently being used by the 
UNHCR to guide their groundwater drilling program. Paul Bauman was awarded with a prestigious 
Community Service Award by the Association of Professional Engineering and Geoscientists of Alberta.
"The water supply situation is very difficult at the Kakuma Refugee Camp, with most areas receiving 12 
to 17 liters of water per person per day and water quality in many areas of the Camp is poor due to 
elevated fluoride and salt concentrations.” Paul Bauman, Advisian Geophysics Technical Director, 
Canada.
The WorleyParsons Academy
The Academy was launched in 2015 to provide learning solutions that develop and enhance our people’s 
core workplace skills and capabilities in the areas of project delivery, business development and 
leadership.
The Academy provides a blended approach to learning and development through the use of both 
physical campuses and online presence.  The first campus opened in Houston, USA.  The facilities

towards achieving this. CEO, Andrew Wood, started the ball rolling by pledging to encourage equal 
opportunity and remove bias from our workplace.
“Parity is not to compete or rebel against the other gender. It is to attain sameness and to achieve consistent 
treatment irrespective of gender. Parity can only be achieved through cooperation from both genders. We all have a 
part to play in sustaining the drive towards our pledge for parity.” The Pledge for Parity from the people of the 
Lagos office, Nigeria.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
1. OPERATIONS
1.1 OVERVIEW 
WorleyParsons is a professional services provider to the resources, 
energy and industrial sectors. During the financial year ended 30 
June 2016 (FY2016), we reported along four business lines of 
Services, Major Projects, Improve and Advisian and three customer 
sectors, each of which is focused on customers involved in the 
following activities: 
•  Hydrocarbons – the extraction and processing of oil and gas; 
•  Minerals, Metals & Chemicals – the extraction and processing of
mineral resources and the manufacture of chemicals;
•  Infrastructure – projects related to water, the environment,
transport, ports and site remediation and decommissioning; and 
all forms of power generation, transmission and distribution.
Our customers include multi-national oil and gas, resources and 
chemicals companies as well as more regionally and locally focused 
companies, national oil companies and government owned utilities 
operating in the customer sectors described above. We offer a range 
of services from small studies to the delivery of mega projects.
The diversity of our business in terms of geography, industry and 
service offering is a fundamental strength. We operate in 42 
countries, with no country individually representing more than 
25% of aggregated revenue.
1.2 BUSINESS MODEL 
Our business is based on our people providing key services to our 
customers from within our business lines. We strive to empower 
our people to support our customers to be successful. We support 
our people with our business procedures and systems and generate 
earnings by charging their time spent performing professional 
services, to our customers.
Aggregated revenue and profit: Our sources of revenue and profit 
are diversified and revenue and profit are generated from a large 
number of customers. As a result, we are not dependent on any one 
of our customers for a significant portion of our revenue or profit. 
Aggregated revenue excludes revenue that has nil margin (this 
typically relates to procurement revenue where WorleyParsons 
undertakes procurement on our customers’ behalf with no exposure 
to financing costs or warranty obligations). We believe the 
disclosure of revenue attributable to associates provides additional 
information in relation to the financial position of the Group and 
include this revenue within aggregated revenue.
Costs: Our two largest costs are: staff costs; and administration 
costs, which include office lease costs. We also have a 
significant amount of pass through costs reimbursed by our 
customers.
Assets and liabilities: The significant items on our balance sheet 
are mainly project related, such as trade receivables, unbilled 
contract revenue, provisions and borrowings. We also hold a 
number of intangible assets generated through previous 
acquisitions. Our business is not capital intensive. Our customers 
pay us at longer intervals than our payments of expenses (e.g. staff 
salaries). This time differential, along with the time from incurring 
the costs, to invoicing the customer, makes up the majority of our 
working capital requirements.
1.3 REVIEW OF OPERATIONS 
The statutory result for FY2016 was a profit of $23.5 million, 
compared with a $54.9 million loss in FY2015 that included the 
recognition of a non-cash impairment of goodwill of $198.6 million 
(approximately 10% of total goodwill). Underlying net profit after 
tax (NPAT)
previous corresponding period.
was $153.1 million for FY2016, down 37.0% on the
1
Aggregated revenue declined by 18.5%, against a backdrop of 
ongoing declines in market activity.  Sustained low commodity 
prices and the fall in oil prices have resulted in our customers 
continuing to reduce capital and operating expenditure.
Aggregated revenue declined across all of our business lines and 
geographies.  Our Infrastructure sector performed well with 
aggregated revenue essentially flat year on year.
We have been taking action since 2013 to reshape the business to 
align it with market activity. During FY2016, the low oil price and 
generally subdued commodity prices across the energy and 
resources sectors resulted in a further contraction of our customers’ 
capital and operating budgets, project cancellations and deferrals. 
In that environment, during the financial year we announced a 
program to reduce our overhead costs by a further $300 million and 
to strengthen the balance sheet by $300 million.  After having taken 
action to deliver $120 million of annualized savings by February 
2016, we commenced the Realize our future transformation 
program to deliver on our objectives to improve our financial 
performance.  Through this program we achieved a further $80 
million of annualized savings taking the total by the end of FY2016 
to $200 million of annualized savings.
The actions taken in FY2016 resulted in the recognition of a series of 
charges related to redundancy, onerous leases, onerous contracts 
and other restructuring costs in the statutory result.
We now employ 24,500 people and still maintain a presence across 
42 countries, compared with 31,400 people across 148 offices at 30 
June 2015.
We have secured 85 significant awards this year compared with 105 
in FY2015.  Backlog at 30 June 2016 is $4.2 billion including $300 
million of soft backlog with $2.7 billion relating to FY2017.
Our financial position remains sound with the Company’s gearing 
ratio at 30 June 2016 of 29.2%, in the middle of the target range of 
25% to 35%.
The FY2015 segment result and segment margins shown in sections 
1.3.1 and 1.3.2 of this review have been restated to reflect the 
organization of the Group into four business lines, a change to the 
allocation of information technology charges and treatment of 
restructuring expenses and associated changed reporting effective 1 
July 2015.
The reconciliation of the underlying earnings before interest and tax 
(EBIT) and underlying NPAT results to the EBIT and NPAT 
attributable to members of WorleyParsons Limited is shown in the

18  WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016
Our aggregated revenue decreased by 18.5% in FY2016 when 
compared with that for FY2015, due to several large projects 
progressing to completion, while potential new project work was 
cancelled or deferred.
Our EBIT increased by 48.0% in FY2016 when compared with that 
for FY2015, due primarily to the benefit of no impairment charge 
recurring, but offset by higher restructuring charges in FY2016.
Our NPAT increased to $23.5 million in FY2016, compared with a 
loss of $54.9 million for FY2015, due primarily to the benefit of no 
impairment charge recurring but offset by higher restructuring 
charges in FY2016.
1.3.1 BUSINESS LINE PERFORMANCE
SERVICES 
The Services business line reported aggregated revenue of $3,437 million and segment result of $252 million (FY2015 restated: aggregated 
revenue of $4,336 million and segment result of $342 million). The segment margin declined to 7.3% from 7.9%.
Aggregated revenue was lower across all regions due to projects completing or moving into construction, and project deferrals and 
cancellations. The Middle East operations continued to perform well growing its contribution to the business. Segment margins decreased as 
the overhead reduction did not keep pace with declining revenues.

Aggregated revenue declined as a result of project completions and other projects moving into construction during financial year 2016. 
Segment margins increased through the improved performance of our portfolio of major projects offset the decline and the improved

Aggregated revenue declined primarily due to reductions in sustaining capital expenditure by oil sands customers. Segment margins 
declined modestly as overhead reductions partially offset the decline in project activity.

ADVISIAN 
Advisian became a standalone business line in FY2016.  It incorporates the heritage advisory businesses of Evans & Peck, MTG and Digital 
Enterprise, previously reported under the Development group in FY2015 and the INTECSEA business and consulting personnel and their 
associated projects transferred from the Services business line. Advisian reported aggregated revenue of $656 million and segment result of 
$44 million (FY2015 restated: aggregated revenue of $701 million and segment result of $53 million). The segment margin declined to 6.8% 
from 7.5%.
Aggregated revenue and margin decreases were primarily associated with the decline in the Hydrocarbons consulting business in the 
Americas and investment associated with development of business in the new energy sector and Digital Enterprise. The Company will 
continue to invest in this business to build a globally significant consulting and advisory business.

HYDROCARBONS 
The Hydrocarbons sector reported aggregated revenue of $4,267 million, and segment result of $329 million with a margin of 7.7% (FY2015 
restated: aggregated revenue of $5,332 million, segment result of $484 million and segment margin of 9.1%). Hydrocarbons’ contribution to 
the Group’s aggregated revenue was 72%, slightly down on last year.
Aggregated revenue declined due to projects reaching completion combined with customers’ reduced capital and operating expenditure. 
The refining sub sector revenues increased 2% year on year.

Chemicals contributed 11% to the Group’s aggregated revenue. Chemicals now represents more than 50% of this sector's contribution.
The Minerals & Metals contribution declined as project activity continued to decrease in line with sustained lower commodity prices. 
Chemicals also declined as the increased activity in the United States only partially offset lower in activity in China.

Group’s aggregated revenue was 17%.
The Infrastructure sector aggregated revenue was essentially flat year on year as growth in the Middle East offset declines in Australia. 
Margins improved primarily due to the resurgence in the power business across renewables, fossil, and nuclear.

2. FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW
2.1 MATTERS RELEVANT TO UNDERSTANDING WORLEYPARSONS’ FINANCIAL POSITION
OUR FINANCIAL CAPACITY REMAINS STRONG BASED ON CASH, GEARING AND DEBT 
POSITIONS.
1.  Operating 
cash flow
FY2016 
$’M
FY2015
$’M  Comments
192.0
251.3  Our operating cash flow comprises the payments
we receive from our customers less the amount 
we pay our suppliers plus related interest and tax 
paid. In our financial statements, operating cash 
flow is called net cash inflow from operating 
activities.
Movement
Our operating cash flow for FY2016 
represents a high cash conversion rate of 
125% of underlying NPAT, an 
improvement over last year's 103%.
2.  Gearing ratio
29.2%
28.0%  Our gearing ratio is our net debt divided by the 
sum of our net debt and our total equity, at the 
end of the financial year. Refer to Note 12 to the 
Financial Statements for the calculation of the 
gearing ratio.
Our gearing ratio increased by 1.2 
percentage points in FY2016 when 
compared with that for FY2015. 
This ratio is within our gearing target of 
25% to 35%.
3.  Debt facility
utilization
57%
59%  Our debt facility utilization is the percentage of 
our debt facilities that we were using at the end 
of the financial year.
4.  Loan,
overdraft and 
lease 
facilities
2,182
2,087  Our loan, overdraft lease facilities are the amount
of our debt facilities at the end of 
the financial year.
Our debt facility utilization decreased by 2 
percentage points in FY2016 when 
compared with that for FY2015, due to 
improvements in cash collection.
The amount of our loan, overdraft and lease 
facilities increased during FY2016, due to 
foreign exchange translation.
2.2 DIVIDENDS  
Our directors resolved not to pay a final dividend. The total 
dividend with respect to FY2016 is nil cents per share.
2.3 SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN WORLEYPARSONS’ 
FINANCIAL POSITION 
An assessment of asset carrying values was conducted as part of the 
normal process of finalizing the accounts.
As a result of this assessment, an impairment of investments in 
associates of $12.1 million was recognized in the FY2016 accounts.
During FY2016, we transferred our South African public 
infrastructure business and our interest in Cegertec, in Quebec, to 
assets and liabilities held for sale. These items are not material and 
so are not reclassified in the Statement of Financial Position.
2.4 FUTURE COMMITMENTS 
There are two types of future commitments which do not 
appear on our balance sheet and are relevant to understanding 
our financial position: 
•  operating leases 
•  operating expenditure commitments. 
These future commitments represent approximately 8.9% of 
our expenses.
In general, we lease the various office buildings from which we 
operate, rather than owning those buildings. Operating leases refers 
to those leases.
In addition, we are generally licensed to use software and also lease 
various items of computer hardware that we use in operating our 
business, rather than owning the software or computer hardware 
ourselves. We refer to our commitments to pay software license and 
equipment lease fees as operating expenditure commitments.
3. BUSINESS STRATEGY, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
3.1 BUSINESS STRATEGY 
We develop our business strategy using an iterative process at each 
of the key levels of our business such that we have: 
•  a Group strategy 
•  sector strategies 
•  business plans to guide the implementation of our sector
strategies at a business line level.
Our Group strategy describes markets in which we intend to invest 
to create sustainable competitive advantage (leading to greater 
market share and/or higher margins) and deliver on our corporate 
vision. Our sub sector or regional level strategies are a detailed view 
of these markets. At the business line level, we translate our sub 
sector strategies into business plans to deliver on the intent of the 
sector strategies as applicable to each business line. Our business 
plans map specific current and near term opportunities or portfolios 
of opportunities to the strategic themes, to provide clear and 
tangible targets for the individual business leaders to pursue, win 
and execute. Overall, our key markets continue to present 
challenges, including increasing competition and customers 
delaying committing to new developments. We believe that we took 
appropriate steps during FY2016 to identify opportunities to realign 
and position the Group to address these challenging market 
conditions.
WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016  21
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Strategically, our immediate focus is on five strategic themes 
which are to: 
•  build a world class consulting and advisory business and
dominate the early project phases;
•  be the global project management consultant or “PMC”
provider of choice;
•  build a leading major Improve business; 
•  be the smartest most agile local service provider; 
•  use the Global Delivery Centers to apply digital technology to
revolutionize the delivery of future services.
Further details on the five strategic themes can be found on pages 
10 and 11 of this Annual Report.
In the current market conditions, our priorities for the next 12 
months are to: 
•  protect revenue by winning the right work; 
•  achieve the overhead reduction target; 
•  strengthen the balance sheet.
3.2 OUTLOOK 
The Company expects trading conditions to remain challenging, 
leading to continued pressure on aggregated revenue. The 
Company is focused on protecting revenue and gross margin, 
achieving further overhead reductions and strengthening the 
balance sheet. The benefit of the cost reductions in the first half are 
expected to be reflected in second half earnings.
3.3 RISKS 
Achievement of our medium and long term prospects could be 
impacted by a number of risks. Those risks could, individually or 
together, have an adverse effect on achievement of those prospects.
Set out below is an overview of a number of key risks that we face 
in seeking to achieve those prospects. The risks are not set out in 
any particular order and do not comprise every risk we encounter 
in conducting our business or every risk that may affect the 
achievement of those prospects. Rather, they are the most 
significant risks that we believe we should be monitoring and 
seeking to mitigate or otherwise manage at this point in time.
The risk management measures set out below are a sample of the 
steps we take to seek to mitigate the various risks. However, the risk 
exists that we may fail to implement or fully implement those steps 
or that they may be entirely or partly ineffective.
3.3.1 HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK 
Our business sometimes requires our people and those people we 
manage to be in high risk geographies, travel long distances by 
road, be in close proximity to complex operating equipment and be 
engaged in construction and operating activities.
There is the risk of injury to, or the loss of life of, our people and 
those people we manage.
To seek to mitigate this risk, we have a OneWay™ framework 
which includes the expectations that every one of our people and 
those people we manage must meet with respect to health and 
safety. OneWay™ expectations are supported by our business 
processes and we use them in assessing our performance.
3.3.2 REPUTATION RISK 
We rely on the strength of our reputation to help win and retain 
work, attract and retain employees, secure lines of credit and gain 
access to capital.
There is a risk that our reputation could be damaged including 
through unethical business practices, poor project outcomes, health 
and safety incidents and not meeting the market’s expectations of 
our financial performance.
22  WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016
We use a range of strategies and actions to seek to mitigate this risk 
including requiring all of our people to undertake various training 
including on the Code of Conduct. In addition, other mitigating 
steps, particularly those referred to in health and safety risk, project 
delivery risk, and internal reporting risk are relevant to seek to 
preserve our reputation.
3.3.3 OPERATING RISKS 
Contract management risk: Effective contract management seeks to 
ensure, among other things, appropriate project and customer 
selection and the effective management of customer expectations.
There is a risk that we will fail to manage our contracts 
appropriately and, as a result, find ourselves in disputes with our 
customers regarding matters including payment of our fees and 
liability for costs and delays. Those disputes may be costly, result in 
liability and absorb significant amounts of management time.
We seek to mitigate this risk by implementing project delivery 
processes and procedures, providing training and development to 
our project staff and appropriate involvement of our legal staff in 
the contract process.
Demand risk: The markets for our services are exposed to volatile 
and cyclical commodity prices. Those prices impact demand for our 
customers’ goods and services and, in particular, our customers’ 
preparedness to fund capital and operating expenditure. This may 
markedly impact demand for our services such that, over relatively 
short periods, we experience rapid and/or sustained changes in that 
demand.
Responding to such changes may lead to reduced revenue and 
increased costs. Our overheads may also need to change such that 
they are efficient relative to our revenue and business size.
We have a number of strategies and processes in place to seek to 
mitigate this risk including maintaining our diversified business 
portfolio, retaining a proportion of our people on short notice 
contracts, seeking contractual protection for project demobilization, 
sharing work across locations and undertaking ongoing overhead 
efficiency reviews and rationalizing overhead where necessary.
Project delivery risk: Our ability to achieve superior shareholder 
returns is substantially influenced by our ability to deliver 
significant and/or strategically important projects to our customers’ 
satisfaction.
Project delivery risk is the risk that we fail to do so. The 
consequences may include fewer awards of significant projects.
To seek to mitigate this risk, we use regularly-reviewed project 
delivery systems and processes and project peer reviews. We have 
established the WorleyParsons Academy to further enhance the 
capability of our people in project management and project 
delivery.
3.3.4 FINANCIAL RISKS 
Liquidity risk: Our ability to maintain an appropriate level of 
liquidity, particularly through timely conversion of unbilled 
contract revenue to cash, impacts returns to shareholders.
There is a risk that given current market conditions, our customers 
delay paying us or are unwilling or unable to do so.  We seek to 
mitigate this risk by focusing on effective working capital 
management  and closely monitoring both cash collection targets 
and measures of debtor conversion.
Internal reporting risk: We operate a complex business which 
provides a wide range of services in a dynamic environment, while 
straddling multiple jurisdictions and regulatory frameworks.
There is a risk that our internal reporting systems may not 
accurately reflect our business performance or prospects and may 
therefore result in us not meeting forecasts provided to the market,
thereby adversely affecting investor confidence and the Company’s 
share price.
We seek to mitigate this risk by reviewing and enhancing those 
systems and seeking to adapt them to our dynamic business 
environment.
3.3.5 STRATEGIC RISKS 
Strategy risk: We operate in a highly competitive and dynamic 
environment. As a result, our ability to develop and implement 
effective strategies will be a significant ongoing contributor to our 
success.
Strategy risk is the risk of failing to develop and implement effective 
strategies. Such failure may, over time, lead to a loss of market 
share, and negatively impact our financial performance.
To seek to mitigate this risk, we have an annual strategy 
development process utilizing both internally and externally 
supplied market data and business knowledge.
The strategy involves five strategic themes executed as projects and 
described in section 3.1 of this Operating and Financial Review.
3.4 UNREASONABLE PREJUDICE 
We have omitted from the review information regarding: (1) our 
internal budgets and internal forecasts; and (2) details of our 
business strategy, on the basis that if we had included that 
information, doing so would have been likely to result in 
unreasonable prejudice to us.
3.5 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 
This review contains forward looking statements, including 
statements of current intention, opinion and expectation regarding 
the Company’s present and future operations, possible future 
events and future financial prospects. While these statements reflect 
expectations at the date of this review, they are, by their nature, not 
certain and are susceptible to change. WorleyParsons makes no 
representation, assurance or guarantee as to the accuracy of or 
likelihood of fulfilling any such forward looking statements 
(whether express or implied), and except as required by applicable 
law or the Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules, disclaims 
any obligation or undertaking to publicly update such forward 
looking statements.

2  Aggregated revenue is defined as statutory revenue and other income plus share
of revenue from associates less procurement revenue at nil margin, interest 
income and net gain on revaluation of investments previously accounted for as

financial performance of the Group.

During the financial year, Ernst & Young, the Group’s auditor, 
performed certain other services in addition to its statutory audit duties. 
Total fees for non-audit services provided by the auditor amounted to 
$931,622.
Underlying basic earnings per share was 61.8 cents per share, a decrease 
of 37.2% from the previous financial year result of 98.4 cents per share.
Underlying basic earnings per share is determined by dividing the 
underlying profit attributable to members of WorleyParsons Limited (as 
set out on page 26) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding as at 30 June 2016 (as set out in note 16 to the financial 
statements).
The Board has adopted a policy governing the provision of non-audit 
services by the auditor. The Board has considered the position and, 
in accordance with the advice received from the Audit and Risk 
Committee, is satisfied that the provision of the non-audit services is 
compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors 
imposed by the Act. The directors are satisfied that the provision of 
non-audit services by the auditor did not compromise the auditor 
independence requirements of the Act for the following reasons:
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
• all non-audit services have been reviewed by the Audit and Risk
Effective 1 July 2015, the Group established its advisory and consulting 
business, Advisian, as an additional business line.  As a result, the 
business operations are managed and reported by the following 
business lines: Services, Major Projects, Improve and Advisian.  Changes 
in business lines reporting also included, among other changes, the 
Group’s Canadian construction and fabrication business Cord now 
being reported as a part of Major Projects. In addition, during FY2016, a 
fully-costed information technology model was introduced which 
resulted in transition of selected costs from global support costs to each 
of the operating business lines.  This represents a change to the 
operating segments reported in the previous corresponding period. The 
previously reported segment results for the year ended 30 June 2015 
have been restated to be comparable with the revised segmentation 
approach as required by AASB 8 Operating Segments.
MATTERS SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE 
FINANCIAL YEAR
Since the end of the financial year, the directors have resolved not to 
pay a final dividend (2015: 22.0 cents per share, unfranked).
No other matter or circumstance has arisen since 30 June 2016 that has 
significantly affected, or may significantly affect:
• the consolidated entity’s operations in future financial years;
• the results of those operations in future financial years; or
• the consolidated entity’s state of affairs in future financial years.
LIKELY DEVELOPMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS 
OF OPERATIONS
The likely developments in the Group’s operations in future financial 
years and the expected results of those operations are set out in section 3 
of the Operating and Financial Review on page 22.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION
In the majority of the Group’s business operations, it does not have 
responsibility for obtaining environmental licenses. The Group typically 
assists its customers, who usually own or operate plant and equipment, 
with the management of their environmental responsibilities, rather 
than having those responsibilities itself. However, the Group has 
environmental responsibilities in terms of compliance with 
environmental controls and in exercising reasonable care and skill in its 
design, construction management, operation and supervising activities. 
The risks associated with environmental issues are managed through 
the Group’s risk management and quality assurance systems.
It is the Group’s policy to comply with all environmental regulations 
applicable to it and to the work it carries out. The Company confirms, 
for the purposes of section 299(1)(f) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Act) 
that it is not aware of any breaches by the Group of any environmental 
regulations under the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia, or of a 
State or Territory of Australia.
Committee to ensure they do not impact the integrity and objectivity 
of the auditor; and
• none of the services undermines the general principles relating to
auditor independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants, including reviewing and auditing the
auditor’s own work, acting in a management or decision making 
capacity for the Group, acting as advocate for the Group or jointly 
sharing economic risk and rewards.
A copy of the auditor’s independence declaration as required under 
section 307C of the Act is as follows:

INDEMNITIES AND INSURANCE
Under the Company’s Constitution, the Company indemnifies each 
current and former officer of the Group against certain liabilities and 
costs incurred by them as an officer of the Group. The Company also 
indemnifies each current and former officer of the Group against certain 
liabilities and costs incurred when the officer acts as an officer of 
another body corporate at the Company’s request and the liability or 
cost is incurred in that capacity. Neither indemnity extends to liabilities 
or costs from which the Company is prohibited from indemnifying 
current or former officers under the Act.
In addition, the Company has entered into Deeds of Access, Indemnity 
and Insurance with certain officers of the Group. Under those deeds, the 
Company agrees (among other things) to: 
•  indemnify the officer to the extent permitted by law and the
Company’s Constitution;
•  maintain a directors’ and officers’ insurance policy; and 
•  provide officers with access to Board papers.
The Company maintains a directors’ and officers’ insurance policy that, 
subject to certain exemptions, provides insurance cover to former and 
current officers of the Group. During the financial year, the Company 
paid insurance premiums to insure those officers of the Group. The 
contracts of insurance prohibit the disclosure of the amounts of 
premiums paid and the nature of the liability covered.

2016/191 (Rounding in Financial /Directors' Reports) issued by the

The Company’s directors present the Remuneration Report prepared in accordance with section 300A of the  
Corporations Act 2001 (Act) for the Company and the consolidated entity for financial year 2016 (FY2016).  
The information provided in this Remuneration Report has been audited as required by section 308(3C) of  
the Act. This Remuneration Report forms part of the Directors’ Report.
LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
Dear Shareholders 
As the new Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present the WorleyParsons Remuneration Report for the financial year 
ended 30 June 2016. 
I would like to reaffirm that the Remuneration Committee is guided by the Company beliefs which aim to pay our executives competitively and 
based upon their contribution to the success of the business.  This is explained further on page 34. 
To provide shareholders with a clearer picture of our approach to remuneration and an improved reading experience, we have made a number 
of changes to our Remuneration Report this year, including the introduction of a new section in the report which contains key shareholder 
questions and answers, on pages 32-33.  
KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL CHANGES IN FY2016 
There were a number of changes to Key Management Personnel (KMP) positions during the year, through new hire, internal promotion and 
retirement.  These are detailed in section 1 of the report. 
REMUNERATION OUTCOMES IN FY2016 
Challenging conditions during FY2016 resulted in a decision being made to make no payment of short term incentives through the cash portion 
of the Combined Incentive to Executives.  A grant of Share Price Performance Rights (SPPRs) was made during the year following the 
introduction of changes to the equity portion of the Combined Incentive Plan.  The SPPRs provide Executives with a clear goal to increase the 
Company’s share price, increase motivation and retention of Executives and ensure we remain competitive in our remuneration practices.  The 
outcome of the performance hurdles for the Long Term Incentive (LTI) Plan once again resulted in nil vesting as neither of the two equally-
weighted hurdles achieved the minimum performance requirements.  
REMUNERATION FOR FY2017  
A review of Executive pay was completed, with particular attention given to the at risk component within the pay mix and alignment with our 
external peers.  We have made no increases in Executives' Fixed Pay for FY2017.  The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has opted to retain his lower 
Fixed Pay following his request to reduce this by 10% from 1 July 2015.    
For the fifth year, no changes were made to Non-Executive Directors' fees for FY2017. The Chairman has agreed to forgo his fee for FY2017. 
The LTI Plan has not achieved the required performance hurdles for the last four years, this demonstrates the alignment of our Executive 
remuneration outcomes with shareholder returns. During FY2017, we will review the LTI Plan for FY2018 to ensure that it will motivate our 
Executives to deliver value to our shareholders over the long term.  For FY2017, the LTI Plan will retain the relative Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) hurdle as 50% of the FY2017 grant with a revision to the comparator group to reflect the Company’s current global competitors (see page 
39). Given the importance of delivery of the Company's Realize our future strategy and the role that Executives will play in leading its 
implementation, the remaining 50% of the FY2017 grant will be subject to strategic performance hurdles.  These performance hurdles will be 
subject to the achievement of cost reduction and net debt to EBITDA targets measured at the end of FY2018, both of which are key to the delivery 
of the strategy. A further two year restriction period will apply on the shares following the measurement of the targets.  Details of performance 
against the targets will be disclosed retrospectively due to the commercially sensitive nature of the targets.   
Lastly, I would like to highlight the change in composition of the Remuneration Committee from August 2016, so that it comprises myself, John 
Grill and Christopher Haynes. My thanks to Ron McNeilly for his contribution as Remuneration Committee member and John Green for his 
leadership as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
We hope that you will find the new format of the Remuneration Report useful, and welcome the views of shareholders on any of the items 
discussed within the report.
Kind regards
Jeet Bindra 
Chairman, Remuneration Committee

1. REMUNERATION IN BRIEF  
KEY SHAREHOLDER QUESTIONS
BQUESTION
BANSWER
BHow is performance reflected in the 
remuneration of Executives in FY2016?
BThe outcomes of Executives' remuneration for FY2016, reflect the financial results of 
the Company: 
•  zero Fixed Pay increases; 
•  zero cash payments through the Combined Incentive Plan; and 
•  nil vesting outcomes for LTI.
BHave any changes been made to the 
remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Directors (NEDs)?
BFor the fifth consecutive year, there have been no increases to Non-Executive Director 
annual fees.  In addition, Mr Grill agreed to a further temporary decrease in his 
Chairman fee for FY2016 and has waived his fee for FY2017.
BWhat changes have been made to 
remuneration components during 
FY2016?
BAs detailed in the 2015 Remuneration Report, we made amendments to the Combined 
Incentive Plan for FY2016 in order to increase our competitiveness in our 
remuneration versus that of our peers while retaining short term cash incentives and 
medium term deferred equity.  We have sought to drive a performance culture 
through an increase in our incentives for outperformance and build the equity 
interests of our Executives to be in alignment with our shareholders' interests.   
BThe cash portion of the Combined Incentive focuses on the achievement of financial 
and non-financial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).  The equity portion provides 
greater certainty of growth in Executive shareholdings through the SPPRs, with 
vesting outcomes linked to share price.

BAre there provisions in place for 
clawback of incentives?
BYes, the Company maintains a Clawback/Malus provision within both the Combined 
Incentive Plan and the LTI Plan.
BSee page 36
BAre there minimum shareholding 
requirements in place for the KMP?
BYes, Executives must retain equity delivered via incentive plans until they hold shares 
equivalent in value to two times Fixed Pay (four times Fixed Pay for the CEO) and 
must subsequently maintain that multiple.  NEDs are required to build a holding 
equivalent in value to their annual fee. The minimum shareholding requirements are 
assessed each year.
BSee pages 36, 43 
and 46
FIXED PAY 
BHas Executives' Fixed Pay been 
reviewed in FY2016?
32  WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016
BYes, a review was completed during FY2016 which resulted in no increases to Fixed 
Pay for our Executives during the year.  We are comfortable that the Executives 
remain competitive against the external market. It should also be noted that the CEO 
requested a 10% reduction in his Fixed Pay from 1 July 2015 and this will continue into 
FY2017.

COMBINED INCENTIVE PLAN 
BHow is the Combined Incentive Plan 
delivered to Executives?
BHow do the Share Price Performance 
Rights (SPPRs) work?
BWhat were the Combined Incentive 
Plan outcomes this year?
LTI PLAN 
BHow has the LTI Plan performed this 
year?
BThe Combined Incentive Plan is delivered in both cash (two thirds) and equity (one 
third). The cash portion is linked to the achievement of KPIs.  The equity portion is 
provided as an annual allocation of equity through SPPRs.
BThe equity portion of the Combined Incentive Plan is an annual grant of performance 
rights with a two year performance period.  The number of actual shares the 
performance rights convert into depends upon the share price at the end of the 
performance period.  A share price lower than 50% of the original grant price will 
result in zero SPPRs vesting; should the share price more than double the original 
grant price, a maximum of 200% of the number of rights will vest. In between half and 
double, the rights vest on a proportionate basis. 
BSPPRs provide strong alignment to shareholders' interests and use share price as the 
performance hurdle.  It will motivate our Executives to take action that results in 
enhanced shareholder return.
BThe FY2016 financial outcomes have resulted in zero cash payments being made to the 
Executives under the cash component of the Combined Incentive Plan.  SPPRs have 
been granted during FY2016, in accordance with the equity portion of the Combined 
Incentive Plan, which remain subject to the share price performance condition until 
the end of the two year vesting period.  The amount granted is calculated as one third 
of the Executive’s Combined Incentive target.
BAs a result of not achieving the required minimum, there will be zero vesting of the 
LTI awards.
BWhat are the performance hurdles for 
the LTI Plan?
BThere are two equally-weighted performance hurdles for the LTI Plan, relative Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) and Earnings Per Share (EPS).
BHow long is the performance period for 
the LTI Plan?
BThe performance period is four years.
BDoes the LTI Plan allow for retesting?
BNo, there is no retesting of the LTI for Executives.
BDoes an Executive receive dividends on 
the unvested LTI?
BNo, there are no dividends paid on the unvested LTI.
BHave there been any changes to the LTI 
Plan this year?
BNo changes have occurred for existing LTI grants.
BAre there any LTI Plan changes planned 
for FY2017?
BYes, following a review of the existing comparator group for our relative TSR 
performance hurdle (50% of the grant), future grants will have a slightly varied 
comparator group aligned to our current competitive landscape.   
BThe focus of Executives on the delivery of the Company's 'Realize our future' strategy 
and leading the change will be achieved through the provision of strategic 
performance rights (50% of the grant).   These performance hurdles will be subject to 
the achievement of cost reduction and net debt to EBITDA targets measured at the end 
of FY2018, both of which are key to the delivery of the strategy. A further two year 
restriction period will apply on the shares following the measurement of the targets.  
Details of performance against the targets will be disclosed retrospectively due to the 
commercially sensitive nature of the targets.   
BDuring FY2017, we will review the LTI Plan performance hurdles for FY2018 grants to 
ensure the motivational value of this portion of our Executives' remuneration is 
effective into the future.

34  WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016
EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION STRUCTURE 
Executive remuneration is structured to recognise an individual’s role, responsibilities, qualifications and experience as well as to drive 
performance over the short and long term.  The proportion of variable pay is reflective of an Executive’s ability to influence Company 
performance through their role. The diagram below provides a high level overview of the various remuneration components, timing for their 
delivery and their link to the remuneration principles:
* Excludes Dennis Finn (refer page 40). 
 
REMUNERATION DECISION MAKING 
Remuneration decision making within the Company follows set processes through which various stakeholders are involved; these include: 
Board 
•  ensures remuneration policies and structures are competitive, fair, and aligned with the long term interests of the Company; 
•  sets and approves remuneration structures; and 
•  approves NED, CEO and other Executive remuneration quantum; 
Nominations Committee  
•  reviews and assesses the CEO’s performance; and 
•  advises the Board on the CEO’s remuneration, including amount, structure and applicable performance targets; 
Remuneration Committee 
•  assists/advises the Board in relation to remuneration structuring and policies, NED remuneration, performance assessment and remuneration
for Executives, and where required, engaging independent advisors for advice on remuneration structure and quantum for Executives, 
including the CEO, and NEDs.
Management 
The CEO recommends pay increases and incentive outcomes for the Executives, other than the CEO. At the request of the Nominations and/or 
Remuneration Committees, management: 
•  provides information relevant to remuneration decisions; and  
•  where appropriate, liaises with independent advisors to assist the Nominations and/or Remuneration Committees with factual information
(subject to prior Board approval of the provider).
All remuneration decisions relating to Executives are made by the Board. However, where appropriate, management is included in Committee 
and Board discussions. 
External Market Data and External Consultants  
Market data is sourced from published reports and independent surveys.  Where required, external consultants are engaged by the Board and 
Committees to provide advice or information. Any advice or recommendations provided by external consultants are used as a guide. They are 
not a substitute for the Board and Committee decision-making process. There were no remuneration recommendations made by consultants in 
relation to KMP in FY2016.
WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016  35
DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
Benchmarking of total remuneration and remuneration mix for Executives during FY2016 was performed by Aon Hewitt, an independent 
research and advisory remuneration consulting firm.  This advice was used as a guide, and was not a substitute for thorough consideration of all 
of the issues by the Remuneration Committee.  The cost of advice and assistance by Aon Hewitt for the Executives is not material for either party.  
Aon Hewitt was engaged by and reported to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.  The Board is therefore satisfied that the information 
provided by Aon Hewitt was free from undue influence by members of the Executive group to whom the remuneration benchmark information 
related.   
Frederic W. Cook, an independent remuneration consulting firm, was engaged to provide commentary and analytical support on the collation of 
industry peer group data, no advice was provided.  The cost of the support was not material for either party. 
Orient Capital calculated the TSR for the purpose of vesting LTI.  The amount paid to Orient Capital for TSR reporting is not material for either 
party. 
EXECUTIVE MINIMUM SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENT 
The Executive minimum shareholding requirement applies to Executives to reinforce the Company’s objective of aligning their interests with the 
interests of shareholders, and to foster an increased focus on building long term shareholder value. 
To satisfy the requirement, Executives must retain equity delivered via incentive plans until they hold shares equivalent in value to two times 
Fixed Pay (four times Fixed Pay for the CEO) and must subsequently maintain that multiple. 
Compliance with the requirement is assessed as at 30 June each year. The table on page 46 provides a summary of the position of each Executive 
against the requirement as at 30 June 2016. 
In addition, under the Company’s Securities Dealing Policy, directors and Executives are not permitted to hedge unvested performance rights or 
shares that count towards an Executive’s minimum holding requirement. This ensures that Executives cannot “limit the risk” associated with 
these instruments and are subject to the same impacts from fluctuations in the share price as all other shareholders. 
CLAWBACK (MALUS) PROVISION 
The Company maintains a Clawback provision within the Combined Incentive Plan and the LTI Plan. 
If in the Board’s opinion, an employee: 
•  acts fraudulently or dishonestly; 
•  is in breach of their obligations to the Company or another Group company; or 
•  received awards based on financial accounts which are later restated, 
the Board may determine that unvested performance rights lapse; this is also known as a Malus provision. The Board may also deem any vested 
but unexercised performance rights to have lapsed. Additionally, the Board may seek to recover shares received from exercised rights. 
CESSATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE OF CONTROL 
Where an Executive leaves the Group, the Board may exercise its discretion and allow a portion of any unvested rights to remain in the plan. 
Rights will subsequently vest and be exercised in the ordinary course, having regard to such factors as the Board determines relevant. Such 
factors would include performance against applicable performance hurdles, as well as the performance and contribution that the relevant 
Executive has made. Generally, the Board only exercises discretion in special circumstances, such as retirement. 
In the event of a change of control of the Company (e.g. where a third party unconditionally acquires more than 50% of the issued share capital of 
the Company), the Board will exercise its discretion to determine whether any or all unvested rights vest, having regard to pro-rata performance 
against applicable performance hurdles up to the date of the change of control.

3. EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION IN DETAIL 
REMUNERATION MIX FOR EXECUTIVES  
The targeted mix of remuneration components shown in the graph below refers to the incentive that would be payable if all performance 
conditions are satisfied and assumes vesting of the Combined Incentive Plan, comprised of a cash and equity incentive and LTI awards at 100%. 
Allowances and benefits are for specific purposes and are excluded in determining the mix. Actual incentive remuneration paid to the Executives 
can vary for individuals depending on the extent that they meet or exceed performance requirements. 
Further details in relation to the Company’s incentive arrangements, the performance conditions imposed and the outcomes of those 
arrangements (based on the Company’s performance over FY2016 and prior years), are set out on page 40 under the Combined Incentive Plan 
and LTI Plan outcome sections.  
 
Targeted pay mix for Executives
AT RISK REMUNERATION 
By linking pay to performance via incentive plans, the Company focuses on total reward and provides motivation to Executives to achieve 
outcomes beyond the standard expected in the normal course of ongoing employment.  The elements of remuneration that are at risk are the 
Combined Incentive Plan and the LTI Plan. The following tables provide details on each of the Plans. 
COMBINED INCENTIVE PLAN 
The Combined Incentive Plan for Executives is made up of two thirds cash (Cash Incentive) and one third equity (Equity Incentive).   The 
minimum potential value of the Combined Incentive Plan is zero where applicable hurdles have not been met.  To be eligible for an incentive 
payment, generally participants must have been employed for at least three months of the financial year and remain in employment at the date of 
payment/vesting.  Outlined below is a detailed summary of the Cash and Equity Incentive components: 
 
Cash Incentive (two thirds of target incentive) 
Performance targets are set and measured through both financial and non-financial KPIs.  These KPIs are agreed at the beginning of the financial 
year and the Board retains rigorous oversight, to ensure they retain sufficient stretch, and appropriate thresholds. 
Gate opener1
Individual thresholds will apply for each KPI to provide the Executive’s line of sight over achieving their targets. 
Financial KPIs require achievement above 80% of budget (such as Group NPAT or business line EBIT) for the sliding 
scale to start to apply – 5% awarded for each 1% achieved above 80%, capped at 200% (at 120% achievement against 
budget).   
Maximum payout of 150% of target incentive. 
Payment of the award will be made as a gross cash amount at the end of the performance period.

KPI weighting for 
FY2016
CEO – 60% financial/40% non-financial. 
Other Executives – Either 50% financial/50% non-financial or 60% financial/40% non-financial.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
Cash Incentive (two thirds of target incentive) 
KPI details for FY2016 - 
chosen due to their 
direct link to the 
Company's priorities for 
the period, and in 
alignment with the best 
interests of shareholders
Financial  
Group NPAT - Group NPAT is based upon audited financial statements to ensure the performance assessment for 
financial KPIs is aligned with business performance and the creation of value for shareholders. The results are 
adjusted at Board discretion, to exclude abnormal items. 
Business line financial targets - Financial goals specific to the business line e.g. Earnings Before Interest and Tax 
(EBIT). 
Cash collection - Cash collection is measured via days sales outstanding. 
Non-financial  
Health, safety and environment performance - Reduction in the number of reportable incidents and the 
demonstration of personal and visible leadership in support of the Company’s goal of Zero Harm. 
Successful implementation of the business plan and/or strategic priorities for the business line - Targeted 
business growth, customer retention, customer satisfaction and acquisition (the specific goals for Executives relating 
to strategic imperatives are considered commercially sensitive to disclose). 
The KPIs listed above were chosen in alignment with the key strategic areas of focus for the Company, and are 
rewarded after they have been achieved as determined by the Board. 
Refer the Clawback (Malus) provision - see page 36.
Performance and 
forfeiture conditions 
(including Malus) 
1 Variation for Dennis Finn - The Advisian EBIT results are measured against the target and used as a multiplier that applies to the incentive payout calculation.  Achievement 
must be greater than 50%, otherwise the multiplier, and therefore the incentive payment is zero; between 51% and 75% achievement, the multiplier increases linearly; and above 
75% (up to 200%), the multiplier is equivalent to the achievement percentage.  The overall payment is subject to a maximum of 200% of target.  This incentive plan arrangement 
reflects the higher leveraged model typical in professional services and focuses the Advisian business line as it grows into a world-class global advisory business. 
 
Equity Incentive (one third of target incentive) 
The performance rights provided through the Equity Incentive are called Share Price Performance Rights (SPPRs).  SPPRs are granted annually 
as performance rights. The vesting period for the SPPRs is two years.  The number of rights is determined by dividing the dollar value of the 
award achieved by the face value of shares.  The grant price for the FY2016 allocation of SPPRs was $7.46, based on 10 day volume weighted 
average price following the release of the FY2015 results.

Dividends 
Examples  
The four examples are 
based on a notional 
grant of 1,000 SPPRs 
with a notional 
WorleyParsons share 
price of $8.00 at the 
time the SPPRs are 
issued i.e. a notional 
value of $8,000.
The threshold relates to the share price at the end of the performance period.  If the closing share price is half or less 
than half the opening share price, the SPPRs lapse. 
The maximum number of SPPRs that convert to shares is double the original amount that was granted. 
If the share price doubles (or more than doubles) over the two year performance period, the rights convert into twice 
the number of shares. If the share price halves (or more than halves), the rights do not convert into any shares and they 
lapse. In between double and half the share price, the rights vest on a proportionate basis. 
The Executive must maintain a satisfactory performance rating during the performance period. See ‘Incentive delivery 
and payment timing’ above for the additional share price performance conditions. 
Should the accounts be restated during the performance period or where an employee has acted fraudulently or 
dishonestly or is in breach of their obligations to the Company, the award may be forfeited. 
Not applicable, no dividends are payable on unvested rights.  
In two years’ time: 
Scenario 1: The opening share price rises to $20.00 (i.e. more than doubles). The 1,000 SPPRs convert to 2,000 shares and 
their total value = $40,000. The Executive’s incentive has delivered a $40,000 reward (in shares) i.e. $32,000 above the 
notional $8,000 value at the time of issue. 
Scenario 2: The opening share price rises to $12.00. The 1,000 SPPRs convert to 1,000 x ($12/$8) = 1,500 shares and their 
total value = $18,000. The Executive’s incentive has delivered an $18,000 reward (in shares) i.e. $10,000 above the 
notional $8,000 value at the time of issue. 
Scenario 3: The opening share price falls to $6.00. The 1,000 SPPRs convert to 1,000 x ($6/$8) = 750 shares and their total 
value = $4,500. The Executive’s incentive has delivered a $4,500 reward (in shares) i.e. $3,500 below the notional $8,000 
value at the time of issue. 
Scenario 4: The opening share price halves or more; then the SPPRs lapse and no shares are issued.
SPPRs were not granted in FY2016 for the Executives who commenced in their roles after the grant of SPPRs was made in October 2015.
38  WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
The provision of LTI is currently assessed through two equally weighted, independent performance targets (TSR and EPS) that align an 
Executive’s interests with shareholder returns while driving long term Company performance.    
LTI grants are delivered to Executives as rights that are issued under the WorleyParsons Performance Rights Plan.  After vesting, each right 
entitles the holder to one fully paid ordinary share in the Company at a nil exercise price (i.e. a zero exercise price option).  The number of rights 
issued is based on the Executive’s target LTI with reference to the underlying share price when the rights are issued. Rights vest and are 
automatically exercised (unless an Executive elects otherwise) after a four year vesting period, subject to defined performance hurdles being 
satisfied.  Where rights cannot be readily issued in certain overseas jurisdictions due to differing securities laws and taxation treatments, the LTI 
Plan rules ensure a participant can still be rewarded for their contribution, while catering for the local restrictions on the issue of securities. 
 
Relative Total 
Shareholder Return 
(TSR) - 50% of 
potential LTI
The TSR measure represents the change in the value of the Company’s share price over a period, including reinvested 
dividends, expressed as a percentage of the opening value of the shares.  Relative TSR has been chosen as a 
performance hurdle because, in the opinion of the Board, it provides the most direct measure of shareholder return and 
reflects an investor’s choice to invest in this company or direct competitors. 
Executives will only derive value from the TSR component of the LTI Plan if the Company’s TSR performance is at least 
at the median of the companies in the peer comparison group over a four year period. Executives are not provided an 
opportunity to retest under the TSR measure.   
The vesting schedule of the rights subject to the relative TSR hurdle is as follows:
RELATIVE TSR PERCENTILE RANKING
PERCENTAGE OF RIGHTS THAT MAY BE EXERCISED IF THE 
RELATIVE TSR HURDLE IS MET 
0% 
25% 
Pro-rated vesting between 25% and 50%
50% (i.e. maximum available under the plan)
Less than 50th percentile 
At 50th percentile 
Greater than the 50th percentile but less 
than the 75th percentile 
At 75th percentile or greater 
 
For LTI grants made since FY2013, the comparator group comprises the companies shown below: 
AECOM, Aker Solutions, AMEC Foster Wheeler, Arcadis, Atkins, Balfour Beatty, Cardno, Chicago Bridge & Iron 
Company, CIMIC, Downer EDI, Fluor Corporation, Fugro, Jacobs Engineering Group, JGC Corporation, KBR, 
McDermott International, Monadelphous Group, SNC Lavalin, , Saipem, Serco Group, Stantec, Technip, Tecnicas 
Reunidas, Tetra Tech, UGL and Wood Group.  The Board has discretion to adjust the comparator group to take into 
account events including, but not limited to, takeovers or mergers that might occur during the performance period.  
For LTI grants in FY2017, the comparator group will include a revised list of companies that were identified by the 
Board as having similar business profiles and with which the Company competes for capital and executive talent, these 
include: AECOM, Aker Solutions, AMEC Foster Wheeler, Arcadis, Fluor Corporation, Fugro, Jacobs Engineering 
Group, JGC Corporation, KBR, Petrofac, SNC Lavalin, Stantec, Tetra Tech, Wood Group and WSP Global. 
 
Basic EPS is determined by dividing the Group NPAT by the weighted average number of the Company’s ordinary 
shares on issue during the financial year. Growth in EPS will be measured by comparing the EPS in the financial year 
immediately preceding the issue and the EPS in the measurement year. EPS has been chosen as a performance hurdle 
because it provides a clear line of sight between Executive performance and Company performance. It is also a 
well-recognized and understood measure of performance both within and outside the organization. The Group NPAT 
may be adjusted by the Board, where appropriate, to better reflect operating performance. 
Executives will only derive value from the EPS component of the grants made in FY2016 if the Company achieves 
average compound growth in EPS of at least 4% per annum above the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over 
the four year performance period. 
The vesting schedule of the rights subject to the EPS hurdle is as follows: 
AVERAGE COMPOUND GROWTH IN EPS OVER THE 
PERFORMANCE PERIOD 
Less than 4% p.a. above the increase in CPI 
4% p.a. above the increase in CPI 
More than 4% p.a. above the increase in CPI but less than 
8% p.a. above the increase in CPI 
8% p.a. or greater above the increase in CPI 
 
For LTI grants in FY2017, the EPS hurdle will be replaced with a strategic performance hurdle, see page 33.
PERCENTAGE OF RIGHTS THAT MAY BE EXERCISED IF THE 
EPS HURDLE IS MET 
0% 
25% 
Pro-rated vesting between 25% and 50%
50% (i.e. maximum available under the plan)
Earnings Per Share

A review of the LTI Plan performance hurdles will occur for future grants to ensure it continues to motivate our Executives into the future.
WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016  39
DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
Rights granted under the LTI Plan carry no voting or dividend entitlements. In addition, other than in relation to bonus issues and capital 
reorganizations (when the number of rights may be adjusted by the Board in accordance with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) Listing 
Rules, so as to ensure no advantage or disadvantage to the Executive), the rights carry no entitlement to participate in new share issues made by 
the Company. The Board has determined that the number of securities issued to Executives and all other participants under the Company’s 
equity plans should be capped at 5% of the issued share capital of the Company over a five year time horizon. Currently, the number of securities 
issued and held pursuant to the equity plans represents 2.01% of the Company’s issued share capital (FY2015: 1.71%).
With the exception of Dennis Finn who has a varied pay mix more aligned with professional services, all current Executives are able to receive 
rights through the LTI Plan.   Details of the rights granted to Executives as the LTI component of their remuneration in FY2016 are outlined on 
page 47.
Exercise of rights and allocation of shares 
To the extent that the performance hurdles have been satisfied, rights are automatically exercised (unless an Executive elects otherwise) and 
participants acquire shares in the Company at a nil exercise price. 
Shares allocated to participants upon exercise of rights rank equally with all other ordinary shares on issue. Participants will have unencumbered 
ownership of the shares, subject to compliance with the Company’s Securities Dealing Policy and minimum shareholding requirement.
COMPANY PERFORMANCE OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD  
The table below contains a snapshot of the Company’s performance against annual financial KPIs and shows how the Company’s performance 
has impacted on remuneration outcomes for Executives under the Company’s incentive programs.  
The remuneration arrangements for Executives ensure that remuneration outcomes are lower when the Company’s performance does not justify 
large awards, and higher when Company performance is strong. As demonstrated by the table, Combined Incentive and LTI Plan outcomes have 
moved in line with the Company’s performance against relevant key metrics:

1  No final dividend for FY2016. 
2  Underlying EPS, which in the Board’s opinion reflects the Company’s operating results, has been used to calculate the outcomes. 
3  The Combined Incentive Plan was introduced in FY2013; previously, this was the Short Term Incentive Plan. 
4  Group NPAT was considered to reflect the Company’s operating results for FY2013 and has been used to calculate the remuneration outcomes for that financial year. For all other financial periods 
represented in this table, underlying NPAT has been used to calculate the remuneration outcomes. Underlying NPAT excludes impairment of goodwill, net gain on revaluation of investments previously 
accounted for as equity accounted associates and joint operations, restructuring costs (net of tax), write off of investments accounted for as equity accounted associates and other adjustments at the Board 
discretion, being the difference between reported Group NPAT and underlying NPAT. 
5 The first grant of SPPRs was made during FY2016 to Executives, calculated as one third of their Combined Incentive target.  See page 47 for further details.
REMUNERATION OUTCOMES IN FY2016  
COMBINED INCENTIVE PLAN OUTCOMES  
As outlined in the description of the Combined Incentive Plan on pages 37-38, reward outcomes for Executives are linked to performance against 
annual financial and non-financial KPIs for the cash component.  
In the five year table above and the following graph, the Company performance is compared to variable pay outcomes for each 12 month period.  
Based on the Company’s financial performance and performance against individual KPIs, there were no resulting payments for the Cash 
Incentive portion of the Combined Incentive Plan for FY2016 as detailed in the table on page 44.  Details of the grant of SPPRs are provided on 
page 47.
40  WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016
The graph below illustrates the average Combined Incentive as a percentage of maximum awarded to Executives over each of the past five years 
compared to underlying NPAT. It demonstrates Executives have not been rewarded during this difficult period: 
 
Average % of maximum Combined Incentive awarded to Executives compared to underlying NPAT
1 The average Combined Incentive as a percentage of maximum for any financial year relates to amounts paid in the September following that financial year end.  
2 Underlying NPAT figures are used for this graph, in 2013 these are the same as reported Group NPAT figures. 
 
SPPRs granted during FY2016 will be displayed in the above graph upon vesting, should this occur. 
LTI PLAN OUTCOMES 
The graph below tracks the Company’s TSR over the last four years against the median TSR of the peer comparison group used for the LTI Plan: 
TSR performance measured over the last four years
This graph illustrates that growth in the Company’s TSR was below median, which has resulted in a nil vesting for Executives for TSR related 
LTI granted in FY2013. As vesting was not achieved, the TSR performance rights will lapse on 30 September 2016.  Over the same four year 
period, the Company’s EPS growth was below the minimum required to trigger vesting against the EPS performance hurdle for LTI granted in 
FY2013. EPS performance rights will lapse on 30 September 2016. No retest applies to either measure. 
The LTI Plan has not achieved the required performance hurdles for the last four years, demonstrating the alignment of our Executive 
remuneration outcomes with shareholder returns.  It is important that we are able to continue to motivate our Executives to deliver value to our 
shareholders over the long term and we will review the LTI Plan during FY2017 to ensure that we continue to use the most appropriate 
performance hurdles.

1  Notice period required to be given by the KMP to the Group is the same as the notice period required to be given by the Group to the KMP upon termination of employment.  
 
The contracts include the components of remuneration which are to be paid to Executives, and provide for an annual review, but do not 
prescribe how remuneration levels are to be modified from year to year.  
In the event of termination, all Executives are generally entitled to receive their statutory leave entitlements. In relation to incentive plans upon 
termination, where an Executive resigns, the Combined Incentive is paid only if the Executive is employed on the date of payment (which is 
subsequent to the performance year).  
In accordance with the plan rules, the Board retains discretion on the treatment of both vested and unvested equity in all instances of separation 
as outlined in the Combined Incentive Plan and the LTI Plan details on page 36. In exercising such discretion, this is typically on a pro-rata basis 
and subject to the original performance requirements and timing.  
At the October 2013 Annual General Meeting (AGM), the Board sought and received approval from shareholders, where discretion was applied 
for the retention of LTI following cessation of employment for the value of LTI to be disregarded when calculating the relevant participant’s cap 
for the purpose of section 200F(2)(b) or section 200G(1)(c) of the Act.  
Mr Holt ceased to be KMP from 1 December 2015 when Mr Honan commenced in the expanded role of Group Managing Director Finance/CFO. 
Mr Holt received a payment upon the cessation of his employment on 11 February 2016, reported on page 44.  In accordance with the LTI Plan 
rules a pro-rata portion of his unvested performance rights was approved by the Board in December 2015, and the pro-rated unvested equity will 
remain in place subject to the original time and performance hurdles. 
The Company did not pay sign-on payments to Executives during FY2016.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES 
The principles of fairness and shareholder alignment are reflected through the Company’s commitment to setting NED fees at a level which 
remains market competitive, while ensuring they reflect the caliber of directors required to address the significant strategic and operational 
challenges faced by the Company, domestically and abroad. 
For the fifth consecutive year, there will be no increase in annual fees for NEDs in FY2017.  The aggregate amount of fees (which include Board 
and Committee fees) that may be paid to NEDs in any year is capped at the level approved by shareholders. The current maximum aggregate 
amount of $3.25 million per annum was approved by shareholders at the 2012 AGM. Of the aggregate annual fee pool, 76% ($2.47 million) was 
utilized during FY2016 (69% ($2.23 million) for FY2015). NEDs do not receive performance related payments. 
REMUNERATION STRUCTURE 
Board and Committee fees 
Board and Committee fees for FY2016 and FY2017 are set out below. These amounts are inclusive of superannuation contributions made on 
behalf of NEDs in accordance with the Company’s statutory obligations.

1  The Chairman of the Board and Deputy Chairman and Lead Independent Director do not receive additional fees for Committees of which they may be a member. 
2  Mr Grill requested a temporary reduction in his Chairman fee of $520,000 per annum in both FY2015 (reduced to $460,000) and FY2016 (reduced to $395,053). 
 
Other benefits 
NEDs are eligible to receive travel allowances of $5,000 per trip for additional time incurred on overseas business related travel including 
attendance at Board meetings and site visits. These payments are made within the NED fee pool. NEDs are also entitled to be reimbursed for all 
business related expenses, including travel, incurred in the discharge of their obligations.  The Company does not pay retirement benefits to 
NEDs, except where required by legislation.  From time to time, the Board may determine special fees for additional duties undertaken by 
directors. No such fees were paid in FY2016. 
REMUNERATION OUTCOMES 
The remuneration outcomes of the NEDs for FY2016 and FY2015 are set out in the Remuneration Tables section of the report, on page 49.   
NED INTERESTS IN SHARES AND PERFORMANCE RIGHTS 
The NED beneficial interests in shares and performance rights of the Company as at 30 June 2016 is detailed in the Remuneration Tables section 
of the report, on page 49.   The service and performance criteria for the rights are discussed in the LTI Plan section on page 39.  
NED minimum shareholding requirement 
A minimum shareholding requirement exists to provide alignment between director and shareholder interests.  Each NED must build a holding 
of the Company’s ordinary shares equivalent in value to that director’s annual fee. NEDs are expected to comply with this requirement within 
their first full term of three years as a director. For the purpose of this test, the value of shares is calculated using the number of shares held at 30 
June 2016 multiplied by the five day volume weighted average price of the Company’s shares up to and including 30 June 2016 ($7.06) or 
purchase price if higher.  All NEDs currently comply with the minimum shareholding requirement.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
5. REMUNERATION TABLES  
STATUTORY REMUNERATION OUTCOMES 
Executive remuneration is detailed in the following table in accordance with accounting standards.  
Accounting standards require the value of equity based payments to be amortized over the relevant period of performance (or vesting period). 
The value of equity based payments awarded during the year is determined as a percentage of Fixed Pay that the Company aims to deliver. This 
can be found in the Equity Incentive and LTI columns under the remuneration awarded section of Actual Remuneration Outcomes on page 45. 
The full value that was received during the year is determined as the number of performance rights vested times the share price at the end of the 
performance period. This can be found under the remuneration received section of Actual Remuneration Outcomes on page 45.

1  The service and performance criteria for the rights are discussed in the LTI Plan section on page 39. Each right entitles the holder to one fully paid ordinary share in the Company at a nil exercise price (i.e.
a zero exercise price option). Where rights were granted prior to commencement as Executives, the service and performance criteria are aligned with those discussed in the Combined Incentive Plan 
section in the 2015 Remuneration Report.
2  Fair value per right at grant date is independently determined using an appropriate option pricing model in accordance with AASB 2 Share-based Payment that takes into account the exercise price, the term
of the right, the vesting and performance criteria, the impact of dilution, the non-tradeable nature of the right, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the 
expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the right. This amount represents the actual cost to the Company. We have used a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the relative 
TSR rights and SPPRs and a Black-Scholes model to value the EPS rights, other cash settled rights and other equity settled rights.
3  Total fair value at grant is calculated by multiplying the fair value per right by the number of rights granted. This does not represent the actual value the Executive will derive from the grant, which will 
depend on the achievement of performance hurdles measured over the vesting period. The maximum value of the rights granted has been estimated based on the fair value per right. The minimum total 
value of the rights granted, if the applicable performance hurdles are not met, is nil.
4  This amount is based on the volume weighted average price of the Company’s shares for the five or 10 trading days following the annual results announcement for the year in which the rights vest (as
there is no exercise price payable in respect of equity or cash settled rights) or following the end of the relevant financial year, as applicable.
5  The number of rights lapsed represents rights lapsed due to performance hurdles not being met and/or rights lapsed on cessation of employment. 
6  Based on the measurement of the relevant performance hurdles, this total value may be an accumulation of values for rights lapsed over multiple periods. 
7  The performance rights granted to Mr Abba in April 2015, as disclosed in the 2015 Remuneration Report, were structured with specific targets related to his personal performance and the ongoing
performance of the Improve business line.
8  The value of the rights issues to Mr Ashton, Mr Finn, Mr Lucey, Mr Parker and Mr Wilkinson are disclosed on page 44 to the extent that they were granted during their term as an Executive. Mr Ashton,
Mr Finn, Mr Parker and Mr Wilkinson were granted rights in the Combined Incentive Plan prior to them becoming KMP.
9  Mr Holt’s and Mr Steele's employment in the capacity of an Executive ceased on 1 December 2015 and 1 January 2016 respectively.  Rights lapsed have been valued based on the volume weighted average
price of the Company's shares for the 10 trading days up to and including their cessation dates.
10 The fair value at grant for matching bonus entitlements under the Employee Share Purchase Plan is calculated as the weighted average market price over the plan year. 
11 Mr Grill and Mr Karren received rights as part of their employment with the Company prior to their retirement effective 23 October 2012 and 31 March 2015 respectively. Board approval was received for
retention of a pro-rated number of rights under the original terms of the grant including performance measures and vesting dates. This is consistent with the Company’s practice in relation to unvested 
LTI held by retiring employees. Full details are disclosed on page 36. Rights lapsed on Mr Grill’s and Mr Karren’s retirement have been valued based on the volume weighted average price of the 
Company’s shares for the five or 10 trading days up to and including their retirement dates.
All vested rights are exercisable. There are no vested and unexercisable rights.

1  Superannuation contributions are made on behalf of the NEDs in accordance with the Company’s statutory superannuation obligations. In some cases, the amounts in this table are lower than the
annualized superannuation guarantee cap (Cap). The legislation requires the Cap to apply quarterly. The lower amount results from those quarters in which only one payment was made and it is lower 
than the quarterly Cap.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR INTERESTS IN SHARES AND PERFORMANCE RIGHTS 
NED beneficial interests in shares and performance rights of the Company as at 30 June 2016 are detailed in the below table. The service and 
performance criteria for the rights are discussed in the LTI Plan section on page 39.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
6. GLOSSARY OF TERMS
TERMS USED IN THE REMUNERATION REPORT
Clawback (Malus) – provides the Board with discretion on the treatment of equity awards where an employee has acted fraudulently or 
dishonestly, is in breach of that employee’s obligations to the Company, or has received awards based on financial accounts which are later 
restated.
Combined Incentive Plan – a variable component of total remuneration.  Two thirds of the incentive value is paid as cash subject to the 
achievement of annually set KPIs and one third is an annual allocation of performance rights deferred as an equity award subject to a two 
year service, performance and share price hurdle.
Earnings Per Share (EPS) – determined by dividing the Group NPAT by the weighted average number of the Company’s ordinary shares on

for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly.
Group Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) – is the net profit earned by the Group after deducting all expenses including interest, depreciation and 
tax.  From time to time, in determining outcomes under the incentive plans, the Board may use its discretion to apply the underlying NPAT 
which in the Board’s opinion reflects the Company’s operating results.
Key Management Personnel (KMP) – those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities 
of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise) of that entity.  KMP comprise Executives and 
Non-Executive Directors and are detailed on pages 34 and 43.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the financial year ended 30 June 2016 
1. CORPORATE INFORMATION 
The financial report of WorleyParsons Limited (Company or parent entity) for the financial year ended 30 June 2016 was authorized for issue in 
accordance with a resolution of the directors on 24 August 2016.
WorleyParsons Limited is a company limited by shares incorporated in Australia whose shares are publicly traded on the Australian Securities 
Exchange (ASX: WOR). WorleyParsons Limited is a for-profit entity for the purposes of preparing the financial statements.
The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company are described in note 3. 
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(A) BASIS OF ACCOUNTING 
(i) Basis of preparation 
This general purpose financial report has been prepared in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) and 
other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB).
The Group is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/191 (Rounding in Financial /Directors' Reports) issued by the Australian 
Securities and Investments Commission, relating to the “rounding off” of amounts in the Directors’ Report and financial statements. Unless 
otherwise expressly stated, amounts have been rounded off to the nearest hundred thousand dollars in accordance with that Instrument. Amounts 
shown as 0.0 represent amounts less than AUD 50,000 which have been rounded down. 
(ii) Statement of compliance 
The consolidated financial report complies with International Financial Reporting Standards and interpretations as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
(iii) Historical cost convention 
The financial report has been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value. 
The carrying values of recognized assets and liabilities that are hedged with fair value hedges are adjusted to record changes in the fair values 
attributable to the risks that are being hedged. 
(iv) Critical accounting estimates 
In the application of AAS, management is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about carrying values of assets and liabilities. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period 
of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Management has identified the following critical accounting policies for which significant judgments, estimates and assumptions are made: 
•  revenue recognition, refer note 4; 
•  goodwill and intangible assets with identifiable useful lives, refer note 10; 
•  project, warranty and other provisions, refer note 11; and 
•  recovery of deferred taxes, refer note 29. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions and may materially affect financial results or the financial 
position reported in future periods. 
(v) Adoption of new and amended accounting standards 
The Group has adopted the following amendment from 1 July 2015: 
•  AASB 2013-9 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Conceptual Framework, Materiality and Financial Instruments [AASB CF 2013-1, AASB
1031, and AASB 9].
Adoption of this amendment did not have any material effect on the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Comprehensive Income and 
Statement of Financial Position of the Group.
WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016  57
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
(vi) New accounting standards not yet applicable 
The following new accounting standards have been issued or amended but are not yet effective and have not been adopted by the Group for the 
annual reporting period ended 30 June 2016:
Effective 1 July 2016:
AASB 2014-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations  
[AASB 1 & AASB 11]
AASB 2014-3 provides guidance on the accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations in which the activity constitutes a business to 
apply, to the extent of its share, all the principles in AASB 3 Business Combinations and other AAS except for those principles that conflict with the 
guidance in AASB 11. Furthermore, entities are required to disclose the information required by AASB 3 and other AAS for business combinations. 
The impacts of this amendment are not expected to be material for the Group’s financial statements.
AASB 2014-4 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation [AASB 116 & 
AASB 138]
AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment and AASB 138 Intangible Assets both establish the principle for the basis of depreciation and amortization as 
being the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits of an asset. The IASB has clarified that the use of revenue based methods 
to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate because revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset generally 
reflects factors other than the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in the asset. The amendment also clarified that revenue is generally 
presumed to be an inappropriate basis for measuring the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in an intangible asset. This presumption, 
however, can be rebutted in certain limited circumstances. The amendment is not expected to impact the Group’s financial statements.
AASB 2014-9 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements
AASB 2014-9 amends AASB 127 Separate Financial Statements, and consequentially amends AASB 1 First-time Adoption of Australian Accounting 
Standards and AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, to allow entities to use the equity method of accounting for investments in 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their separate financial statements. AASB 2014-9 also makes editorial corrections to AASB 127. The 
amendment is not expected to impact the Group’s financial statements.
AASB 2014-10 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
AASB 2014-10 amends AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures to address an 
inconsistency between the requirements in AASB 10 and those in AASB 128, in dealing with the sale or contribution of assets between an investor 
and its associate or joint venture. The amendments clarify that the gain or loss resulting from the sale or contribution of assets that constitute a 
business, as defined in AASB 3 Business Combinations, between an investor and its associate or joint venture, is recognized in full. However, any gain 
or loss resulting from the sale or contribution of assets that do not constitute a business is recognized only to the extent of unrelated investors’ 
interests in the associate or joint venture. The impact of this amendment is not expected to be material to the Group’s financial statements.
Effective 1 July 2017:
2016-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses: Amendments to AASB 112
This Standard amends AASB 112 Income Taxes to clarify the requirements on recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses on debt 
instruments measured at fair value. The impacts of this amendment are not expected to be material to the Group’s financial statements.
2016-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to AASB 107 
This Standard amends AASB 107 Statement of Cash Flows to require entities preparing financial statements in accordance with Tier 1 reporting 
requirements to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, 
including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes. The amendment is expected to enhance the Group's disclosure in relation to 
interest bearing loans and borrowings with minor additional changes.
Effective 1 July 2018:
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and AASB 2014-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 15
AASB 15 addresses how revenue is recognized and will require the Group to identify contracts and performance obligations, determine the 
transaction price, allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. 
AASB 2014-5 incorporates the consequential amendments to a number of AASBs (including interpretations) arising from the issuance of AASB 15. 
The Group has not finalized its assessment of how changes to the rules for revenue recognition will impact the Group’s financial statements.
AASB 9 Financial Instruments
AASB 9 is the AASB’s replacement for AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The standard includes requirements for 
classification, recognition and measurement, impairment, derecognition and general hedge accounting. The Group has not yet finalized its 
assessment of how changes to the rules for financial instruments will impact the Group’s financial statements.
Effective 1 July 2019:
AASB 16 Leases 
AASB 16 is the AASB's replacement for AASB 117 Leases. The standard includes new recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements for 
lessees. The Group has not yet finalized its assessment of how the new lessee accounting requirements will impact the Group's financial statements.
58  WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016
(B)  BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all entities controlled by WorleyParsons Limited as at 30 June 2016 and 
the results of all controlled entities for the financial year then ended. WorleyParsons Limited and its controlled entities together are referred to in this 
financial report as the consolidated entity or the Group. Investments in associates are equity accounted and are not part of the consolidated entity 
(refer note 21).
The impact of all transactions between entities in the consolidated entity is eliminated in full. Non-controlling interests in the results and equity 
of controlled entities are shown separately in the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Comprehensive Income and Statement of 
Financial Position.
Non-controlling interests not held by the Company are allocated their share of net profit after tax in the Statement of Financial Performance and of 
total comprehensive income net of tax in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, and are presented within equity in the Statement of Financial 
Position, separately from the equity of members of WorleyParsons Limited. 
(C) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 
Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the entity operates (functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the Group’s 
presentation currency.
Translation of foreign currency transactions 
Transactions denominated in a foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency 
receivables and payables at balance date are translated at foreign exchange rates at balance date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are brought to 
account in determining the profit and loss for the financial year. 
(D) OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Significant and other accounting policies that summarize the measurement basis used and are relevant to the understanding of the financial 
statements are provided throughout the notes to the financial statements.

The previously reported segment results for the year ended 30 June 2015 have been restated to be comparable with the revised segmentation approach as 
required by AASB 8 Operating Segments. The Group has also included additional information segmented according to its customer sector groups.
1 Segment revenue represents aggregated revenue, which is defined as statutory revenue and other income plus share of revenue from associates less procurement
revenue at nil margin, interest income and net gain on revaluation of investments previously accounted for as joint operations. The directors believe the disclosure of 
revenue attributable to associates provides additional information in relation to the financial performance of the Group.
2 Segment result is segment revenue less segment expenses and excludes the items listed in note 3(H). It is the key financial measure that is presented to the chief
operating decision makers.

WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016  61
3. SEGMENT INFORMATION (continued) 
(G) IDENTIFICATION OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 
The Group has identified its operating segments based on the monthly internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Chief Executive Officer 
(CEO), Group Managing Director Finance / CFO and other Group Managing Directors (chief operating decision makers) in assessing performance 
and in determining the allocation of resources. Effective 1 July 2015, the Group established its advisory and consulting business, Advisian, as an 
additional business line.  As a result, the business operations are managed and reported by the following business lines: Services, Major Projects, 
Improve and Advisian.  Changes in business lines reporting also included, amongst other changes, the Group’s Canadian construction and 
fabrication business Cord now being reported as a part of Major Projects. In addition, during the financial year 2016, a fully costed information 
technology model was introduced which resulted in transition of selected costs from global support costs as disclosed in the previous period to each 
of the operating business lines in the current period.  This represents a change to the operating segments reported in the previous corresponding 
period. The previously reported segment results for the year ended 30 June 2015 have been restated to be comparable with the revised segmentation 
approach as required by AASB 8 Operating Segments. The Group has also included additional information segmented according to its customer 
sector groups. 
(H) ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND INTER-SEGMENT TRANSACTIONS 
Segment revenues and expenses are those that are directly attributable to a segment and the relevant portion that can be allocated to the segment on 
a reasonable basis.
Segment revenues, expenses and results include transactions between segments incurred in the ordinary course of business. These transactions are 
priced on an arm’s length basis and are eliminated on consolidation.
The accounting policies used by the Group in reporting segments internally are the same as those contained in these financial statements and are 
consistent with those in the prior period.
The segment result includes the allocation of overhead that can be directly attributed to an individual business segment. The following items and 
associated assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments as they are not considered part of the core operations of any segment: 
•  impairment of goodwill; 
•  global support costs; 
•  Arkutun-Dagi project settlement costs; 
•  interest and tax for associates; 
•  amortization of acquired intangible assets; 
•  staff restructuring costs; 
•  onerous lease contracts; 
•  onerous engineering software licenses; 
•  write-down of investments in equity accounted associates; 
•  certain functional currency related foreign exchange gains; 
•  net gain on revaluation of investments previously accounted for as joint operations; 
•  net borrowing costs; and 
•  income tax expense. 
(I)  MAJOR CUSTOMERS  
The most significant customer accounted for 5.6% (2015: 6.4%) of aggregated revenue and is within the Services, Major Projects, Improve  and 
Advisian business lines and Hydrocarbons customer sector group.

During the year ended 30 June 2016, the Group finalized the acquisition accounting for an additional net interest in entities which had previously 
been accounted for as joint operations. This resulted in a $4.5 million net gain on revaluation of investments previously accounted for as joint 
operations. There was no such transaction during the year ended 30 June 2015.
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 
Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of trade allowances, duties and taxes paid. Revenue is recognized and measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenues are recognized net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST). The following specific recognition criteria must be met before 
revenue is recognized:
62  WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016
Professional services and construction and fabrication 
Revenue from cost plus contracts is recognized by reference to the recoverable costs incurred during the reporting period plus the percentage of 
fees earned. Contract revenue and costs are recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method unless the outcome of the contract 
cannot be reliably estimated. Where it is probable that a loss will arise from a contract, the excess of total costs over revenue is recognized as an 
expense immediately. Where the outcome of a contract cannot be reliably estimated, contract costs are recognized as an expense as incurred, and 
where it is probable that the costs will be recovered, revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred. Incentive payments on contracts are 
recognized as part of total contract revenue where it is probable that specified performance standards are met or exceeded and the amount of the 
incentive payment can be reliably measured.  For fixed price contracts, the stage of completion is measured by reference to costs incurred to date as a 
percentage of estimated total costs for each contract.
Procurement 
Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the costs incurred or to be 
incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. Risks and rewards of ownership are considered passed to the buyer at the time of 
delivery of the goods to the customer.
Interest 
Interest income is recognized as it accrues using the effective interest rate method.
Dividends 
Revenue is recognized when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established.
KEY ESTIMATES 
Percentage of completion 
The percentage of completion is estimated by qualified professionals. The Group considers the terms of the contract, internal models and other 
sources when estimating the projected total cost and the stage of completion.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 
Employee benefits 
Employee benefits expenses are charged against profit on a net basis in their respective categories. 
(i) Share based payments – performance rights 
Performance rights (rights) over the ordinary shares of WorleyParsons Limited are granted to executive directors and other executives of the 
consolidated entity for nil consideration in accordance with performance guidelines approved by the Board. The fair values of the rights are 
amortized on a straight line basis over their performance period. For share settled rights, the fair value of the rights is the share price at grant date 
adjusted for the impact of performance hurdles and other vesting or exercise criteria attached to the right. For cash settled rights, the fair value of the 
rights is recalculated at the end of each reporting period and amortized on a straight line basis over their vesting period. The accounting estimates 
and assumptions relating to equity settled rights would have no impact on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next annual 
reporting period but may impact expenses and equity.
WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016  63
5. EXPENSES AND LOSSES/ (GAINS) (continued)
Fair value per right at grant date is independently determined using an appropriate option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, 
the term of the right, the vesting and performance criteria, the impact of dilution, the non-traded nature of the right, the share price at grant date and 
expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the right. This amount 
represents the actual cost to the Company. A Monte Carlo simulation is applied to fair value the TSR element and the SPPRs. For the EPS, EBIT and 
“continuous employment" condition, the Black-Scholes model is utilized. Total fair value at grant date is calculated by multiplying the fair value per 
right by the number of rights granted. This does not represent the actual value the executive will derive from the grant, which will depend on the 
achievement of performance hurdles measured over the vesting period. The maximum value of the rights granted has been estimated based on the 
fair value per right. The minimum total value of the rights granted, if the applicable performance hurdles are not met, is nil. 
(ii) Employee share plan 
Employees in eligible countries were invited to participate in an employee share plan. Shares purchased under the employee share plan are subject 
to dealing restrictions until the restriction end date. The Group will grant one bonus entitlement to a share for every five shares purchased through 
the employee share plan which vests on the restriction end date at which point it will convert to an ordinary share. The Group accounts for the 
bonus entitlements as equity settled share based payments. The employee share plan has closed to new participants, effective from 1 May 2016.
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred, except when they are included in the costs of qualifying assets. 
Borrowing costs include: 
•  interest on bank overdrafts, and short term and long term loans and borrowings; 
•  amortization of discounts or premiums relating to loans and borrowings and non-current payables; and 
•  finance lease charges. 
Operating lease rentals – minimum lease payments 
The minimum lease payments of operating leases, where the lessor effectively retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the 
leased item, are recognized as an expense on a straight line basis. Lease incentives are recognized in the Statement of Financial Performance as part 
of the total lease expense.
Depreciation and amortization 
Property, plant and equipment
Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to write off the net cost of each item of property, plant and equipment (excluding land) over its 
expected useful life to the consolidated entity. The expected useful lives for plant and equipment range from three to 10 years. The estimated useful 
lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period.
The cost of improvements to or on leasehold properties is amortized over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the 
improvement to the consolidated entity, whichever is the shorter.
Identifiable intangible assets
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the useful life 
and tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period for an intangible asset 
with a finite useful life is reviewed at least each financial year end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of 
future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for prospectively by changing the amortization period. The amortization expense on 
intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the Statement of Financial Performance on a straight line basis over the following periods: 
•  customer contracts and relationships 
•  trade names 
 
•  computer software 
•  other 
 
Goods and Services Tax (GST) 
Expenses are recognized net of the amount of GST except where the GST incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority. In these 
circumstances, GST is recognized as part of the expense.

The benefit for tax losses will only be recognized if: 
•  the consolidated entity derives future assessable income of a nature and of an amount sufficient to enable the benefit from the deductions for the
losses to be realized; or
•  the losses are transferred to an eligible entity in the consolidated entity; and 
•  the consolidated entity continues to comply with conditions for deductibility imposed by tax legislation; and 
•  no changes in legislation adversely affect the consolidated entity in realizing the benefit from the deductions for the losses.
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 
Income tax 
The income tax expense for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the income tax rate for each jurisdiction 
adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as any adjustments required between prior periods’ current tax expense and income 
tax returns and any relevant withholding taxes.
Current and deferred tax amounts relating to items recognized directly in equity are recognized in equity and not in the Statement of Financial 
Performance.
Tax consolidation 
WorleyParsons Limited and its wholly owned Australian entities elected to form a tax consolidated group from 1 July 2003. On formation of the tax 
consolidated group, the entities in the tax consolidated group entered into a tax sharing agreement which, in the opinion of the directors, limits the 
joint and several liability of the wholly owned entities in the case of a default by the head entity, WorleyParsons Limited.
The entities have also entered into a tax funding agreement under which the wholly owned entities fully compensate WorleyParsons Limited for any 
current tax liability assumed and are compensated by WorleyParsons Limited for any current tax loss, deferred tax assets and tax credits that are 
transferred to WorleyParsons Limited under the tax consolidation legislation.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 
Cash and cash equivalents in the Statement of Financial Position comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding 
bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included within interest bearing loans and borrowings in current liabilities in the Statement of Financial 
Position. Cash flows are included in the Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis. The GST component of cash flows arising from investing and 
financing activities is classified as an operating cash flow.
Where cash and cash equivalents held by the Group are subject to external restrictions, the nature of the restrictions and value of cash subject to 
these restrictions are disclosed below.
PROCUREMENT AND RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
Included within cash and cash equivalents is $83.6 million (2015: $107.5 million) which has been identified as for procurement ($69.4 million) or 
restricted, but available for use under certain circumstances by the Group ($14.2 million).
Procurement cash is held in relation to procurement activities undertaken by the Group on behalf of its customers (refer note 27). Restricted cash is 
held in relation to guarantees (refer note 25(A)) and financing activities.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 
All trade and other receivables are recognized at the original amounts less an allowance for any impairment of receivables. An allowance for 
impairment of receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect debts. The recoverable amount of trade 
and other receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Receivables are stated with the amount of GST included.
Unbilled contract revenue is stated at the aggregate of contract costs incurred to date plus recognized profits less recognized losses and progress 
billings. Contract costs include all costs directly related to specific contracts, costs that are specifically chargeable to the customer under the terms of 
the contract and an allocation of overhead expenses incurred in connection with the Group’s activities in general.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired at the time of acquisition of a 
business or shares in controlled entities or associates. Goodwill on acquisition of controlled entities is included in intangible assets and goodwill on 
acquisition of associates is included in investments in associates. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of 
goodwill relating to the entity sold.
68  WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016
Identifiable intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired separately or in a business combination have finite useful lives and are initially measured at cost. The cost of an intangible 
asset acquired in a business combination is its fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at 
cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangible assets are not capitalized and 
expenditure is recognized in the profit and loss in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Research costs are expensed as incurred. An intangible asset arising from development expenditure on an internal project is recognized only when 
the Group can demonstrate: 
•  the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;  
•  its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset; 
•  how the asset will generate future economic benefits; 
•  the availability of resources to complete the development; and  
•  the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. 
Impairment of assets 
Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is tested annually, unless impairment is indicated. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) that are 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those groups 
of CGUs. Goodwill is allocated to six CGUs. These CGUs represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal 
management purposes. Each CGU is set out below. Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the groups of CGUs to which 
the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the groups of CGUs is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized.
Impairment losses recognized for goodwill are not subsequently reversed. Assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for 
which there are separately identifiable cash flows (CGUs). Impairment testing calculations use cash flow projections based on financial forecasts of 
how the business is expected to perform consistent with current and historical experience and external data. The estimation of future cash flows 
requires assumptions to be made regarding future uncertain events. Management has risk adjusted the future cash flows to recognize challenging 
market conditions.  The risk adjusted revenue growth rates for the all CGUs range from 2% to 5%. The Group has initiated an overhead reduction 
program and intends to decrease total costs (including direct and overhead) by approximately 5%, excluding any benefits from uncommitted 
restructuring. A risk premium is included in determining each CGU's discount rate, reflecting the level of forecasting, size, country and financing 
risks for that CGU.
KEY ESTIMATES 
The goodwill allocated to the material CGUs and the key assumptions used for the value in use impairment testing are as follows:

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 
The combined fair value in the all the CGUs exceed the carrying value by over $800 million. Management recognizes that the cash flow projections, 
discount and growth rates used to calculate the value in use may vary from what has been estimated.
The value in use estimate is particularly sensitive to the achievement of long-term growth rates, discount rates and the forecast performance 
improvement program. The Group has performed detailed sensitivity analysis as part of its impairment testing to ensure that the results of its testing 
are reasonable.
Sensitivity analysis on the inputs for all CGUs are as follows: 
•  Terminal growth rates: a 1% decrease in the terminal growth rate will result in all CGUs listed above being free of impairment at reporting date;  
•  Post tax discount rates: a 0.5% increase in the discount rate will result in all the CGUs listed above being free of impairment at reporting date; and 
•  Forecast cash flows: a 3% decrease in the forecast cash flows will result in all the CGUs listed above being free of impairment at reporting date

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 
Provisions are recognized when the consolidated entity has a legal, equitable or constructive obligation to make a future sacrifice of economic 
benefits to other entities as a result of past transactions or other past events, it is probable that a future sacrifice of economic benefits will be required 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Employee benefits 
Provision is made for employee benefits accumulated as a result of employees rendering services up to the reporting date. These benefits include 
wages and salaries, annual leave, sick leave, severance pay and long service leave.
Liabilities arising in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave, sick leave and any other employee benefits expected to be settled within 12 months 
of the reporting date are measured at their nominal amounts based on remuneration rates which are expected to be paid when the liability is settled. 
All other employee benefits or liabilities are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made in respect of services 
provided by the employees up to the reporting date. In determining the present value of future cash outflows, the high quality corporate bond rate 
with terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related liability, is used.
Deferred revenue 
The Group at times receives payment for services prior to revenue being recognized in the financial statements. Revenue is classified as deferred due 
to the criteria required for its recognition not being met as at the reporting date, in line with the accounting policy set out in note 4. It is expected this 
revenue will be earned within two years of balance date.
Project provisions 
Where the outcome for a services contract is expected to result in an overall loss over the life of the project, this loss is provided for when it first 
becomes known that a loss will be incurred.
Insurance 
Provision for insurance liabilities is recognized in line with actuarial calculations of unsettled insurance claims, net of insurance recoveries. 
The provision is based on the aggregate amount of individual claims incurred but not reported that are lower in value than the insurance deductible 
of the consolidated entity. It is based on the estimated cost of settling claims and consideration is given to the ultimate claim size, future inflation as 
well as the levels of compensation awarded through the courts.
Onerous leases 
Provisions for onerous leases are recognized when the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease obligations under the contract exceed the economic 
benefits expected to be received under it.
Warranties 
Provision is made for the estimated liability on all products and services still under warranty at balance date. This provision is estimated having 
regard to prior service warranty experience. In calculating the liability at balance date, amounts were not discounted to their present value as the 
effect of discounting was not material. It is expected that these costs will be incurred within two years of balance date.
In determining the level of provision required for warranties, the Group has made judgments in respect of the expected performance and the costs of 
fulfilling the warranty. Historical experience and current knowledge have been used in determining this provision.
WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016  71
11. PROVISIONS (continued)
Deferred consideration 
Deferred consideration arising from a business combination is initially measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. Subsequently, it is measured 
in accordance with AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. Where settlement of any part of the consideration for a business 
combination is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is 
the Group’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under 
comparable terms and conditions.
Dividends payable 
Provision is made for the amount of any dividends declared, determined, announced or publicly recommended by the directors before or at the end 
of the financial year but not distributed at balance date. 
12. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development 
of the business. The Board monitors the return on equity, which the Group defines as profit after income tax expense divided by the average total 
shareholders’ equity, excluding non-controlling interests. The Board also determines the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and 
security afforded by a sound capital position.
The Board monitors this through the gearing ratio (net debt/net debt plus total equity), the size of available banking facilities and the assessment 
of the outlook for the Group operations. The target for the Group’s gearing ratio is between 25% and 35%. The gearing ratio at 30 June 2016 and 
30 June 2015 was as follows:
Total interest bearing loans and borrowings1 
Less: derivatives2 
Less: cash and cash equivalents
Net debt 
Total equity
Gearing
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the financial year.
Neither the Group nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 
Interest bearing loans and borrowings 
Loans and borrowings are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognized in the Statement of 
Financial Performance over the period of the loan using the effective interest rate method.
Finance lease liability 
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalized at the 
inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognized as an expense in the Statement of Financial Performance.
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred, except when they are included in the costs of qualifying assets.  
A qualifying asset is defined as an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale.  Borrowing costs 
include: 
•  interest on bank overdrafts, and short term and long term loans and borrowings; 
•  amortization of discounts or premiums relating to loans and borrowings and non-current payables; and 
•  finance lease charges.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 
Issued and paid up capital is recognized at the fair value of the consideration received by the Group. Any transaction costs arising on the issue of 
ordinary shares are recognized directly in equity as a reduction of the share proceeds received. 
(B)  TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ISSUED CAPITAL 
Ordinary shares 
Ordinary shares have the right to receive dividends as declared and, in the event of the winding up of the Company, to participate in the proceeds 
from the sale of all surplus assets in proportion to the number of and amounts paid up on shares held. Ordinary shares entitle their holder to one 
vote, either in person or by proxy, at a meeting of the Company.
Exchangeable shares 
The exchangeable shares were issued by WorleyParsons Canada SPV Limited as part of the consideration for the acquisition of the Colt Group. 
Exchangeable shares may be exchanged into ordinary shares of the Company on a one for one basis (subject to adjustments) at any time by the 
exchangeable shareholders.
Exchangeable shares have the right to receive the same cash dividends or cash distributions as declared on the ordinary shares into which they are 
convertible. In the event of the winding up of the Company, the exchangeable shares would convert to ordinary shares, which would participate in 
the proceeds from the sale of all surplus assets pro-rata with other ordinary shares.
The exchangeable shares, through a voting trust which holds a special voting share in the Company, entitle their holders to vote at the Company’s 
general meetings as though they hold ordinary shares. During the financial year ended 30 June 2016, 580,189 (2015: 197,150) exchangeable shares 
were exchanged.
Special voting share 
The special voting share was issued to Computershare Trust Company of Canada Limited (Trustee) as part of the consideration for the acquisition of 
the Colt Group. The special voting share does not have the right to receive dividends as declared, and in the event of the winding up of the 
Company is unable to participate in the proceeds from the sale of all surplus assets. The special voting share has a right to vote together as one class 
of share with the holders of ordinary shares in the circumstances in which shareholders have a right to vote, subject to the Company’s Constitution 
and applicable law. The Trustee must vote in the manner instructed by an exchangeable shareholder in respect of the number of votes that would 
attach to the ordinary shares to be received by that exchangeable shareholder on exchange of its exchangeable shares. The special voting share has an 
aggregate number of votes equal to the number of votes attached to ordinary shares into which the exchangeable shares are retracted or redeemed.
1 Included in ordinary shares are 2,540,875 (2015: 3,121,064) exchangeable shares. The issuance of the exchangeable shares and the attached special voting share replicate 
the economic effect of issuing ordinary shares in the Company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, exchangeable shares are treated in the same single class of issued 
capital as ordinary shares. In addition, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) treats these exchangeable shares to have been converted into ordinary shares of the 
Company at the time of their issue for the purposes of the ASX Listing Rules.  Ordinary shares have no par value and the Company does not have a limited amount of 
authorized capital. The WorleyParsons Limited Plans Trust holds 218,818 (2015: 267,173) shares in the Company, which have been consolidated and eliminated in 
accordance with the accounting standards.

The expected volatility was determined based on the historical share price volatility of the Company. The resulting expected volatility therefore 
reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

(A) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION RESERVE 
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of 
foreign controlled entities and associates, and the net investments hedged in their entities. 
(B)  HEDGE RESERVE 
The hedge reserve is used to record gains or losses on hedging instruments used in the cash flow hedges that are recognized directly in equity. 
Amounts are recognized in the Statement of Financial Performance when the associated hedged transaction affects the profit and loss.
The total amount recognized in the Statement of Financial Performance in relation to hedge ineffectiveness was a loss of $0.3 million (2015: 
$0.0 million). This amount is included in professional services costs.
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 
Specific hedges 
Hedging is undertaken to avoid or minimize potential adverse financial effects of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Gains or losses 
arising upon entry into a hedging transaction intended to hedge the purchase or sale of goods or services, together with subsequent foreign 
exchange gains or losses resulting from those transactions, are deferred up to the date of the purchase or sale and included in the measurement of 
the purchase or sale.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither 
planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognized directly in 
equity in the foreign currency translation reserve.
At each balance date, the Group measures the effectiveness of its cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument is recognized directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognized in the profit and loss. 
(C) PERFORMANCE RIGHTS RESERVE 
The performance rights reserve is used to recognize the fair value of performance rights issued but not vested. 
(D) ACQUISITION RESERVE 
The acquisition reserve is used to record differences between the carrying value of non-controlling interests before acquisition and the consideration 
paid upon acquisition of an additional shareholding, where the transaction does not result in a loss of control.

MEASUREMENT 
Basic earnings/(loss) per share 
Basic earnings/(loss) per share is determined by dividing the profit/(loss) attributable to members of WorleyParsons Limited by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year.
Diluted earnings/(loss) per share 
Diluted earnings/(loss) per share is calculated as profit/(loss) attributable to members of WorleyParsons Limited adjusted for: 
•  costs of servicing equity (other than dividends); 
•  the after-tax effect of dividends and interest associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares that have been recognized as expenses; and 
•  other non-discretionary changes in revenues or expenses during the period that would result from the dilution of potential ordinary shares,
divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element.

18. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
(A) OVERVIEW 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise receivables, payables, bank loans and overdrafts, finance leases, cash and short term deposits 
and derivatives. The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: 
•  credit risk; 
•  liquidity risk; and 
•  market risk. 
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and 
managing risk, and the management of capital. Quantitative disclosures are included throughout this financial report.
1 The Group has sufficient credits in its foreign income account to ensure that there should be no Australian dividend withholding tax withheld on dividends paid to non-
resident shareholders. The unfranked portion of the dividend represents conduit foreign income.
1 In the period performance rights which could be considered dilutive but were considered antidilutive were 1,204,233.
WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016  77
18. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management framework. The Audit and Risk Committee assists 
the Board in overseeing the integrity of the Group’s financial reporting risk management framework and internal controls.
Risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to 
monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the 
Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive 
control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management 
controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Committee. 
(B)  CREDIT RISK 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. 
The financial assets of the Group comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and derivative financial instruments and off 
Statement of Financial Position guarantees and letters of credit. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of 
these instruments. Exposure at balance date is addressed in each applicable note. Credit exposure of derivatives is considered to be any positive 
market value.
Trade and other receivables 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The profiles of the Group’s customer 
base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, have less of an influence on credit risk. Geographically and 
on a customer basis, there is no concentration of credit risk.
The Group has a credit policy under which each new customer is analyzed for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery 
terms and conditions are offered. The Group’s review includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases bank references.
The Group has established an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables. 
This allowance comprises only those components that are individually significant.
Guarantees 
Details of outstanding guarantees are provided in note 25(A). The Group is, in the normal course of business, required to provide guarantees and 
letters of credit on behalf of controlled entities, associates and related parties in respect of their contractual performance related obligations.
Maximum credit exposure 
The carrying amount of the Group’s financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the 
reporting date was:
Cash and cash equivalents 
Trade receivables, unbilled contract revenue and retentions 
Other receivables 
Amounts owing by associates and related parties 
Derivatives
The ageing of the Group’s trade receivables, unbilled contract revenue and retentions at the reporting date was:
Unbilled contract revenue 
0-30 days 
Past due 31-60 days 
Past due 61-90 days 
Past due 91-120 days

Based on historic default rates, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of receivables not past due or past due by up 
to 30 days other than for specifically identified accounts. The Group’s typical payment terms are 30 days from date of invoice.
The allowance amounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the 
amount owing is possible; at that point, the amount is considered irrecoverable and is written off against the financial asset directly.
Counterparties with receivables neither past due nor impaired are assessed as creditworthy.
78  WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016
(C) LIQUIDITY RISK 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity 
is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, 
without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses including the servicing of financial obligations; 
this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.
The Group has unrestricted access at balance date to the following lines of credit:

(D) MARKET RISK 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, will affect the Group’s income or 
the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within 
acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return. The Group enters into derivatives, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage 
market risk. Generally, the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to reduce volatility in the profit and loss. 
(i) Currency risk 
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional 
currencies of Group entities. In the ordinary course of business, the Group structures its contracts to be in the functional currency of the country 
where the work is performed and costs incurred.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from 
the reporting date. When necessary, forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity.
Interest on loans and borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations for the Group 
resulting in an economic hedge. Interest is primarily AUD, CAD, GBP and USD denominated.
A number of the Group controlled entities have a functional currency other than AUD. The exchange gains or losses on the net equity investment of 
foreign operations are reflected in the foreign currency translation reserve within the equity attributable to members of WorleyParsons Limited. 
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations is managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the 
relevant foreign currencies. 
(1) CROSS CURRENCY SWAPS 
The Group uses cross currency swaps to hedge its foreign currency interest rate risk, most with a maturity of greater than one year from the 
reporting date.
At balance date, the details of cross currency swaps were:

(2) FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange rate transaction risk on foreign currency sales and purchases, and loans to and from related entities. The 
most significant foreign exchange risk is USD receipts by Australian and other non-US entities. When required, hedging is undertaken through 
transactions entered into in the foreign exchange markets. Forward exchange contracts have been used for hedging purposes and are generally 
accounted for as cash flow hedges.

As these contracts are hedging anticipated future receipts and sales, to the extent that they satisfy hedge accounting criteria, any unrealized gains 
and losses on the contracts, together with the cost of the contracts, are deferred and will be recognized in the measurement of the underlying 
transaction provided the underlying transaction is still expected to occur as originally designated. Included in the amounts deferred are any gains 
and losses on hedging contracts terminated prior to maturity where the related hedged transaction is still expected to occur as designated.
The gains and losses deferred in the Statement of Financial Position were:
Effective hedge – unrealized gains 
Effective hedge – unrealized losses

(ii) Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The Group enters into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that the majority of its exposure to 
interest rates on borrowings is on a fixed rate basis.

As the largest component of interest bearing liabilities, being notes payable, are at fixed interest rates, the effect of changes in interest rates on equity 
and profit of the Group is negligible. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are non-interest bearing. 
19. FAIR VALUES
DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES 
The Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. 
Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further 
information about the assumptions used in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.
Derivatives 
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price for the residual 
maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes. 
Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market 
interest rates for similar instruments at the measurement date.
Non-derivative financial liabilities 
Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. For finance leases, the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements.
FAIR VALUES COMPARED TO CARRYING AMOUNTS 
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying values with the exception of interest bearing loans and borrowings which 
have a fair value of $1,394.0 million (2015: $1,385.5 million) and a carrying value of $1,243.9 million (2015: $1,240.1 million).
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of a financial asset or liability: 
•  Level 1 – the fair value is calculated using quoted prices in active markets; and 
•  Level 2 – the fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices). The Group's interest bearing loans and borrowings and derivative instruments including 
interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts fall within Level 2 of the hierarchy.
Derivative instruments including interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts are restated to fair values at each reporting date based on 
market observable inputs such as foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves.
Fair values of the Group’s interest bearing loans and borrowings are determined by discounting future cash flows using period-end borrowing rates 
on loans and borrowings with similar terms and maturity.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2, and no financial instruments were measured at Level 3 (where fair value is measured using 
unobservable inputs for the asset or liability) for the periods presented in this report.
1 Excludes capitalized borrowing costs.

In accordance with the accounting standards, the Group discloses only significant entities identified on the basis of materiality. 
(B)  ACQUISITION OF CONTROLLED ENTITIES 
During the year ended 30 June 2016, the Group finalized the acquisition accounting for an additional net interest in entities which had previously 
been accounted for as joint operations. This resulted in a $4.5 million net gain on revaluation of investments previously accounted for as joint 
operations.
On 24 October 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the voting shares of MTG Limited (MTG) and its controlled entities. MTG is a US based 
management consulting firm in the oil and gas, petrochemicals and chemicals industries with operations in North America, the United Kingdom 
and Australia. The acquisition was made as a building block in the growth of Advisian, the advisory business of the Group.
There were no other changes to the acquisition values recognized in the 30 June 2015 financial statements.
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 
Controlled entities 
Where control of an entity is obtained during a financial year, its results are included in the Statement of Financial Performance and the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income from the date on which control commences. Where control of an entity ceases during a financial year, its results are included 
for that part of the year during which control existed.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary that does not result in a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
Acquisition of assets and business combinations 
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are 
acquired. Cost is measured as the fair value of the assets given up, shares issued or liabilities undertaken or assumed at the date of acquisition. 
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Where equity instruments are issued in a business combination, 
the value of the instruments is their market price as determined by market valuation at the acquisition date. Transaction costs arising on the issue of 
equity instruments are recognized directly in equity.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is 
remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through the profit and loss.
1 Entities subject to Australian Securities and Investments Commission Class Order 98/1418 relief.
84  WorleyParsons Annual Report 2016
Except for non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale (which are measured at fair value less costs to sell), all identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, 
irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of the business combination over the net fair value of the Group’s 
share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the Group’s share of the net fair value of 
the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary, the difference is recognized as a gain in the Statement of Financial Performance, but only after a 
reassessment of the identification and measurement of the net assets acquired.
Where settlement of any part of the consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date 
of exchange. The discount rate used is the Group’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from 
an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 
Investments in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the 
consolidated entity’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses after tax of associates is recognized in the Statement of Financial Performance and 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognized in consolidated reserves. The 
cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the cost of the investment. Associates are those entities over which the consolidated 
entity exercises significant influence, but not control.

standards, they have not been reclassified as current assets in the Statement of Financial Position on the basis of materiality.
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale and measured at the lower of their carrying value, and fair value less costs to 
sell, if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction. They are not depreciated or amortized. For an asset or disposal 
group to be classified as held for sale, it must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable.
An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is 
recognized for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment 
loss previously recognized. A gain or loss not previously recognized by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognized 
at the date of derecognition.
The assets and liabilities are presented separately on the face of the Statement of Financial Position except where the amounts involved are 
considered immaterial.

Contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from or payable to the taxation authority. 
(B)  ACTUAL AND PENDING CLAIMS 
The Company is subject to various actual and pending claims arising in the normal course of business. The Company has regular claims reviews, 
including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The 
directors are currently of the view that the consolidated entity is adequately provided in respect of these claims in accordance with the accounting 
policy set out in note 11. 
(C) ASBESTOS 
Certain subsidiaries acquired as part of the Parsons acquisition (Parsons E&C), have been, and continue to be, the subject of litigation relating to the 
handling of, or exposure to, asbestos. Due to the continuation and extension of the existing indemnity and asbestos claims administration 
arrangements between Parsons Corporation and Parsons E&C Corporation, the Group is not aware of any circumstance that is likely to lead to a 
residual contingent exposure for the Group in respect of asbestos liabilities. 
26. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
Since the end of the financial year, the directors have resolved to pay no dividend (2015: 22.0 cents per share, unfranked).
Unless disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements, no other material matter or circumstance has arisen since 30 June 2016 that has significantly 
affected, or may significantly affect: 
•  the consolidated entity’s operations in future financial years; 
•  the results of those operations in future financial years; or 
•  the consolidated entity’s state of affairs in future financial years. 
27. PROCUREMENT 
In certain situations, the Group will enter into contracts with its customers which require the Group to procure goods and services on behalf of the 
customer.
Where the risks and rewards associated with the procurement activities are assumed by the Group, the revenues and expenses, and assets and 
liabilities are recognized on a gross basis in the Statement of Financial Performance and Statement of Financial Position.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to apply when the assets are recovered or 
liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates which are enacted or substantially enacted for each jurisdiction. The relevant tax rates are applied to 
the cumulative amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences to measure the deferred tax asset or liability. An exception is made for 
certain temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability. No deferred tax asset or liability is recognized in relation to 
these temporary differences if they arose in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time did not affect either accounting profit or 
taxable profit and loss.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in 
controlled entities where the parent entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Current and deferred tax amounts relating to items recognized directly in equity are also recognized in equity and not in the Statement of Financial 
Performance.
KEY ESTIMATES 
Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will 
be available to utilize those temporary differences.

Our oblectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the linancial report as a whole is

tree irom material misstatement, whether due to lraud or error. and to issue an auditor's report that

includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level oi assurance, but is not a guaranteethat
an audit conducted In accordance Wlth Australian Audltlnq Standards wlll always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inlluence the economic
deCIsionS of users taken on the basis 0! this tirlianclal report

As part ol an audit in accordance with Australian Auditing standards, we exercise prolessional

judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

I Identify and assess the rISkS of material mlsstaternent of the financial report, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those rislis, and obtain audit
evidence that is suflicient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from l‘raud is higher than tor Dne resulting irnm error,
as lreud may involve collusion, lorgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override
of internal control.

. Obtain an understanding oi internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purposeot expressing an

estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors,

. Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors‘ use of the going concern basis ol accounting in
the preparation at the linancial report We also conclude, based on the audit evidence obtained,
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and conditionsthat may cast signilicant
doubt on the entitv‘s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the disclosures in
the financial report about the material uncertainty or, ii such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify the opinion on the linancial report. However, luture events or conditions may cause an
entity to cease to continue as a going concern

. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial stalements represent the underlyinq
transactions and events in a mannertnat achieves fair presentation.

. Obtain sutlicient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information ol the entities or
business activities within the Groupto express an opinion on the financial report. We are

the audit and signilicant audit findings, including any significant deﬁciencies in internal control that

we identify during our audit.
