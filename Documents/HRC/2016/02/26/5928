their functioning, and encourages continuing efforts aimed at improving the effectiveness of the 
treaty body system with a view to a more coordinated approach to its activities and standardized 
reporting, including by streamlining, rationalizing, rendering more transparent and otherwise 
improving working methods and reporting procedures, inter alia by: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Reducing the duplication of reporting required under the different instruments as

improve further the quality of their work, including by avoiding unnecessary duplication;  
</p>

</p>
<p> 8. <i>Urges</i> States to: 
</p>

submitting their core documents or initial reports under United Nations human rights

non-accumulation of United Nations human rights mandates at a time;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Expresses its appreciation</i> for the technical cooperation and training activities 
undertaken and reiterates that a priority of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights should be to provide assistance to States parties, upon their request and, if 
possible, in coordination with other United Nations bodies, Governments and other interested 
parties, in order to assist States:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) In the process of ratifying United Nations human rights instruments;

<p>treaty bodies, and encourages the Office to continue to enhance its use of modern technologies, 
such as webcasts, with a view to strengthening the treaty body system and its visibility and 
making it more accessible to the public, including persons with disabilities, and making more 
efficient use of existing resources, including through harmonizing the treaty body websites and 
providing the option to States of submitting and receiving electronic copies of documentation 
rather than hard copies;  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Emphasizes</i> the need to ensure financing and adequate staff and information 
resources for the operations of the human rights treaty bodies, in particular in view of the 
additional demands placed on the system by the creation of new treaty bodies and their 
mandates, new reporting requirements, the increasing number of ratifications and enhanced 
reporting by States and, with this in mind, reiterates its request that the Secretary-General 
provide adequate resources in respect of each treaty body while making the most efficient use of 
existing resources, in order to give the human rights treaty bodies adequate administrative 
support and better access to technical and legal expertise and relevant information;
