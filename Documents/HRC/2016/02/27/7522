<p><b> I. General comments 
</b>4. The Report contains a critical view as regards the realization of the human right to 
safe drinking water and sanitation. The Report, however, does not spell out the ongoing 
progress achieved through public policies and the recent evolution of basic sanitation 
indicators registered throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>5. It would also be important to mention the significant commitments the Brazilian 
Government has made regarding investments in the sector in the recent past.  
</p>
<p>6. Strictly speaking, considering that the Report is restricted to water and sanitation 
sewage &#8211;the latter understood as &#8220;sanitation&#8221;, according to the United Nations &#8211; one should 
bear in mind that those actions implemented by the Brazilian government have a broader 
scope. This is based on the fact that the Brazilian Government considers the concept of 
&#8220;basic sanitation&#8221;, as stated in Law 11.447/2007, in broader terms than the concept 
employed by the UN. According to the referred law, &#8220;basic sanitation&#8221; includes a set of 
services, infrastructures and operational installations for supplying safe drinking water, 
sanitary sewage, urban cleaning, and handling of solid wastes and drainage of the urban 
pluvial waters.  
</p>
<p>7. Therefore, it is important to point out that the term &#8220;sanitation sewage&#8221;, instead of 
&quot;basic sanitation&quot;, is the correct terminology when referring to the Brazilian experience. As 
explained  above, the concept of sanitation sewage  adopted by Brazil has a broader 
meaning than the concept of <i>basic sanitation </i>as applied by the UN (also named <i>improved 
sanitation)</i> &#8211;  which focuses on the immediate removal of wastes (the focus is not on the 
process &#8211; collection, treatment, and final disposition in the environment, but on the 
sanitation equipment of households). In this sense, it is not possible to establish a clear 
comparison between the efforts the Brazilian Government has made to ensure the right to 
sanitation sewage with those of other countries, even when these countries make an effort 
to implement water and sanitation networks, for example. 
</p>
<p>8. What should be highlighted &#8211; and this is the singular contribution of Brazil in the 
international context &#8211; is the extent to which the right to sanitary sewage, as applied in 
Brazil, is both a legal and institutional progress (as to include the entire sanitary sewage 
process chain) and, also, the extent to which the concept of <i>basic sanitation </i>adopted in the 
country is even broader, so as to include water management, sanitation sewage, 
cleaning/waste handling and drainage. This means that the broader the content of the right 
to water and sanitation is, the greater the effort must be to ensure its fulfillment. Brazil 
expects this explanation to be properly considered in the evaluation of the Report.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/55/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>9. It is also worthwhile to remember, in this case, that many of the principles of the 
Basic Sanitation Law are similar to the principles of the human right to safe drinking water 
and sanitation. In this way, the Brazilian legislation precedes the recognition of these rights 
by the UN.  
</p>
<p>10. The federal government is conscious that a significant portion of the population is 
not provided with the above mentioned services, and it has carried out initiatives towards 
universalizing access to basic sanitation. In order to achieve this goal, it has adopted 
measures to improve its planning and management and has supported state governments to 
carry out physical infrastructure projects in order to make effective progress in terms of the 
coverage and quality of the services provided.  
</p>
<p>11. In the last few years, the Federal Government has considerably expanded its 
investments in basic sanitation, allocating resources from the National Budget&#8211; OGU. 
These resources correspond to subventions provided by the Federal Government to expand 
the services, and they are not reimbursed by the states, cities, and service providers. Such 
investments, therefore, do not impact on the costs for supplying or on the fees for such 
services.  
</p>
<p>12. Besides the resources provided by the OGU, budgets from special funds were also 
increased, such as the Severance Pay Funds (FGTS) and Workers Welfare Fund (FAT), for 
the purpose of expanding investments in safe drinking water and sewage infrastructure. It is 
useful to remember that resources for investments from FGTS and FAT are contracted with 
subsidized interest rates, below the normal market rate. Regarding FGTS, it should also be 
pointed out that the Law that creates the fund establishes that its resources must be applied 
to investments in the fields of housing and sanitation. Such measures seek to guarantee and 
stimulate financing and, thus, implement and expand the infrastructure for supplying safe 
drinking water and sanitation sewage with a smaller impact on the prices.  
</p>
<p>13. This process was intensified, especially by means of the Growth Acceleration 
Program &#8211; PAC launched in 2007, which marks the resumption of public investments in 
basic sanitation, with a considerable increase in resources applied to the sector. For the 
purpose of comparison, between 2000 and 2006, R$18.4 billion was destined to basic 
sanitation (at an annual average of R$2.6 billion in investments), while between 2007 and 
2013, after launching the PAC, R$83.9 billion was channeled to basic sanitation (at an 
annual average of R$12 billion). It is possible to perceive a significant progress, as the 
annual budget destined to basic sanitation more than quadrupled between the two analyzed 
periods. 
</p>
<p>14. Such contributions seek to correct the greatest <i>deficits</i> registered and they are 
aligned with the priority placed on the realization of the human right to safe drinking water 
and sanitation, as pointed out on the Report. Consequently, a great increase in the service 
coverage is expected to follow the conclusion of the projects.  
15. These investments demonstrate the effort of the Federal Government to 
progressively reach, in partnership with Brazilian states and cities, the universalization of 
basic sanitation services, in such a way as to promote social inclusion and to make it 
possible for the Brazilian population to have substantial improvements in the quality of 
their lives. In the following topics, more data is presented to demonstrate the progress 
achieved by Brazil in this field.  
</p>
<p>16. Besides the increase in public investments in basic sanitation, government 
expenditure in other fields has also increased. In the last decade, there were progressive 
increases in the minimum salary, an amount used as a reference for social security and 
welfare programs, and for the expansion of cash transfer programs. More recently, the Plan 
&quot;Brazil without Extreme Poverty&quot; (PBSM), a strategy to eradicate poverty and extreme 
poverty, was implemented. The PBSM places its focus on families whose <i>per capita </i></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/55/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>income is less than R$ 70.00 (seventy reais) per month and it is based on three axes: basic 
income guarantees, urban and rural productive inclusion and access to public services, such 
as water and sanitation sewage. There has been an increase in the amount paid for &#8216;Bolsa 
Familia&#8217; (or &quot;Family Grant&quot;, a direct cash transfer program), which is part of the PBSM, 
besides the increase in the number of families attended by it. Besides that, the PBSM 
increases access to water supply and sanitary sewage services through building houses and 
cisterns for supplying dispersed rural areas with rain water.  
</p>
<p>17. Another important social initiative, which directly impacts on access to basic 
sanitation services, is the &quot;My House, My Life (MCMV)&quot; program, implemented by the 
Federal Government to meet the historical lack of adequate housing among lower income 
families in the country. In its first stage, which began in 2009, the Program contributed to 
the construction of 1 million houses. Currently, its second phase is underway, whose aim is 
the construction of another 1 million houses. The program causes positive impacts on basic 
sanitation, considering that, in order to build the houses, the government requires that water 
and sewage supply services are provided. Furthermore, providing adequate housing 
represents, per se, a great leap forward in terms of environmental conditions and life quality 
for low income and marginalized groups.  
</p>
<p>18. The results from the PAC, MCMV and PBSM demonstrate progressive reduction in 
the number of people in poverty and extreme poverty and the progressive expansion in 
access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, whether the beneficiaries live in rural 
or in urban areas. Sectorial policies, plans, and programs for women, elderly, indigenous 
people and traditional populations, such as maroons, have also been designed and are being 
implemented, establishing goals to enlarge the access by these groups to services of safe 
drinking water and sanitation. The main evidence of this is the indicators on access to these 
services, the physical growth of the systems (water management and sewerage networks 
and connections), the increase of individual solutions &#8211; especially of cisterns for collecting 
rain water &#8211; and the increase of the percentage of treated sewage in Brazil.  
</p>
<p>19. Recent measures were also implemented to reduce electric energy fees in 
percentages varying according to the sector benefited (the productive or the domestic 
consumer sector). For the productive sectors, the reduction can be up to 32% and, for 
residences, up to 18%. A reduction in the cost of safe drinking water and sanitation for 
service providers is expected. Moreover, the reduction in family expenses with electric 
energy will make more income available for expenses on safe drinking water and sewage 
services.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Constraints regarding the sampling space and the duration of 
the field visits 
</b></p>
<p>20. Brazil is a country with a large territory, regional diversity and countless 
peculiarities. It is the largest country in South America and the fifth largest in the world, 
with a territory equivalent to 47% of the entire South America. According to the Brazilian 
Geographic and Statistical Institute &#8211; IBGE, its population has already exceeded 200 
million inhabitants, spread in five regions. In these regions, there are 5,570 cities, dispersed 
among 26 states and the Federal District.  
</p>
<p>21. To give an accurate account of this scenario is challenging, particularly when it 
comes to providing information on such a complex field as basic sanitation. To elaborate 
scenarios in order to better understand situations of different regions across the country, 
considering their characteristics and peculiarities, would require more research and field 
investigation, with a longer duration and more representative sampling space.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/55/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>22. It is understood that a field visit is not enough to undertake a research study with 
these characteristics. On the other hand, it is important to stress that these limitations in the 
research study bear an impact on the Report, as it could be seen on generalized conclusions 
contained in parts of the document. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Specific comments on the report, following its structure. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal and institutional framework  
</b></p>
<p>23. The assessment according to which the actions of the PAC are not aligned with the 
Basic Sanitation Program of the Multiannual Plan (PPA) is not accurate. Three sections 
integrate the National Basic Sanitation Plan (PLANSAB): Integrated Sanitation, Rural 
Sanitation, and Structural Sanitation. Those sections are fully in accordance with the Basic 
Sanitation Program of the Multiannual Plan (PPA) 2012-2015. Their goals are in line with 
principles, challenges, and federal strategies for the realization of the right to safe drinking 
water and sanitation, as pointed out below.  
</p>
<p>24. It is appropriate to point out that the Multiannual Plan &#8211; PPA, as described in article 
165 of the Federal Constitution, regulated by the Decree 2.829, from October 29th 1998 - is 
a medium term plan that establishes Guidelines, Objectives, and Goals to be followed 
during the following four years. Each PPA enters into force in the second year of the 
presidential mandate and lasts until the end of the first year of the following mandate. It 
also defines the role to be played by the Government, during the aforementioned period, 
through programs of continued duration already instituted or to be instituted in the medium 
term. The objectives of the PPA have been defined as guidelines for implementing public 
policies.  
</p>
<p>25. After the adoption of the PPA, it became mandatory for the Government to plan all 
its actions and budget in such a way as not to breach the guidelines contained in the 
Multiannual Plan. In other words, the Government could only make investments in strategic 
programs described in the PPA for a specific period. The PPA is divided into action plans, 
and each plan must contain the following items: an objective, the Government entity that is 
responsible for executing the project, price, time period for conclusion, financing sources, 
indicators for defining the situation the plan seeks to change, the need for goods and 
services for the full realization of the plan, actions which were not planned in the Union&#8217;s 
budget, regionalization of the plan, etc. The Decree that regulated the PPA provides for the 
integration of the public branches (federal, state, and municipal) and for the integration of 
these with the private sector. 
</p>
<p>26. It is appropriate to point out that some of these objectives established in the PPA 
explicitly seek to reach the most vulnerable populations and regions, as mentioned in the 
following statements:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Objective 0353 &#8211; </b>Implement structuring measures that seek to improve management 
in basic sanitation, comprising the organization, planning, service providing, 
regulations, and inspection, participation and social control; <b> 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Objective 0355 &#8211; </b>Expand the coverage of the actions and services of basic 
sanitation in rural, traditional, and special communities (maroons, agrarian reform 
settlements, indigenous people, and others), and the dispersed rural population, 
prioritizing solutions which enable service sustainability; <b> 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Objective 0610 &#8211; </b>Expand the coverage and improve the quality of the sanitation 
services in urban areas, by means of implementation, expansion, and structuring 
improvements of the safe drinking water supply, sanitation sewage, drainage, and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/55/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>handling of pluvial water, and urban solid wastes, focused on populations in need 
in urban clusters and small-sized towns located in pockets of poverty. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>27. The scope of these objectives comprises, among others, many goals of the PAC 
which reflect the distinctive strategies of the Federal Government in order to expand access 
to services, such as:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Contracts of R$ 600 million for carrying out projects and plans in the field of  basic 
sanitation;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Implementation of sanitation projects in 750 rural, traditional, and special  
communities, and in 375 communities of maroons (&quot;quilombolas&quot;);  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Contracts of R$ 1.3 billion and R$ 960 million to support investments in sanitation 
sewage and safe drinking water supply in towns with populations under 50 thousand 
inhabitants;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Contracts of R$ 14.5 billion and R$ 6.5 billion  to support investments in sanitation 
sewage and safe drinking water supply in towns with low access rates to these 
services or insufficient treatment services. 
</p>
<p>28. The Brazilian Government considers that the Report could be improved by treating 
more precisely the federal strategies underway to eradicate inequalities related to the access 
to sanitation services in rural areas. The PAC and &quot;Brazil without Extreme Poverty&quot;, for 
instance, are important innovations in planning and management which reinforce the 
impact of policies to guarantee the access to safe drinking water and sanitation and the 
inclusion of vulnerable populations. Among the initiatives adopted to improve the 
conditions for implementing policies, one should keep in mind the following: the expansion 
of investment, the combined work of different government sectors to implement policies, 
the rising number of agreements between the federal, state and local governments and the 
creation of a specific procedure for decentralized use of resources allocated from the federal 
budget &#8211; transfers  involved in these procedures were qualified as mandatory  and non-
contingent, thus increasing the number of cities capable of having access to these resources. 
It is also worth recalling the reduction of financial compensations and the flexibility of 
limits for indebtedness of states and cities (which provided federal units with no capacity to 
invest with access to financial resources), the availability of standardized projects and the 
financial support for their drafting, the creation of a Differentiated Contracting Regime 
(RDC), which reduces time required for bidding process, the active search for those in 
extreme poverty to provide services, as well as intensive monitoring of the contracted 
operations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. The human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in 
Brazil 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Water availability 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Priority for personal and domestic uses 
</b></p>
<p>29. In paragraph 49 of the Report, the Special Rapporteur refers to the concern 
expressed by civil society organizations regarding the real objectives of the Integration 
Project of the S&#227;o Francisco River Basin &#8211; PISF. Environmental licensing and the 
authorization for using the hydric resources do not contemplate uses other than meeting the 
needs of human beings. The proposal for the revitalization of the S&#227;o Francisco river basin 
is also an answer to the social concern about the capacity for providing support to the 
continued use of the project. As far as social participation is concerned, it is also important </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/55/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>to say that the project was discussed by the S&#227;o Francisco River Basin Committee 
(CBHSF), in the National Council of Hydric Resources (CNRH) &#8211; integrated by 
representatives from Ministries and Special Secretariats of the Presidency of the Republic, 
hydric resources State councils, hydric resource users (irrigators; factories; concessionaries 
and companies authorized to operate hydroelectric power plants; fishermen, and users of 
water for recreational and tourism purposes; public service providers of safe drinking water 
and sanitation services and waterway transport) and representatives from civil society 
organizations (committees, consortiums, and inter-municipal associations of river basins; 
technical and research organizations with interest in the field of hydric resources; and non-
governmental organizations). Moreover, many public hearings were held by the Brazilian 
Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources - IBAMA at the time 
environment licenses were granted.  
</p>
<p><b> B Physical accessibility 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Informal settlements 
</b></p>
<p>30. While recognizing the challenge portrayed in the Report to improve the quality of 
life of people living in substandard clusters, it is also worth recalling the Government's 
growing effort to expand access to sanitation by citizens who live in these areas. The 
Adequate Housing Program of the PPA 2012-2015 has the specific objective to &#8220;Improve 
the living conditions of low income families who live in precarious settlements, develop 
initiatives necessary to urban and rural regularization, to the promotion of safety and health 
conditions and to improve housing conditions, by means of carrying out integrated housing 
initiatives, infrastructure, and social-environmental inclusion&#8221;. To achieve this objective, 
the goal of &#8220;Making R$ 30.5 billion available through public bids to urbanize precarious 
settlements&#8221; was established.  
</p>
<p>31. Through PAC, initiatives to urbanize precarious settlements have significantly 
increased, by means of their association with integrated sanitation projects and 
collaboration to increase the amount of budget and non-budget resources invested in their 
realization. Accordingly, an agreement has been achieved to promote an overarching 
federative agenda of investments (around R$ 21.5 billion) with the aim of providing such 
settlements with adequate housing, safe drinking water and sewage services, garbage 
collection, urban revitalization and environmental protection. The greatest portion of 
investments (around R$ 19 billion) has been assigned to 178 towns and cities which 
correspond to over 90% of the households located in the 6300 precarious settlements 
identified in 323 towns and cities in the 2010 Census performed by IBGE. It is also 
appropriate to underline the goal of the Basic Sanitation Program to &#8220;Contract R$ 3 billion 
to support the integrated sanitation interventions in towns and cities with low indexes of 
access or unsatisfactory quality in two or more components of sanitation&#8221;, whose aim is to 
serve the needs of precarious settlements.   
</p>
<p>32. While recognizing the challenge pointed out in the Report on the constraints that 
land tenure imposes on access to sanitation, it is also worth mentioning innovative 
measures adopted in the scope of PAC to make more flexible the presentation of documents 
to prove land ownership, therefore allowing to implement and to accelerate the performance 
of projects. Furthermore, it is useful to keep in mind the great effort made to advance the 
national legislation on the regularization of lands of social interest. For example, one should 
bear in mind the amendments made to Law 11.977, of 2009, and Law 10.188, of 2001, 
which made it possible that transactions of &quot;My House, My Life&quot; projects  funded by FAR 
resources (Residential Leasing Fund) be used to purchase properties which have not yet 
concluded its expropriation process, which allows the expansion of the program and 
benefits especially urbanization and regularization projects in precarious settlements; and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/55/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>the amendments to Law 6.015, of 1973, with the aim of adjusting and detailing the 
procedures for regularizing urban land settlements (these procedures were provided for by 
Law 11.977, of 2009), as well as facilitating the mechanisms of individualization of public 
properties and its registration in real estate registry offices, for the purpose of making the 
regularization of occupations and their urbanization possible through My House, My Life 
Program.  
</p>
<p><b>  Rural areas and the drought problem 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur, at the end of paragraph 65 of the Report, states that &#8220;it is 
essential that the government, in allocating cisterns to populations in the semiarid regions, 
takes into account the specific composition of each household, not relying simply on 
averages, in order to accommodate the number of cisterns distributed to the actual size of 
each family group&#8221;. The &#8220;Cistern Program&#8221;, in order to make access to water universal, is 
based on statistics regarding the average composition of family units in the semiarid region. 
The average was based on studies which show that this solution is appropriate for most 
families. At the operational level, the adoption of the average family unit as a standard 
allows the Program to achieve faster and more comprehensive results. Large family units 
(such as the one composed of 14 members, as referred to by the Special Rapporteur) have 
been the exception, not the rule, in the region. Once universalization is achieved, the 
Program will be able to develop mechanisms to deal with specific cases, based on other 
criteria.  
</p>
<p>34. Regarding rural areas and the drought issue, the recent evolution of indicators 
related to access to sanitation can help put in context the challenge of guaranteeing the 
enjoyment of such right to the rural population. Although great inequalities between rural 
and urban areas persist, there has been a reduction in the gap regarding access to water and 
sanitation sewerage over the last years, which indicate improvements and reduction of 
inequalities, as shown in the following graphs:

<p><b>  Water and sanitation quality 
</b></p>
<p>36. In this topic, the Report deals with the negative impacts of the lack of sanitation on 
people's health, pointing out the vulnerability of children under 5 years old. This challenge 
could also be analyzed in the light of recent improvements in the reduction of the gap 
regarding access to sanitation sewage based on age criteria (see the following graph).  The 
most significant progress took place in the age groups between 0 to 3 and 4 to 6 year-olds.

<p><b> III. Participation and Social Oversight 
</b>37. In the paragraph 96, the Report alleges that, in the scope of the PAC, some priority 
investments in the water and sanitation sectors have been chosen without significant and 
active people's participation. This statement is questionable, since the PAC has been 
developed and implemented through the creation of an open dialogue with the federative 
units in order to choose and define investments. In this context, the principle of the 
autonomy of federative units and municipalities must be respected in the formulation and 
execution of interventions, in the light of legal guidelines regarding the participation of 
local communities. At the federal level, people's participation in planning and monitoring 
the works of the PAC is also a constant practice under the scope of the &quot;Council of the 
Cities&quot; (&quot;Conselho das Cidades&quot;) of the Ministry of Cities and their Technical Committees. 
The PAC monitoring procedures include public periodic evaluation. The Program has also a 
website (http://www.pac.gov.br/), making possible greater transparency and allowing more 
social control and scrutiny over the interventions made under its scope.

<p><b> IV. Conclusions and Recommendations 
</b>38. <b>Although universal access to sanitation in Brazil remains a great challenge, 
qualifying last years' achievements as &quot;limited&quot; (paragraph 99 of the Report) does not 
seem accurate.  Good results have been reached regarding indicators of access to 
sanitation over the past years. The improvements are significant nationwide and also 
regarding more vulnerable populations and territorial inequalities, taking into 
account macro-regional sections of the country, as well as other criteria based on race, 
on rural or urban areas, on situations of extreme poverty, and on age. Such 
achievements have been promoted by innovative programs, such as the PAC, and 
&quot;Brazil Without Extreme Poverty&quot;, which have improved sanitation policy focusing 
on greater outreach, greater efficiency, and also on placing priority on more 
vulnerable populations and therefore empowering its impact on reducing social and 
territorial inequalities.  
</b></p>
<p>39. <b>Taking this into account and considering that the PAC is an exponent program 
of these innovations as well as one of the axes of the national strategy of development, 
established in the PPA 2012-2015, the recommendation stated under letter &#8220;e&#8221;, item 
VI, of the Report has already been observed by the federal Government:  
</b></p>
<p><b><i>e) The implementation of PAC investments take place in the existing legal framework, 
also taking account of the priorities delineated for the sector in the context of existing 
annual planning.  
</i></b></p>
<p>40. <b>Concerning the recommendation stated in letter &#8220;j&#8221;, the Decree 5.995/2006 
established the Project Management System for the Integration of the S&#227;o Francisco 
River, and its respective Management Council, which has seats for representatives 
from River Basin Committees. Overall, the federal government has taken a strong 
stance towards placing priority on the supply of water for human consumption in all 
the actions implemented under the scope of the S&#227;o Francisco River Basin Integration 
and Recuperation Project (PISF).  
</b>41. <b>Concrete actions of the Brazilian Government are being implemented in the 
country, under legal frameworks, through public policies, plans and programs, with a 
strong commitment to reaching universal access to water and improvement of the 
quality of sanitary services. Such actions reduce inequalities and guarantee the 
fulfillment of the human right to water and sanitation.  </b></p>

<p>42. <b>These are the preliminary comments of the Brazilian government concerning 
the recommendations contained in the Report. The final comments will be made after 
the Brazilian government receives the final version of the Report and they will be 
based on the debates to be held with all stakeholders in the sanitation sector in Brazil.
