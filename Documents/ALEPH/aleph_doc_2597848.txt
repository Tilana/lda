Commentary on results
Group overview
The Company began the year with three strategic goals, namely:
1.
2.
3.
During the course of the year, it became clear that the best return for shareholders was likely to be
gained by pursuing the first of these as a priority, simply because, without a wharf (and ideally a
wharf of its own) the Company would remain beholden to others and unable to monetize its
substantial timber holdings. Accordingly, the Company committed to developing, as rapidly as
possible, into a sustainable timber-growing business with harvest income, gained from exports
across a wharf, ideally at its Smith Bay site.

Commentary on results (continued)
The Company now considers the development of wharf infrastructure that allows exploitation of the
substantial standing timber resource to be virtually inevitable.
Even so, the Company has maintained its policy of valuing its standing timber at $0, primarily on
the basis that there is currently no deep-water wharf on Kangaroo Island, through which the timber
could be exported to markets in Asia, and neither is there yet a single proposal and a firm timetable
for the permitting and construction of such a wharf.
The valuation basis for the Company’s land is on the basis of its non-forestry (i.e. agricultural) use.
In the event that the Board considers that the situation has altered materially, such that a deep
water wharf with known costs and with a high probability of approval and construction is more likely
than not, the Board will review its valuation approach.
The Company continues to work on wharf development and believes the time is approaching when
it will no longer be appropriate to use its present valuation basis.
Results of operations
Revenue for the period decreased by $15,000 to $85,000 (2015: $100,000), while other income
increased by $86,000 to $100,000 (2015: $14,000).
During the period the fair value of investment properties loss amounted to $nil (2015: $77,000) and
the loss on sale of property, plant and equipment amounted to $34,000 (2015: $13,000).
performance rights AASB 2 Share-based Payment valuation of $1,623,000 (2015: $nil);
Net comprehensive loss for the period was $2,696,000. This is a $1,730,000 increase from last
year’s loss of $966,000. The increase is primarily due to:
•
• wharf feasibility costs increasing by $311,000;
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
higher ASX and registry fees $71,000;
additional consulting fees $43,000;
higher plantation costs $59,000; offset by
increase in fair value of property, plant and equipment by $135,000; and
lower change in fair value of investment property, by $77,000;
other income increased by $86,000; and
tax benefit increase of $58k as a result of the increase in fair value property, plant and
equipment.
