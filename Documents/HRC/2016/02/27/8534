<p><b>  Report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
  Addendum 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Mission to Malaysia</b>*, ** 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention conducted a country mission to 
Malaysia from 7 to 17 June 2010 at the invitation of the Government. During the entire 
visit and in all respects, the Working Group enjoyed the fullest cooperation of the 
Government. The delegation was able to visit all prisons and detention facilities and 
interview in confidence all detainees requested. 
</p>
<p> In its report, the Working Group notes a number of positive aspects, such as the 
drastic reduction in the recourse to the Internal Security Act (1960); the release of a person 
whose detention had been declared arbitrary by the Working Group and the release of some 
leaders of the Hindu Rights Action Force (HINDRAF), who were detained in 2007 for 
organizing protests against the alleged marginalization of ethnic Indians. The Working 
Group also notes that most Malaysian prisons met international standards on conditions. 
</p>
<p> However, with regard to the criminal justice system, the Working Group observes 
the relatively long periods accused persons spend in pretrial detention, sometimes for 
several years. Police agents often fail to inform detainees about their rights to contact 
family members and to consult a lawyer of their choice. Limited pretrial discovery prevents 
defendants from defending themselves and prosecution evidence is not consistently made 
available. The law imposes excessive restrictions on appeals and the habeas corpus 
resource is rarely used, and solely for procedural issues. 
</p>

in the annex to the summary, is circulated in the language of submission only.

<p> The Working Group points out that human rights guarantees in Malaysia are 
hindered by four preventive laws, mainly the Internal Security Act, but also the Emergency 
(Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance, the Dangerous Drugs (Special 
Preventive Measures) Act and the Restricted Residence Act. The Working Group 
recommends that the Government abrogate all these laws as soon as possible. In the 
meantime, emergency ordinance decisions and decisions made by the Appeals Advisory 
Board should be binding on the Home Minister and decisions on the Internal Security Act 
should be subjected to judicial review. 
 Detention under immigration powers does not seem to be in line with international 
human rights law. The Working Group considers that the detention of migrants should be 
decided upon by a court of law, on a case-by-case basis, and pursuant to clear and 
exhaustively defined criteria in legislation under which detention may be used. The 
Working Group received complaints of detainee abuse, inadequate food, water, medical 
care and poor sanitation in most immigration detention centres. The situation at the 
overcrowded Lenggeng detention centre is especially highlighted. The Working Group 
expresses its concern at the caning of immigrants in an irregular situation and the powers 
extended to the Ikatan Relawan Rakyat Malaysia (RELA) volunteer force to be present in 
immigration detention centres and to track down foreigners living in Malaysia without 
valid documents. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group also recommends that the Government change its laws and 
policies related to the detention of asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants in an irregular 
situation, so that detention is decided upon by a court of law, on a case-by-case basis and 
pursuant to clearly and exhaustively defined criteria; rule out systematic immigration 
detention of vulnerable groups of migrants; and provide in all cases for automatic periodic 
review by a court of law on the necessity and legality of detention, as well as an effective 
remedy for detainees. Lastly, the Working Group recommends that the Government of 
Malaysia strengthen the status, powers and functions of the national human rights 
institution SUHAKAM, in accordance with the Paris Principles.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention conducted a country mission to 
Malaysia from 7 to 17 June 2010 at the invitation of its Government. The Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Working Group, El Hadji Malick Sow (Senegal), and its member Roberto 
Garret&#243;n (Chile), expressed their gratitude to the Government of Malaysia for the invitation 
and for the full cooperation extended to the Group in the conduct of its mission. The 
members of the Working Group were accompanied by the Secretary of the Working Group, 
another staff member of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, as well as by two local interpreters. 
</p>
<p>2. During the entire visit and in all respects, the Working Group enjoyed the fullest 
cooperation of the Government and of all authorities it dealt with. The authorities provided 
the delegation with all the necessary information and arranged all the meetings it requested. 
The delegation was able to conduct visits to detention facilities and to interview all 
detainees requested in confidence.  
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group would like to thank the representatives of Malaysian civil 
society, as well as representatives of international organizations and agencies, particularly 
the Office of the Resident Coordinator, for its full support during the mission. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Programme of the visit 
</b></p>
<p>4. During its official visit, the Working Group visited Lenggeng detention centre, 
Kajang prison, the women&#8217;s prison, the drug rehabilitation centre, the psychiatric 
department at the General Hospital and the Cyberjaya police station in Selangor. In 
Sarawak, the Working Group visited Puncak Borneo Prison, the women&#8217;s prison and the 
Integrity School. In Kelantan, it visited Pengkalan Chepa Prison, the women&#8217;s prison and 
the rehabilitation programme. The Working Group also visited Kamuting detention centre 
in Perak and Simpang Renggam detention centre in Johor. In all these facilities, the 
Working Group interviewed prisoners and detainees in private, without the presence of 
guards or witnesses. 
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group met with senior Government authorities from the executive, 
legislative and judicial branches, including the Minister for Home Affairs, the Deputy 
Minister and Deputy Secretary-General II of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Chief 
Justice and the Attorney General of Malaysia. It also held meetings with the Advisory 
Board on Preventive Laws, the national human rights institution SUHAKAM, the Bar 
Council, former detainees and civil society representatives, as well as relatives of former 
detainees. The Working Group also met with representatives of United Nations agencies. 
The mission concluded with a debriefing with the Government on the preliminary 
observations of the Working Group and a press conference. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Institutional and legal frameworks 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political system 
</b></p>
<p>6. Malaysia, a federation of 13 States and 3 federal territories with around 28 million 
inhabitants, has a parliamentary system of government. The Federal Constitution is the 
supreme law of the land. It consecrates the rights of Malaysian citizens and establishes a 
dual justice system based on secular laws (criminal and civil) and sharia (Syariah) laws, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-10638 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>which only applies to Muslims. The dual system of law is provided in article 121 (1A) of 
the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>7. The Constitution provides for freedom of opinion, expression, speech and of the 
press. The law can, however, establish limitations &#8220;in the interest of security (or) public 
order&#8221;. The Constitution also provides for freedom of religion, although Islam is the official 
religion and the practice of Islamic beliefs other than Sunni Islam is restricted.  
</p>
<p>8. According to the Bar Council of Malaysia, Malaysian courts have taken the clear 
position that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not legally binding and that it 
would only be given effect insofar as it is not inconsistent with the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>9. The court system, as far as it is relevant to the present report, was established by the 
former British colonial power and is based on English common law. It consists of high 
courts with original jurisdiction over all criminal cases involving serious crimes and most 
civil cases. A first-class magistrate has jurisdiction to try offences for which the maximum 
term of imprisonment provided by law does not exceed 10 years of imprisonment or is 
punishable with a fine. The magistrate may only pass sentences not exceeding 5 years of 
imprisonment. The jurisdiction of a second-class magistrate is limited to offences for which 
the maximum term of imprisonment does not exceed 12 months or which are punishable 
only with a fine.  
</p>
<p>10. Civil suits are heard by sessions courts. Juvenile courts try offenders under the age 
of 18 years. The Court of Appeal has appellate jurisdiction over high court and sessions 
court decisions. The Federal Court hears appeals of court of appeal decisions. A special 
court tries cases against the King and sultans. The military has a separate system of courts. 
Village head courts (<i>Penghulu</i>), may adjudicate minor civil matters. Syariah (sharia) Law 
deals with religious and family issues and is implemented at the State rather than the federal 
level. Muslims and ethnic Malays are bound in some matters by Islamic religious laws 
administered by Islamic courts.  
</p>
<p>11. Indigenous people in Sarawak and Sabah also have a separate system and hierarchy 
of native courts that has been established in those two States under the Native Courts 
Ordinance (1992) respectively, to hear and determine disputes among native customary 
laws. 
</p>
<p>12. The country does not have a solid, fully independent judiciary based on the principle 
of separation of powers and composed of independent and impartial judges and magistrates. 
The amendment to clause 1 of article 121 of the Federal Constitution, which eliminated the 
term &#8220;judicial power&#8221;, seriously affected the hierarchy between the three powers of the 
State, as the judiciary is no longer at the same level as the executive or the legislative. 
According to the authorities, that amendment does not affect the hierarchy between the 
three branches of the State because there is no such hierarchy or ranking among these 
branches. According to the authorities, the position and effect of clause 1 of article 121 of 
the Federal Constitution prior to and after the amendment remained the same, as both 
subject the judicial power of the courts to federal law. The jurisdiction and powers of the 
courts were at all times subjected to federal law.  
</p><p>13. The Working Group notes, however, that Government action, constitutional 
amendments, legislation and other factors undermine judicial independence. As the courts 
now only have judicial power as accorded to them by Parliament, recourse to judicial 
review has been severely restricted, despite the fact that article 128 of the Constitution 
foresees judicial review of governmental actions on constitutional grounds. As a result, the 
checks and balances on the actions of the executive power and law enforcement agencies 
are very weak. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.11-10638 
</p>
<p><b> B. International human rights obligations 
</b></p>
<p>14. Malaysia is a State party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, albeit with 
certain reservations. Its accession to the former was subject to the understanding that its 
provisions did not conflict with Islamic sharia law and the Constitution. Malaysia ratified 
the Convention on 6 July 2010 but not the Optional Protocol thereto. On 19 July 2010, 
Malaysia withdrew its reservations to articles 5 (a), 7 (b) and 16 (2) of the Convention. 
Malaysia has also withdrawn its reservations to articles 1, 13 and 15 of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child. Malaysia ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities on 19 July 2010, with declarations on articles 3 (b), 3 (a), 5 (2) and 30, and 
reservations to articles 15 and 18. 
</p>
<p>15. Malaysia has not ratified most of the major international human rights instruments. 
It is yet to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the Convention relating to the 
Status of Refugees and the Protocol thereto, the Convention relating to the Status of 
Stateless Persons, the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and the Rome Statute 
of the International Criminal Court (see appendix II). Malaysia is not a party to the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Judicial guarantees 
</b></p>
<p>16. Trials are public, although judges may order restrictions on press coverage. There 
are no jury trials. Defendants have the right to counsel. Strict rules of evidence apply in 
court and witnesses are subject to cross-examination. Bail is sometimes available for those 
who have committed minor offences, including minor drug offences. Depending on the 
seriousness of the offence, a detainee can be held in remand for up to one year. Detainees 
are not allowed to make or receive phone calls, but may write and receive letters. They are 
permitted one visit a week and have unlimited access to their defence lawyer.  
</p>
<p>17. Defendants enjoy the presumption of innocence and may appeal court decisions to 
higher courts. They also may appeal for clemency to the King or local State rulers.  
</p>
<p>18. With regard to the criminal justice system, the Working Group observes the 
relatively long periods accused persons spend in pretrial detention, sometimes for several 
years. This is often due to understaffed and crowed courts.  
</p>
<p>19. The Federal Constitution provides that no person should be deprived of his or her 
life or personal liberty, save in accordance with the law. It also provides that when a person 
is arrested, he is informed as soon as possible of the grounds of arrest and is allowed to 
consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice (article 5, clause 3). However, 
police agents often fail to inform detainees about their rights to contact family members and 
consult a lawyer of their choice. Police officers often question suspects without giving them 
access to legal counsel.  
</p>
<p>20. The Federal Constitution guarantees the rights of a detained person to legal counsel. 
A detained person may appoint and consult a legal counsel of their own choice. The right to 
legal counsel starts from the time of arrest. The right to legal counsel is also available to a 
detained person during a remand proceeding. This is specifically provided for under section 
117 (5) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which states that, in deciding on the period of 
detention, a magistrate should allow representations to be made himself or by a legal </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-10638 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>counsel of choice. In relation to guidelines on how this right to counsel may be exercised, 
section 28A (c) provides that the consultation under paragraph (b) should be within the 
sight of a police officer and in circumstances, insofar as practicable, where their 
communication will not be overheard. Access to legal counsel and communications of 
detained persons with their relatives are both guaranteed under the Federal Constitution. 
With regard to offences to the Internal Security Act, Federal Court Judge Siti Normah 
Yaacob, in the case of <i>Mohamad Ezam Bin Mohd Noor v. Ketua Polis Negara</i> (2002) held 
that the Act made no provision for denial of access to legal representation, which would be 
inconsistent with article 5 (3) of the Federal Constitution.  
21. The Working Group did receive, however, information that limited pretrial 
discovery impedes the right of defendants to defend themselves. Government-held evidence 
is not consistently made available. The law imposes excessive restrictions on appeals.  
</p>
<p>22. The right of detainees and prisoners charged with minimal offences to legal counsel 
would be further strengthened and improved with the establishment of the national legal aid 
foundation, which was proposed by the Malaysian Bar Council to the Prime Minister on 7 
January 2010. On 3 March 2010, the Government agreed that the foundation would be set 
up as a company limited by guarantee under section 16 of the Companies Act 1965 (Act 
125). 
</p><p>23. The objectives of the national legal aid foundation are:  
 (a) To fund the conduct of legal aid in criminal proceedings for and on behalf of 
those needing legal aid; 
</p>
<p> (b) To provide services for lawyers to represent those needing legal 
representation in criminal proceedings; 
</p>
<p> (c) To promote, establish, finance and supervise research in respect of legal aid; 
 (d) To initiate and carry out educational programmes designed to promote the 
understanding of members of the public of their rights, powers, privileges and duties under 
the laws of Malaysia; 
</p>
<p> (e) To provide information to the public on the availability of legal aid in 
criminal proceedings. 
</p>
<p>24. Communication between detainees and their relatives, is guaranteed in Malaysia and 
was upheld in the case of <i>Abdul Ghani Haroon v. Ketua Polis Negara and Another 
Application</i> (2001). In this case, the court held that the detention was, inter alia, mala fide 
by reason of deliberate and unreasonable denial of access to family members. The family 
members had been denied access to the applicants for almost 40 days, despite a formal 
request having been made to the Inspector General of Police. The court also ruled that &#8220;to 
deny the applicants and their families access to one another for such a long period is cruel, 
inhuman and oppressive not only to the applicants but to their families as well&#8221;. Article 149 
of the Federal Constitution provides the power to legislate preventive detention laws. In 
relation to a detainee held under the Internal Security Act, the law does not explicitly 
provide for the right of family members or legal counsel to have full information on 
detention. Rule 27 of the Internal Security (Detained Persons) Rules (1960), which is 
similar to Regulation 2000, only hints at such a right in the case of the death of a detainee.  
</p>
<p>25. The Working Group also received complaints that women do not receive fair 
treatment from sharia courts. 
</p>
<p>26. The Federal Constitution, the Criminal Procedure Code (Act 593) and the Internal 
Security (Detained Persons) Rules do have provisions against incommunicado detention 
and the courts do recognize a detainee&#8217;s right of access to legal representations and family 
members. Rule 81 (1) (a) of the Internal Security (Detained Persons) Rules stipulates that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.11-10638 
</p>
<p>family members or a legal adviser of a detainee held under the Internal Security Act is 
entitled to visit the detainee. Nevertheless, the habeas corpus recourse is currently solely 
used on procedural aspects. In 2009, only 92 habeas corpus recourses were filed: of those, 
only 10 were declared funded.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Preventive laws 
</b></p>
<p>27. General concern was expressed by lawyers and members of civil society concerning 
the four preventive laws: the Internal Security Act (1960); the Emergency (Public Order 
and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance; the Dangerous Drugs (Special Preventive Measures) 
Act and the Restricted Residence Act. These laws establish investigative detention to 
prevent a suspect from fleeing, destroying evidence or from committing a future crime. 
They impede the detainee&#8217;s right to a fair trial, consecrated in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and by international human rights customary law. They also severely restrict 
detainees&#8217; access to legal counsel. 
</p>
<p>28. Preventive laws have been promulgated in order to prevent subversion and to 
suppress organized violence against persons and property. It is meant to safeguard the 
public interest and security of Malaysia. These preventive laws allow State institutions, 
particularly the police and the Office of the Attorney General, to elude the normal penal 
procedure for common crimes and offences. It also gives the Minister for Home Affairs 
excessive powers to keep people in detention indefinitely. The Emergency Ordinance is 
used for this purpose in particular. In the detention centres reserved for detainees under 
these laws, the Working Group found people charged with common offences who should in 
principle be treated under the regular penal procedure. To put people under these preventive 
laws allows the police and the Minister for Home Affairs to detain persons without the need 
to sustain evidence or to probe penal responsibility. 
</p>
<p><b> 1.  Internal Security Act  
</b></p>
<p>29. The Working Group was informed that the Penal Code had been amended to 
establish that the commission and financing of terrorist acts and hostage-taking are specific 
offences under Malaysian law. The Internal Security Act would as a result not be necessary. 
However, suspected terrorists are still being detained under the Act.  
</p>
<p>30. The Internal Security Act has its origins in a similar act during the British colonial 
period and is based on article 149 of the Constitution, which allows for legislation to be 
enacted to combat threats against the security of the State by organized violence or 
insurgency. Since its promulgation in 1960, approximately 20,000 persons have been 
detained under the Act. The Working Group held private interviews with the 15 detainees 
being held in the country under the Act at the time of its visit. 
</p>
<p>31. The Internal Security Act allows the police to arrest people without a judicial arrest 
warrant and hold them for up to 60 days in special police remands centres. People can be 
held in detention during such period without the right to legal counsel and without being 
taken before a judicial court. The Minister for Home Affairs may authorize further 
detention for up to 2 years, a period which may be further extended for an unlimited 
number of 2-year periods. Once released, detainees are subjected to restrictive conditions, 
usually limiting freedom of residence in the national territory, freedom of travel inside and 
outside the country and even freedom of opinion, expression and association. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-10638 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Ministry of Home Affairs has taken steps to conduct a review of the Internal 
Security Act to ensure that it is relevant to the security environment of the present day 
without compromising the stability and security of the country. The Government has 
organized consultations with various stakeholders, including the Malaysian Bar Council 
and civil society organizations, to look into areas that could improve further the existing 
Act, namely with regard to the five main areas causing public dissatisfaction over the Act: 
(a) ministerial powers; (b) treatment of detainees and welfare of their families; (c) duration 
of detention (60 days); (d) detention without trial (arbitrary detention); and (e) public 
perception (the Act is used for political interest). 
</p><p>33. The tabling of amendments to the Internal Security Act had to be postponed, 
however, as the Government felt it was necessary to take a look at the other preventive laws 
in the country, namely the Prevention of Crime Act (1959), section 27 of the Police Act 
(1960), the Banishment Act (1959) (revised in 1972), the Restricted Residence Act (1933), 
the Dangerous Drugs (Special Preventive Measures) Act (1985), and the Emergency 
Ordinance (Public Order and Crime Prevention) (1969). 
34. Although detainees may appeal every six months to the Advisory Board on 
Preventive Laws, its recommendations are not binding and they are not made public. The 
Working Group observed that detainees are not notified of its recommendations. Also 
worrying is the fact that decisions concerning the Internal Security Act cannot be reviewed 
by any court. Detainees may file habeas corpus applications, based only on procedural 
issues, not on their substantive merits. Nevertheless, even when habeas corpus is granted 
and detainees are released, they are frequently arrested again immediately after release. The 
Working Group was also informed that the Act was used in 2008 to detain a Member of 
Parliament, a blogger and a journalist for exercising their rights. The Working Group met 
with the Member of Parliament.  
</p>
<p>35. The Advisory Board makes recommendations to His Majesty Yang Di Pertuan 
Agong, whose decision is binding for the Minister. The writ of habeas corpus is available to 
all cases of detention without trial; this is guaranteed by article 5 of the Federal 
Constitution. Access to legal counsel and communication with relatives are provided for 
under Internal Security (Detained Persons) Rules, as well as other criminal legislation 
dealing with detention. The prison procedure does not deprive prisoners from having 
meetings or discussions with their respective legal advisers. This legal right is provided and 
ensured for all prisoners. Moreover, the Prison Department has further assisted the 
prisoners to meet or enlist legal counsel for court proceedings, appeals, pardon petitions and 
other legal matters requiring the presence of a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>36. The Working Group was informed of the release of some leaders of the Hindu 
Rights Action Force (HINDRAF), who were arrested and detained under the Internal 
Security Act for organizing protests in 2007 against the alleged marginalization of ethnic 
Indians. They were charged with sedition, and some were accused of having links with the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. 
</p>
<p>37. The Working Group met Mat Sah Bin Mohammad Satray, whose detention was 
declared arbitrary by the Working Group and contrary to articles 9 and 10 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights.1 Mr. Satray was released from Kamuntang Prison in 
September 2009 and placed under harsh control orders restricting his movements and 
freedom of speech. He must report every Monday to the Ampang police station. The 
restrictions are so severe that he cannot even visit the local supermarket behind his house or 
his mother&#8217;s grave.

</p>
<p><b> 2. Emergency Ordinance and Dangerous Drugs Act  
</b></p>
<p>38. The Working Group notes that many more people are detained under the Emergency 
Ordinance and the Dangerous Drugs Act. The Minister for Home Affairs may issue a 
detention order for up to 2 years if he considers that such a measure is necessary to protect 
public order, suppress violence or prevent offences involving violence.  
</p>
<p>39. Suspected drug traffickers may be detained for up to 60 days before the Minister for 
Home Affairs issues a detention order. Afterwards, the suspect may be held for successive 
2-year periods, with periodic review by the Advisory Board. In this case, the opinion of the 
Advisory Board is binding for the Minister. 
</p>
<p>40. Malaysia recognizes a person&#8217;s right for a fair hearing or trial under article 8 (1) of 
the Federal Constitution, which provides that all persons are equal before the law and 
entitled to the equal protection of the law. However, section 16 of the Internal Security Act 
does not require the Minister, members of the Advisory Board or any public servant to 
disclose facts or to produce documents, but only those considered to be against the national 
interest to disclose or produce. The procedure of the Advisory Board is governed by 
Internal Security (Advisory Board Procedure) Rules (1972). The Rules are supported by 
article 151 (3) of the Federal Constitution, which provides for restrictions on preventive 
detention and does not require any authority to disclose facts the disclosure of which would, 
in its opinion, be against the national interest. According to the authorities, the restrictions 
applied with regard to hearings before the Advisory Board are justified to protect the 
national interest and security, as promulgated in article 29 (2) of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>41. The Working Group considers that an appearance before an advisory board does not 
fulfil minimal fair trial guarantees. Many accused of common crimes are held under the 
Emergency Ordinance. Defence lawyers may appear on behalf of the detainee, but attend 
the hearing without access to all the documentation, including evidence, and have no right 
to call witnesses. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Powers of the police and the Ikatan Relawan Rakyat Malaysia  
</b></p>
<p>42. The Ikatan Relawan Rakyat Malaysia Volunteer Corps (RELA) was established on 
11 January 1972 with the main task of preserving and maintaining national security. Its 
objective is to assist the relevant authorities in maintaining peace and security for the public 
and the country as a whole. Through amendments to the Essential Rules (Amendment) 
2005 on 1 February 2005, RELA was given the power to assist enforcement authorities, 
namely the police and the Immigration Department, to apprehend foreigners without proper 
documentation. Their roles and functions are thus to implement operations to apprehend 
illegal immigrants, preserve local security and peace (patrol duty in crime prevention), 
undertake &#8220;psychological warfare&#8221; activities; act as the &#8220;eyes and ears&#8221; of the Government, 
perform local social and socio-economic activities, and assist other enforcement agencies, 
such as the Royal Malaysian Police, the Malaysian Department of Insolvency, the Ministry 
of Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism, the Road Transport Department and 
local authorities in carrying out their duties. 
</p>
<p>43. The excessive powers attributed to the police and the RELA leads to situations 
whereby refugees with a recognized status granted by the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees and even Malaysian nationals may be sent to immigration 
detention centres. Once detainees have served their prison sentences for their illegal 
presence on Malaysian territory, they are held in detention centres for an indefinite period 
while awaiting deportation to their countries of origin.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-10638 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>44. Citizens of countries with a strong consular presence can be more or less easily 
deported. However, those nationals whose countries do not have a consulate in Malaysia, or 
whose Government refuses to intervene, may stay in detention indefinitely. 
</p>
<p>45. RELA has shifted its focus to crime-prevention, including cases such as snatch 
thefts, one of the major components of the six national key results areas announced by the 
Government in 2009. In this regard, RELA members are directly involved in the &#8220;feet on 
street&#8221; programme in four sensitive areas, namely in the States of Selangor, Johor, Penang 
and Kuala Lumpur. Through this programme, RELA works closely with the police, 
conducting street patrols, with the aim of deterring snatch theft crimes. RELA members 
involved in the programme are required to undergo two weeks of compulsory basic 
training. To date, 3,663 RELA members have been inducted into the programme.  
</p>
<p>46. RELA has been accused of being responsible for a large number of detentions, 
particularly inside the country. Despite being a volunteer force, RELA is meant to help 
police and other authorities to conduct neighbourhood patrols and track down foreigners 
living in Malaysia without valid documents. Most detentions by RELA were directed 
against non-ethnic Malays and foreigners, reason for which several interlocutors accused 
RELA of promoting discrimination. 
</p>
<p>47. During a meeting with the General Director of RELA, the Working Group was 
informed that most RELA personnel had not been trained, and that those trained had only 
followed a one-day orientation course. Nonetheless, the General Director expressed his 
intention to boost RELA membership from the current 1.6 million to 2.6 million in 2011. 
Many civil society representatives have accused RELA of extorting money from 
immigrants in an irregular situation and physically abusing them.  
</p>
<p>48. The Government informed the Working Group that it took a serious view at 
allegations of unprofessional conduct of RELA officers, including allegations of abuse of 
illegal immigrants at immigration detention centres. Although investigations have to date 
shown that the allegations were unfounded, the Government took preventive steps by 
placing the administration of all detention centres under the Immigration Department with 
effect from 1 July 2009. The Government therefore wishes to assure that there is no more 
opportunity of any form of abuse by RELA officers, given that it is no longer in charge of 
detention centres.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Police detention 
</b></p>
<p>49. In some cases, police agents may arrest individuals without a warrant. Although in 
the regular penal procedure the limit for initial police detention is 24 hours, this is usually 
extended by a magistrate for up to 2 weeks. Extension of the 24-hour period is almost 
always granted by magistrates. Although in some cases magistrates reduce the term of the 
extensions requested by the police, they still grant extensions to assure further 
investigations. 
</p>
<p>50. The Working Group notes that virtually all detainees interviewed stated that they 
had been subjected to ill-treatment and even torture in police stations and detention centres 
in order to obtain confessions or incriminatory evidence. Many detainees told the Working 
Group that they were not informed of their rights while in police detention, particularly the 
right to contact their relatives or to consult a defence lawyer. Some reported that police 
officers even told them that to consult a lawyer would make their situation even more 
complicated. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.11-10638 
</p>
<p><b> D. Pretrial detention 
</b></p>
<p>51. In prison, the ratio of people in pretrial detention to those convicted seems 
proportional and adequate; approximately a third of detainees are on remand. 
</p>
<p>52. Interviews with detainees, however, showed that pretrial detention is unusually long, 
mainly owing to a large backlog of court cases. Additionally, most detainees and prisoners 
interviewed did not have defence lawyers, mostly as a result of their lack of financial 
resources to pay for one. In some cases, detainees and prisoners did not seem to understand 
the importance or the benefits of having a defence lawyer. 
</p>
<p>53. A legal aid system for the regular penal procedure does not exist, though some aid is 
provided to persons charged with crimes that can result in the death penalty. The bar 
associations in peninsular Malaysia and on Borneo play the role of the State on this issue, 
granting legal aid on a pro bono basis to thousands of detainees.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Detention centres and prisons 
</b></p>
<p>54. Government officials told the Working Group that the main objective of detention is 
to rehabilitate, not to punish. A prison sentence can be reduced by a third for good 
behaviour. There is no parole for non-nationals, but they could benefit from a reduction of 
their sentence for good behaviour.  
</p>
<p>55. The Working Group did not receive any complaints concerning treatment by guards 
in detention centres and prisons. Several convict prisoners did state, however, that they had 
been caned, some of them receiving up to 24 strokes. Most had been found guilty of drug 
trafficking, drug possession, rape or robbery. Whippings are supervised by prison 
authorities and attended by medical doctors.  
</p>
<p>56. There are a total of 36,040 prisoners (25,320 convicted and 10,720 on remand), not 
only under the four preventive laws; 531 prisoners are on the death row, although the last 
execution took place in 2009. Serious crimes numbered 18,784, while petty offences 
amounted to 17,256. There are 15 detainees under the Internal Security Act, and between 
5,000 and 6,000 detainees held under the Emergency Ordinance.  
</p>
<p>57. Kajang women&#8217;s prison, Tawau prison, Sandakan prison, Penor prison and Kajang 
prison face serious overcrowding. In Kajang prison, the Working Group found 3,290 
prisoners: 2,492 were convicts. A total of 160 prisoners had been placed in maximum 
security. In the women&#8217;s prison, there were 1,160 detainees: 797 convicted; 9 on death row 
(5 foreigners), and 363 on remand. In the drug rehabilitation centre, there were 440 
detainees. 
</p>
<p>58. In Puncak Borneo prison, opened in October 2008, there were 614 prisoners, 
including 48 women. Its capacity is for 1,000 prisoners. A total of 18 prisoners were on 
death row, although no execution has taken place in the State of Sarawak since 1998. 
Juvenile prisoners between 18 and 21 years old were held in a separate section.  
</p>
<p>59. The Working Group observed that Pengkalan Chepa prison held 1,596 detainees: 
1,133 convicted, 461 on remand, 22 on death row, 29 juvenile offenders, 102 women and 
16 on parole. However, its capacity is only for 1,000 prisoners. Convicted prisoners are 
held in buildings A and B; those remanded in building D; building C is for juvenile 
offenders. In building C, there were 29 identity cards, but only 28 detainees. When the 
Working Group asked the guards, they claimed that the missing detainee was outside 
cleaning. A boy was later presented, but was clearly not the boy on the identity card. The 
Working Group observed that segregation cells were used not for punishment, but to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-10638 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>provide additional security to detainees requesting it or to those with psychological 
disorders.  
</p>
<p>60. Convicts go through four different stages of a rehabilitation programme, which is 
based on reforming the prisoner&#8217;s attitude, developing skills and providing training and 
teaching. Stage one, on orientation and discipline-building, normally takes three months. 
Stage two, self-development, concerns personal enhancement and character reinforcement: 
Muslims follow the Halaqah programme on Islamic teaching; while non-Muslim prisoners 
meet with counsellors. Stage three is about skills development and professional training, 
while Stage four is to follow a community pre-release programme to assist reintegration 
into civil life.  
</p>
<p>61. Prisoners can stay for a maximum of two weeks in segregation cells, where they are 
sent under the order of the Prison Director. The Working Group observed that the 
conditions in prison and in Simpang Renggam detention centre were considerably better 
than those at the immigration detention centres.  
</p>
<p>62. In Simpang Renggam rehabilitation centre, there were 1,235 detainees. Its capacity 
is for 2,000 detainees. The average duration of detention is 2 years, although some 
detainees had been held for 6 years. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Deaths in custody 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Working Group received information that, during the period from 2003 to 2007, 
1,535 people died in prisons, rehabilitation centres and immigration detention centres; 85 
other people died in police custody. Most deaths occurred in hospitals and included a high 
number of persons affected by HIV and AIDS. 
</p>
<p>64. The issue of deaths in police custody was being investigated by the Royal 
Commission to Enhance the Operations and Management of the Royal Malaysian Police. 
The Working Group believes, however, that investigations by external, independent bodies 
are also necessary. In the Working Group&#8217;s view, inquests should be conducted in each 
case as soon as a death takes places. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Detention pursuant to immigration powers 
</b></p>
<p>65. With regard to detention outside the context of criminal law, during its visit, the 
Working Group was seriously concerned by the administrative detention regime applied to 
asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants in an irregular situation. In a population of around 
28 million, between 3 to 4 million are foreign immigrants. It is estimated that at least half of 
them are in an irregular situation or without the necessary documentation. Malaysia is a 
transit point for asylum-seekers, particularly those from Afghanistan and Myanmar. Some 
90,000 foreigners have refugee status as determined by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and mainly live in Kuala Lumpur. A 
significant number of migrants from, inter alia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nepal also live 
in the country without authorization. 
</p>
<p>66. There is no special legislation relating to refugees and asylum-seekers in Malaysia, 
since they are not recognized as such under domestic law; indeed, current legislative 
framework does not even recognize the terms &#8220;refugees&#8221; and &#8220;asylum-seekers&#8221;. It is 
understood that any non-citizens of Malaysia entering the country without the necessary 
documents and permits are categorized as illegal migrants, dealt with according to the 
relevant laws and punished accordingly.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.11-10638 
</p>
<p>67. Illegal migrants are detained under the Immigration Act for the purposes of making 
inquiries or investigations into an offence under the law, and also for removing from 
Malaysia any foreigners who violate the provisions under the Act. 
</p>
<p>68. While immigrants in an irregular situation are subjected to mandatory detention 
under the Immigration Act, they do have some recourse to a court law. Article 5 of the 
Federal Constitution provides that detained persons should not be detained for more than 24 
hours without authorization by a magistrate, although in the case of immigrants, this period 
is extended to 14 days. Migrants are detained by order of the Director General of 
Immigration and, under the criminal Procedure Code, by a magistrate. Detention of 
migrants in a prison is governed by the Prisons Regulations (2000), which contain 
safeguards on fundamental liberties, inter alia the rights to food, clothing, medical 
examination and treatment, education and recreation, the right to visits and communication.  
</p>
<p>69. The Government has not ratified the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees 
or the Protocol thereto. The Government has yet to put in place a national legal and 
administrative framework for dealing with asylum-seekers and refugees. While the 
Government does not restrict the access of undetained asylum-seekers to the Office of 
UNCHR, it does nothing to facilitate access and, as part of its immigration enforcement 
efforts, often arrests and detains asylum-seekers and refugees.  
</p>
<p>70. Although Malaysia is not a party to the Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees and the Protocol thereto, Malaysia has fulfilled its international obligations to 
persons who have entered Malaysia claiming to be refugees and asylum-seekers through 
special arrangements on humanitarian grounds with UNHCR. 
</p>
<p>71. Persons committing offences under the immigration laws (either travelling without 
travel documents or committing criminal offences) are detained by the relevant authorities. 
However, section 8 (3) of the Immigration Act 1959/63 also sets out to determine persons 
categorized and prohibited from entering Malaysia. In the event, however, that such 
offenders are from vulnerable groups, including minors, families with minor children, 
pregnant women, elderly persons, persons with disabilities and other such persons, the 
authorities are required, on the basis of humanitarian grounds, to take all reasonable 
measures to treat such persons with appropriate care and attention. 
</p>
<p>72. The Working Group believes that detention of migrants should be decided upon by a 
court of law, on a case-by-case basis, and pursuant to clearly and exhaustively defined 
criteria in legislation under which detention may be used. The Government should not use 
immigration detention for asylum-seekers, refugees and vulnerable groups of migrants, 
including unaccompanied minors, families with minor children, pregnant women, 
breastfeeding mothers, elderly persons, persons with disabilities, or people with serious 
and/or chronic physical or mental health problems. 
</p>
<p>73. In all cases, immigrants should be provided with automatic periodic review by a 
court of law of the necessity and legality of their detention at any time.  
</p>
<p>74. Refugees and asylum-seekers are prosecuted for immigration-related offences and 
may be indefinitely detained at immigration detention centres or deported. Malaysia has no 
laws or regulations relating to the status of refugees and asylum-seekers in line with 
international standards. The 24 hours allowed for the police to bring a detainee before a 
magistrate becomes 2 weeks in the case of a foreigner detained under immigration laws.  
</p>
<p>75. In the absence of national refugee legislation, UNHCR performs core protection 
functions, including registration of asylum-seekers, determination of refugee status, 
issuance of identification documentation and promotion of solutions, including voluntary 
return, local integration or resettlement in a third country. UNHCR performs these 
functions, however, as a result of the Government&#8217;s unwillingness to perform what are </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-10638 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>clearly State functions of asylum management. UNHCR does so in the absence of a 
comprehensive legal and administrative framework for managing asylum-seekers. 
</p>
<p>76. The Government believes that the issue of refugees and asylum-seekers requires 
commitments from all States to cooperate in addressing the problems of the mass influx of 
refugees and asylum-seekers faced by many countries, including Malaysia. Such 
commitments would need to take into account the resources available of each State and 
their relevant domestic laws and migration policies. States should take measures jointly to 
eliminate the problems that give rise to persons having to migrate from their country of 
origin. Apart from addressing the issue of refugees, efforts need to be made to assist the 
countries of origin to alleviate the root causes of why their people migrate to other 
countries; only then would the international community to be able address the problem of 
refugees and migration as a whole. 
</p>
<p>77. The capacity of the 13 immigration detention centres in the country is around 6,000 
places. All centres are under the control of the Immigration Department. Approximately 
10,000 people were deported in 2009.  
</p>
<p>78. The Government is working to address the issue of overcrowding, the number of 
detainees has been reduced to an average of 4,500 to 4,800 from the total capacity of 6,640 
of all detention centres. Cooperation with non-governmental organizations and international 
bodies is vital to improve management of immigration detention centres. The Government 
is therefore working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and 
organizations such as Buddhist and Shelter. 
</p>
<p>79. The Government recognized that there is a need to improve conditions in 
immigration detention centres. It is taking steps such as by establishing a new set-up 
comprising personnel from various departments. The Government is also currently looking 
at emulating best practices in detention centre management of other countries such as 
Australia and the Netherlands. An additional allocation of RM100 million was recently 
approved by the Government to upgrade physical conditions and renovations of the centres 
concerned. 
</p>
<p>80. The Working Group was informed that at least six asylum-seekers and migrants had 
died of leptospirosis, an infectious disease, in immigration detention camps. In 2009, 14 
detainees died in immigration detention centres. 
</p>
<p>81. Capacity at Lenggeng detention centre is 1,250, including a block for 250 women. 
As a transit place, detainees should stay for a maximum of 14 days for investigation. The 
Working Group found evidence of overcrowding, insufficient access to potable water, poor 
sanitation and inadequate medical care. Allegations were received of inadequate food and 
lack of ventilation. The unsanitary and overcrowded conditions facilitated the transmission 
of communicable diseases, particularly skin diseases. Three detainees died during the first 
five months of 2010. Some detainees also stated that the overcrowding often led to 
confrontations and fighting between the detainees, with very limited or no intervention at 
all from the security guards.  
</p>
<p>82. The Working Group found a 14-year-old boy who had been in the centre since June 
</p><p>2008. He stated that he was born in Malaysia, although his documents indicated that he was 
Indonesian, as both his parents are Indonesian. He was adopted by a Malaysian family after 
his parents returned to Indonesia in 2006. His adoptive family had not visited him since 
2009. He has no bed in his cell and was uncertain about his future. 
</p>
<p>83. According to the Government, all immigrants are subject to the same criminal 
justice system in Malaysia; detainees may therefore challenge the necessity and legality of 
their detention at any time. This is a common principle of the criminal justice system in 
Malaysia. Migrants who are found in an irregular situation (without valid travel documents) </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.11-10638 
</p>
<p>or commit an offence are charged in court. After the sentence period has been served, 
migrants are kept in immigration detention centres until deportation. The Working Group 
reminds the Government that it is an obligation of the State to guarantee the right to safety 
of all foreigners when it decides to place them in detention. 
</p>
<p>84. In Sabah, concern was also expressed at the detention of foreign children whose 
parents had been deported. 
</p>
<p>85. Migrants found to have violated immigration laws are liable to imprisonment, 
substantial fines and, in some cases, caning. Since 2002, caning has been used to punish 
immigration offences, such as illegally entering the country. The Working Group was 
informed that most of the 10,000 people caned each year are immigrants in an irregular 
situation.  
</p>
<p>86. Upon the conclusion of its visit, the Working Group was informed that no migrant in 
detention was denied the necessary medical treatment.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Monitoring mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>87. Of positive note is the work carried out by the Human Rights Commission of 
Malaysia, SUHAKAM, which in 2009 and 2010 regularly visited prisons and attempted to 
monitor prisons and detention facilities. It is essential that this work be continued and 
indeed increased, particularly with respect to immigration detention. Its mandate also 
includes carrying out analyses and awareness-raising and training activities, as well as 
receiving and investigating individual complaints. The Working Group invites the 
Government of Malaysia to strengthen the status, powers and functions of SUHAKAM, in 
accordance with the Paris Principles. It also calls upon the State to take all measures 
necessary to ensure that it maintains its A-status during the reaccreditation process by the 
International Coordinating Committee.  
</p>
<p>88. Act 597 of 1999 concerning the establishment of SUHAKAM was amended twice in 
2009 to strengthen the Commission further. The Act now provides that commissioners are 
to be appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia on the advice of the Prime 
Minister, who, in turn, consults a committee. The committee consists of the Chief Secretary 
to the Government, the Chairman of the Commission and three other members who are 
knowledgeable or possess practical experiences in human rights, including former judges or 
commissioners. Members, however, should not be currently active or involved in politics, 
or current or former enforcement officers. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Detention of minors 
</b></p>
<p>89. Courts for children try offenders under the age of 18. The Working Group notes with 
concern the low minimum age of criminal responsibility (10 years) and the discrepancies in 
this regard in the Penal Code, the Sharia Criminal Procedure (Federal Territories) Act 1977 
and the interpretation in the Sharia Court. It also notes with concern the long pretrial 
detention periods and the delays in dealing with cases involving children. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b>90. <b>The Working Group expresses its appreciation to the Government of Malaysia 
for the invitation and for its full cooperation during its mission to the country. It notes 
a number of positive aspects with regard to the institutions and laws safeguarding 
against cases of arbitrary deprivation of liberty.  </b></p>

<p>91. <b>Among the positive aspects, the Working Group notes the release of some 
leaders of the Hindu Rights Action Force, who were arrested and detained under the 
Internal Security Act for organizing protests in 2007 against the alleged 
marginalization of ethnic Indians. The Working Group also notes the release of Mat 
Sah Bin Mohammad Satray, whose detention had been considered arbitrary by the 
Working Group and contrary to articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Most prisons visited were found to meet international standards and 
regulations on conditions. This finding does not, however, apply to immigration 
detention centres. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>With regard to the criminal justice system, the Working Group observes the 
relatively long periods accused persons spend in pretrial detention, sometimes for 
several years, often because of understaffed and crowed courts.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Police agents often fail to inform detainees about their rights to contact family 
members and to consult a lawyer of their choice. Police agents often question suspects 
without giving them access to legal counsel.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Limited pretrial discovery prevents defendants from defending themselves 
properly. Government-held evidence is not consistently made available. The law 
imposes excessive restrictions on appeals.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Working Group received complaints that women do not receive fair 
treatment from sharia courts. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Human rights guarantees in Malaysia are hindered by the four preventive laws, 
mainly the Internal Security Act but also the Emergency (Public Order and 
Prevention of Crime) Ordinance, the Dangerous Drugs (Special Preventive Measures) 
Act and the Restricted Residence Act. 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> The Internal Security Act allows police to detain incommunicado and without a 
warrant any person deemed a threat to national security or economic life for up to 60 
days of investigation. Under the Act, the Minister for Home Affairs may extend 
detention for an initial period of up to two years without reference to the courts, and 
may issue further detention orders for a period up to two years indefinitely. Suspects 
can be detained without normal judicial review or formal charges. Some of those 
released before the end of their detention period are subjected to &#8220;imposed restricted 
conditions&#8221;, which usually limit their freedom of opinion, speech, association and 
travel inside and outside the country. 
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> The Working Group is worried about the deaths that occur during police 
arrests and while people are in police custody. 
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> The regime applied to migrants in an irregular situation, refugees and asylum-
seekers is not seen to be in line with international human rights law. Immigrants in an 
irregular situation arriving in the country are subjected to mandatory detention 
without genuine recourse to a court of law. The conditions of detention at most of the 
immigration detention centres visited adversely affect the ability of detainees to 
challenge the lawfulness of their detention. The Working Group received complaints 
of detainee abuse, inadequate food, water and medical care, and poor sanitation in the 
immigration detention centres. 
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> The Working Group expresses its concern about the excessive powers granted 
to the non-official organization RELA, particularly its activities concerning asylum-
seekers, refugees and migrants in an irregular situation. The Working Group received 
allegations of ill-treatment and beatings by RELA militants.  </b></p>

overcrowding in prisons, but mainly in immigration detention centres. </b> 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> On the basis of its findings, the Working Group addresses the 
recommendations below to the Government of Malaysia.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> A. General recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>105.<b> The Government should increase its efforts to develop a human rights culture 
in Malaysia. The judiciary should train magistrates, judges and prosecutors in 
international human rights law in order to increase the capacity of applying 
international human rights principles and standards in the resolution of judicial cases. 
</b>106.<b> The Government should become a party to the main international instruments 
on human rights, particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol 
thereto, the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, the Convention on 
the Reduction of Statelessness and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court. 
</b></p>
<p>107.<b> The Government should also study the possibility of becoming a party to the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families and the Optional Protocol thereto, as well as of revising 
the reservations and declarations it made to those conventions to which it is a State 
party. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Concerning criminal detention 
</b></p>
<p>108.<b> The Government should take steps to abrogate all norms that limit the 
independence of the judiciary, the independence of judges and magistrates, the 
impartiality of prosecutors and the free exercise of the legal profession, as well as all 
norms that restrict judicial review and strengthened executive influence over the 
judiciary. 
</b>109.<b> The Government should bear in mind that no one should be detained without a 
fair trial. Consequently, it should take steps to repeal the Internal Security Act and 
the other three preventive laws, namely, the Emergency (Public Order and Prevention 
of Crime) Ordinance, the Dangerous Drugs (Special Preventive Measures) Act and the 
Restricted Residence Act. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>During the transition period, while the Internal Security Act is still in force, 
decisions by the non-judicial Appeals Advisory Board should be binding on the Home 
Minister, and decisions with regard to the Act should be subjected to judicial review. 
</b>111. <b>Access to legal counsel and communication from detainees with their relatives 
should be guaranteed. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-10638 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Habeas corpus recourse should be developed to protect the right to liberty of all 
persons living under Malaysian jurisdiction. It is currently solely used on procedural 
aspects. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The authorities should develop a parole system. 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>The authorities should work on a reduction of recidivism by the rehabilitation 
of prisoners with the assistance of the community. 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>Prisoners categorized as minor offenders should not be imprisoned but made to 
do community work. 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>Furthermore, the Working Group recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Raise the minimum age of criminal responsibility to 12; 
 (b) Include strict time limits for completing children cases;  
 (c) Ensure that deprivation of liberty of children conforms fully with the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant international standards. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Concerning detention under immigration powers 
</b></p>
<p>117.<b> Regardless of immigration status, nobody should be subjected to arbitrary 
detention or appalling detention conditions. The Government is reminded that it is its 
responsibility to guarantee the right to physical and psychological integrity and the 
right to security in immigration detention centres. 
</b></p>
<p>118.<b> The Government should ratify the Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees and the Protocol thereto, and put in place a national legal and 
administrative framework for dealing with asylum-seekers and refugees that meets 
international standards. 
</b></p>
<p>119.<b> The Government should also rule out detention of asylum-seekers and refugees 
as well as vulnerable groups of migrants, including unaccompanied minors, families 
with minor children, pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, elderly persons, 
persons with disabilities, people with serious and/or chronic physical or mental health 
problems. 
</b></p>
<p>120.<b> The Government should, in all cases, provide for automatic periodic review by 
a court of law on the necessity and legality of detention. 
</b></p>
<p>121.<b> The Government should also provide for an effective remedy for detainees to 
challenge the necessity and legality of detention at any time of the detention period 
and ex post facto, and define the circumstances. 
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>As long as there is a regime of mandatory administrative detention for 
migrants in an irregular situation, the Government should legally define its maximum 
period rather than basing it on Government regulations or policy. 
</b></p>
<p>123.<b> The Government should also provide for a system of legal aid for immigration 
detainees. 
</b></p>
<p>124. <b>The Government should assume the responsibility of improving the conditions 
in immigration detention centres as a matter of urgency. 
</b></p>
<p>125.<b> RELA, as a volunteer force, should not be used for law enforcement nor for 
guarding immigration detention centres. </b></p>

<p><b> D. Concerning monitoring mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>126.<b> The Working Group recommends that the Government strengthen the status, 
powers and functions of SUHAKAM, in accordance with the Paris Principles. The 
Working Group also calls upon the State to take all measures necessary to ensure that 
it maintains its A-status. 
</b></p>
<p>127. T<b>he Government should facilitate the access of international organizations such 
as UNHCR and ICRC to monitor conditions in detention. 
</b></p>
<p>128. T<b>he Government should facilitate the access of SUHAKAM and non-
governmental organizations to immigration detention facilities, police lock-ups and 
prisons to monitor conditions and provide additional services in partnership with the 
Government. </b></p>
