<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report by the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons, Chaloka Beyani, is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council 
resolution 14/6. The first part provides an account of the activities undertaken by the 
Special Rapporteur since his last report to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>2. The second part of this report provides an analysis of the key issues related to 
internally displaced women (IDW) and identifies the way forward for enhancing effective 
protection and assistance for them, recognizing that IDW have varying concerns and 
capacities, and often play critical roles in protecting their families and communities. In 
addressing their particular situation and finding practical solutions to key obstacles, the 
Special Rapporteur underscores the importance of having a process as inclusive as possible 
and integrating not only IDW but also members of civil society, including 
community/traditional leaders, women&#8217;s groups and men.   
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Mainstreaming activities 
</b></p>
<p>3. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur continued to mainstream the 
human rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs) within the United Nations system and 
the wider humanitarian community by actively participating in the Inter-Agency Standing 
Committee (IASC). He has also maintained close collaboration with key United Nations 
organizations, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. He engaged in a 
constructive dialogue with these agencies, inter alia, on current challenges and responses to 
internal displacement and potential areas of cooperation, both at headquarters and field 
levels. He also held periodic briefings on thematic or country activities.  
</p>
<p>4. The mandate also participated in several activities organized by United Nations 
agencies, including: the regular meetings and annual retreat of the Global Protection 
Cluster; activities for the promotion of the African Union Convention for the Protection and 
Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (Kampala Convention); a seminar on 
addressing the adverse impacts of climate change on the full enjoyment of human rights 
(23&#8211;24 February 2012), organized by OHCHR in Geneva; the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women regional consultation for South and Eastern 
Europe and Central Asia on women in conflict and post-conflict situations (11 May 2012), 
in Turkey; a high-level panel discussion in Geneva, &#8220;Promoting and protecting women's 
rights in conflicts and post conflicts situations: the case of French speaking Africa&#8221; (18 
October 2012), co-organized by OHCHR and the International Organization of la 
Francophonie; and a seminar on humanitarian access and protection assistance under 
constraints (7 November 2012), organized by UNHCR in Geneva. The Special Rapporteur 
expresses his appreciation for the continued partnership with these bodies. 
</p>
<p>5. The past year also marked the mandate&#8217;s twentieth anniversary. In that context, the 
mandate organized various events in collaboration with relevant partners and sponsors, 
including, a panel discussion in Geneva on &#8220;Influencing our common future: the role of 
internally displaced women in recovery, peacebuilding and durable solutions&#8221; (7 March 
2012); a side event to the Human Rights Council on IDPs living outside camps (29 June 
2012); a side event to the General Assembly on &#8220;The evolution of the mandate and the </p>


<p>internal displacement context: achievements and challenges two decades later&#8221; (24 October 
2012), which was also the theme of the report presented by the Special Rapporteur at the 
General Assembly in 2012 (A/67/289); and a consultation in Geneva &#8220;Taking Stock of 
Internal Displacement: Twenty Years On&#8221; (28&#8211;29 November 2012). The Special 
Rapporteur further convened a workshop (18 September 2012) in Geneva to hold 
consultations with experts from numerous human rights, humanitarian and development 
bodies and civil society organizations with specific expertise in the field of displacement 
and protection of the human rights of women. The discussions of the workshop informed 
the present thematic report.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Cooperation with regional and international organizations 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to report on his ongoing collaboration with 
regional and international organizations, such as African regional organizations and 
mechanisms, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM). Amongst others, he engaged closely with 
regional organizations in Africa for the promotion, ratification and implementation at the 
national level of the 2009 Kampala Convention. To this end, he participated in the 126th 
Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (31 March&#8211;5 April 2012), in Kampala. He is 
pleased to note that this first legally binding regional instrument, which represents the 
culmination of over two decades of work involving Governments, civil society and the 
international community to address the plight of millions of IDPs, came into force on 6 
December 2012.  
</p>
<p>7. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur addressed the Human Dimension Committee 
of OSCE in Vienna on 4 September 2012 with a view to raising awareness of the mandate&#8217;s 
work and the critical connections between durable solutions to internal displacement 
situations and national and regional security in the OSCE area. In that same context, he 
participated in a workshop in Vienna on &#8220;Natural Disasters and Displacement&#8221; (5 
September 2012). He also participated in a panel discussion on displacement induced by 
natural disasters (20 July 2012), organized by IOM in New York. Moreover, he briefed the 
Humanitarian Liaison Working Group on his mandate priorities and country visits (24 
October 2012).  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur has maintained a strong partnership with civil society 
organizations (CSOs) in Geneva, New York and the field. In particular, he wishes to 
express his appreciation for the support provided to his mandate through the Brookings-
LSE Project on Internal Displacement and for the cooperation with the Internal 
Displacement Monitoring Centre on various issues of mutual interest. He also entered into 
a collaboration agreement to formalize and strengthen the existing cooperation with Joint 
IDP Profiling Service (JIPS). In the field, CSOs have played a vital role in supporting the 
mandate by sharing information, articulating the human rights impact of internal 
displacement in different contexts and acting as a liaison with displaced communities, 
especially during country visits.  
</p>
<p>9. From 18 to 23 June 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated in the eighth Annual 
Course on the Law of Internal Displacement, in San Remo, Italy, co-organized by 
Brookings-LSE Project, the International Institute of Humanitarian Law, UNHCR and 
OHCHR. The course included 18 Government officials working on internal displacement 
from 14 displacement-affected countries. He is also pleased to announce that a new week-
long, annual San Remo Seminar on International Law and Legal Protection in Natural 
Disasters, intended for practitioners and lawmakers, was launched in December 2012.  
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur also participated in numerous other forums and events on 
internal displacement organized by CSOs and other actors, including: &#8220;The Role of Women </p>


<p>in Conflict Situations&#8221; (2 May 2012), and transitional justice and displacement (28 June 
2012) organized by Brookings-LSE Project in Washington, D.C., and Geneva respectively; 
and a round-table discussion on current priorities and challenges relating to internal 
displacement (23 March 2012) hosted by USAID in Washington, D.C.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Country engagement 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p>11. From 12 to 16 July 2012, at the invitation of the Government of Afghanistan, the 
Special Rapporteur held dialogue sessions with Government officials and participated in a 
national consultative workshop on the development of a national policy on internal 
displacement (15&#8211;16 July) in Kabul. The workshop, which was led by the Ministry of 
Refugees and Repatriation with the support of CSOs and the United Nations, aimed to 
establish a road map for key stages in the development of an IDP policy. He congratulates 
the Government of Afghanistan for this important initiative and wishes to express his 
commitment to continue to provide his assistance in this regard.  
</p>
<p><b>  </b>C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire<b> 
</b></p>
<p>12. From 23 to 31 July 2012, the Special Rapporteur undertook a country visit to C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire, at the Government&#8217;s invitation. He met with communities affected by internal 
displacement in sites of return, resettlement and integration, in both Abidjan and west of 
the country. He found that the Government, with support of the international community, 
had made significant progress in stabilizing the country after the 2010 post-election 
violence, re-establishing law and order and facilitating return or other solutions for the 1 
million persons estimated to have been displaced at the height of that crisis. Significant 
challenges remain, however. Chief amongst these is ensuring that conditions conducive to 
durable solutions are put in place, including housing, services, and security for IDPs so that 
they may rebuild their lives. It is also essential that the root causes of violence and 
displacement, which have repeatedly shaken the country for over a decade, be addressed.  
</p>
<p>13. While IDPs were no longer visible in camps at the time of his visit, the Special 
Rapporteur noted the dire living conditions of many IDPs and host communities, in areas of 
return and local integration, including lack of housing, basic services, livelihood 
opportunities and confidence in the security sector &#8211; especially in the country&#8217;s western 
part and in informal urban settlement in and around Abidjan. He underlines the need to 
address the special needs of vulnerable IDPs, such as single female households, the elderly 
and disabled, and separated children. In this regard, he commends the Government and the 
international community for the recent decision to undertake a data-collection exercise 
which will seek to identify the needs of vulnerable IDPs and host communities, and the 
decision to pilot the Secretary-General&#8217;s decision and framework on durable solutions in 
post-conflict situations in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire.  
</p>
<p>14. Addressing structural and other deep-seated challenges such as those relating to 
land, justice and security sector reforms, reconciliation, and other issues likely to affect the 
human rights of many, such as the lack of personal identity documents (e.g. birth 
registrations, proof of citizenship), will also be essential in order to avoid further future 
displacement. Given the role that land has played in inter-community conflicts in the past, 
and its connection to identity issues, it is critical that the reform process be inclusive and 
transparent, promote local ownership of solutions and take into account the specific 
situation of IDPs.  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur notes that, despite some progress, the security situation in 
the country remains fragile due to the slow pace of related reforms. Many IDPs continue to </p>


<p>express deep apprehension with regard to their safety, especially in the west. He underlines 
the need to fully set in place security sector reforms, and the disarmament, demobilization 
and reinsertion process. These should benefit from an inclusive consultation process, 
include a vetting mechanism which makes the human rights records of a soldier a condition 
to serving in the new army, and concrete measures to address the presence of non-State 
armed actors and other irregular forces in parts of the country, and particularly in the west. 
The Special Rapporteur condemns the 20 July 2012 attack on the Nahibly camp, in which 
at least eight persons were killed and 60 injured, as a violation of the protection afforded to 
IDPs according to the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (Guiding Principles), 
international human rights and international humanitarian law. He regrets that to date no 
findings have been announced from the investigations undertaken into the incident and no 
arrests have been made, and urges the Government to pursue these measures as a matter of 
priority. He also calls on the international community to continue supporting humanitarian, 
development, peacebuilding and Government reforms in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire &#8211; reforms which 
should be grounded in a human rights-based approach and include the meaningful 
participation of displacement-affected communities. 
</p>
<p><b>  Sudan  
</b></p>
<p>16. From 14 to 22 November 2012, the Special Rapporteur undertook a country visit to 
Sudan at the Government&#8217;s invitation. He met with displacement-affected communities in 
north, west and south Darfur, and in Khartoum, but was unfortunately unable for security 
reasons to visit South Kordofan. He commends the Government and the international 
community for their efforts to address both the sources and consequences of internal 
displacement. He found that, while important challenges continue to exist in Sudan, there 
are also significant opportunities and progress made, which must be seized by all relevant 
actors so as to bring about sustainable peace and durable solutions.  
</p>
<p>17. In Darfur particularly, the signing of the 2011 Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, 
represents one such window of opportunity. The Special Rapporteur believes that, if 
implemented effectively and in an inclusive manner by all stakeholders, this agreement, 
which includes provisions on durable solutions for IDPs, security, power and wealth-
sharing, and reconciliation, can contribute to peace and stability in the region. He urges all 
efforts to be made towards this end, and momentum on its implementation to be increased. 
He notes that other factors are essential to effectively address the protracted internal 
displacement situation in Darfur. These include, inter alia: open, predictable and sustained 
humanitarian access to affected populations, which will enable an assessment of their 
humanitarian needs and longer term intentions; a comprehensive approach to durable 
solutions, which facilitates local integration, resettlement and voluntary returns; and 
concerted efforts to integrate IDPs (which in many cases have been urbanized) into urban 
planning, development, and livelihood projects. Other areas, emphasized by IDPs, are the 
need for improved security, access to services and livelihood opportunities, and access to 
their land in areas of return. Concerted efforts are needed to meet the protection and 
assistance needs of IDPs in Darfur, most of who have now lived in very dire circumstances 
for many years.  
</p>
<p>18. Regarding persons of South Sudanese origin, the Special Rapporteur is encouraged 
by the signing of the 4 Freedoms Agreement, which will facilitate the process of 
regularizing the stay of persons wishing to remain in Sudan. He urges all parties to take 
practical measures to implement it as soon as possible and exercise flexibility on 
administrative requirements that may be difficult for persons to meet. He also calls on the 
Governments of Sudan and South Sudan to facilitate the establishment of humanitarian 
corridors to enable safe and voluntary returns. Until a durable solution has been attained, 
however, it is essential that the human rights of persons of South Sudanese origin be 
protected. In this regard, he urges the Government of Sudan to promote a culture of respect </p>


<p>for their rights within Sudan and fully investigate and prosecute any violations thereof. The 
very difficult conditions in some departure points, including with regard to water and 
sanitation, shelter, health care and other basic services, also require particular attention and 
monitoring.  
</p>
<p>19. In South Kordofan and Blue Nile, the Special Rapporteur notes the efforts by the 
Government of Sudan to ensure the provision of humanitarian assistance in Government-
controlled areas. He further urges all parties to provide safe access to humanitarian 
assistance in all areas, in implementation of the memoranda of understanding (August 
2012), and to redouble efforts, with support of the international community, to peacefully 
address all outstanding issues that are fuelling this crisis. He observes that Sudan continues 
to experience a variety of causes and contexts of internal displacement. These include both 
new and protracted displacement; displacement due to armed conflict and communal 
violence; and displacement due to conflicts over resources because of climate change and 
natural disasters. He therefore urges the Government to embrace a comprehensive 
framework for the protection of the human rights of IDPs by ratifying the Kampala 
Convention and adopt implementing legislation at the earliest opportunity.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Internally displaced women: progress, challenges and the 
way ahead 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction and overview 
</b></p>
<p>20. Since the 1990s, States, international agencies, CSOs and other relevant actors 
have paid greater attention to the rights and needs of women and girls in emergency and 
post-conflict situations, and promoting gender-sensitive approaches to humanitarian and 
development assistance1 and early recovery. This has been borne out in a wide range of 
resolutions, policies, guidelines and handbooks, as well as gender-mainstreaming efforts 
and numerous targeted programmes. This overall framework, predominantly focused on 
women, peace and security, turned greater attention to refugees, with initiatives in recent 
years increasingly including IDW.  
</p>
<p>21. Despite these developments, in many cases responses to internal displacement still 
do not adequately address the concerns of women,2 who account for some 50 per cent of 
IDPs.3 As IDPs, women experience the various human rights challenges characteristic of 
displacement situations generally, and which often place IDPs at greater risk than most 
other affected populations. These frequently include: loss of livelihoods and key 
documentation, and lack of effective access to a number of important rights and services. 
Existing patterns of discrimination prevalent in many of these contexts are exacerbated 
during conflict and contribute to violations of women&#8217;s rights to housing, land and 
property. IDW also often experience human rights challenges due to interlinked forms of 
discrimination based on gender, and intersection of gender with other factors such as age, 
group affiliation (e.g. membership in minority groups), disability, civil status, 
socioeconomic status and displacement itself. Particular groups or categories of IDW can 
therefore be especially at risk, while the particular risks encountered by IDW vary 
depending on the displacement context (e.g. emergency situations, protracted displacement

</p>
<p>of the Twenty-Third Special Session of the General Assembly.

</i></p>

<p>situations, camp settings, etc.). The Council expressed &#8220;particular concern at the grave 
problems faced by many displaced women and children, including violence and abuse, 
sexual and labour exploitation, trafficking in persons, forced recruitment and abduction&#8221; 
(resolution 14/6). Other major human rights concerns include inequitable access to 
assistance, education, training and livelihoods; poor reproductive health care; and exclusion 
from decision-making processes.  
</p>
<p>22. Refugee and IDW often face similar assistance and protection concerns, such as 
increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), and could benefit in some 
instances from analogous gender-sensitive interventions to address these problems.4 
However, the diversity within these groups, the particular challenges they may face, and the 
legal, social and other implications of the very context of their displacement (i.e. internal 
versus external displacement) must be acknowledged and integrated into responses to their 
needs. For example, the lower levels of international assistance provided, on average, to 
IDPs compared to refugees are associated with comparatively poorer reproductive health 
outcomes for IDW.5 Conversely, as residents or citizens of their country, IDW generally do 
not face the same type (or extent) of legal and administrative barriers in the exercise of 
their rights to freedom of movement and to work.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Taking stock of efforts to protect and assist internally displaced women 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The evolving framework on gender and internal displacement 
</b></p>
<p>23. The past twenty years have witnessed the formulation of a multitude of tools and 
standards relevant to gender and forced displacement, which increasingly include IDW. 
While some standards and practices focus on particular issues such as reproductive health6 
and SGBV,7 others tackle gender and displacement in a cross-cutting manner. The Guiding 
Principles formed the first normative framework to detail a number of specific rights of 
IDW, including non-discrimination and the right of expectant mothers, mothers of young 
children, and female heads of household, inter alia, to protection and assistance that &#8220;takes 
into account their special needs&#8221;.8 The Guiding Principles identify various forms of 
violence and exploitation against which IDPs should be protected, including SGBV, 
underline the right of IDW to access all necessary documents, education and training, and 
call for the active participation of women in decision-making at all stages of displacement.9 
They have informed subsequent instruments and frameworks, which address IDW, such as 
the Kampala Convention and the Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced 
Persons.

 8 Principle 4, para. 2.

<p>24. Other tools and frameworks that address the needs and rights of IDW include: 
IASC Guidelines on Gender-based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Settings and the 
<i>Gender Handbook in Humanitarian Action</i> of 2006; UNHCR Executive Committee 
conclusion 105 (LVII) of 2006; UNHCR&#8217;s 2008 <i>Handbook for the Protection of Women 
and Girls</i>; the United Nations Principles on housing and property restitution for refugees 
and displaced persons;10 the Protocol on the Property Rights of Returning Persons in the 
Great Lakes Region; general recommendations No. 24 (1999) on women and health and 
No. 27 (2010) on the human rights of older women of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women. The Special Rapporteur is presently supporting the work of 
the Committee as it develops a general recommendation on women in conflict and post-
conflict situations, which he welcomes as it will contribute to the evolving protection 
framework. 
</p>
<p>25. Various Security Council resolutions address issues of particular relevance to 
IDW, including access to protection and assistance;11 sexual violence;12 trafficking;13 and 
peace, reconciliation and development.14 The Council&#8217;s resolutions on women, peace and 
security, including its landmark resolution 1325 (2000), are particularly important tools for 
strengthening and systematizing responses to the rights and needs of IDW.15 The 
development of national action plans for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) 
represents a valuable opportunity to include and engage IDW. To date, 35 national 
Governments, as well as the European Union, OSCE and the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO), have approved action plans, while numerous others are in the 
drafting phase.16 Several countries facing internal displacement have developed plans, 
including C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Georgia, Nepal and the Philippines. Concerted support for the 
effective implementation of these action plans is essential to ensure that their potential 
benefits for IDW are maximized.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Mainstreaming gender in responses to internal displacement 
</b></p>
<p>26. It is now widely recognized that a &#8220;two-pronged approach&#8221; is needed, which 
balances programmes targeted at displaced women with concerted gender mainstreaming 
efforts.17 Yet many organizations continue to struggle to identify and respond to the 
multiplicity of concerns facing IDW.18 To improve its protection and assistance efforts,

</i></p>
<p>Refugees and Displaced Persons: Implementing the &#8216;Pinheiro Principles&#8217; (FAO et al., 2007). The 
Pinheiro Principles underline, inter alia, the right to equality between men and women (including 
regarding remedies, inheritance rights, security of tenure, ownership rights and land control rights); 
the need for age and gender-sensitive restitution and appeals processes; and the need for international 
and national actors to ensure that the particular concerns of potentially vulnerable groups such as 
female heads of households, are accommodated.

<p>UNHCR issued the new Age, Gender and Diversity Policy in June 2011 and accompanying 
Forward Plan for 2011&#8211;2016. These documents were informed by an analysis of key 
challenges that have hindered UNHCR mainstreaming efforts, including a tendency to treat 
the displaced as &#8220;passive beneficiaries of aid&#8221; rather than &#8220;equal partners with rights&#8221; and 
the need for proactive leadership and follow-up on the findings of participatory assessment 
processes integral to age, gender and diversity mainstreaming.19 Progress in mainstreaming 
also depends on improved coordination between actors20 and the development of more 
concrete indicators to assess the implementation of mainstreaming policies. 
</p>
<p>27. The lack of gender-sensitive budgeting represents a significant obstacle to effective 
mainstreaming. Presently, many budget processes do not devote adequate attention to 
gender considerations and budget cuts tend to disproportionately impact areas essential to 
women. Introduced by IASC in 2009 with a view to increasing gender mainstreaming in the 
Consolidated Appeals Process, the gender marker tool supports efficient tracking of 
gender-sensitive funding allocations and promotes the development of projects more 
attuned to gender considerations. However, mainstreaming gender issues, including the 
rights and needs of IDW, in budget processes will continue to require more institutional 
leadership, disaggregated data collection and increased training.21  
</p>
<p>28. There is also a need to integrate gender considerations in relevant legislation so as 
to ensure that the rights of IDW are addressed in legislative processes at national 
(Parliament) and local levels (local government units). Finally the Special Rapporteur 
highlights that gender-sensitive planning is another element to consider especially in 
displacement-affected countries. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Addressing key protection issues 
</b></p>
<p>29. Advances have been made in addressing some key protection issues, even as many 
continue under-examined or unresolved. The greatest strides are visible in the area of 
reproductive health services, mainly owing to the Inter-agency Field Manual on 
Reproductive Health in Humanitarian Settings, and the Minimum Initial Service Package 
(MISP) addressing reproductive health and sexual violence in emergency settings, 
developed by the Inter-agency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crises. This 
manual was revised in 2010 to better encompass IDPs and others affected by humanitarian 
emergencies better.22 Nonetheless, important gaps remain in the reproductive health 
response, including the provision of adequate maternal and reproductive health care for 
women with disabilities and adolescent girls; scaling up systematic and equitable coverage 
of MISP; and sustaining these services in protracted crisis and the recovery phase. 
</p>
<p>30. Some progress has also been made in developing guidelines on prevention of and 
response to SGBV;23 setting standards for the inclusion of sexual violence concerns in 
peace agreements and ceasefires;24 implementing training programmes to prevent sexual 
exploitation by peacekeepers and humanitarians; rolling-out monitoring analysis and

(2010); developing early warning indicators on sexual violence;25 and establishing targets 
to increase the proportion of female police officers in peacekeeping operations to 20 per 
cent by 2014. However, these issues continue to represent stark challenges. 
</p>
<p>31. Modest &#8211; and not yet entrenched &#8211; advances have been achieved in integrating 
women into assistance distribution systems,26 and implementing fuel strategies to reduce 
displaced women&#8217;s exposure to violence when they collect firewood.27 Limited gains in 
upholding housing, land and property rights of IDW have been achieved in some instances 
through measures such as the provision of legal aid to returnee women. Likewise, the 
participation of IDW in decision-making processes has increased in some countries, 
including through the development of strong associations of IDW, for example in Colombia 
and the Philippines.28 In 2011, UNHCR convened its second global dialogue with women 
and engaged IDW in this process for the first time.29 Despite persistent constraints, some 
progress has been made in collecting disaggregated data in conflict and post-conflict 
situations,30 including through the establishment of JIPS, which collects data disaggregated 
by age, sex and location, as well as other indicators such as the provision of protection of 
and assistance to IDW, their housing, land and property rights. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Looking forward: analysis of key challenges 
</b></p>
<p>32. Despite these advances, the Special Rapporteur finds that a host of challenges 
remain, from implementing equitable documentation practices to systematically training 
Government officials, security actors and field staff in gender approaches, raising 
awareness of communities, especially host communities, about IDPs to avoid double 
stigmatization of displaced women (as IDPs and as women) and engaging women in early 
warning systems and disaster preparedness strategies. He finds that overcoming the 
&#8220;implementation gap&#8221; that curtails the practical impact of the frameworks developed to 
protect, assist and support the leadership role of IDW possibly represents the greatest 
obstacle. Beyond this, he below some of the key challenges faced by IDW, and which are 
notable for their strategic significance, or because they reflect important longstanding, 
neglected or emerging problems.

<p><b> 1. Detailed and disaggregated data collection 
</b></p>
<p>33. Data disaggregated by sex, age, location and other key indicators are essential for 
effective advocacy and the development of programmes to respond to the specific needs of 
IDW at all stages of displacement, whether caused by conflicts, disasters or other factors.31 
Data is equally essential to the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of such 
programmes. Despite calls in the Beijing Platform for Action and subsequent reports,32 
recommendations33 and resolutions34 for the collection of detailed, disaggregated data, such 
information is not available in the vast majority of displacement-affected States, which 
often lack the necessary infrastructure and human and financial capacity to produce and 
update such data.35 Additionally, where such data are collected, lack of formal endorsement 
by Governments may represent a further hurdle to its dissemination and the implementation 
of corrective measures in programmes, particularly those affecting IDW. Improving the 
reporting and analysis of sex-disaggregated data has been a key area of focus of the IASC 
Sub-Working Group on Gender and Humanitarian Action. Moving forward, greater 
attention is needed for the collection not only of disaggregated quantitative, but also 
qualitative data that capture the particular experiences and concerns of IDW and other 
members of displacement-affected communities. For instance, data that is sex-
disaggregated should further be age-disaggregated to take into account the specific needs of 
adolescent girls, young women and older women and therefore allow more equitable 
assistance to these different groups. Beyond collecting such data, national census offices 
should also systematically apply a gender lens to analysis and dissemination efforts.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Prevention and response to SGBV in the context of internal displacement  
</b></p>
<p>34. Despite myriad training, guidelines and manuals, displaced women and girls 
continue to be subject to egregious levels of sexual violence. In some situations, sexual 
violence or other forms of gender-based violence is used as a deliberate tactic to instil 
terror, and force displacement, or to discourage IDPs from demanding their rights. Beyond 
being a significant cause of displacement and a grievous human rights violation in its own 
right, SGBV or the perceived risk of it can also curtail women&#8217;s access to a range of rights 
and services.36  
</p>
<p>35. There is therefore a pressing need for a more preventative approach to these 
challenges. In this regard, the Protocol on the Prevention and Suppression of Sexual 
Violence against Women and Children (2006) of the Great Lakes region and the model law 
annexed thereto, the 2011 Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating 
violence against women and domestic violence and the Inter-American Convention on the 
Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women (Convention of 
Bel&#233;m do Par&#225;) provide some important entry points and examples in terms of legal 
frameworks. Fuel strategies and livelihood initiatives targeting displaced women and girls,

<p>and those at risk of displacement, are further practical measures which can be central to 
reducing exposure to sexual violence. Reducing vulnerability to sexual violence also entails 
ensuring that survivors have access to appropriate support, including reproductive and 
psychosocial services and that adequate resources are devoted to gender-sensitive site 
planning.  
</p>
<p>36. Given that nearly 50 per cent of survivors of sexual assault are under 18 years of 
age,37 the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the prevailing tendency to overlook the 
needs of children and youth in this area. Additionally, a stronger focus on prevention is 
required regarding SGBV <i>within</i> internally displaced households and communities. At 
present, most SGBV prevention and response programmes focus on &#8220;stranger&#8221; rape rather 
than the more prevalent forms of sexual violence experienced within households and 
communities (e.g. intimate partner violence), and the problematic coping practices that 
IDW may be compelled to adopt (e.g. early marriages).38 Moreover, given that women with 
disabilities in non-displacement settings are more likely to be victims of sexual violence 
and abuse, the levels of sexual violence against women and girls with disabilities amongst 
displaced and conflict-affected populations are likely to be even higher.39 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Early recovery 
</b></p>
<p>37. Early recovery is a vital element of an effective response to internal displacement 
as it aims at crisis recovery from the humanitarian phase onwards, resilience-building and 
development opportunities, and can encourage social change. As such, it presents important 
opportunities to promote gender equality in the context of internal displacement. However, 
these opportunities are often lost because gender issues are given low priority in emergency 
contexts, as well as during the recovery phase. The Special Rapporteur underlines that 
failure to include gender perspectives early in decision-making processes can have long-
lasting impacts on IDW, particularly in the context of governance structures, and policies 
and practices, which can reinforce existing socioeconomic disparities between men and 
women. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Access to justice and accountability towards internally displaced women 
</b></p>
<p>38. Access to justice and accountability mechanisms remains limited and inadequate 
for most IDW. In some cases, women are constrained to use customary justice systems, 
which often discriminate against them and apply principles in contradiction with national 
and international standards. In others, formal justice mechanisms may also discriminate 
against women and therefore not provide the best outcome for IDW. The Special 
Rapporteur finds the most glaring gap to be in access to justice for survivors of sexual 
violence. Ensuring legal justice for survivors can be transformative because it sends a clear 
message rejecting impunity for this heinous crime. However, in some instances IDW not 
only lack access to effective remedies, but have themselves been charged when bringing 
forward allegations of rape by State security forces in camps.40 Conversely, legal aid, where

<p>available, has proven invaluable to IDW seeking access to justice for SGBV, as well as for 
other crimes and legal claims. 
</p>
<p>39. Furthermore, in the absence of rule of law that characterizes many conflict and 
post-conflict contexts and where women&#8217;s access to formal justice mechanisms may be 
compromised by lack of documentation, illiteracy and absence of or restricted access to 
judicial structures, it is important for the humanitarian community to engage with 
alternative dispute resolution processes (including customary, religious and local 
governance structures) to promote women&#8217;s access to land and housing and resolve 
disputes over central issues such as inheritance.41 International development actors also 
have a critical role to play in working alongside national actors to respond to these concerns 
and support more concerted efforts to evaluate interventions and identify best practices in 
this field.  
</p>
<p>40. In addition to promoting access to criminal and civil justice systems for IDW, it is 
also essential to consider how their concerns are addressed through transitional justice 
processes. Transitional justice measures such as restitution, compensation, trials and truth 
and reconciliation commissions can contribute to recognizing and redressing the violations 
experienced by IDW, and in turn supporting sustainable solutions to displacement. 
Maximizing these contributions depends upon ensuring their accessibility, equitability and 
relevance to the priorities of IDW. For instance, reparation programmes can be calibrated to 
mitigate pre-existing structural inequalities, such as biased inheritance or other practices, 
for example by recognizing customary marriages in order to facilitate recognition of 
succession and inheritance rights and displaced women and men as co-claimants, or by 
distributing compensation benefits on an individual rather than family-unit basis, so as to 
increase women&#8217;s control over the use of their share.42 In countries where the presence of 
formal legal institutions is limited at the local level, and alternative dispute-resolution 
mechanisms or customary justice are de facto the main accessible form of justice, 
programmes should consider engaging with these to sensitize them to national and 
international standards and progressively redress discriminatory customary practices. 
</p>
<p>41. International and national actors should also be accountable to IDW for delivery of 
effective protection and assistance programmes, a challenge currently largely unmet. 
Integrating a stronger gender lens into initiatives such as the Humanitarian Accountability 
Partnership Standard in Accountability and Quality Management and more accessible and 
trusted complaints and response mechanisms at field level constitute important steps 
towards addressing this challenge. Increasing donor accountability towards IDW entails 
more effectively integrating gender issues into donorship practices, including through tools 
like the gender marker. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Implementing meaningful participatory approaches and supporting internally 
</b></p>
<p>displaced women&#8217;s mobilisation<b> 
</b></p>
<p>42. Gender-sensitive responses to internal displacement require the full and equal 
participation of women in decision-making at all stages of displacement and in

Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, to the Council on reparations for

<p>peacemaking processes.43 Such participation is essential to effectively promoting and 
protecting human rights, preventing rights violations, achieving durable solutions, and 
supporting sustainable peace processes, post-conflict reconstruction and development.44 
Ongoing participatory needs assessments and &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; participatory planning processes 
are essential to overcoming the &#8220;implementation gap&#8221; between gender policies and 
effective practice, and ensuring that nationally and internationally supported protection 
interventions complement women&#8217;s self-protection strategies and respond to their evolving 
needs and concerns. 
</p>
<p>43. However, opportunities for IDW to participate actively in decision-making 
processes remain particularly limited. For example, IDW have rarely played an active role 
in developing, implementing and monitoring national action plans on Security Council 
resolution 1325 (2000), although IDW in a diverse range of contexts have demonstrated 
their ability and determination to play leading roles in developing and implementing 
policies and programmes concerning them.45 Unfortunately, the participatory approaches 
used to identify protection gaps of concern to IDW often do not extend to ensuring that 
they have an active say in the development, implementation and evaluation of responses to 
these gaps. IDW should therefore be given the opportunity to actively participate in peace 
processes; in negotiating durable solutions and the planning process for returns, 
reintegration or resettlement; and in post-conflict reconstruction and rebuilding. 
Participation of women in humanitarian planning should further reflect the diversity of the 
population and seek to include adolescent girls, youth and those with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>44. Strategies to strengthen the meaningful participation of IDW should also include 
constructive engagement of men in efforts to uphold IDW&#8217;s rights. Yet, this also remains 
an inadequately addressed challenge. Engaging men in women&#8217;s economic empowerment 
programmes has in some instances proven advantageous because it has increased men&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>support for the initiatives, but it also raises the risk of men assuming control of the 
process.46 Similarly, when IDPs are consulted on development and implementation of 
protection and assistance programmes, IDW may often defer to men as the community&#8217;s 
representatives if separate consultations are not convened.47 Identification and exchange of 
good practices, effective awareness-raising programmes and creative approaches to 
engaging men and boys to work alongside and support IDW should be a fundamental pillar 
of protection and assistance efforts.48 
</p>
<p>45. Beyond consultation and participation processes, mobilization of IDW to actively 
assert their rights can play a critical role in advancing and sustaining equitable assistance,

<p>protection and development strategies at the community level. In countries such as 
Colombia and Georgia, IDW have formed organizations to advocate for their rights at 
multiple levels, gaining important political skills and capacity to inform and advise other 
women facing human rights concerns. However, IDW who mobilize to defend their rights 
are often exposed to increased risks and threats, including SGBV perpetrated by State or 
non-State armed actors.49 National and international actors should document, monitor and 
ensure accountability for these violations and ensure comprehensive protection for these 
IDPs. Equally, these actors can support the development of such groups by encouraging 
their engagement in policy development and implementation processes, and by promoting 
access to training and opportunities to exchange experiences with other women involved in 
mobilization efforts. Moreover, the value of IDW mobilization may extend beyond the 
period of displacement, as community mobilization efforts establish women as active, equal 
citizens and leaders. Opportunities for young IDW to participate in mobilization processes 
are therefore of particular importance.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Supporting sustainable livelihoods 
</b></p>
<p>46. Access to sustainable livelihoods for both women and men is now widely 
recognized as a key element of protection in the context of displacement, and is critical to 
ensuring durable solutions for IDPs.50 IDW and girls are often disproportionately affected 
by the loss of livelihoods during displacement. For example, due to security concerns, they 
may be more confined to the domestic sphere than they were prior to displacement and 
unable to leave the home in order to pursue livelihoods or other necessary activities. They 
may not be able to practise their livelihoods due to loss of land and livestock and may have 
particular difficulty in shifting from rural to urban lifestyles (or vice versa) and livelihood 
options, depending on their level of education and cultural or other barriers. In extreme 
circumstances, IDW and girls may resort to dangerous coping practices, such as survival 
sex, to feed their families. They are also often the first to drop out of school and take on 
work to support the family; incidences of early marriage tend to rise; and they may 
experience increased risk of trafficking. Such risks, as well as exposure to sexual violence, 
harassment, physical abuse, and exploitation, need to be taken into account when 
programing and advocating for livelihood programmes or schemes for IDW.51 
</p>
<p>47. In some situations, such as the Philippines, employment rates are in fact higher 
amongst IDW men, in part due to the fact that women benefit from greater freedom of 
movement because they are not seen as a threat by warring parties.52 IDW taking on new 
employment opportunities can result in increased tensions, particularly within families and 
between generations, as notions of pride, status and dignity are perceived to be challenged. 
These women may face increased pressure and strain, particularly if men do not shift roles 
to take on more domestic work.53 However, new livelihood opportunities can strengthen the 
confidence, leadership skills and influence of IDW. To maximize these benefits, the skills

<p>and resources of IDW should be fully recognized and more systematically supported. This 
entails rectifying the &#8220;pervasive biases&#8221;, which, as the Secretary-General has highlighted, 
result in resources for initiatives such as post-conflict livelihoods programmes being 
directed &#8220;overwhelmingly towards men&#8221;.54 Livelihood programmes for IDW should further 
be designed to be safe and sustainable, and protect women against unintended protection 
consequences, including elevated risks of SGBV. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Enhancing gender-sensitive approaches to durable solutions 
</b></p>
<p>48. The pursuit of durable solutions raises a range of concerns for IDW. Although the 
choice of a durable solution is, in principle, an individual matter, in practice decisions 
concerning durable solutions are usually made by families or communities, often 
marginalizing women&#8217;s preferences. For example, particularly when they have been the 
targets of SGBV, IDW may be deterred from returning due to traumatic associations or fear 
of further attacks.55 Yet, in some instances families or other actors may pressure women to 
return despite these concerns.  
</p>
<p>49. Moreover, experiences of crisis, conflict and displacement often challenge existing 
notions of gender. While uprooted, many women take on new roles as leaders and 
breadwinners, which they sustain after displacement by, for example, developing new 
businesses and promoting peaceful coexistence at the grassroots level. However, many 
women struggle to preserve these advances upon return or resettlement, as they are often 
pressured to revert to traditional gender roles. Such changed gender roles can lead to 
increased incidents of domestic violence, particularly when men return to their families and 
communities and are not able to resume their traditional roles as breadwinners and head of 
the family. Hence, the importance of actively engaging men in order to achieve equitable 
humanitarian assistance and enhancing IDW participation and protection. Additionally, 
displaced and returnee women may be disadvantaged with regard to housing rights, be 
unable to gain security of tenure, and are often marginalized in the negotiation of land 
claims.56 Those with disabilities may also face particular obstacles to accessing durable 
solutions, including extreme marginalization in decision-making processes, lack of 
appropriate transportation and inadequate services and pervasive discrimination in return 
and resettlement communities.57 
</p>
<p>50. Overall, the Special Rapporteur notes that discussions of gender issues within host 
and return communities and how particular durable solutions can backstop protection for 
IDW remain relatively nascent. Addressing them requires more concerted attention, as well 
as cooperation between humanitarian and development actors. The piloting of the 
Secretary-General&#8217;s 2011 Framework for Ending Displacement in the Aftermath of 
Conflict represents an important opportunity to strengthen attention to the particular rights, 
needs and concerns of IDW in the pursuit of durable solutions.

<p><b> 8. Strengthening the links between gender and age-sensitive approaches, and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>elements of diversity 
</b></p>
<p>51. Despite attempts to mainstream attention to gender, age and other elements of 
diversity, room remains for stronger links between gender and generation-sensitive 
analyses and interventions in support of IDPs. This is especially the case for adolescent 
girls, young and older IDW. The ageing of the global population points towards the need to 
integrate gender and generation-sensitive approaches to internal displacement more 
systematically, given the growing proportion of elderly displaced women, including 
widows,58 with particular capacities and protection and assistance concerns.59 These 
concerns may be particularly pronounced when older IDW take on the role of caregivers to 
children whose parents have died or moved elsewhere.60 Similarly, displaced girls are 
burdened with heavy household responsibilities, including domestic chores, such as 
fetching water and firewood and caring for younger siblings. This often results in young 
girls missing out on schooling and exposes them to increased protection risks.61 There is 
also a need for more concerted attention to the particular risks and challenges faced by 
IDW and girls with disabilities, including ensuring full access to and inclusion in 
humanitarian programmes and recognizing their skills and capacities. 
</p>
<p><b> 9. Gender dimensions of displacement linked to natural disasters and climate change 
</b></p>
<p>52. In recent years, increased attention has been devoted to rising rates of displacement 
linked to the effects of climate change62 and the particularly adverse effects of climate 
change on potentially vulnerable groups, including women. It is now widely acknowledged 
that climate change impacts on men and women differently at all stages from preparedness 
to reconstruction. As recognized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC), inequitable gender roles may exacerbate women&#8217;s exposure to harm, while at the 
same time women may make &#8220;very significant, active contributions &#8230; [to] coping with and 
adapting to extremes&#8221;.63 Women often experience higher rates of mortality than men in 
natural disasters64 and may experience particularly deleterious effects on health, 
</p>
<p>  
 58 For example, the JIPS profiling exercise in Burundi highlighted the large number of older widows in 
</p>
<p>IDP settlements.

<p>exacerbated gender inequality and reduced access to education and livelihood 
opportunities.65  
</p>
<p>53. The Hyogo Framework for Action 2010-2015 requires Member States to 
incorporate gender perspectives into all disaster risk management processes, plans and 
policies (para. 13 (d)). However, there has been relatively little success to date in 
mainstreaming gender and women&#8217;s health considerations in these policies and processes, 
and when they have been integrated they have mainly been portrayed as victims rather than 
actors.66 Given that natural disaster-induced displacement is expected to become more 
severe in future, issues such as the role of women in early warning systems and women&#8217;s 
full participation in the development and implementation of gender-sensitive disaster 
preparedness and response strategies therefore merit more concerted attention.

<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>Important steps have been taken over the past decades to improve 
international and national responses to the diverse assistance, protection and durable 
</b></p>
<p><b>solution challenges faced by IDW. Yet too often, discussions of these issues remain 
</b></p>
<p><b>perfunctory, failing to recognize and actively engage IDW and perpetuating 
</b></p>
<p><b>inadequate responses to their concerns. In the light of these dynamics, and in line with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Guiding Principles and other relevant standards, the Special Rapporteur makes 
</b></p>
<p><b>the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General recommendations to national and international stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. States: 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>In accordance with the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, ensure 
that national laws and policies provide comprehensive protection for IDW; 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>Initiate gender-sensitive budgeting processes that ensure allocation of 
adequate resources to the needs and priorities of IDW; 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>Support initiatives to increase the capacity of officials, particularly at local 
level, to adopt gender-sensitive approaches to policymaking, planning, budgeting and 
</b></p>
<p><b>programme implementation on IDP issues; 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>Provide gender-sensitive training to police, military forces, judiciary and 
social workers, including on preventing and addressing SGBV in displacement 
</b></p>
<p><b>situations; 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>Recruit, train and deploy greater numbers of female police and military 
personnel at national level in countries experiencing internal displacement, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>in United Nations peacekeeping operations; 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>Ensure prompt and equitable provision of all necessary personal 
documentation to IDW;

<p>61. <b>Develop awareness-raising programmes to enhance relationship between IDW 
and host communities, especially other women in those communities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Humanitarian and development organizations: 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>Strengthen gender mainstreaming efforts, in particular by providing 
comprehensive gender training for staff at all levels, consistently conducting gender 
</b></p>
<p><b>analysis and developing more precise indicators to assess implementation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>mainstreaming policies; include senior management/decision-makers as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>operational staff in such training and outreach activities; 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>Deepen efforts to develop and implement programmes that recognize and 
build on IDW capacities, taking into account their diversity; 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>Include civil society including CSOs, and networks of women and traditional 
leaders within host/return communities, in consultations and awareness-raising 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities in order to build a support system for IDW. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations to States, United Nations agencies and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>international actors on particular challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Gender and age-sensitive data collection and analysis 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>Strengthen support for national and international efforts to collect, update, 
analyse and disseminate both quantitative and qualitative data on IDPs (including 
</b></p>
<p><b>those outside camps), displacement-affected communities, and communities at risk of 
</b></p>
<p><b>displacement, which are disaggregated by age, sex, location and other relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>factors; 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>Ensure that such data is not only collected but analysed in a gender-sensitive 
manner, that it is meaningfully reflected in programme design and implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>and that dissemination efforts include feedback to IDW; 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Consultation, meaningful participation and mobilization 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>Ensure meaningful participation of IDW and girls in the development, 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of laws, policies, programmes and 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities that affect their lives at all stages of displacement, through ongoing and 
</b></p>
<p><b>direct engagement in identifying priorities and devising and implementing responses 
</b></p>
<p><b>to them; 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Facilitate active participation of IDW in development and implementation of 
national and regional action plans on women, peace and security, and integration of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their diverse concerns into such plans; 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>Recognizing the barriers socioeconomic and security concerns may present, 
identify and implement practical steps to make meaningful participation 
</b></p>
<p><b>opportunities more accessible to IDW, such as providing safe transportation to 
</b></p>
<p><b>meetings; 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>More concertedly integrate women of different ages, diverse capacities and 
socioeconomic backgrounds into consultation and participation processes, with a view 
</b></p>
<p><b>to increasing community ownership of decisions and initiatives; 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Identify and integrate lessons from past consultation and participation 
processes with IDW in order to improve participatory practices; </b></p>


<p>72. <b>Devote particular attention to the creation of participation and mobilization 
opportunities for IDW with disabilities, including involvement in camp management, 
</b></p>
<p>community leadership and women&#8217;s committees and groups;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Gather, systematize and share lessons on engaging men and boys in 
participatory processes intended to advance gender equality; 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>States should systematically investigate, document, monitor, prosecute and 
punish crimes against IDP leaders and IDW advocates, and ensure adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection from physical, psychological and socioeconomic abuses against them, their 
</b></p>
<p><b>families and communities; 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Given the importance of the mobilization of IDW to protection, assistance and 
long-term empowerment:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Develop guidance notes for international actors on how to effectively, 
</b></p>
<p><b>ethically and non-discriminatorily engage with and support IDP organizations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Promote training opportunities for IDW and girls, to strengthen their 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity to organize and advocate on multiple levels; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Support the exchange of experiences and strategies between IDP groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>within and between countries; 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Preventing and addressing SGBV 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Redouble efforts to prevent and respond effectively to SGBV at all stages of 
displacement, including by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Enhancing security measures in all locations with IDPs, including host 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities, IDP settlements and camps, and return communities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Engaging men, as appropriate, in prevention and protection efforts; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Supporting the provision of cooking fuel as part of lifesaving assistance 
</b></p>
<p><b>and implementation of market-based livelihood programmes which can help prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>SGBV by removing the need for IDW to venture into unsafe areas to collect firewood 
</b></p>
<p><b>or other resources to use themselves or to sell; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Providing mental health, psychosocial and medical services and public 
</b></p>
<p><b>education programmes for individuals and communities affected by SGBV; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Devoting increased attention to sexual violence in domestic contexts, 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognizing its high prevalence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Increasing targeted support for young women and girls, including those 
</b></p>
<p><b>with disabilities, at risk of or subjected to SGBV; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Piloting and evaluating strategies which promote access and inclusion 
</b></p>
<p><b>for IDW and girls with disabilities in SGBV prevention programmes, building the 
</b></p>
<p><b>evidence base and guidance for field practitioners; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Holding States accountable for bringing perpetrators of conflict-related 
</b></p>
<p><b>sexual violence to justice and for reporting on progress on the relevant resolutions;  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Refine as appropriate the mandates of peacekeeping operations working in 
situations characterized by internal displacement and widespread SGBV to enable 
</b></p>
<p><b>peacekeepers to take action to stop attacks (including from civilian groups) wherein 
</b></p>
<p><b>SGBV is used as a tactic; </b></p>


<p><b> 4. Access to justice and accountability  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Increase investments in rule of law and governance in displacement-affected 
communities, with a view to rectifying the marginalization of IDW from justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>systems; 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Increase support for and access to legal aid for IDW; 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Collect, disseminate and apply good practices in engaging IDW in transitional 
justice processes and addressing their concerns, such as through gender-sensitive 
</b></p>
<p><b>reparation processes; 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Ensure that men and members of communities are integrated in consultation 
processes to avoid marginalization of IDW; 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Support the development of more accessible and trusted complaints and 
response mechanisms at field level, particularly to eliminate sexual exploitation by 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarians and peacekeepers; 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>States should take all measures to combat impunity for SGBV, including by 
promptly investigating, prosecuting and punishing SGBV, and providing police, 
</b></p>
<p><b>judicial officials (including legal aid providers) and the health sector with necessary 
</b></p>
<p><b>training and tools such as SOPs; 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Supporting livelihoods 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Increase strategic support for education, training and safe and sustainable 
livelihoods for IDW at all stages of displacement, recognizing the critical contribution 
</b></p>
<p>effective livelihoods make to protection, and to advancing and sustaining women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>empowerment; 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Ensure livelihood programmes are based on market analysis and 
participatory assessments; are built around a graduated model of need, where 
</b></p>
<p><b>beneficiaries are connected to services specific to their level of poverty; do not 
</b></p>
<p><b>inappropriately perpetuate gendered divisions of labour; mitigate unintended 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection consequences, including exposing women to increased SGBV; and are 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessible to IDW both in and outside camps; 
</b></p>
<p><b> 6. Gender-sensitive durable solutions strategies 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Ensure IDW have the right as individuals to make free and informed 
decisions concerning the resolution of their displacement on the basis of adequate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriately communicated information, and participate fully in planning and 
</b></p>
<p><b>management of their return, local integration or resettlement; 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>Develop and implement protection-focused, gender-sensitive durable solutions 
strategies that: fully consider the needs and rights of IDW of different ages and 
</b></p>
<p><b>socioeconomic circumstances; strive to maintain the gains they may have made while 
</b></p>
<p><b>displaced; and incorporate gender analysis of the concerns of host and return 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities; 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Ensure systematic integration of gender analysis throughout the piloting, 
refining and implementation of the Secretary-</b>General&#8217;s Framework on Ending 
</p>
<p><b>Displacement in the Aftermath of Conflict, and the broad dissemination of lessons 
</b></p>
<p><b>learned through this process; 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Ensure systematic, medium and long-term monitoring of durable solutions to 
better understand and address their gendered impacts; </b></p>


<p>90. <b>Building on the Guiding Principles, develop guidelines on the active inclusion 
of women in recovery, reconstruction and durable solutions processes, and link 
</b></p>
<p><b>funding to respect for these principles; 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Given that comprehensively addressing the rights and concerns of IDW 
requires a long-term development approach, donors should promote and enable 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation between humanitarian and development actors working in displacement-
</b></p>
<p><b>affected contexts; 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>With regard to housing, land and property (HLP), States should:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Develop and implement laws and policies which recognize equal HLP 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights for IDW, in accordance with international standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>  (b) Take specific measures to ensure that HLP claims of persons without 
</b></p>
<p><b>individually held or formally registered properties are equitably addressed, giving 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular consideration to those at risk of marginalization, including widows, female 
</b></p>
<p><b>heads of households, and unaccompanied children; 
</b></p>
<p><b> 7. Gender, natural disasters and displacement 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Closely examine the gender dimensions of displacement linked to the effects of 
climate change, in order to identify specific vulnerabilities and good practices in 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender-sensitive protection, assistance, adaptation, mitigation, relocation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>reconstruction processes; 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Ensure that women at risk of displacement are actively engaged in 
development and implementation of early warning and disaster preparedness systems, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and that information on disaster risks and preparedness is comprehensively 
</b></p>
<p><b>disseminated through accessible channels.
