JUDGMENT

1.      
This is an application form 5 by the applicant for Maintenance towards her two children namely Deepshika Dipal, female aged 11 years and Prasant Deepshek Prakash, male aged 4 years and herself.

2.      
The form 5 application was filed on 29th August 2012 and a response form 6 filed from the respondent on 14th September 2012. Matter was than fixed on 6th December 2012 for hearing.

3.      
On the hearing, the applicant affirmed and stated that she doesn't work (domestic duties only). She's an asthmatic and needs medical supplies per month. Her weekly budget is $40.00 per week. Her FEA and Water bills paid by her father in law. For her children they need $30.00 per term for book fees. They also need school fees. She also needs $30.00 per month for her personal items. Her in laws provide food. She also buys food from interim maintenance paid by respondent. Interim maintenance is not enough for her and the two children. She requests for $100.00 per week for maintenance of the two children and herself.

In cross examination she stated that the piece land mentioned by the respondent is transferred under brother in laws name and not to her. States that respondent also gets income from driving taxi and sugar cane. Last year respondent promised to pay school fees for daughter but nothing was paid.

4. The respondent also gave evidence on oath and stated that he works as a fitter at Vatukoula Gold mine. He gives money to his mother and earns $320.00 fortnight. He pays in 2 weeks $20.00 for fuel. His rent is $180.00. He pays $62.00 for FEA bills per month. For water bills he pays $52.00 every 3 months. Groceries he pays $100.00 fortnight i.e. for de-facto wife and son. 

Issue

5. The issue for the Court to resolve in this application is to consider the financial support necessary for the children and determine the financial contribution required to financially support the two children? Also whether spousal maintenance should be granted?

Law & Analysis of Evidence

6. Section 89 (1) of the Family Law Act 2003 states that "In proceedings for a child maintenance order, the court may, subject to this Division, make any child maintenance order it thinks proper."

7. Section 89 (2) of FLA 2003 further states "The court must in, accordance with the following sections  

(a)     
consider the financial support necessary for the maintenance of the child; and

(b)     
determine the financial contribution, or respective financial contribution, towards the financial support necessary for the maintenance of the child that should be made by a party&to the proceedings" 

8.      
The court also takes into consideration section 90 of the FLA 2003 which deals with Considering what financial support necessary and section 91 of FLA 2003 which deals with matters to be taken into account by court in determining contributions to be made by parties. 

9.      
In considering the evidence put before the court it's not disputed that the applicant and respondent had been living separately for some time. The elder child is schooling whilst the younger will presumably enroll into kindergarten this year. Both children are looked after by their mother the applicant.

10.     
From the date of separation it seems the applicant has always been the one supporting the two children. There is no evidence put before the court to show or suggest that respondent had in some ways supported the two children. From record however he was ordered to pay interim maintenance of $50.00 per week on 24th September 2012.
11.     
From the applicants evidence it's apparent that the two children require financial support from both parents. Since both children will be schooling this year, it is important that they be supported in the following:

Education

"        
School fees.
"        
School uniforms.
"        
School exercise & text books.
"        
Foot wear.
"        
Food i.e. School lunch

Medical
"        
Medical checks when children are ill.
"        
Medicine required.

Other Expenses
"        
Food
"        
Clothing.

12.     
From the evidence it has been clearly established on the balance of probability that the applicant alone had been maintaining the two children, until the Court made orders for interim maintenance against respondent.

13.     
Under section 86 of the Family Law Act 2003, the primary responsibility to maintain a child or children lies on both parents and not just the mother or the father. Both mother and father have an equal and shared responsibility to maintain their children.

14.     
The respondent it seems from the evidence has secure employment as he's a fitter at Vatukoula Gold mine and earns $320.00 fortnight. There is no doubt that the respondent lives in a de-facto relationship and also has a child to look after from the said relationship, however I can only add to say that he has an important responsibility provided by law which he has to fulfill as parent towards his two children from the applicant.

15.     
Therefore in the courts view it is only fair and proper to ensure that the respondent be made to carry out his duty to maintain the children as required by law.

Conclusion

16.     
The applicant's maintenance application of the two children is therefore granted.

17.     
I order that the respondent pay child maintenance of $ 80.00 per week for both children. Maintenance payment to commence forthwith.

18.     
As for spousal maintenance I'm not satisfied that the applicant is incapable of supporting herself by reason of some physical or mental disability. Spousal maintenance will not be granted.

19.     
30 days to appeal.
