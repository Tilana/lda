<p><b>Part One: Resolutions and decisions 
</b></p>
<p><b> I.  Resolutions adopted by the Council at its thirteenth session 
</b></p>
<p><b>  13/1. 
Composition of staff of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> paragraph 5 (g) of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
in which the Assembly decided that the Council should assume the role and responsibilities 
of the Commission on Human Rights relating to the work of the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as decided by the Assembly in its 
resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of all relevant resolutions on this issue adopted by the General 
Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Council, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note also</i> of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner 
(A/HRC/13/18), 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note further</i> of the reports of the Joint Inspection Unit on the follow-up to the 
management review of the Office of the High Commissioner (A/59/65-E/2004/48 and 
Add.1) and on the funding and staffing of the Office (JIU/REP/2007/8), 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> that an imbalance in the composition of the staff could diminish the 
effectiveness of the work of the Office of the High Commissioner if it is perceived to be 
culturally biased and unrepresentative of the United Nations as a whole, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing</i> <i>its concern</i> that, despite the repeated requests to correct the unbalanced 
geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains that one region accounts for 
more than half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner and for more posts than 
the four remaining regional groups combined, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of continuing the ongoing efforts to address the 
imbalance regarding the regional representation of the staff of the Office of the High 
Commissioner, 
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> that the paramount consideration for employing staff at every level is 
the need for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and taking into 
account Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, expressing its 
conviction that this objective is compatible with the principle of equitable geographical 
distribution, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the 
General Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses</i> <i>its serious concern</i> at the fact that, despite the measures taken by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the imbalance in 
the geographical representation of its composition continues to be prominent, and that a 
single region occupies more posts in both the professional and technical categories, as well 
as permanent and temporary categories, than the other four regions all together; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Welcomes</i> the statement made by the High Commissioner in her report that 
achieving geographical balance in the staff of her Office will remain one of her priorities, </p>


<p>and requests the High Commissioner to continue to take all measures needed to redress the 
current imbalance in geographical distribution of the staff of the Office; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Notes</i> the increase in the past three years in the percentage of staff from 
regions identified as requiring better representation, and the various measures proposed and 
already taken to address the imbalance in geographical distribution of the staff, while 
noting with concern the small increase in 2009 and no change in the status of the prominent 
region, and stresses the need to implement additional measures to redress the prominent 
imbalance in a more expeditious way; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Takes note</i> of the progress achieved towards improved geographic diversity 
in the staff of the Office, and takes note also of the commitment of the High Commissioner 
to remain attentive to the need to maintain the emphasis on the broadest possible 
geographic diversity of her Office, as stated in the conclusion of her report; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to work on the broadest geographical 
diversity of her staff by enhancing the implementation of measures to achieve a better 
representation of countries and regions that are unrepresented or underrepresented, 
particularly from the developing world, while considering applying a zero-growth cap on 
the representation of countries and regions already overrepresented in the Office of the 
High Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Welcomes</i> the efforts made towards the achievement of a gender balance in 
the composition of the staff and the decision to continue to pay special attention to this 
issue; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> future High Commissioners to continue to enhance the ongoing 
efforts made in the fulfilment of the goal of a geographical balance in the composition of 
the staff of the Office; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Underlines</i> the importance of continuing to promote geographical diversity in 
the recruitment of and promotion to high-level and Professional posts, including senior 
managers, as a principle of the staffing policies of the Office of the High Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Affirms</i> the vital importance of geographical balance in the composition of 
the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, taking into account the significance of 
national and regional specificities and various historic, cultural and religious backgrounds, 
as well as of different political, economic and legal systems, to the promotion and 
protection of the universality of human rights; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Recalls</i> the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General 
Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001, on human resources management, in which 
the Assembly reiterated its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to 
improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical 
distribution of staff in all departments, and also recalls the request that he submit to the 
Assembly proposals for a comprehensive review of the system of desirable ranges, with a 
view to establishing a more effective tool to ensure equitable geographical distribution in 
relation to the total number of staff of the Secretariat; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Encourages</i> the General Assembly to consider further measures for 
promoting desirable ranges of geographical balance in the staff of the Office of the High 
Commissioner representing national and regional specificities and various historic, cultural 
and religious backgrounds, as well as the diversity of political, economic and legal systems; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Welcomes</i> the significant increase in the human and financial resources 
allocated to the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner and the impact it should 
have on the geographic composition of the Office; </p>


<p> 13. <i>Recognizes</i> the importance of the follow-up to and implementation of 
General Assembly resolution 61/159 of 19 December 2006, and underlines the priority 
importance that the Assembly continue to provide support and guidance to the High 
Commissioner in the ongoing process of improvement of the geographical balance in the 
composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to submit a comprehensive and updated 
report to the Council at its sixteenth<b> </b>session, in accordance with its annual programme of 
work, following the structure and scope of her report and with a special focus on further 
measures taken to correct the imbalance in the geographical composition of the staff of the 
Office.

to which everyone has the right to a nationality and no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of 
his nationality, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> its resolutions 7/10 of 27 March 2008 and 10/13 of 26 March 2009, as

of human rights and the arbitrary deprivation of nationality, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the authority<b> </b>of States to establish laws governing the acquisition,

broad issue of State succession, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> the provisions of international human rights instruments and international 
instruments on statelessness and nationality recognizing the right to acquire, change or

</p>
<p> <i>Noting also</i> general comment No. 30 (2004) of the Committee on the Elimination of

International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that persons arbitrarily deprived of nationality are protected by 
international human rights and refugee law as well as instruments on statelessness,

Persons and the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol thereto,  
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and

<p> <i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 64/127<b> </b>of 18 December 2009, in which, inter

in particular, the conclusion of its Executive Committee on identification, prevention and 
reduction of statelessness and protection of stateless persons No. 106 (LVII) 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> of the endorsement by the General Assembly, in its resolution 41/70 of 3 
December 1986, of the call upon all States to promote human rights and fundamental 
freedoms and to refrain from denying those to individuals in their populations<b> </b>because of 
nationality, ethnicity, race, religion or language,

persons in relation to the succession of States&#8221;, with the aim of examining the subject, 
including the question of the form that might be given to the relevant draft articles on 
nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States prepared by the 
International Law Commission, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that arbitrary deprivation of nationality disproportionately affects 
persons belonging to minorities, and recalling the work done by the independent expert on 
minority issues on the subject of the right to nationality, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its deep concern</i> at the arbitrary deprivation of persons or groups of 
persons of their nationality, especially on discriminatory grounds such as race, colour, sex, 
language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or 
other status, </p>


<p> <i>Recalling</i> that arbitrarily depriving a person of his or her nationality may lead to 
statelessness and, in this regard, expressing concern at various forms of discrimination 
against stateless persons that may<b> </b>violate the obligations of States under international 
human rights law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons whose 
nationality may be affected by State succession must be fully respected, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the right to a nationality of every human person is a 
fundamental human right; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recognizes</i> that arbitrary deprivation of nationality, especially on 
discriminatory grounds such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status is a violation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to refrain from taking discriminatory measures and from 
enacting or maintaining legislation that would arbitrarily deprive persons of their 
nationality on grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth or other status, especially if such measures and 
legislation render a person stateless; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges</i> all States to adopt and implement nationality legislation with a view to 
avoiding statelessness, consistent with principles of international law, in particular by 
preventing arbitrary deprivation of nationality and statelessness as a result of State 
succession; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Acknowledges</i> that 2011 will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of 
the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness,<b> </b>and<b> </b>encourages States that have not 
acceded to the Convention and to the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons 
to consider doing so; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Notes</i> that the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms 
of an individual might be impeded as a result of arbitrary deprivation of nationality; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses its concern</i> that persons arbitrarily deprived of nationality may be 
affected by poverty, social exclusion and legal incapacity which have an adverse impact on 
their enjoyment of relevant civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, in particular 
in the areas of education, housing, employment and health; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Recalls</i> that every child has the right to acquire a nationality, and recognizes 
the special needs of children for protection against arbitrary deprivation of nationality; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure that all children are registered at birth, and notes 
the importance of standardized and effective procedures for civil registration and identity 
documentation in order to help prevent arbitrary deprivation of nationality and 
statelessness; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Also calls upon<b></b></i><b> </b>States to observe minimum procedural standards in order to 
ensure that decisions concerning the acquisition, deprivation or change of nationality do not 
contain any element of arbitrariness and are subject to review, in conformity with their 
international human rights obligations;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 11. <i>Further calls upon</i> States to ensure access of persons arbitrarily deprived of 
their nationality to effective remedies, including, but not limited to, restoration of 
nationality; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the report of the Secretary-General submitted 
in accordance with Council resolution 10/13 (A/HRC/13/34);<b> </b></p>


<p> 13. <i>Urges</i> relevant United Nations human rights mechanisms and appropriate 
treaty bodies and encourages the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees to continue with the ongoing collection of information on the issue of human 
rights and arbitrary deprivation of nationality from all relevant sources and to take account 
of such information, together with any recommendations thereon, in their reports and 
activities conducted within their respective mandates; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to prepare a report on the impact that 
arbitrary deprivation of nationality may have on the enjoyment by persons of their human 
rights, including civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, and to present it to the 
Council at its nineteenth session;

Open-ended Working Group on an optional protocol to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child to provide a communications procedure 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 11/1 of 17 June 2009 on the Open-
ended Working Group on an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
to provide a communications procedure,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> General Assembly resolution 64/146 of 18 December 2009 on the 
rights of the child,  
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 33 (p) of General Assembly resolution 64/146, in which 
the Assembly called upon States to ensure that child-sensitive procedures were made 
available to children and their representatives so that children had access to means of 
facilitating effective remedies for any breaches of any of their rights arising from the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child through independent advice, advocacy and complaint 
procedures, including justice mechanisms, and that their views were heard when they were 
involved or their interests were concerned in judicial or administrative procedures in a 
manner consistent with the procedural rules of national law,  
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with interest</i> general comment No. 5 (2003) of the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, in which the Committee emphasized that children&#8217;s special and dependent 
status creates real difficulties for them in pursuing remedies for breaches of their rights, and 
general comment No. 12 (2009), in which the Committee stated that the right of all children 
to be heard and taken seriously constitutes one of the fundamental values of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the view of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, expressed by its 
Chairperson in her oral report to the General Assembly at its sixty-third session, that the 
development of a communications procedure for the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
would significantly contribute to the overall protection of children&#8217;s rights, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Takes note</i> of the report on its first session, held in Geneva from 16 to 18 
December 2009, of the Open-ended Working Group established under Human Rights 
Council resolution 11/1 to explore the possibility of elaborating an optional protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child to provide a communications procedure 
complementary to the reporting procedure under the Convention (A/HRC/13/43); </p>


<p> 2. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Open-ended Working Group until the 
seventeenth session of the Council, and also decides that the Open-ended Working Group 
shall meet for up to ten working days and report to the Council not later than at its 
seventeenth session;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also decides</i> to mandate the Open-ended Working Group to elaborate an 
optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to provide a communications 
procedure and, in this regard, requests the Chairperson of the Open-ended Working Group 
to prepare a proposal for a draft optional protocol, taking into account the views expressed 
and inputs provided during the first session of the Working Group in December 2009 and 
giving due regard to the views of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and, where 
appropriate, to the views of relevant United Nations special procedures and other experts, to 
be circulated by September 2010 in all the official languages of the United Nations with the 
proposal for the draft optional protocol to be used as a basis for the forthcoming 
negotiations; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Further decides</i> to invite a representative of the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child to participate in the Open-ended Working Group as a resource person and, where 
appropriate, relevant United Nations special procedures and other relevant independent 
experts; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to update and publish the report of the Secretary-General on the comparative 
summary of existing communications and inquiry procedures and practices under 
international human rights instruments and under the United Nations system, published on 
22 November 2004 (E/CN.4/2005/WG.23/2), and to present that report to the Council at its 
fifteenth session;

The right to food 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>all previous General Assembly and Council resolutions on the right to 
food, in particular Assembly resolution 64/159 of 18 December 2009 and Council 
resolution 10/12 of 26 March 2009, as well as all resolutions of the Commission on Human 
Rights on the issue,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>the holding of its seventh special session, at which it analysed the 
negative impact of the worsening of the world food crisis on the realization of the right to 
food for all, as well as its resolutions S-7/1 of 22 May 2008, 9/6 of 18 September 2008 and 
12/10 of 1 October 2009,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides that 
everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for her or his health and well-being, </p>


<p>including food, the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition 
and the United Nations Millennium Declaration,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights in which the fundamental right of every person to be free from hunger is 
recognized,  
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, the World Food 
Summit Plan of Action and the Declaration of the World Food Summit, adopted in Rome 
on 13 June 2002, the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 
November 2009, and the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures Concerning the 
Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net Food-
importing Countries, adopted on 15 April 1994,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to 
support the progressive realization of the right to adequate food in the context of national 
food security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations in November 2004, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
2006,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same 
footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic 
environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the essential foundation 
that will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating</i>, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration 
of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument 
of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of 
international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from 
unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the 
United Nations and that endanger food security, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced </i>that each State should adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and 
capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained 
in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of 
Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize 
collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked 
institutions, societies and economies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities 
are essential, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that, despite the efforts made, the problems of hunger and food 
insecurity have a global dimension and that there has been insufficient progress made on 
reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, 
determined and concerted action is taken,  
</p>
<p><i> Concerned </i>by the fact that the effects of the world food crisis are not over and that 
they continue to have serious consequences on the most vulnerable people, particularly in 
developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world economic and 
financial crisis,  
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading 
system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and sell their products, 
thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food, </p>


<p><i> Noting </i>that environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change are 
factors contributing to destitution and desperation and have a negative impact on the 
realization of the right to food, in particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its deep concern </i>at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases 
and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of 
life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security, in particular in 
developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>the importance of reversing the continuing decline of official development 
assistance devoted to agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of total official 
development assistance, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the pledges made to increase official development assistance devoted to 
agriculture, as well as that the realization of the right to food not only entails an increase in 
productivity but also a holistic approach that includes a focus on smallholder and traditional 
farmers and the most vulnerable groups and national and international policies that are 
conducive to the realization of this right, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the need to increase investment in agriculture from all relevant sources 
for the realization of the right to food, </p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the United Nations Human 
Rights Council, and 5/2 on a code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the 
Human Rights Council, of 18 June 2007, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms </i>that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity 
and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and 
international levels for its elimination; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also reaffirms </i>the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious 
food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be 
free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and 
mental capacities; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses grave concern</i> at the fact that the world food crisis continues to 
seriously undermine the realization of the right to food for all, and especially for one sixth 
of the world population, mainly in developing and least developed countries, who suffer 
from hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Considers it intolerable </i>that, according to an estimation by the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the 
age of 5 years do so from hunger-related illness, and that, according to an estimation by the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people who are 
undernourished has grown to about 1.02 billion worldwide, and that there is an additional 1 
billion people suffering from serious malnutrition, including as a result of the global food 
crisis, even though, according to the latter organization, the planet could produce enough 
food to feed 12 billion people, that is, twice the world&#8217;s current population;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Expresses its concern </i>that women and girls are disproportionately affected by 
hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and 
discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from 
malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice 
as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Encourages</i> all States to take action to address gender inequality and 
discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of 
women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to 
food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and </p>


<p>water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and 
technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Stresses </i>the need to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory access to land 
rights for smallholders, traditional farmers and their organizations, including in particular 
rural women and vulnerable groups; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to ensure the 
mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations 
bodies and mechanisms that address the right to food and food insecurity to integrate and 
effectively implement a gender perspective and a human rights perspective into their 
relevant policies, programmes and activities regarding access to food; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Reaffirms </i>the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious 
food are inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Encourages</i> States to mainstream a human rights perspective in building and 
reviewing their national strategies for the realization of the right to food for all, and to take 
steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as 
possible, to enjoy fully the right to food and, where appropriate, to consider establishing 
appropriate institutional mechanisms, in order to:  
</p>
<p> (a) Identify, at the earliest stage possible, emerging threats to the right to 
adequate food, with a view to facing them; 
</p>
<p> (b) Strengthen the overall national human rights protection system with a view to 
contributing to the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> (c) Improve coordination between the different relevant ministries and between 
national and subnational levels of government;  
</p>
<p> (d) Improve accountability, with a clear allocation of responsibilities, and the 
setting of precise time frames for the realization of the dimensions of the right to food that 
require progressive implementation; 
</p>
<p> (e) Ensure adequate participation, particularly of the most food-insecure 
segments of the population; 
</p>
<p> (f) Pay specific attention to the need to improve the situation of the most 
vulnerable segments of society; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Stresses</i> that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the 
right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated 
response and upon request, international cooperation in support for national and regional 
efforts by providing the necessary assistance for increasing food production, particularly 
through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop 
rehabilitation assistance and food aid, with a special focus on the gender-sensitive 
dimension;  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Calls upon </i>States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights to fulfil their obligations under article 2, paragraph 1, and article 11, 
paragraph 2 thereof, in particular with regard to the right to adequate food; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Calls upon </i>States, individually and through international cooperation and 
assistance, relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all 
necessary measures to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human 
rights objective, and to consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative 
impact on the realization of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free 
from hunger, before instituting such a policy or measure;  </p>


<p> 14. <i>Stresses </i>that improving access to productive resources and investment in 
rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in 
developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small-
scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to 
droughts; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Recognizes </i>that 80 per cent of people suffering from hunger live in rural 
areas, and 50 per cent are small-scale and traditional farm holders, and that these people are 
especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of various inputs and the 
fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an 
increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural 
policies are important tools to achieve food security and rural development; and that 
support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises is a key 
element to food security and provision of the right to food;  
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through 
national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land 
degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to 
the risk of drylands and, in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United 
Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in those countries experiencing serious 
drought and/or desertification, particularly in Africa; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Recalls </i>the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous 
peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the obstacles and 
challenges they face to the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take 
special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and 
malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Requests </i>all States and private actors, as well as international organizations 
within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the 
effective realization of the right to food for all, including in ongoing negotiations in 
different fields;  
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Encourages </i>all relevant international organizations and agencies to bring a 
human rights perspective and the need for the realization of the right to food for all to their 
studies, research, reports and resolutions on the issue of food security;  
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Recognizes </i>the need to strengthen national commitment as well as 
international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with the affected countries, 
towards the full realization and protection of the right to food and, in particular, to develop 
national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of 
hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food;  
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Stresses </i>the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and 
utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt 
relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable 
food security policies; 
</p>
<p> 22. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur to continue to cooperate with States in 
order to enhance the contribution development cooperation and food aid to the realization 
of the right to food, within existing mechanisms, taking into account the views of all 
stakeholders; 
</p>
<p> 23. <i>Stresses </i>that all States should make every effort to ensure that their 
international policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade 
agreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other countries;  </p>


<p> 24. <i>Recalls </i>the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against 
Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying 
additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty;  
</p>
<p> 25. <i>Recognizes </i>that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to 
halve the number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, while 
recognizing the efforts of Member States in that regard, and urges all States, international 
financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations agencies and 
funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding to realize the aim of halving by 
2015 the number, or at least the proportion, of people who suffer from hunger, as stated in 
Millennium Development Goal 1, as well as the right to food, as set out in the Rome 
Declaration on World Food Security and the United Nations Millennium Declaration; 
</p>
<p> 26. <i>Reaffirms </i>that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all 
people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their 
dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive 
effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, 
tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 
</p>
<p> 27. <i>Urges </i>States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and 
expenditures to the realization of the right to food;  
</p>
<p> 28. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of international cooperation and development 
assistance, as an effective contribution both to the expansion and improvement of 
agriculture and its environmental sustainability and to the provision of humanitarian food 
assistance in activities related to emergency situations, for the realization of the right to 
food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country 
has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and 
strategies in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 29. <i>Invites </i>all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and 
the International Monetary Fund, to promote such policies and projects that have a positive 
impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the 
implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the 
fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on 
the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 30. <i>Encourages</i> developing countries to establish regional arrangements with the 
support of the international community and development partners to ensure adequate food 
production and thereby contribute to ensuring food security, in particular in developing 
countries and in those countries that have scarce fertile land; 
</p>
<p> 31. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises to cooperate on the subject of the contribution 
of the private sector to the realization of the right to food, including the importance of 
ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture; 
</p>
<p> 32. <i>Also encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue his collaboration with 
relevant international organizations and United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, in 
particular the Rome-based ones, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food 
Programme, in order to contribute to ensuring that the right to food is promoted further 
within these organizations, in accordance with their respective mandates, including for the 
advancement of smallholders and agricultural workers in both developing and least 
developed countries; </p>


<p> 33. <i>Recognizes </i>the negative impact on the full enjoyment of the right to adequate 
food of insufficient purchasing power and of increased volatility of prices of agricultural 
commodities on the international markets, particularly on people in developing countries 
and on net food-importing countries; 
</p>
<p> 34. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur, within his existing mandate, to explore, 
in consultation with Member States and relevant stakeholders, ways and means of raising 
the capacity of countries, particularly developing countries, including least developed and 
net food-importing developing countries, to ensure the realization and protection of the 
right to adequate food for their populations, and to report on his findings to the Council; 
</p>
<p> 35. <i>Takes note with appreciation </i>of the report of the Special Rapporteur 
(A/HRC/13/33) and of the addendum thereto on large-scale land acquisitions and leases: a 
set of minimum principles and measures to address the human rights challenge 
(A/HRC/13/33/Add.2);  </p>
<p> 36. <i>Decides </i>to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, for a period of 
three years, to enable him to continue to work in accordance with the mandate established 
by the Council in its resolution 6/2 of 27 September 2007<i>; 
</i></p>
<p> 37. <i>Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur, as part of his mandate, to continue to 
monitor the evolution of the world food crisis and, in the context of his regular reports, to 
maintain the Council informed of the impact of the crisis on the enjoyment of the right to 
food and to alert it to possible further actions in this regard;

right to adequate food is indivisibly linked to the inherent dignity of the human person and 
is indispensable for the fulfilment of other human rights enshrined in the International Bill

Human rights in the occupied Syrian Golan 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council, 
</i></p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>at the suffering of the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian 
Golan due to the systematic and continuous violation of their fundamental and human rights 
by Israel since the Israeli military occupation of 1967, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>all relevant General Assembly resolutions, the most recent being 
resolution 64/95 of 10 December 2009, in which the Assembly declared that Israel had 
failed so far to comply with Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and demanded that 
Israel withdraw from all the occupied Syrian Golan, </p>


<p><i> Reaffirming once more </i>the illegality of the decision by Israel of 14 December 1981 
to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan, which has 
resulted in the effective annexation of that territory, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by 
force in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of 
international law, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with deep concern </i>of the report of the Special Committee to Investigate 
Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of 
the Occupied Territories (A/64/339) of 9 September 2009, in which the Committee 
expressed concern at the human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and 
the occupied Syrian Golan and, in this connection, deploring the Israeli settlement in the 
occupied Arab territories and expressing regret at the constant refusal of Israel to cooperate 
with and to receive the Special Committee, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, international 
law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirming the applicability of the 
Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 
August 1949, and the relevant provisions of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 to 
the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the importance of the peace process, which started in Madrid on the 
basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 
22 October 1973 and the principle of land for peace, and expressing its concern at the 
halting of the peace process in the Middle East and its hope that peace talks will be resumed 
on the basis of the full implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 
(1973) for the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>the previous relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human 
Rights and of the Human Rights Council, the most recent being resolution 10/17 of 26 
March 2009, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon </i>Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant 
resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Council, 
in particular Security Council resolution 497 (1981), in which the Council decided, inter 
alia, that the decision of Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the 
occupied Syrian Golan is null and void and without international legal effect, and 
demanded that Israel rescind forthwith its decision; 
</p>
<p> 2.  <i>Also calls upon </i>Israel to desist from its continuous building of settlements 
and from changing the physical character, demographic composition, institutional structure 
and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan, and emphasizes that the displaced persons of 
the population of the occupied Syrian Golan must be allowed to return to their homes and 
to recover their property; 
</p>
<p> 3.  <i>Further calls upon </i>Israel to desist from imposing Israeli citizenship and 
Israeli identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan, and to desist from 
its repressive measures against them and from all other practices that obstruct the 
enjoyment of their fundamental rights and their civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural rights, some of which are mentioned in the report of the Special Committee to 
Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and 
Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories; 
</p>
<p> 4.  <i>Calls upon </i>Israel to allow the Syrian population of the occupied Syrian Golan 
to visit their families and relatives in the Syrian motherland through the Quneitra 
checkpoint and under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and </p>


<p>to rescind its decision to prohibit these visits, as it is in flagrant violation of the Fourth 
Geneva Convention and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
</p>
<p> 5.  <i>Also calls upon </i>Israel to release immediately the Syrian detainees in Israeli 
prisons, some of whom have been detained for more than twenty-four years, and calls on 
Israel to treat them in conformity with international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> 6.  <i>Further calls upon </i>Israel, in this connection, to allow delegates of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross to visit Syrian prisoners of conscience and 
detainees in Israeli prisons accompanied by specialized physicians to assess the state of 
their physical and mental health and to protect their lives; 
</p>
<p> 7.  <i>Determines </i>that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken 
or to be taken by Israel, the occupying Power, that seek to alter the character and legal 
status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void, constitute a flagrant violation of 
international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian 
Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and have no legal effect; 
</p>
<p> 8.  <i>Again calls upon </i>States Members of the United Nations not to recognize any 
of the above-mentioned legislative or administrative measures; 
</p>
<p> 9.  <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the 
attention of all Governments, the competent United Nations organs, specialized agencies, 
international and regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian 
organizations, to disseminate it as widely as possible and to report on this matter to the 
Council at its sixteenth session;

in and around East Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the 
wall in departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, which could prejudge future 
negotiations and make the two-State solution physically impossible to implement and 
which is causing the Palestinian people further humanitarian hardship,

the Government of Israel to immediately end all settlement activities, in East Jerusalem and

further undermine and jeopardize the ongoing efforts by the international community to </p>


<p>reach a final settlement compliant with international legitimacy, including the relevant 
United Nations resolutions; 
</p>
<p> 5.  <i>Expresses its grave concern </i>at: 
</p>
<p> (a) The continuing Israeli settlement and related activities, in violation of 
international law, including the expansion of settlements, the expropriation of land, the 
demolition of houses, the confiscation and destruction of property, the expulsion of 
Palestinians and the construction of bypass roads, which change the physical character and 
demographic composition of the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem and the 
Syrian Golan, and constitute a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the 
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and in particular article 
49 of that Convention, and recalls that settlements are a major obstacle to the establishment 
of a just and comprehensive peace and to the creation of an independent, viable, sovereign 
and democratic Palestinian State; 
</p>
<p> (b) The Israeli planned settlement construction in the vicinity of the Adam 
settlements in the occupied West Bank, which constitutes a new settlement block;  
</p>
<p> (c) The increasing number of newly built structures, in 2008 and 2009, 
amounting to several thousand, including a large number of permanent buildings and 
structures, which undermine the efforts of the international community to advance the 
Middle East peace process;  
</p>
<p> (d) The so-called E-1 plan aimed at expanding the Israeli settlement of Maale 
Adumim and building the wall around it, thereby further disconnecting occupied East 
Jerusalem from the northern and southern parts of the West Bank and isolating its 
Palestinian population; 
</p>
<p> (e)  The implications for the final status negotiations of Israel&#8217;s announcement 
that it will retain the major settlement blocks in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including settlements located in the Jordan Valley; 
</p>
<p> (f)  The expansion of Israeli settlements and the construction of new ones on the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory rendered inaccessible behind the wall, which create a fait 
accompli on the ground that could well be permanent and would in that case be tantamount 
to de facto annexation; 
</p>
<p> (g)  The Israeli decision to establish and operate a tramway between West 
Jerusalem and the Israeli settlement of Pisgat Zeev, which is in clear violation of 
international law and relevant United Nations resolutions; 
</p>
<p> (h<i>)</i>  The continued closures of and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory and 
the restriction of the freedom of movement of people and goods, including the repeated 
closure of the crossing points of the Gaza Strip, which have created an extremely precarious 
humanitarian situation for the civilian population as well as impaired the economic and 
social rights of the Palestinian people; 
</p>
<p> (i) The continued construction, contrary to international law, of the wall inside 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> (j) The latest Israeli plan to demolish hundreds of houses in occupied East 
Jerusalem, including its decision to demolish more than eighty-eight houses in the Al-
Bustan neighbourhood of Silwan, which would result in the displacement of more than two 
thousand Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, in addition to the Israeli decision to 
evacuate Palestinian families from their houses in the Al-Sheikh Jarrah area of East 
Jerusalem and to replace them by Israeli settlers; 
</p>
<p> 6.  <i>Urges </i>Israel, the occupying Power: </p>


<p> (a)  To reverse the settlement policy in the occupied territories, including East 
Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, and, as a first step towards their dismantlement, to stop 
immediately the expansion of the existing settlements, including &#8220;natural growth&#8221; and 
related activities including in East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> (b)  To prevent any new installation of settlers in the occupied territories, 
including in East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 7.  <i>Urges </i>the full implementation of the Access and Movement Agreement of 15 
November 2005, particularly the urgent reopening of Rafah and Karni crossings, which is 
crucial to ensuring the passage of foodstuffs and essential supplies, as well as the access of 
the United Nations agencies to and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory; 
</p>
<p> 8.  <i>Calls upon </i>Israel to implement the recommendations regarding the 
settlements made by the then United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in her 
report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session on her visit to the 
occupied Palestinian territories, Israel, Egypt and Jordan (E/CN.4/2001/114); 
</p>
<p> 9.  <i>Also calls upon </i>Israel to take and implement serious measures, including 
confiscation of arms and enforcement of criminal sanctions, with the aim of preventing acts 
of violence by Israeli settlers, and other measures to guarantee the safety and protection of 
the Palestinian civilians and Palestinian properties in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 10.  <i>Demands </i>that Israel, the occupying Power, comply fully with its legal 
obligations, as mentioned in the Advisory Opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the 
International Court of Justice; 
</p>
<p> 11.  <i>Urges </i>the parties to give renewed impetus to the peace process in line with 
the Annapolis Peace Conference and the Paris International Donors&#8217; Conference for the 
Palestinian State and to implement fully the road map endorsed by the Security Council in 
resolution 1515 (2003) of 19 November 2003, with the aim of reaching a comprehensive 
political settlement in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council, including 
resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973, and other 
relevant United Nations resolutions, the principles of the Peace Conference on the Middle 
East, held in Madrid on 30 October 1991, the Oslo Accords, the Arab Peace initiative and 
subsequent agreements, which will allow two States, Israel and Palestine, to live in peace 
and security;

decision to demolish a large number of Palestinian houses in East Jerusalem, including in 
the<b> </b>neighbourhood area of Al-Bustan in Selwan, and the evacuation of Palestinian families 
in the Al-Sheikh Jarrah area of East Jerusalem, which is resulting in the displacement of 
more than two thousand resident Palestinians of East Jerusalem;

and detainees including women, children and members of the Palestinian Legislative

</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child and the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to 
National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, and bearing in mind article 27 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other relevant existing 
international standards and national legislation,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> all previous resolutions on the rights of persons belonging to national 
or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities adopted by the General Assembly, the 
Commission on Human Rights and the Council, including Council resolutions 6/15 of 28 
September 2007 and 7/6 of 27 March 2008,  
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> the need for reinforced efforts to meet the goal of the full realization of 
the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that the lack of equal opportunities and equal access to education for many 
persons belonging to minorities, in particular minority children, prevents them from 
contributing fully to their own communities and to the wider society, and perpetuates the 
cycle of poverty experienced acutely by persons belonging to minorities facing 
discrimination, economic marginalization and social exclusion,  
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing also</i> that the effective participation of persons belonging to minorities in 
national political, cultural, religious, economic and social processes of their societies is of 
paramount importance for their full and equal enjoyment of all human rights, and 
contributes to the alleviation of tensions, serves the purpose of conflict prevention and 
increases stability and social cohesion, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Urges</i> States to review, enact and amend their legislation, where necessary, 
as well as their educational policies and systems, to ensure the realization of the right to 
education, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to eliminate 
discrimination and to provide for equal access to quality education for persons belonging to 
minorities, in particular minority children, while protecting their identity, as enshrined in 
the Declaration, and promoting integration, social inclusion and a prosperous and stable 
society; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also urges</i> States to develop appropriate mechanisms for effective 
participation of and consultation with persons belonging to minorities in order to take into 
account their views in decision-making processes affecting them, with a view to promoting </p>


<p>greater participation in the political processes of the country and providing inclusive, 
informed and sustainable policymaking and implementation;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Welcomes</i> the successful completion of the first two sessions of the Forum on 
Minority Issues addressing the right to education and the right to effective political 
participation and which, through the widespread participation of stakeholders, provided an 
important platform for promoting dialogue on these topics, and as part of its outcome 
identified in its recommendations best practices and challenges for the further 
implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or 
Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, and encourages States to take into 
consideration, as appropriate, relevant recommendations of the Forum;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Commends</i> the independent expert on minority issues for the work 
undertaken to date, for the important role that she has played in raising the level of 
awareness of and in giving added visibility to the rights of persons belonging to national or 
ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, and for her guiding role in the preparation and 
work of the Forum on minority issues, which contributes to efforts to improve cooperation 
among all United Nations mechanisms relating to the rights of persons belonging to 
minorities;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Takes note</i> of the reports of the independent expert (A/HRC/10/11 and 
A/HRC/13/23) and of the Secretary-General (A/HRC/9/8, A/HRC/10/38 and A/HRC/10/38 
Add.1) providing, inter alia, an overview of minority-related activities of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and other United Nations 
mechanisms, such as the treaty bodies and the special procedures;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Welcomes</i> the inter-agency cooperation of United Nations agencies, funds 
and programmes on minority issues, led by the Office of the High Commissioner, and urges 
them to further increase their cooperation by, inter alia, developing policies on the 
promotion and protection of rights of persons belonging to minorities, drawing also on 
relevant outcomes of the meetings of the Forum; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Invites</i> the human rights treaty bodies and special procedures of the Council 
to continue to give attention, within their respective mandates, to the situations and rights of 
persons belonging to minorities and, in this regard, to take into consideration relevant 
recommendations of the Forum;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to present an annual report to the Council 
containing information on relevant developments of United Nations human rights bodies 
and mechanisms, as well as on the activities undertaken by the Office of the High 
Commissioner at Headquarters and in the field that contribute to the promotion of and 
respect for the provisions of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National 
or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a compilation of 
existing manuals, guides, training material and other tools dealing with minority issues by 
various United Nations entities, and to present the compilation to the Council at its 
sixteenth session;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner to continue to 
provide all the human, technical and financial assistance necessary for the effective 
fulfilment of the mandate of the independent expert and for the activities of the Office of 
the High Commissioner in the area of rights of persons belonging to minorities;

</p>
<p> 2. <i>Urges</i> States to promote a safe and enabling environment in which human 
rights defenders can operate free from hindrance and insecurity; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Underscores</i> that the legal framework within which human rights defenders

human rights law; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges</i> States to publicly acknowledge the legitimate role of human rights 
defenders and the importance of their work as an essential component of ensuring their

</p>
<p> 5 <i>Encourages </i>States to create and strengthen mechanisms for consultation and

<p> 7. <i>Also</i> <i>urges</i> States not to discriminate against human rights defenders on any 
grounds, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or 
social origin, property, birth or other status, and to desist, in this context, from any

including those promoting the rights of members of marginalized groups;

<p> 2. <i>Expresses deep concern </i>at the negative stereotyping and defamation of

belief still evident in the world, which have led to intolerance against the followers of these 
religions; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Strongly deplores </i>all acts of psychological and physical violence and 
assaults, and incitement thereto, against persons on the basis of their religion or belief, and 
such acts directed against their businesses, properties, cultural centres and places of 
worship, as well as targeting of holy sites, religious symbols and venerated personalities of 
all religions;

programmes and agendas pursued by extremist organizations and groups aimed at creating

Governments;

<p> 5.<i> Notes with deep concern </i>the intensification of the overall campaign of 
defamation of religions and incitement to religious hatred in general, including the ethnic 
and religious profiling of Muslim minorities in the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 
September 2001; 
</p>
<p> 6.<i> Recognizes </i>that, in the context of the fight against terrorism, defamation of 
religions and incitement to religious hatred in general have become aggravating factors that 
contribute to the denial of fundamental rights and freedoms of members of target groups, as 
well as to their economic and social exclusion; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses deep concern </i>in this respect that Islam is frequently and wrongly 
associated with human rights violations and terrorism and, in this regard, regrets the laws or 
administrative measures specifically designed to control and monitor Muslim minorities, 
thereby stigmatizing them and legitimizing the discrimination they experience; 
</p>
<p> 8.<i> Strongly condemns </i>in this regard the ban on the construction of minarets of 
mosques and other recent discriminatory measures, which are manifestations of 
Islamophobia which stand in sharp contradiction to international human rights obligations 
concerning freedoms of religion, belief, conscience and expression, and  stresses that such 
discriminatory measures would fuel discrimination, extremism and misperception leading 
to polarization and fragmentation with dangerous unintended and unforeseen consequences; 
</p>

integrated manner, of the United Nations Global Counter-terrorism Strategy, adopted 
without a vote by the General Assembly in its resolution 60/288 of 8 September 2006 and 
reaffirmed by the Assembly in its resolution 62/272 of 5 September 2008, and in which it 
clearly reaffirms, inter alia, that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any 
religion, nationality, civilization or group, as well as the need to reinforce the commitment 
of the international community to promote, among other things, a culture of peace and 
respect for all religions, beliefs, and cultures and to prevent the defamation of religions; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Deplores </i>the use of the print, audio-visual and electronic media, including 
the Internet, and any other means to incite acts of violence, xenophobia or related 
intolerance and discrimination against any religion, as well as the targeting of religious 
symbols and venerated persons; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Emphasizes </i>that, as stipulated in international human rights law, including 
articles 19 and 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 19 and 20 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, everyone has the right to hold 
opinions without interference and the right to freedom of expression, the exercise of which 
carries with it special duties and responsibilities and may therefore be subject to limitations </p>


<p>only as provided for by law and are necessary for respect of the rights or reputations of 
others, protection of national security or of public order, public health or morals and 
general welfare; </p>
<p> 12.<i> Reaffirms </i>that general comment No. 15 of the Committee on the Elimination 
of Racial Discrimination, in which the Committee stipulated that the prohibition of the

<p> 16.<i> Calls upon </i>all States to make the utmost effort, in accordance with their 
national legislation and in conformity with international human rights and humanitarian

promotion of a culture of tolerance and peace at all levels, based on respect for human 
rights and diversity of religions and beliefs, and urges States, non-governmental

Political Rights, without prejudice to the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee on 
complementary standards, and requests the High Commissioner to continue to build on 
such initiatives, with a view to contributing concretely to the prevention and elimination of

<p> <i>Recalling</i> all resolutions on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment adopted by the General Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and 
the Council, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>Human Rights Council resolution 12/3 of 1 October 2009 on the 
independence and impartiality of the judiciary, jurors and assessors and the independence 
of lawyers, and Human Rights Council decision 2/110 of 27 November 2006 on the 
integrity of the judicial system, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that no one shall be subjected to torture or to other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment is a non-derogable right that must be protected under all circumstances, 
including during states of emergency and in times of international or internal armed 
conflicts or disturbance and that the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment is affirmed in relevant international instruments, 
stressing that legal and procedural safeguards against such acts must not be subject to 
measures that would circumvent this right, and emphasizing that judges, prosecutors and 
lawyers play a critical role in safeguarding this right, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> that an independent and impartial judiciary, an independent legal 
profession and the integrity of the judicial system are essential prerequisites for the 
protection of human rights, including the right to be free from torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and for the application of the rule of law 
and for ensuring a fair trial and that there is no discrimination in the administration of 
justice, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Condemns </i>all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all States to implement fully the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; </p>


<p> 2. <i>Emphasizes </i>that States must take persistent, determined and effective 
measures to prevent and combat all acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, and stresses that all acts of torture must be made offences under 
domestic criminal law, and encourages States to prohibit under domestic law acts 
constituting cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> States to respect and ensure respect for the critical role that judges, 
prosecutors and lawyers play in the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, including with respect to arbitrary detention, due 
process safeguards and fair trial standards, and bringing perpetrators to justice; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also urges </i>States to adopt, implement and fully comply with legal and 
procedural safeguards against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, as well as to ensure that the judiciary, and where relevant the prosecution, can 
effectively ensure compliance with such safeguards; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Stresses</i> that effective legal and procedural safeguards for the prevention of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment include, inter alia, 
ensuring that any individual arrested or detained is brought promptly before a judge or 
other independent judicial officer in person, and permitting prompt and regular medical 
care and legal counsel as well as visits by family members; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Calls upon</i> States in the context of criminal proceedings to ensure access to 
lawyers from the outset of custody and during all interrogations and judicial proceedings, as 
well as access of lawyers to appropriate information in sufficient time to enable them to 
provide effective legal assistance to their clients; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Strongly urges </i>States to ensure that no statement that is established to have 
been made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a 
person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made, and calls upon States to 
consider extending that prohibition to statements made as a result of other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment, and recognizes that adequate corroboration of 
statements, including confessions, used as evidence in any proceedings constitutes one 
safeguard for the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Urges </i>States not to expel, return (refouler), extradite or in any other way 
transfer a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the 
person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, and stresses the importance of 
effective legal and procedural safeguards in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Condemns</i> any action or attempt by States or public officials to legalize, 
authorize or acquiesce in torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment under any circumstances, including on grounds of national security or through 
judicial decisions; </p>
<p> 10<i>. Calls </i>upon States to ensure accountability for acts of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and in this regard stresses that the 
competent domestic authority must promptly, effectively, independently and impartially 
investigate all allegations of such acts and wherever there is reasonable ground to believe 
that such acts have been committed and that those who encourage, order, tolerate or 
perpetrate such acts must be held responsible, brought to justice and punished in a manner 
commensurate with the severity of the offence; </p>
<p> 11. <i>Urges </i>States to ensure that any person who has been subjected to torture or 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment has access to an effective remedy and 
that victims will receive adequate, effective and prompt reparations, where appropriate;  </p>


<p> 12.<i> Emphasizes</i> the essential role of judges, prosecutors and lawyers in 
safeguarding the right not to be subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment and that in this regard States should ensure the effective 
administration of justice, particularly by: 
</p>
<p> (a) Enabling the judiciary to exercise its judicial functions independently, 
impartially and professionally; </p>
<p> (b) Taking effective measures to prevent and combat any unlawful interference 
of any kind, such as threats, harassment, intimidation and assaults on judges, prosecutors 
and lawyers, as well as ensuring that any such interference is promptly, effectively, 
independently and impartially investigated with a view to bringing those responsible to 
justice; 
</p>
<p> (c) Taking effective measures for combating corruption in the administration of 
justice, establishing proper legal aid programmes and having judges, prosecutors and 
lawyers adequately and in sufficient numbers selected, trained and remunerated; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Also emphasizes</i> the importance of international cooperation, including 
financial assistance, to assist States, upon their request, in their national efforts to 
strengthen administration of justice; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Urges</i> all States to consider establishing or to maintain and enhance 
independent and effective mechanisms with qualified legal and other relevant expertise to

with those for other serious crimes, recognizing that persons convicted of sexual violence 
against children should be prevented from working with children until such time as national

<p>248. At the same meeting, the representative of the United States of America made a 
statement in explanation of vote before the vote.  
</p>
<p>249. Also at the same meeting, the draft resolution, as orally revised, was adopted 
without a vote. 
</p>
<p>250. For the text as adopted, see part one, chapter I, resolution 13/17. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reports of the Advisory Committee 
</b></p>
<p>251. At the 44th meeting, on 26 March 2010, the President of the Council made a 
statement in relation to the reports of the Advisory Committee on its third and fourth 
sessions (for the text of the President&#8217;s statement, see part one, chapter III, PRST/13/1). 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>252. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251, Council resolution 5/1 and 
President&#8217;s statements PRST/8/1 and PRST/9/2 on modalities and practices for the 
universal periodic review process, the Council considered the outcome of the reviews 
conducted during the sixth session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
Review, held from 30 November to 11 December 2009. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Consideration of the universal periodic review outcomes 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Eritrea 
</b></p>
<p>253. The review of Eritrea was held on 30 November 2009 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Eritrea in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/ERI/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/ERI/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/ERI/3). 
</p>
<p>254. At its 28th meeting, on 17 March 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Eritrea (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>255. The outcome of the review on Eritrea comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/13/2), the views of Eritrea concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/13/2/Add.1). </p>


<p><i> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions, as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>256. The delegation of Eritrea noted that, given the time restriction, it would only focus 
on a few elements of its written responses, which had been distributed to all stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>257. The delegation recalled that, during its review, 137 recommendations had been 
made. Eritrea grouped the recommendations into 28 clusters and after careful consideration, 
it had accepted close to 50 per cent of them; around 15 per cent of them did not enjoy its 
support. 
</p>
<p>258. Although around 40 per cent of the recommendations were not labelled accepted or 
rejected, Eritrea had made clear statements in that regard. 
</p>
<p>259. Regarding the accession of Eritrea to the Convention against Torture, the delegation 
noted that the recommendations had been accepted. The recommendations relating to its 
accession to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities had also been 
accepted. 
</p>
<p>260. Concerning the ratification or accession to the Optional Protocols to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, the Convention against Torture and the acceptance of the 
jurisdiction of the Committee on enforced disappearance, the delegation indicated that these 
recommendations did not enjoy the support of Eritrea. 
</p>
<p>261. The delegation indicated that the recommendations relating to the ratification of the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, including its accession to the privileges 
and immunities, did not enjoy the support of Eritrea. It noted that the Rome Statute raised 
various unanswered questions in terms of contents, scope and practical implementation, 
especially with regard to Africa. 
</p>
<p>262. Concerning the abolition of the death penalty, the delegation stated that the death 
penalty could be a deterrent in extreme cases. In Eritrea, the death penalty had been applied 
only in extreme and limited cases. Taking into account the particularities and the historical 
and cultural background of Eritrea, the abolition of the death penalty was not warranted at 
the present time. 
</p>
<p>263. The delegation indicated that the recommendations relating to the accession to the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families, as well as the ratification of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the 
Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour (Convention No. 182) had both been 
accepted. 
</p>
<p>264. The delegation also indicated its acceptance of the principle of establishing a 
national institute to promote and protect human rights. It stated that article 32, sub article 11 
of the Constitution of Eritrea provided for the National Assembly to establish a standing 
committee in order to promote and protect the rights of Eritrean citizens through, inter alia, 
the establishment of forums where the complaints and petitions of citizens were heard and 
addressed. 
</p>
<p>265. Regarding children&#8217;s rights, the delegation indicated that recommendations 25, 42, 
and 73 to 78 had been accepted. 
</p>
<p>266. Turning to the issue of standing invitation to human rights special procedures, the 
delegation indicated that requests for an invitation by special procedures were considered 
on a case-by-case basis. </p>


<p>267. The delegation noted that the recommendations on the cooperation with special 
procedures and United Nations treaty bodies (the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), and follow-
up to universal periodic review recommendations had been accepted. 
</p>
<p>268. Regarding the issue of same-sex activity between consenting adults, the delegation 
indicated that these recommendations were in direct conflict with the values and traditions 
of the Eritrean people and did not, therefore, enjoy the support of the Government. 
</p>
<p>269. On the right to life, physical integrity and security, on gender equality and female 
genital mutilation, and domestic and sexual violence, the delegation stated that the 
recommendations had been accepted. 
</p>
<p>270. Regarding national service, underage military conscription and torture, the 
delegation indicated that these recommendations did not enjoy the support of Eritrea. It 
noted that members of the Eritrean Defence Forces were highly disciplined and humane. In 
the rare cases of abuse, severe punishment was imposed on offenders. There was no under-
age recruitment into the national military and no one was tortured or subjected to cruel and 
degrading or inhuman treatment by the police or the military as a general practice. 
Nevertheless, the Government spared no effort in prosecuting anyone found guilty of 
subjecting people to inhuman and degrading treatment, torture or exacting forced and/or 
free labour of youth in the national service programme. 
</p>
<p>271. The recommendations regarding national service did not enjoy the support of 
Eritrea, since the national service, which is enshrined in the Constitution, was established 
with the sacred duty and responsibility of defending the country&#8217;s sovereignty and 
independence. Eritrea remained under military threat; as long as it existed, Eritrea would 
protect its sovereignty and independence the way it deemed appropriate. The inability or 
unwillingness of the international community in general and the sponsors of the Algiers 
Peace Agreement in particular to enforce respect of the ruling of the Eritrea-Ethiopia 
Boundary Commission and international law had been a serious cause for the deterioration 
of peace and security in the Horn of Africa. The delegation denounced the double standards 
with which the international community treated Eritrea. 
</p>
<p>272. The delegation highlighted the fact that Eritrea had begun its demobilization process 
in 2002. In the past five years in particular, graduates of the Sawa school had been 
(depending on their academic performance) provided with basically three career 
opportunities: joining degree programme institutions; joining one-to-three-year diploma or 
certificate schools; or joining the civil service. 
</p>
<p>273. Concerning detention centres, torture, involuntary disappearances and due process of 
law, the delegation stated that torture was illegal in Eritrea and there were no secret 
detention centres in the country. Due process was the law of the land. Any transgressor in 
these areas was accountable before the law. The Special Court had been established by law 
to implement the Government&#8217;s zero-tolerance policy on corruption, theft and 
embezzlement, and it was carrying out its duties in line with those mandates. Nevertheless, 
the Special Court was currently under review with regard to procedure and substance. 
</p>
<p>274. Regarding the rights of returnees, the delegation indicated that recommendation 107 
had been accepted. 
</p>
<p>275. Concerning social services, poverty reduction and the Millennium Development 
Goals, the delegation noted that recommendations 116 to 125 had been accepted. 
</p>
<p>276. The delegation also indicated that the recommendations relating to technical 
assistance had been accepted. Eritrea welcomed the building of partnerships that enhanced 
its human, development and institutional capacity, enabling it to further and deepen its 
commitment to promote and protect the rights and dignities of its citizens. Its efforts in this </p>


<p>regard were hampered by the failure to respect the ruling of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary 
Commission. Eritrea called upon the international community to take steps to ensure that 
the illegal occupation of its sovereign territory was stopped. 
</p>
<p><i> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i></p>
<p>277. Cuba viewed positively the fact that Eritrea had accepted the recommendations it 
had made, in particular those relating to improving the quality and accessibility of health 
services for all. Cuba noted that, in spite of the problems it faced, Eritrea had made progress 
in the areas of health and education. It congratulated Eritrea on the policies and 
programmes adopted, in particular those on increasing the budget for education and the 
strengthening of efforts to eradicate poverty. Cuba considered that the actions taken by 
Eritrea, a developing country, must be supported by the international community. In this 
context, it called for the intensification of the cooperation and financial assistance extended 
to Eritrea, as this would contribute to the implementation of programmes to promote human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>278. The United States of America welcomed Eritrea&#8217;s decision to allow official visits of 
international human rights organizations. It concurred with concerns expressed by the 
delegations of the United Kingdom, Austria and Australia that Eritrea continued to 
arbitrarily arrest, detain, abuse and torture political dissenters and religious adherents, 
forcibly returned asylum-seekers and independent journalists. It requested Eritrea to give 
due consideration to conducting a national review to examine the need to maintain the 
national state of emergency that had curbed its citizens&#8217; basic human rights. 
</p>
<p>279. Saudi Arabia thanked Eritrea for its statement, which clarified its position on 
recommendations made in the Working Group. It considered that the report reflected 
Eritrea&#8217;s engagement with the Council mechanism. Eritrea was cooperating with all 
mechanisms and special procedures, which was a clear indication of the interest paid to 
human rights and its keenness to uphold and develop economic, social, cultural, civil and 
political rights. It noted that the review of the situation was an opportunity to learn of the 
efforts made to develop laws and institutions to promote human rights; it urged Eritrea to 
continue such efforts. 
</p>
<p>280. Italy stated that Eritrea had been open to the suggestions and recommendations put 
forward during the interactive dialogue. It however noted with concern that Eritrea had 
rejected important recommendations for further progress. Italy noted that, although it was 
needed for a meaningful follow-up, Eritrea had not provided a clear position on all 
recommendations, and thus encouraged Eritrea to provide replies to all recommendations. 
</p>
<p>281. Algeria stated that Eritrea&#8217;s participation in the universal periodic review process 
testified to its commitment to human rights despite the challenges faced after 30 years of 
conflict. Algeria congratulated Eritrea on its positive reaction and clear responses to the 
recommendations, including those made by Algeria. The latter related to the establishment 
of an independent national human rights institution, the improvement of programmes for 
children, awareness-raising to combat female genital mutilation and the partnership to be 
built to enhance human development and institutional capacity, to realize the full enjoyment 
of human rights by its citizens. 
</p>
<p><i> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>282. The Network of African National Human Rights Institutions expressed its 
satisfaction regarding the recommendation on the establishment of a national human rights 
institution in accordance with Paris Principles. It also referred to the recommendation 
calling for the development of a wide political dialogue aimed at involving all stakeholders 
in the national political process, including through the independence of the judiciary and </p>


<p>freedom of expression and press freedom. The Network encouraged Eritrea to set up an 
efficient and inclusive partnership aimed at getting technical assistance, and called upon 
regional and international partners to support Eritrea in areas relating to human rights 
protection. 
</p>
<p>283. Reporters Without Borders estimated that some 30 journalists were being held in 
Eritrean prisons without having been convicted, and that sources indicated that they had 
been submitted to torture and other cruel treatment. It noted that, during the review, Eritrea 
had stated that no one had been imprisoned for expressing their opinion. However, Eritrea 
had then declared that freedom of the press was &#8220;another issue&#8221;, adding that, after having 
initially recognized freedom of the press to private enterprises, it had been forced to take 
&#8220;corrective measures&#8221;. Reporters Without Borders noted that four imprisoned journalists 
had died in recent years, and that it had sent a letter to the Special Rapporteur on torture to 
ask him to do everything in his power to improve conditions of detention of imprisoned 
journalists in Eritrea. It affirmed that witnesses had described the existence of underground 
isolation cells where prisoners were chained to the walls. Witnesses also reported incidents 
of detainees being exposed for long periods to the scorching sun and of being held in metal 
containers. 
</p>
<p>284. The International Fellowship of Reconciliation stated that enforced indefinite 
national service was an increasing element of the human rights crisis in Eritrea. The 
compulsory 18 months of national service could be extended until the age of 50 in cases of 
mobilization or emergency. It highlighted the lack of any rights to conscientious objection, 
the incidence of forced labour and the threats to families of those who deserted. As a 
consequence, many people fled or attempted to flee the country, and mentioned the special 
situation of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses in this regard. 
</p>
<p>285. Human Rights Watch urged Eritrea to implement the universal periodic review 
outcome, including by issuing a standing invitation to special procedures. It stated that 
scores of Eritreans experienced arbitrary detention and ill-treatment because they were 
unwilling to perform indefinite military service or declared themselves conscientious 
objectors. It urged Eritrea to implement the recommendations to establish the right to 
conscientious objection. It also expressed concern at the secret detention of persons, 
without access to appropriate medical care, lawyers or family. It requested that Eritrea 
implement recommendations to permit access to all detention facilities by independent 
international monitors. It requested that Eritrea, in the implementation of the review 
outcome, allow independent voices to be established and to pursue their rights to free 
expression and association. Regarding the violation of freedom of opinion and worship, 
Eritrea should repeal its ban on religions, cease its practice of arresting individuals who 
meet and practise other faiths, and end discrimination against Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses. 
</p>
<p>286. Interfaith International, in a joint statement with Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense 
des droits de l&#8217;homme, stated that the presence of Eritrea was testimony to its willingness to 
establish dialogue with the international community after the end of the armed conflict. It 
noted that Eritrea had rejected half of the recommendations. It expressed concern at the 
increasing numbers of training camps in Eritrea for military groups spreading terror in the 
subregion and at the presence of pirates on Eritrean coasts. It urged Eritrea to cooperate 
with the international community to end the instability in the subregion, to develop a 
national plan of action for the rehabilitation of the victims of the successive conflicts and to 
revise the rules applicable to press bodies and human rights organizations. 
</p>
<p>287. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network considered that the criminalization of 
consensual same-sex conduct under the Penal Code was an issue of concern. It reminded 
Eritrea of its primary obligation to respect international law, noting that the treaty bodies 
had repeatedly affirmed that laws criminalizing homosexuality violated international rights 
to privacy and non-discrimination. It urged Eritrea to repeal all legislative provisions that </p>


<p>criminalized activity between consenting adults of the same sex, to take measures to 
recognize and protect the rights of sexual and gender minorities, and to extend its HIV 
intervention programmes to include same-sex practising people. 
</p>
<p>288. Conscience and Peace Tax International stated that Eritrea had rejected all 
recommendations relating to military service, except those included under the heading of 
domestic and sexual violence and exploitation of female soldiers, without addressing their 
prevention. It added that the current military service system was an important cause of the 
flood of refugees from Eritrea in recent years. It added that Eritrea should take effective 
measures to prevent the recruitment of persons under 18 years of age into the military 
forces. It stated that conscientious objectors had been imprisoned, and made reference to 
the specific situation of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses. It called on States to give adequate protection 
to all Eritreans who had fled the country, and particularly to conscientious objectors. 
</p>
<p><i> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i></p>
<p>289. The delegation indicated that Eritrea firmly believed that promoting, establishing 
and protecting the freedom, liberty and dignity of the human person was a process achieved 
only through time. No nation had been automatically created as a bastion of human rights. 
Ensuring human rights in all its forms entailed a process, struggle and paying a price. On 
that score, Eritrea was on the right path and was willing to bet that its record could stack up 
with that of most nations. 
</p>
<p>290. In its short history as an independent State, Eritrea had made progress in the sectors 
of the rights of children, women and youth, the justice system, food security, education, 
health, human welfare, transportation, energy, and water and sanitation, to name a few. All 
this was testimony to its commitment to the promotion and protection of the rights of its 
citizens. 
</p>
<p>291. Eritrea recognized the challenges it faced in the human rights area. These challenges 
emanated from two sources: insufficiency of human, financial and institutional capacity; 
and interference of certain outside forces that disregarded Eritrea&#8217;s legitimate national and 
regional interests. 
</p>
<p>292. Despite these challenges, the delegation assured the Council and other human rights 
stakeholders that the people and Government of Eritrea were committed to the promotion 
and protection of human rights and to engage with the international community in this area, 
in the spirit of dialogue and on the basis of mutual respect. Eritrea was convinced that the 
advancement in human rights critically hinged upon peace and security. In this regard, the 
delegation stated that Ethiopia&#8217;s continued illegal occupation of Eritrea&#8217;s sovereign 
territory was an impediment to peace and security and, therefore, to the promotion of 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>293. Before the adoption of the outcome of the review, and in compliance with paragraph 
32 of Council resolution 5/1, the President of the Council invited Eritrea to clarify the status 
of a number of recommendations for which the country indicated that it had not taken a 
position. The delegation stated that the recommendations made had many parts; for 
instance, one recommendation stated that a clear order should be given to the security 
forces in Eritrea not to arrest anybody, or to that effect. The country already had laws that 
regulated the behaviour of the security forces. It was therefore very difficult to say 
categorically that Eritrea had rejected or accepted it. The recommendations did not lend 
themselves to that kind of response; the delegation therefore chose to provide substantive 
responses rather than to accept or reject recommendations. The President then indicated that 
he would therefore take it that, since Eritrea could not yet support these recommendations, 
they had been noted. </p>


<p><b>  Cyprus 
</b></p>
<p>294. The review of Cyprus was held on 30 November 2009 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Cyprus in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/CYP/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/CYP/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/CYP/3). 
</p>
<p>295. At its 28th meeting, on 17 March 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Cyprus (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>296. The outcome of the review on Cyprus comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/13/7), the views of Cyprus concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/13/7/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><i> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions, as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>297. The President of the Council made an opening statement, welcoming the presence of 
the delegation of the Republic of Cyprus for the adoption of the report on their UPR review 
and clarifying that as a subsidiary body of the United Nations General Assembly, the 
Human Rights Council adheres to the official United Nations position as reflected in 
relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, and therefore respects the 
sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus. 
</p>
<p>298. The delegation of Cyprus stated that its presence was due to the seriousness Cyprus 
gives to its international commitments and responsibilities, particularly in relation to human 
rights international and intergovernmental mechanisms, among which the universal 
periodic review was the latest and, potentially, the most promising. However, the 
acceptance to be subjected to the review by peers was on the understanding that the process 
was based on clearly defined and universal rules. 
</p>
<p>299. Cyprus had taken a self-critical look and accepted to discuss the challenges it faced 
and, where necessary, to take steps to improve its human rights situation, naturally 
expecting to be treated in accordance with the principles and objectives of the universal 
periodic review process. The delegation regretted that that was not the case. Despite this, 
the Government had decided to respond to the recommendations out of respect of those 
States that had adopted a constructive and serious approach. Its response to the 
recommendations was without prejudice to its declared position towards the report, as 
adopted by the Working Group, and could not be interpreted as endorsing in any way the 
content of paragraph 38 of that report. 
</p>
<p>300. Cyprus accepted the overwhelming majority of a total number of 70 
recommendations, as enumerated in section B of the document submitted 
(A/HRC/13/7/Add.1). Cyprus was not in a position to accept the recommendations 
concerning the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families, since this issue required further consideration, </p>


<p>bearing in mind the limitations posed by European Union jurisdiction and competence on 
the matter. 
</p>
<p>301. The delegation of Cyprus noted that there were four recommendations referred to in 
section E of the above-mentioned document, which could neither be accepted nor rejected. 
With regard to the recommendation on the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, Cyprus reiterated the importance it attaches to 
the Convention. The competent authorities were currently evaluating the possible 
ramifications of its ratification on national legislation. Recommendations 25, 54 and 69 
were not confined to the human rights perspective, but were rather linked to the overall 
political issue of Cyprus, and its comments were included in section E of the document. 
</p>
<p>302. Cyprus indicated having received all the recommendations with an open spirit and a 
genuine intention to engage in a meaningful internal evaluation. Through this process, it 
recognized that, despite the substantial progress achieved, additional and continuous effort 
was required, as reflected in the number of recommendations accepted. 
</p>
<p>303. In this context, Cyprus announced that (a) the instrument of ratification for the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict would be submitted within three months; (b) the instrument of 
ratification for the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, as well as the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, would 
be submitted within the next 18 months; (c) the Government undertook the commitment to 
submit all reports due to the human rights mechanisms within the next 24 months; and (d) 
within the next 24 months, Cyprus undertook to make its national human rights institution 
fully compatible with the Paris Principles, including its financial independence, as the 
relevant bill had to go through parliamentary procedures. 
</p>
<p>304. Cyprus reiterated that it had already ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture on 29 April 2009. 
</p>
<p>305. The delegation noted that the rights of children were of prime concern. The relevant 
monitoring mechanism of the Commissioner for Children&#8217;s Rights had been established in 
2007, in full compliance with the Paris Principles and general comment No. 2 of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child. Its recommendations had been duly taken into 
consideration by the Government, which was committed to reviewing and improving its 
policies constantly. 
</p>
<p>306. The promotion of women&#8217;s rights and wider gender equality was a major priority. 
The first five-year national plan of action on gender equality incorporated a holistic 
approach to gender equality in addressing employment, education, decision-making, social 
rights, violence and gender stereotypes. This was made possible through close collaboration 
of all Government departments, local authorities, women&#8217;s and relevant non-governmental 
organizations, academic institutions and human rights mechanisms. A ministerial 
committee on gender equality had been set up to monitor its implementation. 
</p>
<p>307. With regard to human rights education and training, Cyprus announced that, within 
the framework of the annual work programme 2012 of the Fundamental Rights Agency, a 
series of actions under the title &#8220;Human rights assessment of curricula and teaching 
materials&#8221; would be undertaken. 
</p>
<p>308. In relation to domestic violence, Cyprus noted that the concerted actions of 
governmental and non-governmental agencies were based on the relevant law and on the 
manual of interdepartmental procedures, which was being revised. A five-year national plan 
of action was in the final stage of deliberation. Concerning cases of police misconduct, the 
Government was taking measures to comply fully with the standards set by the Council of 
Europe. Several mechanisms were already in place to investigate allegations of police </p>


<p>misconduct and/or to impose sanctions where appropriate. These include criminal 
procedures, the Independent Authority for the Investigation of Allegations against the 
Police, the appointment of independent investigators by the Attorney-General, the 
Ombudsman, the Commissioner for Children&#8217;s Rights, the Police Audit and Inspection 
Directorate, and internal police disciplinary procedures. In 2009, the Directorate of 
Professional Standards was established by the police as an internal self-monitoring 
mechanism. The police had recently incorporated specialized courses, lectures and 
workshops on human rights, racism and diversity at all levels of police training. 
</p>
<p>309. The Government was determined to prevent and combat trafficking in human beings 
for the purpose of sexual or labour exploitation. In addition to the legal and other measures 
that the Government was taking, Cyprus extended an open invitation to countries of origin 
to cooperate in combating trafficking in human beings. 
</p>
<p>310. An unprecedented influx of irregular migrants in the last decade had placed extreme 
pressure on the financial and human resources of the country. Nevertheless, Cyprus 
recognized the challenges and would continue to honour its relevant international 
commitments. Cyprus was fully aware of the human dimension of migration and the need 
to ensure that individuals, in whatever circumstances, receive respect and enjoy their 
dignity. 
</p>
<p>311. The delegation was available to provide further clarifications. 
</p>
<p><i> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i></p>
<p>312. Turkey considered that the integrity of the universal periodic review must be upheld, 
the rules must be fully respected, and its politicization must be avoided. It welcomed the 
appeals made and hoped that they would discourage countries under review from 
attempting to exploit the process for political goals. Turkey stated that countries should 
refrain from including accusations against other countries in their national reports and in 
other presentations. One of the virtues of the universal periodic review was the equal 
treatment of all States, without any privilege. It hoped that this practice would endure and 
no other precedents would be set, but observed with regret the unusual treatment applied. 
Turkey had no intention to repeat the statement made at the Working Group session, which 
could constitute a response to the questions raised in the introductory remarks, and would 
further elaborate its views during the general debate on agenda item 6. Turkey had noticed 
the incorrect comments made in its Working Group statement in the additional information 
submitted. In order to save time, it would distribute its views later as a Council document. 
The report to be adopted included important recommendations aimed at promoting and 
protecting human rights; Turkey recommended that the concerned authorities focus on their 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>313. India considered that, without any prejudice to the position taken by the State under 
review not to be present at the time of the adoption of the report by the Working Group, or 
the reasons thereof, there was a failure in the collective responsibility to ensure that things 
did not come to such a pass. More time should have been allowed for consultations before 
the adoption of the report. This had set a difficult precedent, with wide-ranging implications 
to the extent that the obligations of the report on the State under review and the validity of 
the adoption of the report in such circumstances were unclear. This general concern held 
regardless of whether or not the absentee State under review subsequently decided to accept 
the universal periodic review outcome. It stressed that, while respecting and valuing the 
principle of freedom of expression during the interactive dialogue, it was equally important 
to emphasize that such freedom had to be exercised specifically and only within the ambit 
and purpose of the universal periodic review and in strict conformity with the principles 
laid down in Council resolution 5/1. </p>


<p>314. The United States of America noted favourably the establishment of the directory of 
professional standards, and stated it was an important step for the training of police on 
human rights, racism and diversity. It encouraged Cyprus to ensure application of these 
professional standards as a mechanism for promoting accountability among the security 
forces. It considered that the Independent Authority for the Investigation of Allegations 
against the Police was a positive step for combating police abuses, and encouraged the 
dissemination of information on these mechanisms to promote professionalism. It 
welcomed the steps taken to tackle issues of gender inequality and domestic violence, and 
applauded the establishment of the women&#8217;s multicultural centre, as well as the increased 
support given to the national machinery for women&#8217;s rights. It looked forward to further 
dialogue on the issue of domestic violence and curbing the reported increase. It would 
appreciate Cyprus&#8217;s continued attention to the recommendations concerning discrimination, 
particularly against Turkish Cypriots living in Government-controlled areas, Roma and 
other ethnic minorities, as well as violence and intolerance directed at lesbian, gay, bisexual 
or transgender individuals. 
</p>
<p>315. Armenia stated that Cyprus deserved sincere appreciation for its participation in the 
universal periodic review in good faith, and its sincere desire to discuss its human rights 
record without politicization, despite the obstacles. This reflected a genuine commitment to 
international cooperation and the protection of human rights in Cyprus and elsewhere. 
Armenia also stressed that the universal periodic review clearly demonstrated the 
international community&#8217;s acknowledgement of the accomplishments of Cyprus in the area 
of human rights. Along with similar recognition at the regional level, it might further enable 
Cyprus to meet its new commitments. Armenia commended Cyprus for accepting an 
overwhelming number of recommendations. It was particularly pleased to note that the 
recommendations regarding further promotion of political representation of members of 
traditional religious groups and the promotion of their identity and culture had received the 
full attention and agreement of the Government. 
</p>
<p>316. The Russian Federation took note of the constructive approach taken by Cyprus with 
regard to most recommendations, its expressed readiness to further the protection of human 
rights without any discrimination and its intention to implement universal human rights 
standards. This approach confirmed the position of Cyprus as a responsible State Member 
of the United Nations, committed to its international human rights obligations. It noted with 
satisfaction the positive response with regard to strengthening democratic procedures and 
institutions and harmonizing legislation and practice with universal human rights standards. 
The Russian Federation noted that the universal periodic review process was an 
intergovernmental mechanism intended to develop cooperation, with the full participation 
of the State under review, and counted upon continuing constructive interaction with 
Cyprus in the Council. The settlement of problems, particularly humanitarian problems, 
should be in conformity with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, first of all of 
the Security Council, while bearing in mind the communities of Cyprus. 
</p>
<p>317. Algeria noted the observations and recommendations it had made in relation to the 
improvement of wage differences between men and women; the promotion of the rights of 
migrant workers and of migrants in an irregular situation, to the situation of refugees and 
asylum-seekers as well as to children&#8217;s rights; and to the prevention of discrimination, in 
particular against minorities and foreigners, and in the area of education. Although Algeria 
expressed full appreciation to Cyprus for accepting most of the recommendations, it 
regretted the fact that the recommendations on accession to the International Convention on 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and on the continuation 
of efforts to promote and guarantee freedom of movement had not been accepted. It hoped 
that the intercommunity situation in Cyprus would make it possible for the authorities to 
respect the principle of freedom of movement in the near future. The absence of Cyprus </p>


<p>during the adoption of its report by the Working Group had led to a difficult situation that 
the Council should avoid in future. 
</p>
<p>318. Greece congratulated Cyprus on having participated very constructively at all stages 
of the universal periodic review and for its detailed responses, accepting all 
recommendations, with one exception. Greece regretted that, during the sixth Working 
Group session, the very existence of the State under review had been questioned, along 
with its sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity. Greece added that this 
question lay outside Council resolution 5/1 stipulating the principles and objectives of the 
universal periodic review. It firmly considered that the universal periodic review was a very 
important Council mechanism that should focus on human rights issues. 
</p>
<p><i> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>319. Interfaith International hoped that the universal periodic review would be the 
opportunity to lay the foundations for unification and reconciliation among the various 
families of the island. Interfaith International was surprised at the absence of Cyprus during 
the adoption of the report of the Working Group. Nevertheless, it considered that the 
presence of the delegation during the adoption of the outcome in the Council gave rise to 
hope for fresh dynamics in the social and political dialogue in Cyprus, in order to build true 
rule of law based upon fundamental freedoms. Interfaith International encouraged Cyprus 
to set up favourable conditions for the removal of restrictive measures, which would make 
it possible for the faithful to exercise their religious freedom and to visit places of 
pilgrimage annually, and to combat trafficking in women by setting up a mechanism for the 
reintegration of victims in social and economic life. 
</p>
<p>320. The European Region of the International Lesbian and Gay Association commended 
Cyprus for accepting the recommendation to strengthen existing non-discrimination 
legislation and to take all necessary measures to prevent discrimination on the grounds of 
sexual orientation, as well as for the law preventing discrimination of all vulnerable groups. 
It highlighted the research demonstrating that homophobic attitudes prevailed, and that 
lesbians, gays, bisexual and transsexuals were not only marginalized but treated as outcasts. 
It asked what steps were planned to give effect to the recommendation relating to education 
and awareness-raising campaigns for the general public and law enforcement officials. It 
also stated that, while recognizing that the northern part of the island fell outside the 
effective control of the Government, it reminded the Council that homosexual acts were 
still criminalized there, and called upon the Council, the Government and all concerned to 
work together to end this practice. 
</p>
<p><i> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i></p>
<p>321. Cyprus welcomed the comments made by States and international organizations, 
which would all be duly taken into consideration. The delegation thanked the States that 
had contributed to the review process with genuine human rights recommendations, and 
expressed its commitment to work for their implementation. In closing, Cyprus clarified 
that it had taken note of the four recommendations referred to in section E of the addendum 
for the time being. 
</p>
<p><b>  Dominican Republic 
</b></p>
<p>322. The review of the Dominican Republic was held on 1 December 2009 in conformity 
with all the relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Dominican Republic in accordance with the 
annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/DOM/1); </p>


<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/DOM/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/DOM/3). 
</p>
<p>323. At its 28th meeting, on 17 March 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of the Dominican Republic (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>324. The outcome of the review on the Dominican Republic comprises the report of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/13/3), the views of the 
Dominican Republic concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary 
commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in 
the Working Group.  
</p>
<p><i> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions, as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>325. Rhadys Abreu de Polanco, in charge of the Human Rights Section at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, made an opening statement, thanking all delegations and civil society 
organizations for their interest in the universal periodic review of the Dominican Republic, 
which was truly committed to the review mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>326. With regard to the recommendations regarding the signature and ratification of 
certain human rights treaties, conventions and protocols,4 the Dominican Republic would 
continue to analyse these instruments with a view to ratifying them as soon as possible.  
</p>
<p>327. With regard to the recommendations made on children and adolescents, the 
Dominican Republic indicated that, with a view to eradicate corporal punishment of 
children, Law 136-03 had been adopted. 
</p>
<p>328. With regard to the problem of exploitation of children, including prostitution and 
pornography, the Dominican Republic referred to Law 137-03 and related structures, such 
as the National Commission to Combat Trafficking and People Smuggling, the Inter-
Agency Commission to Combat Abuse and Sexual Exploitation of Children for 
Commercial Purposes, and others. 
</p>
<p>329. With regard to the recommendations on gender issues, reference was made to the 
national plan on gender equality and equity as the framework for the incorporation of a 
gender perspective in all public policies, and ensuring coordination with different actors. 
The plan complied with the international obligations of the Dominican Republic. Reference 
was also made to Law 24-97, the main legislation addressing domestic and gender violence.  
</p>
<p>330. Concerning the recommendations in the area of education, the stimulus to quality 
education with equity was fundamental to the educational system of the country, in 
accordance with general law 66-97. 
</p>
<p>331. Regarding the recommendations on racial discrimination, the Dominican Republic 
reiterated that the State did not have a discriminatory policy. The Constitution prohibited 
such acts. It further reiterated that the Dominican Republic was a multicultural and 
multiracial society. 
</p>
<p>332. With regard to the recommendations on the issue of illegal smuggling and 
trafficking in persons,5 Law 137-03 criminalized illegal smuggling and trafficking in 
</p>
<p>  
 4 A/HRC/13/3, para. 88, recommendations 1&#8211;12 and 22 (partially).  </p>


<p>persons. The General Directorate of Migration General had also taken measures in 
accordance with international standards to guarantee the human rights of immigrants. 
</p>
<p>333. With regard to civil registration, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the 
Interior and the Central Electoral Board were elaborating a plan for the identification of 
foreign nationals entering or who had already entered the Dominican Republic through the 
collection of biometric data, with a view to providing them with an identity number as 
foreigners.  
</p>
<p>334. With regard to the recommendations on extrajudicial executions, when such cases 
occurred, they were dealt with by the competent judicial and other bodies, and those 
responsible were sanctioned through judicial means, respecting the norms of due process 
and in line with a &#8220;zero tolerance to impunity&#8221; policy.  
</p>
<p><i> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i></p>
<p>335. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) noted the Dominican Republic&#8217;s cooperation 
with the universal periodic review, which reaffirmed its commitment to human rights. It 
welcomed the participation of civil society in the elaboration of the national report. 
Venezuela noted that the new Constitution resulted from the dialogue of citizens and 
strengthened fundamental rights. It highlighted the advances of the Dominican Republic in 
the area of social rights, in particular education. It encouraged the Dominican Republic to 
continue its efforts against exclusion and poverty. 
</p>
<p>336. Cuba noted that the Dominican Republic had accepted many of the 
recommendations and mentioned the efforts taken to implement them. It indicated that, as a 
small country, the Dominican Republic was striving to develop in difficult circumstances, 
aggravated by an international crisis and under the threat of natural phenomena, such as 
hurricanes. It highlighted efforts to combat discrimination, the measures establishing quotas 
for women participation in public positions, and the national plan on gender equality and 
the measures taken for victims of discrimination to have preferential access to tribunals. It 
also highlighted the programmes to address all forms of exclusion, and the important 
assistance provided by the Dominican Republic to the victims of the earthquake in Haiti. 
</p>
<p>337. Algeria appreciated the Dominican Republic&#8217;s commitment to the universal periodic 
review and its openness in dealing with the recommendations made. It commended the 
national report for acknowledging that inequality was a historical socio-economic 
characteristic of the Dominican Republic. It noted with appreciation the acceptance by the 
Dominican Republic of its recommendation on promoting equality. While noting the efforts 
of the authorities to eradicate corruption, it encouraged them to accede to the United 
Nations Convention against Corruption. It welcomed the announcement that the Dominican 
Republic was working towards ratifying the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, an example to be 
followed by countries claiming leadership in human rights but still reluctant to ratify this 
core human rights instrument. It also encouraged the Government to request the assistance 
of relevant international institutions. 
</p>
<p>338. The United States of America encouraged the implementation of the work of the 
Commission to Combat Human Trafficking and People Smuggling and of the Gender 
Equity and Equality Plan. It welcomed the fact that the Dominican Republic was 
considering establishing an independent national human rights institution. It commended 
the assistance provided to Haiti after the earthquake and expressed its support for the 
recommendations relating to cooperation with Haiti, to ensure that Haitians living in the 
</p>
<p>  
 5 A/HRC/13/3, para. 88, recommendation 22.  </p>


<p>Dominican Republic had adequate access to civil and birth registration mechanisms to 
establish their Haitian citizenship. It shared concerns about child labour, migratory reform 
and gender-based violence. It noted the concerns about the continued occurrence of 
arbitrary and summary executions, and supported recommendations to consider favourably 
the request for a visit by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions. It commended the proclamation of a new Constitution expanding the catalogue 
of fundamental rights and giving special consideration to vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>339. Haiti thanked the Dominican Republic for accepting the recommendation to 
relaunch the joint Haitian-Dominican Commission, an important mechanism of 
consultation, cooperation and negotiation between the two countries. It indicated that the 
recent earthquake resulted in the slowing down of the activities of the Commission, and 
expressed its sincere hope that the Commission would meet in 2010. The Dominican 
Republic had shown solidarity and fraternity, welcoming several of the injured from the 
earthquake and opening a humanitarian corridor to facilitate humanitarian aid to Haiti. The 
Dominican police had cooperated with the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti in 
tracking escaped prisoners after the earthquake. Haiti expressed its gratitude and hoped the 
cooperation put in place after 12 January would continue, and would strengthen relations 
between the two countries. 
</p>
<p>340. Morocco noted the determination of the Dominican Republic to strengthen its 
policies to protect and promote human rights by accepting an important number of the 
recommendations made. It welcomed the acceptance of Morocco&#8217;s recommendations on 
education and training in human rights, and the protection of the rights of migrant workers 
through implementation of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
all Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. The Dominican Republic was 
engaged in adhering to that Convention. Morocco noted the measures to consolidate the 
system to address extreme poverty, reduce the problems of hunger and help the families in 
precarious situations. It noted the efforts made to protect vulnerable groups, notably 
through innovative measures and actions for women and children. It highlighted the need 
for technical assistance from the international community. 
</p>
<p><i> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>341. While appreciating that a number of recommendations had been accepted,<b> </b>the 
Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network regretted that the response of the Government to more 
than 30 recommendations had not been available before the plenary meeting, thus limiting 
the capacity of stakeholders to engage meaningfully at this stage of the process. The general 
references in the oral statement of the delegation made it difficult to know the position of 
the country on some key recommendations still under consideration. It thus enquired 
whether the Government would distribute an addendum 1, a document matching its 
responses to the recommendations still pending. In that regard, it asked whether 
recommendation 25 of paragraph 88 of the Working Group report made by France was 
accepted. It commended the Dominican Republic for its support for the resolution of the 
Organization of American States (OAS) on sexual orientation, gender identity and human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>342. Amnesty International welcomed the Dominican Republic&#8217;s commitment to 
promptly designate the Ombudsman. It also noted the Dominican Republic&#8217;s support for the 
recommendations relating to the improvement of the legislative and policy framework for 
the protection of women and girls from violence, and urged its early and full 
implementation. It welcomed the Government&#8217;s commitment to adopt comprehensive 
strategies to combat racism, including specific measures to protect the status and protection 
of persons of Haitian origin, and further action to protect the rights of migrants. Amnesty 
International believed that these commitments would be strengthened by the prompt </p>


<p>ratification of the Migrant Workers Convention, as recommended by several States. It 
regretted the fact that the Dominican Republic did not support the recommendation to take 
measures to ensure that Dominicans of Haitian descent were not denied citizenship or 
access to civil and birth registration procedures and not arbitrarily subjected to retroactive 
cancellation of identity document, and urged the Government to reconsider this important 
recommendation. It also urged the Dominican Republic to support explicitly the 
recommendations to investigate all reports of human rights violations and to suspend 
persons suspected of such violations from active duty, to establish an independent body to 
deal with complaints of abuse by police and to ratify the Convention against Torture and 
the Convention on Enforced Disappearances. 
</p>
<p>343. Conectas Direitos Humanos thanked the authorities for giving impetus to the setting-
up of the Ombudsman office as follow up to the Working Group recommendation 2 from 
Peru, which partially complied with the Paris Principles on national human rights 
institutions. However, it expressed concern at the fact that the Government had not 
accepted a number of important recommendations, in particular the recommendation made 
by the United Kingdom on impunity and the investigation of killings by the security forces. 
Reference was made to the lack of confidence in the justice system, caused mainly by cases 
of administrative corruption, sentences that could be called into question by national courts, 
extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. Conectas invited the Government to 
accept and implement all the recommendations related to the rights of people in vulnerable 
situations and/or minorities.  
</p>
<p>344. Action Canada for Population and Development, while acknowledging the progress 
made in the area in the last decade, welcomed the Government&#8217;s acceptance of a large 
number of recommendations, many of which related to women&#8217;s rights and the elimination 
of violence against women. In implementing a number of recommendations, it called on the 
Government to allocate a larger budget to public policies aimed at the promotion of 
women&#8217;s rights through the effective implementation of the national plan for gender equity 
(PLANEG II), which had not yet been implemented. It underscored the importance of 
recommendation 26 in paragraph 88 of the Working Group report, and urged the 
Government to use a wide and dynamic interpretation of article 37 of the new Constitution, 
dealing with the right to life from conception to death. It also requested that, in conformity 
with its obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and other human rights treaties, the Dominican Republic 
ensured that the new Penal Code included exceptions to the criminalization of abortion, at 
least in cases where the life or health of a woman was in danger, or in cases of pregnancy 
resulting from rape or incest. Such exceptions would contribute to decreasing maternal 
mortality and to protecting women&#8217;s right to health. It called upon the Government to 
ensure that judicial measures of due process were applied to cases of discrimination against, 
physical attacks on, and murders of gay, lesbian, transgender and transsexual persons. 
</p>
<p><i> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i></p>
<p>345. The Dominican Republic thanked all delegations that had recognized all its efforts. 
It also recognized and congratulated the human rights organizations for their work.  
</p>
<p>346. With reference to recommendation 13 in paragraph 88 of the Working Group report, 
the Dominican Republic was up to date with all its reporting obligations.  
</p>
<p>347. With regard to the recommendation to extend a standing invitation to special 
procedures, the Dominican Republic noted that it had never rejected the request of any 
rapporteur wishing to visit the country. The Dominican Republic considered favourably the 
visit of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, which 
would need to be organized carefully.  </p>


<p>348. In accordance with the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action, and with the 
participation of the civil society, the Dominican Republic had already established an 
independent national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles, 
though it had a different name.  
</p>
<p>349. The recent Constitution provided for equality between men and women. Although 
the marriage of persons of the same sex was not prohibited, the Constitution indicated that 
the family was made up of a man and a woman, while articles 36 and 37 stated that 
everyone had equal rights. It also noted that the Constitution protected the right to life from 
the time of conception, in accordance with international instruments.  
</p>
<p>350. The Dominican Republic reiterated its commitment to continue cooperating with 
international organizations with the goal of strengthening its national institutions, and to 
comply with human rights requirements as set forth in the Declaration of Human Rights 
and all international human rights conventions.  
</p>
<p>351. In concluding, the Dominican Republic wished to clarify that it had accepted 74 of 
79 recommendations; it had only rejected 5 recommendations, as noted in paragraph 89 of 
the report of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p><b>  Cambodia 
</b></p>
<p>352. The review of Cambodia was held on 1 December 2009 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Cambodia in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/KHM/1 and 
A/HRC/WG.6/6/KHM/1/Corr.1);  
</p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/KHM/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/KHM/3). 
</p>
<p>353. At its 29th meeting, on 17 March 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Cambodia (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>354. The outcome of the review on Cambodia comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/13/4), the views of Cambodia concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><i> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions, as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>355. The delegation of Cambodia welcomed the constructive participation of States, 
international and non-governmental organizations in its review, and the adoption of its 
outcome. The Government had examined the issues raised in Cambodia&#8217;s review with a 
view to ensuring the smooth and practical implementation of recommendations. 
</p>
<p>356. The delegation informed the Council that Cambodia had responded positively and 
accepted all the recommendations made, adding, however, that it had reservations and 
comments in some areas. 
</p>
<p>357. Cambodia viewed most of the recommendations, addressing a wide range of 
challenges it faces, as essential to the promotion of human rights in the country. Some of </p>


<p>the recommendations were already partly being implemented, while others reinforced 
existing policies and actions being taken in relevant national plans for the coming years. A 
number of recommendations required study, reflection and pragmatic consideration to 
ensure their successful implementation within the time frame of the universal periodic 
review process. The delegation indicated that the Government had shown its political will 
by accepting all the recommendations for the sake of the improvement of human rights for 
its people. 
</p>
<p>358. On recommendations for Cambodia to accede to international treaties, the State 
would consider accession in a practical manner, despite resource constraints. The 
Government expressed a desire for more active engagement with United Nations human 
rights bodies in identifying priority issues that demand attention in the country. 
</p>
<p>359. With regard to land issues, the Government would continue to address challenges 
according to the existing reform programme and policies, ensuring further success. The 
efforts made to date should be recognized, the delegation added. 
</p>
<p>360. The delegation informed the Council of practical steps taken by the Government 
following the review of Cambodia in the Working Group. It cited the adoption of the draft 
anti-corruption law the previous week. The ratification of the law would proceed according 
to constitutional requirements, and promulgation would follow in due course. The law 
would be an important tool to combat corruption and go hand-in-hand with the penal code. 
</p>
<p>361. In the spirit of strengthening cooperation between the Government and OHCHR, the 
delegation noted that the Government had agreed to extend the term of the memorandum of 
understanding with the Office for two years, until the end of 2011. It cited the important 
role of OHCHR in providing relevant technical support to enhance human rights in 
Cambodia. 
</p>
<p>362. The delegation also cited the completion of the second visit of the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia in January 2010, who took note 
with encouragement of the progress in some areas, namely the strengthening of the legal 
framework, the completion of the first case in the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, the continued 
effort to reform the prison system, the adoption of the Penal Code, and an improved regime 
for public demonstrations. The delegation also noted that the Special Rapporteur had 
identified a number of areas of concern, including the need to develop binding national 
guidelines to address land reform; making the legislative process more transparent by 
sharing draft legislation with an impact on human rights issues with the wider community; 
and creating a Government and civil society forum to foster an environment of cooperation 
to strengthen democracy and human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p>363. Regarding the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, smooth progress was being made. After 
completion of the first case before the tribunal, the Office of the Co-Investigating Judges 
had recently announced the closure of the judicial investigation in case file 002. The 
delegation stressed that the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia were 
established at the request of the Government and were within the Cambodian court system. 
The Government would work cooperatively with the United Nations to ensure their 
independence<b>. </b>While obtaining justice for the tragic events of the past, emphasis would be 
placed on the compelling need for national reconciliation in order to build durable peace, 
democracy and prosperity for the Cambodian people. 
</p>
<p>364. With regard to cooperation with treaty bodies, the delegation noted that the 
Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture had recently visited Cambodia and it would 
enhance its cooperation with the body and comply with the relevant instrument. 
</p>
<p>365. Cambodia also took upon itself implementation of universal periodic review 
recommendations addressing socio-economic development issues, such as poverty </p>


<p>reduction, education, health, gender, the rights of the child and other economic, social and 
cultural rights. Such issues would remain top priorities for the Government. 
</p>
<p>366. The delegation expressed Cambodia&#8217;s commitment to the fundamental freedoms 
guaranteed by its Constitution, citing a recommendation made for the Government to 
pursue its efforts to constantly improve the level of enjoyment and protection of 
fundamental rights, consistent with the process of democratic development and national 
interests. 
</p>
<p>367. On tackling gender discrimination, the Government would strive further to 
implement important existing legislative and other regulatory measures and plans of action. 
A national strategy for equality and gender equity (gender mainstreaming strategy-phase II) 
was a top priority. Many other initiatives had been taken to support and improve the 
situation of women, such as programmes to increase schooling for girls and the promotion 
of women in leadership positions, including awareness-raising and human rights education. 
Cambodia would intensify efforts to improve human rights for women and children to 
combat key problems such as human trafficking, sexual violence, domestic violence and the 
exploitation of women and children. 
</p>
<p>368. Cambodia was also working to address issues affecting the indigenous community. 
A policy plan of action in this regard was being implemented at the national and local 
levels. 
</p>
<p>369. Acknowledging that the tasks ahead were challenging, the delegation noted that 
sustained efforts would be required, with a long-term perspective. The Government would 
strive for further progress by accelerating the implementation of its current plan and agenda 
to improve human rights in all relevant areas by its next universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><i> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i></p>
<p>370. Algeria thanked Cambodia for the additional information provided and welcomed its 
acceptance of all recommendations, including those made by Algeria. It valued the 
cooperation between Cambodia and United Nations mechanisms, particularly the Special 
Rapporteur on human rights in Cambodia. Algeria commended the recent adoption of the 
anti-corruption law, the reform of the prison system and the Criminal Code as well as the 
importance attached to implementing recommendations relating to poverty reduction, 
education, health, children and women. It acknowledged the political will demonstrated by 
the Government and called for the international community to support Cambodia in 
implementing the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>371. Viet Nam commended Cambodia&#8217;s acceptance of the recommendations submitted 
by Viet Nam, namely to improve its legal reforms and pay particular attention to poverty 
reduction, education, health, the rights of the child, the poor and disadvantaged groups. Viet 
Nam applauded Cambodia for its efforts to combat corruption and its ongoing active 
cooperation with United Nations human rights mechanisms. It noted that Cambodia had 
acted in a responsible manner in responding to the recommendations and encouraged it to 
continue to do so. 
</p>
<p>372. Malaysia thanked Cambodia for its update on the latest human rights developments 
in the country. Malaysia was pleased to note Cambodia&#8217;s acceptance of a large number of 
recommendations and that it had started to take steps to implement many of them. Malaysia 
welcomed the mechanisms established to guarantee the protection of fundamental rights, 
including economic, social and cultural rights, and in particular the promotion of gender 
equality, employment, economic growth and poverty alleviation. It encouraged the 
Government to continue to take necessary measures for the effective implementation of 
recommendations. </p>


<p>373. Thailand recognized Cambodia&#8217;s unfortunate legacy and expressed admiration for 
the progress achieved in moving the country forward. It commended the adoption of the 
anti-corruption law and the extension of the memorandum of understanding with OHCHR 
in Cambodia. It also noted that Cambodia had become party to most core international 
human rights instruments, particularly the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. Thailand expressed support for Cambodia&#8217;s efforts to tackle poverty and 
improve the lives of its people and welcomed the progress in the clearance of landmines. 
Thailand was pleased to note Cambodia&#8217;s acceptance of all the recommendations made in 
the Working Group. Reiterating the recommendations made by Thailand, it added that it 
would work with Cambodia towards their implementation. 
</p>
<p>374. Indonesia commended Cambodia&#8217;s efforts to strengthen democratic institutions, 
good governance and the rule of law. It acknowledged the role of the Cambodian Human 
Rights Committee and the Government&#8217;s efforts to foster an environment of cooperation, 
transparency and accountability. It highlighted the recent adoption of the anti-corruption 
law. It hoped that combating domestic violence and trafficking in women and children 
would continue to be priorities. Indonesia shared the view that wider socio-economic 
development, such as poverty reduction and better access to education and health care, was 
necessary. It hoped that Cambodia would further enhance the work of the ASEAN 
Intergovernmental Human Rights Commission. 
</p>
<p>375. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic<b> </b>commended Cambodia for its acceptance of 
all the recommendations, despite the reservations on some of them. It appreciated the fact 
that, after the review, Cambodia had taken all necessary measures to address pending issues 
on human rights. It recognized that Cambodia had overcome tremendous obstacles and 
achieved significant progress. It also commended the implementation of its national 
strategic development plan. 
</p>
<p>376. Japan<b> </b>welcomed Cambodia&#8217;s commitment to address all universal periodic review 
recommendations and hoped it would follow up on them, including through measures to 
address land issues. Japan appreciated Cambodia&#8217;s efforts towards democratization and its 
cooperation with the Special Rapporteur. It commended the efforts to establish a working 
relationship between the Special Rapporteur and the Government based on mutual trust, 
essential to improve the situation with effective assistance and cooperation from the 
international community. Japan hoped for the continued efforts of Cambodia and called on 
the international community for continued support and assistance. Japan pledged its full 
support through constructive dialogue with the Government. 
</p>
<p>377. The Philippines<b> </b>commended Cambodia&#8217;s commitment to advancing the socio-
economic development of its people by addressing issues of poverty reduction, gender 
equality, education, health and children&#8217;s rights, and for making these the Government&#8217;s 
priority issues. It noted that a national strategy for equality and gender equity was now in 
place, and welcomed Cambodia&#8217;s commitment to intensify efforts to improve the human 
rights of women and children, to combat human trafficking, sexual violence, domestic 
violence and the exploitation of women and children. It applauded the Government&#8217;s 
constructive engagement with OHCHR and the Special Rapporteur. The Philippines also 
called on the international community to increase its development cooperation and support 
for Cambodia. 
</p>
<p>378. Nepal<b> </b>commended Cambodia&#8217;s engagement with the international community and 
the United Nations, as well as the positive changes on the political and socio-economic 
fronts, gradually overcoming the bitterness of the past. It noted that Nepal was also making 
a peaceful transition from armed conflict to sustainable peace and inclusive democracy, and 
was engaged in the process of recovery, reconstruction and reconciliation; it wished success 
to Cambodia in its process. Nepal expressed appreciation for Cambodia&#8217;s commitment to 
democratic principles and to the promotion and protection of human rights. </p>


<p>379. Sri Lanka<b> </b>noted that Cambodia was building a strong democracy that promoted and 
protected civil and political rights, and expressed appreciation for its significant efforts 
towards the eradication of poverty. It noted that this achievement was particularly important 
in the context of a country on the road to peacebuilding and national reconciliation. Sri 
Lanka believed the recommendations made at the universal periodic review would enable 
Cambodia to further its efforts. It commended the ongoing preparation of laws essential to 
enhancing the rule of law and democracy and Cambodia&#8217;s commitment to establish an 
independent human rights institution. 
</p>
<p>380. The United States of America expressed appreciation for the establishment of the 
Extraordinary Chambers as well as of a national torture prevention mechanism. Expressing 
support for Cambodia&#8217;s cooperation with the United Nations in establishing a programme 
to combat trafficking and sexual abuse, it remained concerned about the well-being of 
children, particularly with respect to the worst forms of child labour. The United States 
reiterated the recommendations made in the Working Group relating to child labour, 
workers&#8217; freedom of association, freedom of expression and the inclusion of women in the 
political process. 
</p>
<p>381. China noted that the Government of Cambodia had prioritized economic progress 
and social development, and had achieved important visible progress in protecting 
economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development. It also cited the 
establishment of many mechanisms to promote and protect human rights. China noted that 
Cambodia had accepted virtually all the recommendations and urged the international 
community to continue to supply financial and technical assistance to the country. 
</p>
<p><i> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>382. The International Federation for Human Rights Leagues regretted that several 
recommendations made to Cambodia were of a general and vague nature. It expressed 
concern that at least 150,000 Cambodians lived under the threat of forced eviction, 
supporting recommendations for a moratorium on evictions until fair and transparent 
mechanisms to resolve land disputes and issue land titles were put in place. It noted that 
human rights defenders continued to face harassment and intimidation and increasing 
restrictions on the right to freedom of expression and assembly were imposed by the Law 
on Demonstrations. It highlighted concerns about ongoing political interference and 
allegations of corruption in the judiciary, noting that the lack of independence further 
eroded access to justice and perpetuated a culture of impunity. It urged Cambodia to take 
concrete measures to implement the universal periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>383. The World Association for the School as an Instrument of Peace, citing 
recommendations made, called on Cambodia to abide strictly by international standards of 
justice, particularly respect for the independence of the Extraordinary Chambers by 
facilitating its prosecution of perpetrators of crimes of genocide. It urged Cambodia to 
protect the rights of vulnerable people, notably through the equal distribution of wealth, and 
to reform the immigration law to preserve the fundamental rights of the Khmer people. It 
underlined the need to protect freedom of expression in conformity with international 
standards, noting recommendations that urged the Government to respect the 1991 Paris 
Peace Agreement on Cambodia. It urged the international community, particularly donor 
countries and signatory countries to the Paris Peace Agreement, to hold the Government of 
Cambodia to account for pledges made. 
</p>
<p>384. The Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development sought clarification on 
Cambodia&#8217;s reservations to the recommendations. It urged the Government to widely 
disseminate the universal periodic review report and take genuine steps to engage with civil 
society organizations in the follow-up. It noted the recent crackdown in Dangkor District, 
Phnom Penh, on 1 March 2010, against demonstrators protesting against the alleged seizure </p>


<p>of their farmland. Legitimate activities of human rights defenders were also obstructed 
when monitors from human rights groups had had their cameras confiscated and all photo 
evidence deleted. The Forum echoed the recommendations to implement fully the 2001 
Land Law and institute a moratorium on evictions until safeguards, such as prior 
consultation, full compensation and access to basic services and infrastructure in relocation 
areas, could be guaranteed. 
</p>
<p>385. Interfaith International welcomed Cambodia&#8217;s efforts to update its treaty body 
reports, encouraging the Government to abide by its commitments to systematically 
eliminate discrimination against indigenous groups and minorities. It urged Cambodia to 
ensure adherence to international standards on asylum procedures, urging that immediate 
attention be paid to the forced repatriation of Khmer Krom, who faced arbitrary arrest and 
torture. Interfaith noted that the Khmer Krom, upon arrival from a neighbouring country 
into Cambodia, were treated neither as citizens nor as refugees, rarely granted identity 
papers, forced to change their names and asked to provide impossible documentation such 
as Cambodian birth certificates. The situation was compounded by widespread corruption. 
Without identity papers, the Khmer Krom were in legal limbo. Interfaith also expressed 
concern about the deportation in December 2009 of 20 Uyghur asylum-seekers, identified 
as persons of concern by UNHCR. Their location and well-being remained unknown. 
</p>
<p>386. Lawyers&#8217; Rights Watch expressed concern about reports of political interference and 
corruption in courts, and that advocates representing villagers in land rights cases had been 
targeted with threats, harassment and defamation charges. It called for the implementation 
of recommendations for judicial and legal reform to address impunity and guarantee 
independence. It underscored the recommendation to ensure protection for human rights 
defenders and lawyers working on land rights. It urged Cambodia to observe fully the 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, and to take steps to ensure that lawyers are not 
subject to inappropriate influence or corruption, and the Bar Association is protected from 
interference. It also urged Cambodia to implement the Basic Principles on the Role of 
Lawyers, and to accept requests for visit by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>387. The International Commission of Jurists called for prompt action to implement 
recommendations. It expressed grave concern at the persistent reports of the improper use 
of legal processes by the executive to arbitrarily restrict freedom of expression and 
intimidate political opponents, particularly from the Sam Rainsy Party, journalists, human 
rights defenders and lawyers. It expressed concern that the Government undermined 
judicial and legal independence, noting reports of corruption and improper exercise of 
political influence over the judiciary, including in cases relating to forced evictions without 
appropriate compensation. It cited similar concerns relating to the Extraordinary Chambers 
and endorsed recommendations made in this regard. The Commission called upon the 
Government to respect the rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association of 
political opponents, journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders and to ensure their 
safety.  
</p>
<p>388. Franciscans International appreciated Cambodia&#8217;s commitment to persons with 
disabilities, to endorsing the recommendation to ratify the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and to ensure its full implementation in domestic law, and to 
protect the rights of vulnerable people, including children with disabilities, to provide them 
with the same educational opportunities as others. It noted Cambodia&#8217;s recognition of the 
importance of education as a major tool for national development of human resources and 
its ambitions in this regard, and stressed that children with disabilities must not be left out 
of these strategies. It recommended giving priority to children with disabilities in such 
strategies, suggesting initiatives for teacher training, especially in rural and remote areas, 
and to ensure that all schools provide proper resources that cater for special needs. It further </p>


<p>recommended effective human rights education programmes with specific attention to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p><i> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i></p>
<p>389. In its concluding statement, the delegation of Cambodia reiterated its gratitude to the 
intervening States for their constructive comments and critical concerns with regard to the 
human rights situation in the country. 
</p>
<p>390. With regard to issues raised by non-governmental organizations, such as land issues 
and the freedom of expression in Cambodia, the delegation stated that it had already 
responded to these on many occasions, both during the universal periodic review process 
and in various treaty body sessions. 
</p>
<p>391. It commended the universal periodic review process as one that offered the 
Government an opportunity to assess and reflect on its achievements and shortcomings in 
the promotion and protection of human rights. The process had laid the groundwork for 
further implementation of Government policies and plans of action to enhance human rights 
in Cambodia. Cambodia had learned to share the values of tolerance and freedom in society 
with all the attributes of its own uniqueness and characteristics of its own to overcome the 
challenges ahead. These were a source of strength and would lead to progress. 
</p>
<p>392. The delegation expressed appreciation for the technical assistance and support 
provided by development partners in its human rights endeavours. It reaffirmed 
Cambodia&#8217;s commitment to striving for the strengthening of the rule of law and the 
promotion of good governance, integrity and accountability, as reflected in relevant laws, 
policies and plans of action of the Government. It also reiterated Cambodia&#8217;s commitment 
to the success of the universal periodic review process and the development of the Council 
into a true global forum on human rights. Cambodia would thus join other Member States 
in working constructively on the review of the Council for its further improvement. 
</p>
<p><b>  Norway 
</b></p>
<p>393. The review of Norway was held on 2 December 2009 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Norway in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/NOR/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/NOR/2);  
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/NOR/3). 
</p>
<p>394. At its 13th meeting, on 17 March 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Norway (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>395. The outcome of the review on Norway comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/13/5), the views of Norway concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/13/5/Add.1). </p>


<p><i> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions, as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>396. Norway welcomed the universal periodic review as a unique opportunity to 
undertake a general, critical review of the human rights situation in the country. In that 
regard, Norway expressed its strong support for the review mechanism as a vital institution 
of the new Human Rights Council, which would have a real impact on the awareness and 
development of human rights in Norwegian society. The universal periodic review process 
had received considerable attention in Norway and the discussions on many of the issues 
raised would surely continue. 
</p>
<p>397. Norway highlighted the insightful and constructive comments and recommendations 
made by States, some of which would also rely on the groundwork of many civil society 
organizations. Norway referred to the role of civil society, which provided substance to the 
universal periodic review. The delegation noted that 115 recommendations were made for 
Norway, which clustered them into 91 on a number of issues focusing on the rights to 
equality and non-discrimination, racism and intolerance, the human rights of migrants, 
domestic violence, detention, human rights education and on the legislative framework for 
human rights. In the Working Group, Norway had accepted 44 recommendations and 
rejected one. The remaining recommendations were subject to careful consideration at the 
national level and were to be found in the addendum to the Working Group report.  
</p>
<p>398. The delegation highlighted that Norway accepted, in total, 66 recommendations in 
full and 5 in part; 2 recommendations had been converted into voluntary commitments.  
</p>
<p>399. The delegation mentioned the efforts made to fight against discrimination, as this 
issue was raised by several delegations, and remained high among the priorities of the 
authorities. Almost all the recommendations in this area were accepted, since the fight 
against discrimination, racism and xenophobia represented a matter of human dignity, 
respect and tolerance.  
</p>
<p>400. The delegation recognized the challenges the country faced in relation to domestic 
violence and violence against women and children, and reiterated its clear position that this 
should not be considered a private matter and should be dealt with by the authorities. 
Norway mentioned its full commitment to follow up on related recommendations.  
</p>
<p>401. The delegation referred to the 18 recommendations it could not currently support. 
For most of these issues, disagreement did not relate to substance, as this was the case for 
recommendations where the Government, owing to the constitutional separation of powers, 
did not have any mandate or possibility to exert influence on the process, such as the 
constitutional human rights revision. Other recommendations asked for the revision of 
plans of action, which Norway considered were in the process of being implemented, and 
regarding which review could only come at a later stage.  
</p>
<p>402. Despite the importance of the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families noted by many delegations, 
after careful consideration of its provisions, Norway confirmed that it was not in a position 
to ratify it. Norway was committed to improving labour standards, also of migrants and 
foreign nationals residing in the country, and had, to this effect, ratified all the key human 
rights instruments and the ILO core conventions on workers&#8217; rights.  
</p>
<p>403. Norway regretted not being in a position to provide a clear answer with regard to the 
signature and ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, since it was still in the process of examining the legal implications, which 
should be completed within the year. </p>


<p>404. Norway acknowledged that the success of the universal periodic review would 
require sustained efforts and political will, and looked forward to an open and inclusive 
dialogue on all the issues and recommendations that could not be currently supported.  
</p>
<p>405. Norway pledged to apply the same inclusive approach in the preparation of the 
national report to the review follow-up. Indeed, it would establish a comprehensive, 
systematic and coordinated process in partnership with all relevant stakeholders. Norway 
underlined that the universal periodic review process complemented the other international 
human rights mechanisms, in particular the treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p><i> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i></p>
<p>406. Algeria congratulated Norway on having accepted other recommendations. It 
expressed appreciation at Norway&#8217;s sponsorship of the &#8220;retreat of Algiers&#8221; on the Human 
Rights Council review process. It reiterated its satisfaction with Norway&#8217;s assistance to 
developing countries, which had been raised to 1.09 per cent of its gross national income. It 
encouraged Norway to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Algeria welcomed the importance 
given to the Millennium Development Goals in Norway&#8217;s development policy. It 
commended Norway&#8217;s commitment to combat racism and xenophobia, especially through 
the action plan for the period 2009&#8211;2012, and encouraged it to give further consideration to 
recommendation 19 made by Algeria. 
</p>
<p>407. Pakistan thanked Norway for its frank and elaborate presentation, including its 
detailed comments on the recommendations that were pending. As a troika member for the 
review of Norway, Pakistan commended the delegation&#8217;s positive approach to the universal 
periodic review mechanism and the fact that it had accepted most recommendations. 
Pakistan appreciated Norway&#8217;s strong commitment to the promotion and protection of 
human rights and acknowledged its contributions in helping to build consensus on 
controversial and difficult issues. It encouraged Norway to continue its constructive 
engagement on all human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>408. The Islamic Republic of Iran appreciated Norway&#8217;s acceptance of its 
recommendations. It requested clarification about the implementation of recommendations 
on ensuring that foreign students were not arbitrarily deprived of their right to education in 
universities; on the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples; as well as regarding recommendations on incorporating the content of 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in 
the Human Rights Act. It remained concerned at the rising incidence of domestic violence, 
violence against women and children and sexual abuse, and the high number of rapes, as 
well as increasing racist and xenophobic political speech and stereotypes against Muslims. 
Iran was worried at the broad definition of terrorism in the penal code. It was also 
concerned about and requested clarification on the capacity to address issues such as child 
pornography on the Internet, the rising number of rapes, and measures and legislation that 
endangered the foundation of the family.  
</p>
<p>409. Nepal noted with appreciation the achievements made by Norway in developing a 
strong foundation for democracy, pluralism, the rule of law and human rights. Nepal 
congratulated the country on its top ranking in the United Nations human development 
index. It also welcomed Norway&#8217;s commitment to fighting global poverty. It commended 
its efforts to develop a pragmatic approach to several pressing and difficult issues of our 
time.  
</p>
<p>410. The United States of America appreciated Norway&#8217;s commitment to promoting 
human rights, and commended it for implementing the Anti-Discrimination and 
Accessibility Act. It welcomed Norway&#8217;s commitment to consider ratifying the Convention </p>


<p>on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and favourably noted the programmes for 
migrant juveniles and their focus on secondary education and labour market inclusion. It 
reiterated the importance of the Ombudsman for children&#8217;s cooperation in addressing ethnic 
youth&#8217;s distrust of law enforcement officers as part of its ongoing efforts to combat racism 
and xenophobia. It commended Norway for steps taken to introduce restorative justice 
programmes for juveniles, and the attention and resources committed to unaccompanied 
asylum-seeking minors. 
</p>
<p>411. Hungary appreciated Norway&#8217;s exemplary efforts to protect and promote human 
rights, and highlighted the importance it attached to the fight against all forms of 
discrimination. Hungary welcomed Norway&#8217;s willingness to consider ratifying the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture and signing the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It also highlighted 
Norway&#8217;s pledge to uphold the policy of allocating a minimum of 1 per cent of its GDP for 
development assistance. Hungary also underscored Norway&#8217;s pioneering role in the 
promotion and protection of woman&#8217;s rights and programmes regarding social inclusion, as 
well as its international efforts aimed at ensuring that States fulfil their obligations 
regarding the rights of human rights defenders. Hungary underlined that Norway&#8217;s 
cooperation with the universal periodic review, and its transparency and openness during 
the preparation and the review process, could serve as a model to other countries, and 
highly appreciated its voluntary commitment to provide information annually on the 
implementation of the recommendations it accepted. 
</p>
<p>412. Botswana welcomed Norway&#8217;s acceptance of the majority of the recommendations 
and appreciated the additional information provided. It commended Norway&#8217;s decision to 
convert some of the recommendations into voluntary commitments, as an action-oriented 
approach. It noted with appreciation Norway&#8217;s leadership in the fields of promoting human 
rights and combating racism, as well as its constructive participation in the work of the 
Council.  
</p>
<p><i> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>413. The Norwegian Centre for Human Rights commended Norway for its self-critical 
and constructive approach to the universal periodic review. It highlighted two concerns. 
The first was the lack of response to requests for a new national plan of action for human 
rights. It regretted that Norway did not have a clear policy; indeed, no specific goals had 
been set; and no overall measures were initiated. There was no coordination of ministry 
initiatives, no plan for competence-building in State bureaucracy and no overall mechanism 
for political follow-up of decisions taken. Hence, the plan of action was seen as weakening 
the Government&#8217;s accountability when it came to its human rights commitments. The 
Centre was of the view that the current case-by-case, fragmented approach to the use of 
religious garments, primarily <i>hijab</i>, exemplified the challenges of policy coordination. It 
recommended that Norway commit to formulate and implement a plan of action for human 
rights and establish a high level inter-ministerial coordinating mechanism for its follow-up 
consultation with the Centre and civil society. The second concern referred to the 
ratification of international human rights instruments to which Norway is not yet a State 
party. In this regard, the Centre recommended that the authorities of Norway continue to set 
a good example internationally by giving priority to ongoing ratification processes, by 
ratifying the Optional Protocols to the Convention against Torture, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p>414. The Charitable Institute for Protecting Social Victims stated that a nationwide 
survey showed that 9 per cent of girls of the age of 15 years had been victims of gender-
based violence, and that a Government committee&#8217;s estimations of early 2008 showed that </p>


<p>there were 8,000 to 16,000 rape victims. It was concerned about the lack of comprehensive 
statistics on rape and the lack of prioritization by the Government of gender-based violence 
perpetrated by present or former partners. It recommended that Norway should facilitate 
women&#8217;s access to the justice system and emergency centres in police stations, and should 
train law enforcement officials dealing with gender-based violence considering the impact 
of weakening the economic welfare or societies. 
</p>
<p>415. In its joint statement, the Organization for Defending Victims of Violence and the 
Iranian Elite Research Centre referred to official statistics on domestic violence against 
women in Norway, and asked the Government to maintain a strong focus on the issue, 
including systematic measures to protect victims as well as to prevent rape and domestic 
violence through effective policies and targeted prevention campaigns, education and 
awareness-raising efforts, among others. The Organization was concerned at the methods 
used by the Government to deal with minority issues, especially in relation to Muslims, and 
requested the Government to take all necessary measures to eliminate discrimination faced 
by persons belonging to racial, religious or ethnic minorities, as well as persons with an 
immigrant background, in particular in the context of counter-terrorism measures.  
</p>
<p>416. The Institute for Women&#8217;s Studies and Research recalled Council resolution 10/22 
on combating defamation of religion, and expressed deep concern at the increasing spread 
of Islamophobia in Norway, and that the media, by linking terrorism to Muslims and 
drawing shocking images of Muslims, was endangering peace and stability. It stated that 
Norway had a fundamental role to play in preventing the spread of Islamophobia. 
</p>
<p>417. The European Region of the International Lesbian and Gay Association commended 
Norway&#8217;s engagement in the Durban review process, its leadership in issues of sexual 
orientation and gender identity and its efforts to enhance the Council&#8217;s capacity to fulfil its 
mandate. The organization asked Norway if it would be willing to accept recommendations 
to provide appropriate health-care services for transgender people and to ensure that they 
had access to official documentation in accordance with their self-defined gender identity. 
It also asked if the Government would be willing to endorse the Yogyakarto Principles on 
the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and 
Gender Identity<i>. </i>Finally, it noted with regret that the Government was not yet ready to 
ratify the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and enquired about the deliberations planned and whether Norway would be 
reporting back to the Council on its conclusions in this regard. 
</p>
<p>418. The International Save the Children Alliance noted with interest the scope of 
recommendations enjoying the support of Norway. Concerning trafficking, it urged the 
Government of Norway to act on the recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, to set focus on child victims of trafficking and identify and competently treat 
child victims of trafficking. Concerning asylum-seeking children, it recalled the recent 
recommendations of the Committee calling on the Government to give primary 
consideration to the best interest of the child whenever decisions about the child&#8217;s future 
were under consideration. It expected further action on juvenile justice to guarantee that 
justice standards were fully implemented, and that deprivation of liberty was used as a last 
resort. It commended the continued focus of the Government on combating violence against 
children, and requested that special attention be paid to adequate legal provisions and 
regulations, to ensure that child victims and/or witness of crime were protected against both 
physical and psychological violence. This called for a stronger holistic approach and 
amendments to the penal code. 
</p>
<p>419. Amnesty International welcomed Norway&#8217;s support for recommendations to prevent 
gender-based violence and to strengthen efforts to combat domestic violence and violence 
against women. Amnesty International also welcomed its support for recommendations to 
ensure conformity of pretrial detention with international standards and access to </p>


<p>appropriate care for all detainees. It expressed concern at reports in the national media 
indicating violations of domestic legislations of one in five persons arrested in Oslo in 
police cells. It noted with concern that two groups of Iraqi asylum-seekers had been 
forcibly returned to their country of origin on 6 December 2009 and 26 January 2010, 
contrary to UNHCR recommendations. Amnesty International welcomed Norway&#8217;s support 
for recommendations to respect the rights of refugees and to guarantee a proper analysis of 
each petition on a case-by-case base, while noting the partial support to show flexibility 
towards the irregular situations of persons who might face expulsion. It also acknowledged 
the positive contribution of Norway to the Durban Review Conference, and encouraged it 
to pursue efforts to address racism. 
</p>
<p><i> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i></p>
<p>420. Norway noted that many important issues had been raised and thanked the 
representatives of the civil society who had taken the floor. Norway considered that most of 
the issues raised had been addressed in the review report and by the Minister during the 
review in the Working Group. Many interventions addressed crucial issues concerning 
racism, discrimination, domestic violence and trafficking. Norway respectfully drew 
attention to the comprehensive addendum circulated for more details. All concerns raised 
were seen as requiring continuous and systematic efforts, which justified the setting-up of 
concrete plans of action on various issues, such as equality and discrimination, living 
standards for Roma people, domestic violence, integration and social inclusion of 
immigrant population and social dumping.  
</p>
<p>421. Norway assured the Council that it was fully committed to continuing the discussion 
on all these issues in the follow-up to the report. Norway looked forward to continuing 
dialogue with everyone, and reaffirmed its support for the crucial role of treaty bodies. 
Norway also reaffirmed its strong commitment to the promotion of the Millennium 
Development Goals and to international solidarity. Norway expressed sincere gratitude to 
OHCHR for its invaluable support in the universal periodic review process and to the 
President for his able leadership. Norway also thanked the troika for its smooth and 
effective cooperation with the delegation of Norway. 
</p>
<p><b>  Albania 
</b></p>
<p>422. The review of Albania was held on 2 December 2009 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Albania in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/ALB/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/ALB/2);  
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/ALB/3). 
</p>
<p>423. At its 29th meeting, on 17 March 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Albania (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>424. The outcome of the review on Albania comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/13/6), the views of Albania concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. </p>


<p><i> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions, as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>425. The head of the delegation, Edith Harxhi, the deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, 
stated that the Council enjoyed the full-fledged support of the Government of Albania, and 
extended its thanks to all delegations that in the universal periodic review session of 
December 2009 had highlighted Albania&#8217;s accomplishments in the human rights area, and 
suggested legal and structural improvements. A special thanks went to the troika of 
delegations from the United States of America, the Russia Federation, Mauritius and the 
secretariat.  
</p>
<p>426. Since the December session, the activities of the Government had been intense, a 
large part of them being a follow-up to the recommendations made by delegations.  
</p>
<p>427. In early January 2010, the Government announced that it would conduct a 
population census in 2011, which will also include the question of ethnic and religious 
affiliation. To that end, the Central Census Commission had held a series of meetings with 
representatives of associations of minorities and religious communities. With regard to the 
definition of ethnic and religious affiliation, the census would comply with Albania&#8217;s 
international commitments. In particular, regarding the definition of national affiliation, it 
would refer to the requirements specified in article 32 of the European Convention on the 
Protection of Minorities.  
</p>
<p>428. At the end of January 2010, the Government of Albania decided to set up the 
Institute for the Crimes of Communism. This initiative related to the necessity of bringing 
to light and punishing the crimes committed in Albania during the 50 years of communist 
rule. During that period, the bloodiest regime ever of all Eastern European countries 
adopted a repressive internal policy against all political opponents, and imposed a total 
isolation of the country from the rest of the world. The terrible toll of those days was tens of 
thousands of persons executed and hundreds interned. 
</p>
<p>429. Indeed, a great effort had been made in the past 20 years to integrate into the 
political, economic and social life former politically persecuted persons by communism. 
Nonetheless, a thorough investigation and punishment of crimes perpetrated by that regime 
was an absolute necessity. Accordingly, the establishment of the Institute for the Crimes of 
Communism served to keep intact the memories, and to inform new generations, of the 
suffering under that regime. 
</p>
<p>430. In early February 2010, Parliament adopted the Law on Protection from 
Discrimination. In the universal periodic review session of December 2009, several 
delegations highlighted the absence of an exhaustive legal framework aimed at the 
protection of all categories vulnerable to discrimination. Today, in legal terms, Albania had 
met this commitment. The relevant legislative activity broke new ground in Albania. The 
elaboration of the anti-discrimination law was a contribution by an Albanian non-
governmental organization, which had worked on it for over three years with the help of the 
best international expertise in the field. The final version of the draft law was elaborated 
with almost all groups of interest and then referred to Parliament for endorsement. Since 
under the Constitution, a non-governmental organization does not enjoy the right of 
legislative initiative, a group of members of Parliament from the governing majority 
supported this initiative. Subsequently, the draft was reviewed by various parliamentary 
commissions and was unanimously adopted on 4 February 2010. 
</p>
<p>431. The anti-discrimination law governs the implementation and compliance with the 
principle of equality on the grounds of gender, race, colour, ethnicity, gender identity, 
sexual orientation, political, religious, philosophical, economic, education or social status, 
pregnancy, parental affiliation, health status, domicile and others.  </p>


<p>432. The law is designed to ensure equality before the law and equal legal protection to 
each individual, equality of opportunity in exercising human rights, protection from 
discrimination or any other form or behaviour that incites discrimination, and to encourage 
active participation in public life. Beneficiaries of this law are Albanian nationals and 
foreign physical and juridical persons.  
</p>
<p>433. To protect victims of discrimination, an institution called the commissioner for the 
protection from discrimination would be set up, employing the most renowned experts in 
the field of human rights and providing effective protection from discrimination and 
incitation to discrimination. 
</p>
<p>434. The commissioner would be elected by Parliament and should be an individual with 
a notable role and expertise in the human rights field; apart from other requirements, he or 
she should not be engaged in political activity. The commissioner&#8217;s powers ranged from the 
administrative verification of violations, recommendations for restoration of rights and 
court representation of aggrieved parties to imposing administrative sanctions against 
persons infringing the principle of equality among nationals.  
</p>
<p>435. According to the Government, the adoption of the law, and particularly its 
implementation, would essentially help produce a climate in which each individual would 
feel an equal part of the society. Of course, discrimination would not end with the adoption 
of the law. Combating discrimination and respect for human rights as a whole was a long 
process, whereby the civil society, the Ombudsman, the commissioner against 
discrimination, the Government and all its structures had their own tasks and goals, which 
are clearly specified in the Constitution and other legal acts. 
</p>
<p>436. At the universal periodic review session in December 2009, the delegation of 
Albania officially extended an open invitation to all special procedures mandate holders to 
visit the country. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur for extrajudicial, arbitrary and 
summary executions, Philip Alston, had visited Albania from 14 to 23 February 2010. The 
Government wished to express its highest appreciation for the professional competence, 
commitment and objectivity of the Special Rapporteur and his staff.  
</p>
<p>437. The delegation highlighted the special significance of transparency towards 
international institutions. From this perspective, verification of human rights standards by 
other special rapporteurs should be a normal practice in the activities of the Council. 
</p>
<p>438. Furthermore, Albania had also passed a draft law on children&#8217;s rights, and a child 
and family protection unit had been established within the Ministry of Labour and Social 
Affairs. In November and December 2009, a national campaign aimed at raising awareness 
for combating violence against women was conducted. Reports to police on violence 
against women were increasing and the building of the first shelter for women had been 
completed. 
</p>
<p>439. Concerning recommendation 3 included in paragraph 69 of the Working Group 
report (A/HRC/13/6), the delegation stated that Albania had made changes relevant to the 
legal framework of the definition of sale of children and child pornography in its Criminal 
Code in 2008. Recommendation 4 was rejected on the ground that the institute of the 
Ombudsman and a national human rights commission had already been established. Action 
on recommendations 9, 11, 12, 14 and 16 would soon be implemented.  
</p>
<p>440. The delegation reiterated that the conclusions of the review of Albania would be part 
and parcel of the Government agenda for the forthcoming period.  
</p>
<p><i> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i></p>
<p>441. Algeria welcomed the efforts of Albania to promote and protect human rights, as 
well as to ensure the gradual establishment of legal and institutional mechanisms. Algeria </p>


<p>was delighted by the fact that Albania had accepted 85 recommendations, including all 
recommendations put forward by Algeria. More than half of those recommendations were 
already in the process of implementation, a sign of Albania&#8217;s commitment to the promotion 
of human rights. Algeria expressed its confidence in the actions being conducted by 
Albania to consolidate and strengthen measures to continue the fight against trafficking in 
human beings, and would like to see other countries benefiting from the Albanian 
experience.  
</p>
<p>442. The delegation of the United States of America welcomed the acceptance of 
recommendation 13, paragraph 69, of the Working Group report (A/HRC/13/6) regarding 
the media monitoring board. It urged Albania to follow up with a robust reform and 
strengthening of the board. The United States welcomed the fact that Albania had indicated 
its support for additional measures to eliminate the worst forms of child labour. While 
expressing its support to the recommendations made by Belgium and Slovenia 
(recommendations 25 and 26) on improving the effectiveness of combating corruption of 
State officials, the United States welcomed the endorsement of those recommendations by 
Albania. It welcomed the development of an anti-corruption strategy, and looked forward to 
hearing about the progress in its implementation. Finally, it commended Albania for its 
commitment to the universal periodic review process.  
</p>
<p>443. Senegal noted that Albania&#8217;s acceptance of most recommendations was a clear 
indication of the country&#8217;s determination to improve its human rights situation. It noted 
particularly the positive responses given by Albania to recommendations with regard to 
strengthening institutional and legislative frameworks, and bringing them into line with 
international standards. Senegal highlighted the spirit of openness with which Albania 
addressed issues regarding smuggling of persons and the protection of the rights of women 
and children. Senegal wished Albania success in the implementation of the 
recommendations accepted. 
</p>
<p>444. Montenegro congratulated Albania on its constructive cooperation and engagement 
in the universal periodic review process. It commended Albania for its responsible attitude 
towards the recommendations proposed. Albania and Montenegro had maintained fruitful 
bilateral relations, with particular emphasis on enhancing the protection of minorities living 
in both countries. The continuity of Albania&#8217;s activities aimed at the affirmation of 
fundamental rights and freedoms demonstrated the commitment of Albania to the 
promotion and protection of universal values. Montenegro encouraged Albania to continue 
to protect and promote human rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p>445. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia saluted the openness of Albania and 
the country&#8217;s readiness to cooperate in the universal periodic review process, which 
demonstrated the determination of Albania to continue to fulfil human rights standards and 
further their implementation. It noted with satisfaction the commitment of Albania to 
improve the human rights situation, in particular the rights of minorities, persons with 
disabilities and children, and to take steps to address regional disparities, in particular in the 
fields of education, health and the environment.  
</p>
<p>446. Morocco congratulated Albania on the openness displayed throughout the process of 
the universal periodic review and for its comprehensive presentation. It noted with 
satisfaction that Albania had accepted a large number of recommendations, reflecting the 
country&#8217;s commitment to a modern society determined to address the challenges of 
development and human rights, in particular the rights of vulnerable persons. It noted with 
interest the national policy and accompanying measures that had been taken to ensure the 
rights of children fully by focusing on the fight of universally recognized phenomena, 
which could undermine those rights. It noted the interest shown for the protection of the 
rights of national minorities, in particular the right to preserve and develop the ethnic, 
cultural, linguistic and religious identity of individuals. Albania&#8217;s determination to continue </p>


<p>bringing its legislation into line with international human rights standards had been 
expressed by the acceptance of all relevant recommendations.  
</p>
<p><i> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>447. The European Region of the International Lesbian and Gay Association commended 
the Government of Albania for having accepted the recommendation to include sexual 
orientation and gender identity specifically in anti-discrimination legislation. It called for 
effective implementation of the anti-discrimination law, also with a view to guaranteeing 
respect for human rights related to sexual orientation and gender identity, and encouraged 
Albania to establish a commissioner on equality. It also commended Albania for having 
accepted recommendations relating to human rights education and awareness-raising, 
including with regard to sexual orientation and gender identity, and asked about steps taken 
to fulfil this commitment. Lastly, it urged the Government to accept the recommendation to 
consider applying the Yogyakarta Principles on the application of international human 
rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity as a guide to assist in policy 
development. 
</p>
<p>448. Amnesty International welcomed Albania&#8217;s support for many recommendations 
made in the Working Group, including the recommendation to promote the enforcement of 
the Law on Gender Equality and Domestic Violence and increase public awareness in this 
regard, to implement the Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children and to take further 
measures to protect the human rights of children leaving care. It expressed particular 
concern about the situation of orphans and other young people after leaving care and called 
on Albania to increase protection for them, including by ensuring that they had access to 
adequate housing. It regretted Albania&#8217;s rejection of two recommendations on the 
prohibition of corporal punishment of children as a disciplinary method, noting that, 
according to press reports, a free national child line opened in 2009 received about 400 
calls a day from children reporting ill-treatment. In the light of information that physical 
and psychological violence was still often regarded in Albania as having a positive effect 
on a child&#8217;s education and development, Amnesty International urged Albania to review the 
two recommendations.  
</p>
<p><i> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i></p>
<p>449. The delegation of Albania stated that recommendation 13 by the United States of 
America on the media monitoring body had been accepted, as well as recommendations 9 
by Belgium and 11 by Slovenia on the independence of the judiciary. The delegation also 
noted that Albanian anti-corruption legislation and policies were among the best. Albania 
would, however, continue its efforts on this issue as well as in the fight against organized 
crime. Additional information on minorities, child rights, anti-discrimination policies and 
legislation on domestic violence was provided.  
</p>
<p><b>  Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>450. The review of the Democratic Republic of the Congo was held on 3 December 2009 
in conformity with all the relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was 
based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 
accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/COD/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/COD/2);  </p>


<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/COD/3). 
</p>
<p>451. At its 30th meeting, on 18 March 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>452. The outcome of the review on the Democratic Republic of the Congo comprises the 
report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/13/8), the views of 
Democratic Republic of the Congo concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, 
and its voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by 
the plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive 
dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><i> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions, as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>453. The delegation indicated that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, respectful of its international commitments, had submitted a national report in the 
context of the universal periodic review. Furthermore, it had already accepted in the 
Working Group 124 of 163 recommendations made during the review.  
</p>
<p>454. With regard to the implementation of the recommendations already accepted, the 
delegation noted that most of the needed legislative reforms would be considered during the 
parliamentary session to be held between March and June 2010, or at the latest, the 
September 2010 session, with particular attention paid to the law implementing the Rome 
Statute of the International Criminal Court, the law on the creation, organization and 
functioning of the national human rights institution, in accordance with the Paris Principles, 
the law on parity between men and women, the ongoing reform of the criminal and family 
codes and the laws allowing ratification of international human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>455. Regarding the promotion of peace, the Government had put an end to the Kimia II 
operation and officially launched the new <i>Amani Leo</i> programme for consolidating peace in 
the east with the assistance of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (MONUC). This joint operation aimed at bringing under control the 
remaining resistance to the peace process, with particular attention to the protection of the 
civilian population. Other operations were under way to bring peace back throughout the 
territory, such as the Rudia II operation in the eastern province, where the Lord&#8217;s 
Resistance Army continued to violate the fundamental rights of Congolese citizens. 
</p>
<p>456. The delegation stressed that awareness-raising campaigns on the need to combat 
sexual violence were still under way in workshops. Mention was made of the campaign 
jointly put in place with MONUC since January 2010. Impunity for crimes of sexual 
violence was being fought, and military courts had convicted a number of soldiers and 
officers found guilty of sexual violence. Ordinary courts were also attempting to combat 
this scourge; the national agency to combat sexual violence against women and girls set up 
in 2009 was being put in place. 
</p>
<p>457. The Government was stepping up efforts to ensure access to education, health and 
an adequate standard of living, including through the building of hospitals, the 
improvement of the business climate and the electricity supply, and the progressive increase 
in remuneration. Efforts to bring an end to the initiative for heavily indebted poor countries 
were part of the same vision, and resources allocated to debt servicing would be reoriented 
to programmes to fight poverty with a view to eradicating it. 
</p>
<p>458. With regard to the fight against the recruitment of children in the army and the 
rehabilitation of former child soldiers, remarkable progress had been made through the unit 
for implementation of the national programme for disarmament, demobilization and </p>


<p>rehabilitation. As at 31 December 2009, the concrete implementation of rehabilitation 
programmes for 5,700 demobilized persons, with contributions from the African 
Development Fund, had begun. CARITAS and the Food and Agriculture Organization had 
identified 4,200 demobilized persons, who were referred to them. Also, pilot agricultural 
farms had been set up in 10 selected sites for community rehabilitation.  
</p>
<p>459. The aim of the Government was to increase the efficiency of justice. Approximately 
2,000 magistrates would be recruited: 1,000 in 2010, 1,000 in 2011. This would allow for 
optimal functioning of the judiciary, and would strengthen the fight against impunity, 
including for crimes of sexual violence and corruption. In the meantime, existing courts 
were ready to deal with different criminal cases, including with regard to sexual violence. 
In combating the overcrowding of penitentiary institutions, a new central prison in line with 
international standards had been inaugurated on 30 December 2009, and the Government 
was rehabilitating two other prisons. In addition, there would shortly be areas for girls in 
the Beni and Goma establishments for child custody. The Beni military court was being set 
up. These actions were part of the implementation of the overall justice system reform plan, 
in particular the creation of 145 peace courts all over the territory, by June 2010, to allow 
people to be close to the courts and to ensure the effectiveness of the justice system. 
</p>
<p>460. With regard to combating impunity within the army and the police, the zero 
tolerance policy, announced by the Head of State, continued its irrevocable path. Any 
officer found guilty was systematically prosecuted at the disciplinary or court levels, 
irrespective of rank. Regarding the recommendations on which the State had reservations, 
the delegation reaffirmed its full readiness to cooperate with the seven special thematic 
rapporteurs and with other special procedures, and to issue them an invitation whenever 
such request was made. It recalled the invitation made by the Government for a visit by the 
independent expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial 
obligations of States on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social 
and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>461. The delegation assured the Council of the readiness of its Government to cooperate 
in view of the implementation of the recommendations by the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions following his visit to the country. With 
regard to the recommendation on the creation of a joint commission, including international 
staff, to combat arbitrary detentions, this structure already existed in the framework of the 
joint justice committee. With regard to the recommendations relating to the internal 
functioning of the armed forces, these issues were part of national policy. The Government 
awaited the results of the mapping carried out by the United Nations for the period 1993&#8211;
2003 before expressing its opinion on the recommendations on transitional justice. 
</p>
<p>462. With regard to recommendations on elaborating laws specifically protecting human 
rights defenders, the delegation reaffirmed its commitment to continue discussions to set up 
a specific legal framework for them.  
</p>
<p><i> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome  
</i></p>
<p>463. Algeria commended the commitment of the Government to improve human rights, 
particularly of vulnerable groups such as women and children, with the support of human 
rights mechanisms. Algeria noted with satisfaction that the State supported the 
recommendations made by its delegation and had accepted 124 recommendations made in 
the Working Group. Algeria encouraged the authorities to pursue the consolidation of the 
peace process in the context of a crisis exit strategy, adapted to its particular circumstances 
within the framework of existing mechanisms, and noted that a country mandate would 
have little practical effect if not established at the request of the concerned country.  </p>


<p>464. Cuba expressed appreciation at the State&#8217;s acknowledgement of the problems it 
faced and its resolve to continue its efforts to overcome them. Cuba noted that the country&#8217;s 
colonial past and structural poverty were the root causes of the existing conflict and 
instability. Punitive actions would not constitute the solution, and priority should be given 
to development strategy and long-term cooperation, in particular from developed countries, 
to overcome structural poverty and improve living conditions.  
</p>
<p>465. The United States of America commended the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
for accepting several recommendations. It noted the State&#8217;s will to cooperate with the 
International Criminal Court, and expected the country to reconsider its refusal to support 
the recommendation to deliver General Bosco Ntaganda to the Court. It expressed concerns 
about impunity and justice and supported a number of recommendations in this regard. It 
expressed its regret that the State had rejected several recommendations relating to access 
to detention facilities and to serious cases of impunity, and encouraged it to reconsider its 
position in this regard.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>466. China noted the importance the State attached to the universal periodic review 
process. Many measures had been adopted to enhance human rights, including the rights to 
education, health and housing, and to incorporate human rights education in the curricula 
and spread human rights. China understood the special difficulties faced by the country due 
to protracted wars and poverty and believed that, with the support of the international 
community, the State would improve its human rights and humanitarian situation.  
</p>
<p>467. Senegal noted that the large amount of recommendations made to the country 
revealed the importance the Council attached to the improvement of the human rights 
situation and to the challenges faced by the State under review. Senegal encouraged the 
international community to support the country through technical assistance, in accordance 
with the needs it expressed, and taking into consideration the fact that the Government had 
accepted recommendations on violence against women and children and prosecution of the 
perpetrators of these acts.  
</p>
<p>468. Italy noted that numerous forms of discrimination and violations of the rights of the 
child persisted and that many children, in particular street children, were exposed to 
exploitation and abuse. Children accused of witchcraft were those who probably suffered 
the worst treatment. Italy appealed to the authorities to take more efficient measures to fight 
this phenomenon, in particular by adopting legislation to criminalize accusations of 
witchcraft against children, raising awareness on this issue and implementing a 
rehabilitation and reintegration programme with the help of the international community.  
</p>
<p>469. Belgium noted that the acceptance of 124 of 163 recommendations made in the 
Working Group, including 3 by Belgium on the fight against sexual violence, the protection 
of &#8220;witch&#8221; children and human rights defenders&#8217; protection, showed the authorities&#8217; 
commitment to enhance human rights protection. Belgium noted with appreciation the 
acceptance of a number of recommendations under consideration, and expressed the hope 
that the possible adoption of a law to protect human rights defenders would allow for a 
positive response to the recommendations made on the subject. Belgium encouraged the 
authorities to implement all the recommendations rapidly, and reiterated its full support in 
this respect. 
</p>
<p>470. Cameroon welcomed the additional information provided and praised the efforts 
made by the State for the promotion and protection of human rights. It welcomed the 
acceptance of 124 recommendations, noting that many were already being implemented. It 
made an appeal to the Council and the international community to strengthen its technical 
assistance to the country. 
</p>
<p>471. Morocco highlighted the commitment displayed by the country to promote and 
protect human rights, particularly illustrated by the open and frank debate on the human </p>


<p>rights situation in the country and the acceptance of the great majority of recommendations. 
Morocco welcomed its willingness to cooperate with the international community to 
promote the human rights situation, and called for technical and financial assistance to the 
country, at its request and with its consent. Morocco thanked the delegation for having 
accepted its two recommendations relating to the national human rights institution and to 
education, particularly human rights education and training. 
</p>
<p><i> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>472. The International Federation for Human Rights Leagues welcomed the commitments 
made by the State in the universal periodic review, but expressed surprise that 
recommendations made for the protection of human rights defenders were regarded as 
implemented. It deplored the rejection of recommendations to arrest Bosco Ntaganda and 
transfer him to The Hague and to create a mechanism to exclude from the army and 
security forces persons responsible for serious human rights violations. Lastly, it requested 
the implementation not only of recommendations accepted but also of those made by the 
special procedures and the High Commissioner, as well as the country&#8217;s obligations under 
international law. 
</p>
<p>473. Franciscans International, in a joint statement with the Swiss Catholic Lenten Fund, 
the International Federation of ACAT and the Lutheran World Federation, mentioned that 
more than 60 national and international non-governmental organizations had expressed 
concern at the high number of rejected recommendations, and urged the Government to 
reconsider its position. Regarding the recommendations already implemented, they noted 
the slow pace of the authorities in carrying them through, including in relation to women&#8217;s 
rights, the abolition of the death penalty, the implementation of the Rome Statute and the 
establishment of the national human rights commission. They encouraged the State to 
create favourable conditions for the implementation of recommendations, in effective 
cooperation with the special procedures and periodic follow-up evaluation by the Council.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>474. Action internationale pour la paix et le d&#233;veloppement dans la r&#233;gion des Grands 
Lacs stated that the past two United Nations reports revealed that violence against the 
civilian population in the East was continuing with impunity. The root causes of the 
Congolese tragedy were the illicit exploitation of natural resources and the role of 
neighbouring countries. It took note of the role of multilateral companies, which had 
transformed the country into a lawless place. It recommended that criminal prosecution be 
initiated against individuals and multinational companies involved in the illegal looting of 
resources, in crimes against humanity and war crimes.  
</p>
<p>475. The International Commission of Jurists requested the Government of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo to take prompt measures to implement all 
recommendations. Members of the armed forces, the intelligence services and armed 
groups had been implicated in gross and systematic human rights abuses. It regretted that 
the Government had rejected the recommendations to arrest and transfer Bosco Ntaganda to 
the International Criminal Court. It stressed the prevalent grave human rights concerns, 
particularly those relating to the culture of impunity and deficiencies of the judicial system. 
It reiterated its call to the Council to re-establish a comprehensive country mandate and a 
group of independent experts to help the Government to address gross human rights 
violations and violations of international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>476. Comit&#233; international pour le respect et l&#8217;application de la Charte Africaine des droits 
de l&#8217;homme et des peuples recalled the existence of numerous serious abuses and 
violations, including massacres, corruption, sexual violence against women and children, 
the recruitment of child soldiers, murders of members of civil society, the looting of 
minerals by multinationals and neighbouring countries, and the persistence of extrajudicial 
executions with impunity. The different military operations had contributed to the </p>


<p>occupation of the east of the country. The complacency of the Government revealed the 
lack of political will to put an end to the suffering of the population. 
</p>
<p>477. Interfaith International, in a joint statement with Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense 
des droits de l&#8217;homme and the Al-Hakim Foundation, encouraged the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo to combat the culture of impunity, discrimination against Bambeto pygmies, 
the rape of women and the stigmatization of &#8220;witch&#8221; children, and to take appropriate 
measures to build transparency and good management of mining resources to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals. Interfaith International congratulated the country on its 
openness to Council mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>478. The International Voluntarism Organization for Women, Education, Development 
and the International Institute of Mary our help of the Salesians of Don Bosco welcomed 
the achievements in human rights made in the country. It noted that measures taken by the 
Government in relation to combating grave economic and sexual exploitation of children, 
as well as putting an end to impunity of those responsible for sexual crimes against 
children, were insufficient. It stressed that serious situations of exploitation persisted, in 
particular in the Katanga region. Mines were still places of economic and sexual 
exploitation of children, including young girls under the age of 12. The Organization 
expressed the hope that more adequate and effective measures be taken in this regard. 
</p>
<p>479. The International Institute of Mary our help of the Salesians of Don Bosco and the 
International Voluntarism Organization for Women, Education, Development welcomed 
the efforts to reinforce the national legal framework of child protection. The Institute 
stressed the serious violations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in the Katanga 
region, particularly due to extreme poverty. The Organization noted the increase of street 
children and children accused of witchcraft, who were exposed to abuse. It hoped that the 
State would pay special attention to this vulnerable group. With regard to the right to 
education, the Organization suggested that the country ensure free education.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>480. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network noted the decision of the Human Rights 
Committee, which considered that criminalizing homosexual conduct violated the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It urged the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo to ensure that the Penal Code was not applied to criminalize homosexual activity 
between consenting adults; adopt measures and programmes for the prevention of 
HIV/AIDS; and provide law enforcement and judicial officials with training on the 
protection of human rights of sexual minorities. 
</p>
<p>481. Amnesty International hoped that the eight recommendations supported by the 
country and related to human rights defenders would be given high priority. It noted that 
the issue of arbitrary and incommunicado detention by security services and the army had 
not received sufficient attention. Amnesty International regretted that the Government had 
not supported the recommendation to grant access to the Joint United Nations Human 
Rights Office, the special rapporteurs and other independent mechanisms to places of 
detention. It was concerned that some national army officers suspected of serious violations 
of human rights and human rights law still served in operations in the east, and hoped that 
the universal period review would give renewed impetus to the Government to show 
political will to implement the national &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; policy . 
</p>
<p><i> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i></p>
<p>482. With regard to the 28 recommendations contained in paragraph 96 of the Working 
Group report, the delegation stated that it had accepted recommendations 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 13, 
14 and 19, and that it had noted the remaining ones. The delegation stressed that country 
mandates could only be set up at the request of the country concerned. The authorities 
renewed their invitations to the various thematic procedures. The delegation mentioned that </p>


<p>all the particular questions mentioned during the debate were a matter of concern to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially sexual violence, exploitation of resources, 
violence against children and combating impunity.  
</p>
<p><b>  C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
</b></p>
<p>483. The review of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was held on 3 December 2009 in conformity with all 
the relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in accordance with the annex 
to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/CIV/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/CIV/2);  
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/CIV/3). 
</p>
<p>484. At its 30th meeting, on 18 March 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>485. The outcome of the review on C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/13/9), the views of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/13/9/Add.1/Rev.1). 
</p>
<p><i> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions, as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>486. Mr. Tia Kon&#233;, President of the Supreme Court, recalled that C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had left 
39 recommendations for further consideration after the Working Group session. He stated 
that the responses were based on the commitment of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to promote and protect 
human rights. The country attached the greatest importance to the universal periodic 
review, and would therefore report to the Council on achievements made in implementing 
these recommendations under item 6 of the agenda, once democratic, inclusive and 
transparent elections were completed. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire also drew the attention of the Council 
to the document containing its responses to the recommendations 
(A/HRC/13/9/Add.1/Rev.1). The delegation provided update on issues addressed by the 
above-mentioned recommendations. 
</p>
<p>487. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire recalled its commitment to the ongoing crisis exit process aimed at 
helping the effective implementation of all human rights. Initiatives and commitments 
already set down in the national report attested to that resolve. 
</p>
<p>488. Regarding the 20 recommendations inviting C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to ratify various 
international instruments, the Government regretted that, despite its will in this regard, the 
current crisis was an impediment to their implementation. As indicated in the national 
report (para. 141) and the Working Group report (para. 93), C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire would proceed to 
such ratifications as soon as the current crisis had ended, as some required constitutional 
revisions to be adopted, not possible in the current situation. 
</p>
<p>489. Concerning the invitation to special procedures mandate holders, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was 
committed to the special procedures and, as indicated in the national report (paras. 152 and 
153), was ready to study any request on a case-by-case basis. </p>


<p>490. With regard to sexual violence, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire referred to the Working Group report 
mentioning challenges linked to gender equality (paras. 94 and 95). A ministerial 
directorate was devoted to this issue and C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was the first African country to 
adopt a national plan of action to implement Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), in 
addition to the establishment of a national committee to combat violence against women 
and children. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire also referred to its national report regarding major strategies 
aimed at preventing HIV/AIDS (para. 110). On gender identity and sexual orientation, C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire did not criminalize same-sex relations between consenting adults. 
</p>
<p>491. On judicial matters and impunity, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire referred to the Working Group 
report (paras. 10 and 49) and to the national report (paras. 146 and 154). It had initiated a 
programme aimed at creating new jurisdictions and had taken various steps to building the 
capacity of judiciary staff, but remained open to any form of technical and financial 
assistance in this regard. 
</p>
<p>492. With regard to statelessness, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire referred to the Working Group report 
(para. 45) that specified that the code of nationality applied the <i>jus sanguinis</i> principle, and 
that statelessness could not exist, as the code governs the acquisition of nationality, in 
addition to the above-mentioned principle, through naturalization, marriage or adoption. 
</p>
<p>493. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire mentioned its national report relating to the right to education and to 
economic and social rights more generally (paras. 15, 86 and 89), which indicated that it 
continuously invested in these fields. The priority given to education and training was also 
illustrated by the establishment of an educational system taking into consideration its 
available resources. The Constitution set forth the right to education as a priority, a plan to 
combat illiteracy had been established and primary education, in particular of girls, was 
promoted. 
</p>
<p>494. Given its constraints and difficulties, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire wished to benefit from technical 
assistance in the following areas: (a) technical capacity-building to draft reports to catch up 
on treaty reporting obligations; (b) support to align domestic legislation with international 
human rights instruments; (c) organization of human rights training seminars for judiciary 
and security forces staff; (d) support for the establishment of a national human rights plan; 
(e) support for human rights education and sensitization activities for the population, 
including through the dissemination of related documents in the main national languages; 
(f) support for the modernization and consolidation of the civil registry; (g) operational 
capacity-building for the Ministry for human rights; (h) support for human rights training 
for locally elected representatives, opinion leaders and parliamentarians; (i) capacity-
building for the national human rights commission; (j) support for the modernization, 
equipping and operational capacities of the military fire brigade unit and civil protection; 
and (k) support for the establishment of a national consumer body. 
</p>
<p><i> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i></p>
<p>495. Algeria thanked C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire for the additional information submitted during the 
session. It supported the Government&#8217;s efforts for national reconciliation and the restoration 
of public authority towards the organization of free and credible elections. It welcomed the 
acceptance of many recommendations, including those made by Algeria, in particular the 
launching of awareness programmes on human rights and international humanitarian law 
for security, legal and judiciary officers. It called for international community assistance 
and acknowledged the role played by C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in the Council, particularly regarding 
the resolutions on toxic waste and human rights, and the human rights of migrants. 
</p>
<p>496. Cuba commended C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire&#8217;s presentation, which highlighted efforts to 
implement universal periodic review recommendations. It applauded C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire for 
accepting many recommendations, including those made by Cuba in connection to </p>


<p>universal access to health and child protection and to child trafficking and exploitation. It 
highlighted comments made to various recommendations, in particular those related to 
children rights, sexual orientation and gender identity, education and social and economic 
rights in general. Despite difficulties, Cote d&#8217;Ivoire had implemented programmes for 
human rights promotion and was encouraged to continue to do so.  
</p>
<p>497. The United States of America stated that widespread sexual violence continued, with 
women and children often targeted on the basis of their nationality and ethnicity, despite the 
efforts of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to address this issue. It remained concerned at the prevalence of 
arbitrary detentions, the conditions of detention facilities and the detention of innocent 
civilians. The United States also expressed concern at the persistence of trafficking in 
persons and the exploitation of child labour. While the United States acknowledged C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire&#8217;s commitment to continue anti-trafficking efforts, it reiterated the importance of 
eliminating the worst forms of child labour.  
</p>
<p>498. Burkina Faso congratulated C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire on its interest in the universal periodic 
review and felt confident the recommendations that had been accepted would be adequately 
addressed in order to benefit all inhabitants of Cote d&#8217;Ivoire. Burkina Faso declared its 
readiness to share with C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire positive experiences that were mutually beneficial. It 
commended the role played by the delegation of Cote d&#8217;Ivoire in Geneva in various 
projects. 
</p>
<p>499. Senegal was pleased by the number of recommendations accepted by C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
in particular the recommendation on the promotion of human rights education and on 
children and women protection, which confirmed C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire&#8217;s commitment to ensure 
better enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all its citizens. This 
attitude constituted an appeal to the international community to provide C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire with 
all the support it clearly requested. 
</p>
<p>500. Cameroon acknowledged the efforts of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to promote and protect human 
rights, in particular those related to reducing maternal mortality, extending vaccination 
coverage and combating malaria and HIV/AIDS. It noted the importance given to the social 
development of children and fighting the trafficking of children, despite a difficult context 
characterized by a decade of political and military crisis. It highlighted the cooperation 
between C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and UNICEF. It commended C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire for accepting 108 
recommendations, many of them already being implemented, and called on the 
international community to assist C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire.  
</p>
<p>501. Botswana stated that C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had demonstrated its commitment to constructive 
engagement in human rights over the years, which was further amplified by its cooperation 
during the universal periodic review. It commended C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire for accepting many of 
the recommendations. Botswana extended its continued support to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, and 
encouraged the international community to also continue its support and cooperation with 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire.  
</p>
<p>502. Morocco commended the full cooperation of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire during the universal 
periodic review, the establishment of a new Government in accordance with the 
Ouagadougou agreement and the efforts to organize open and transparent elections. It 
acknowledged C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire for having accepted Morocco&#8217;s recommendations regarding 
the statute of the national human rights institution and the setting-up of human rights 
education and training programmes. It called for financial and technical assistance to 
accompany C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in its review follow-up, in consultation with and with the consent 
of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. 
</p>
<p>503. Djibouti welcomed the efforts made by C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to promote and protect human 
rights, despite the difficult socio-political climate in the country. It also welcomed C&#244;te </p>


<p>d&#8217;Ivoire&#8217;s acceptance of most of the recommendations, and called upon the international 
community to support C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in the implementation of its recommendations.  
</p>
<p>504. Congo stated that C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had shown its readiness and resolve to work with the 
international community to promote and protect fundamental human rights. The additional 
information provided by C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire showed that substantial action had been taken to 
improve the human rights situation, and it welcomed the efforts made in this regard. Congo 
stated that, given the particular situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, it would be most appropriate for 
the international community to provide support in order to consolidate the progress already 
made.  
</p>
<p>505. The Central African Republic urged the international community to respond to C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire&#8217;s call for technical assistance and cooperation. It acknowledged the Government&#8217;s 
efforts to end the troubles that had shaken the country. It remained convinced that African 
wisdom would allow C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to prevail. It called upon all parties in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to 
build peace and national reconciliation, without which human rights would be meaningless. 
</p>
<p><i> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>506. The International Federation for Human Rights Leagues commended the 
Government&#8217;s acceptance of the recommendation related to toxic waste. Nevertheless, it 
remained concerned at the way reparations to victims of the spill over of the Probo Koala 
ship had been carried out to date. It also noted the Government&#8217;s commitment to improve 
prison conditions, specially the separation of minors from adults and women from men. It 
regretted the fact that C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had not accepted some recommendations, such as the 
ratification of several human rights instruments. It deplored the decision to postpone, once 
again, the elections. Fair and free elections would set off durable peace, national 
reconciliation, the rule of law and respect for human rights.  
</p>
<p>507. Franciscans International and Front Line, in a joint statement, regretted that key 
human rights instruments had not been ratified, and that requests for visits by special 
procedures would be examined on a case-by-case basis. They stated that the social and 
political climate in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire could adversely affect the implementation of 
recommendations. They called for the strengthening of legislation in relation to sexual and 
domestic violence, and for the setting-up of psychological and medical care for victims. 
Primary school education should be free; they requested C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to increase its 
support for the World Programme for Human Rights Education.  
</p>
<p>508. Interfaith International, Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme 
and the Al-Hakim Foundation, in a joint statement, stated that they had been following with 
interest the human rights situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire since the beginning of the political and 
military crisis, which had caused many problems and split the country in two. The 
syndrome of &#8220;Ivoirit&#233;&#8221; continued despite the statements before the Council. The 
organization of free and transparent elections had been postponed six times and the recent 
withdrawal of alleged foreign electors from the rolls had led to violence. They took note of 
the various recommendations made by several countries and considered that their effective 
implementation would improve the human rights situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. 
</p>
<p>509. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network commended C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire for its 
acceptance of the recommendation in relation to non-discrimination on the grounds of 
sexual orientation or gender identity. However, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had not accepted the 
recommendation to implement awareness-raising programmes in this regard, as this was not 
viewed as a &#8220;current priority&#8221;. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was encouraged to consider the 
implementation of such programmes. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network expressed 
its willingness to work with C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to develop and implement initiatives to ensure 
non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. </p>


<p>510. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme had followed closely 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire&#8217;s human rights situation and commended it for its political will in signing the 
peace accords. It expressed concerns regarding widespread human rights violations 
perpetrated during the crisis by private militias, the police, Congolese militants, the military 
and Liberian mercenaries. The adoption of the recommendations would contribute to 
elucidate these crimes. It urged C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to combat impunity, improve prison 
conditions, redress the victims of the spillage of the Probo Koala ship and organize free and 
transparent elections. 
</p>
<p>511. Action Canada for Population and Development expressed its appreciation for the 
recommendations accepted by C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, in particular those relating to women. 
Regarding recommendation 83 on sexual violence, it called on C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to allocate 
additional resources for free medical assistance to victims of sexual violence, and the 
establishment of a national plan for sexual and reproductive health. It urged the 
Government to punish female genital mutilation and to carry out awareness-raising 
campaigns on this matter, as stated in recommendations 47 to 50. It requested the 
Government to reconsider its position on recommendation 28 in order to, at least, 
criminalize acts against the rights of persons belonging to sexual minorities.  
</p>
<p><i> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i></p>
<p>512. The head of the delegation recalled that, regarding treaty ratifications, the priority of 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was to overcome the current crisis before making the necessary constitutional 
changes enabling such ratifications. 
</p>
<p>513. With regard to the &#8220;Ivoirit&#233;&#8221; syndrome, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire disagreed with the 
interpretation made. The latest decisions taken concerning the electoral rolls did not 
concern the withdrawal of persons with Ivorian nationality from the rolls but were aimed at 
removing those who were not Ivorian and were not entitled to vote. This had led to the 
postponement of the ballots because there was a need to submit a transparent list to have 
truly transparent elections. 
</p>
<p>514. Concerning the rejected recommendations, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire referred to 
recommendation 23 (Belgium) and indicated that its legal order did not give investigative 
powers to a national committee, as only courts were vested with that competence. Such 
investigations were carried out daily, the results of which were made known, and offenders 
were punished if an offence had been committed. 
</p>
<p>515. With regard to gender identity and sexual orientation, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire recalled that 
there was no urgent need to take special measures since same-sex relations between 
consenting adults were not criminalized. 
</p>
<p>516. Regarding the recommendation on toxic wastes, punitive measures had been 
initiated against those responsible for the spilling of toxic wastes and some people had been 
imprisoned and sentenced to stiff penalties. With regard to civil damages being awarded to 
victims, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had initiated proceedings that allowed victims to obtain financial 
compensation, which was shared among the victims. The State used some of that money to 
undertake protective actions for its population. The victims themselves had initiated 
proceedings with the London courts and were able to obtain a sum, which was distributed 
among them. Although there had been difficulties in sharing the money between two 
groups of victims and this case was heard by the Supreme Court, the victims had reached a 
gentleman&#8217;s agreement to share this money. Therefore the victims had received suitable 
compensation. 
</p>
<p>517. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire reassured all Member States that human rights were an indicator of its 
good governance. The delegation thanked the Council for all the recommendations and the 
troika members for their assistance. </p>


<p><b>  Portugal 
</b></p>
<p>518. The review of Portugal was held on 4 December 2009 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Portugal in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/PRT/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/PRT/2);  
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/PRT/3). 
</p>
<p>519. At its 30th meeting, on 18 March 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Portugal (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>520. The outcome of the review on Portugal comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/13/10), the views of Portugal concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/13/10/Add.1<i>)</i>. 
</p>
<p><i> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions, as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>521. Portugal recalled that 71 recommendations had been accepted out of the 89 
recommendations made during the review in the Working Group, many of which 
corresponded to areas that Portugal had already identified in the course of the preparation 
of the national report, as crucial areas of attention. A total of 21 recommendations 
corresponded to the recommendations that Portugal had already implemented or was in the 
process of implementing. There were 17 remaining recommendations, the consideration of 
which had been deferred. Portugal had expressed its position on each of them in an 
addendum to the national report. It was pleased to announce that it had accepted almost all 
of the recommendations, bringing the final number of accepted recommendations to 86 of 
</p><p>89. It would report regularly on the implementation of these recommendations. Portugal 
also recalled that it had already rejected the recommendation to sign and ratify the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>522. Portugal updated the Council on its voluntary commitment to establish a national 
human rights commission, which would be an inter-ministerial body with the competence 
to coordinate the implementation at the national level of all its international human rights 
obligations and voluntary commitments. It would ensure not only the follow-up to the 
universal periodic review exercise, but also the timely and adequate reporting to all 
international human rights bodies. It would also ensure the translation of all its international 
commitments into obligations at the national level, thus leading to national legislation and 
to the set-up of concrete policies and plans. The institutional set-up of the commission 
would be approved by the Council of Ministers on 18 March 2010.  
</p>
<p>523. Portugal noted that its rejection of the recommendation to sign and ratify the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families did not imply any lack of importance of the rights of migrants. 
Indeed, all rights of migrants were already protected in its legal system through other 
international conventions to which Portugal was a party, and also European instruments and 
national law, which provided for extensive protection of all the rights envisaged in the </p>


<p>Convention. Portuguese law guaranteed the basic human rights of all migrant workers and 
members of their families, regardless of their status, such as access to health services and 
education.  
</p>
<p>524. Regarding the accepted recommendations to become a party to the Optional Protocol 
to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which Portugal had 
signed on 24 September 2009, to ratify as soon as possible the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, and to ratify as soon as possible the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, Portugal stated that, since 
December 2009, it had been initiating the procedure of ratification, involving the 
Government, Parliament and the President of the Republic, and was hoping that their 
instruments of ratification would be deposited by the next session of the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>525. With regard to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, Portugal 
stated that an intergovernmental working group had been set up to identify the national 
preventive mechanism for the monitoring of detention facilities in compliance with the 
criteria laid down in the Optional Protocol. This process was proceeding simultaneously 
with the ratification procedure.  
</p>
<p>526. With regard to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, and in line with the recommendation to continue to play an 
important role in multilateral forums in support of the promotion and protection of these 
rights, Portugal has initiated diplomatic efforts to promote its ratification with the aim of 
ensuring a prompt entry into force. 
</p>
<p>527. Portugal had deposited the instruments of ratification of both the International 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto on 
23 September 2009. They had come into force on 23 October 2009, and the National 
Institute for Rehabilitation was the national focal point. It had progressively been adopting 
legislation in this area in recent years. 
</p>
<p>528. Regarding the recommendation to establish a national human rights institution, 
Portugal stated that the Ombudsman (<i>Provedor de Justi&#231;a</i>) had been accredited as a 
national human rights institution with &#8220;A&#8221; status by the International Coordinating 
Committee of National Institutions for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights, in 
conformity with the Paris Principles, since 1999. It was an independent organ dedicated to 
the defence of the legitimate rights and interests of citizens. Citizens could submit 
complaints about actions or omissions of the public authorities to the Ombudsman, who 
would investigate them and make recommendations to the competent bodies to prevent or 
redress cases of injustice. 
</p>
<p>529. Portugal also recalled that a national initiative for childhood and adolescence, based 
on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the recommendations of the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child and the United Nations study on violence against children had been 
elaborated in 2007. The national initiative took into account the transversal nature of issues 
relating to children&#8217;s rights and the need to define adequate resources, establish priorities 
and allocate budgets, which were all essential to create favourable conditions to guarantee 
these rights. 
</p>
<p>530. Regarding the phenomenon of street children, Portugal stated that numerous 
initiatives and efforts had been undertaken and the problem was no longer a significant 
issue. 
</p>
<p>531. Portugal set up, in 2008, an inter-ministerial working group to review and elaborate 
all overdue reports to treaty bodies. Portugal expressed hope that, with the new impetus that </p>


<p>the national human rights commission would bring to inter-ministerial coordination in the 
field of human rights, it would be able to deliver all overdue reports by the end of 2010. 
</p>
<p>532. In 2005, a victim unit for immigrants and victims of racial and ethnic discrimination 
had been set up in cooperation with a Portuguese non-governmental organization. The unit 
received public financing on a yearly basis from the High Commission for Immigration and 
Intercultural Dialogue, and provided support free of charge to victims of racial 
discrimination and to immigrant victims in general. It was also possible to file a complaint 
for acts of racial discrimination constituting administrative infractions before the 
Commission for Equality and against Discrimination, and a discriminatory act or practice 
could also constitute a crime, according to criminal law. 
</p>
<p>533. The Plan for the Integration of Immigrants, adopted in 2007, which set the 
guidelines for public policy in the area of integration, covering areas such as employment, 
education, health and the prevention of and the fight against racial discrimination, sought to 
stimulate the participation of immigrants in the design, development and evaluation of 
immigration policies. The Plan was based on the clear assumption of responsibility by the 
State towards the integration of immigrant citizens, with special emphasis on the 
reinforcement of social cohesion and improving integration and the management of cultural 
diversity. 
</p>
<p>534. Portugal had set up national support immigrant centres and local support immigrant 
offices that provided information and support to immigrants. 
</p>
<p>535. On the issue of domestic violence, Portugal stated that the legal framework had been 
completed in September 2009 by the adoption of a law on compensation to victims of 
domestic violence, and another law on the legal regime applicable to the prevention of 
domestic violence and to the protection and assistance to its victims. These laws aimed to 
develop awareness, increase victims&#8217; protection and ensure the prosecution and conviction 
of the perpetrators. A national network of domestic violence centres was set up in 2005 to 
provide an integrated response to cases of domestic violence, complementing the existing 
shelters network. Coverage of the whole country was achieved in January 2010. A growing 
investment in awareness-raising campaigns and in the training of police and prosecutors in 
the specific area of domestic violence had been taking place, which resulted in considerable 
progress in police and judicial practices.  
</p>
<p>536. Regarding the plan of action to combat human trafficking, the first national plan 
included a total of 63 measures, of which more than two thirds had already been taken. It 
had already begun the elaboration of a second national plan. Portugal has been sharing the 
model of signalization, identification and integration of victims and the model of the 
Observatory on Trafficking in Human Beings with other States members of the European 
Union and Portuguese-speaking countries. The OHCHR Recommended Principles and 
Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking had been used as a reference in the 
development of anti-trafficking policy. 
</p>
<p>537. Portugal ensured the protection of the rights of children of prisoners in accordance 
with the principle of the best interest of the child. An amendment to allow children up to 5 
years of age to stay with their mothers in prison, instead of the current 3-year limit, was 
envisaged. 
</p>
<p>538. Portugal had rejected the recommendation to develop a national human rights plan 
in accordance with the Vienna Declaration because it considered that it could not prejudge 
the work that would be carried out by its national human rights commission. Portugal noted 
that, even though it did not have a global national human rights plan, it had several sector 
plans. This would be one of the issues at the top of the agenda of the new human rights 
commission, and Portugal would later inform the Council on the results of its deliberations. </p>


<p>539. Portugal also rejected the recommendation to incorporate representatives of ethnic 
minorities into the security forces, because the Constitution established the principle of 
equality as one of the fundamental principles guiding the public administration. This 
principle was fully applied through a horizontal and legally-binding approach, 
encompassing the recruitment and classification of law enforcement officers. There was no 
specific programme for the selection or recruitment of ethnic minority members for the 
security forces, just as there were no barriers to their entry. All applicants were subject to 
the defined requirements and criteria, equal for all citizens, in accordance with the general 
principles of equality and fairness. 
</p>
<p>540. Portugal stated that the universal periodic review recommendations would be 
translated into Portuguese and disseminated within its national institutions, in partnership 
with Parliament and civil society. It would also strive to inform the Council, on an annual 
basis, on the implementation of the recommendations. 
</p>
<p><i> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i></p>
<p>541. Algeria applauded the fact that Portugal had accepted 71 of a total of 89 
recommendations received. It appreciated the acceptance of one of Algeria&#8217;s 
recommendations in favour of taking additional measures in the areas of housing, 
employment, education and access to social services, for all the segments of society. 
Algeria was saddened that joining the block position of a group of countries, Portugal had 
not accepted the recommendation of Algeria and many other countries to adhere to a core 
human rights instrument, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, although Portugal had long been a 
country of origin of migrant workers and was well placed to understand the suffering and 
indignity to which migrants were exposed. It recommended that Portugal should exercise 
leadership in this regard.  
</p>
<p>542. The Islamic Republic of Iran appreciated Portugal&#8217;s positive approach in accepting 
most of its recommendations. It sought more elaboration on the reasons that Portugal had 
provided on the recommendation concerning the development of a national human rights 
plan in accordance with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. It encouraged 
the Government to continue efforts to eliminate all forms of discrimination and to take a 
comprehensive set of measures to tackle racism and racial discrimination, and to combat 
more resolutely all its forms and manifestations. It requested Portugal to elaborate further 
on its policies and programmes to tackle the problems of ill-treatment and the excessive use 
of force by the police against immigrants and the Roma. It also sought an update on the 
measures to improve the condition of prisons and detention centres, including 
overcrowding, inadequate facilities, health problems and cases of physical and sexual 
abuse. It encouraged Portugal to update the Council on Government policies to combat 
trafficking in persons for the purposes of forced labour and sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>543. The United States of America commended Portugal&#8217;s continued support for human 
rights in the country. It expressed satisfaction that all prisoners had access to sanitary 
installations at all times, and that alternative sentencing programmes had been utilized to 
avoid imprisonment. It noted that few allegations of prisoner abuse were recognized by the 
European Committee for the Prevention of Torture. It looked forward to responses to its 
previous recommendations regarding implementation of the 2004 guidelines and reforms 
for the prison system and the Ministry of Labour&#8217;s efforts to prevent child labour. 
</p>
<p>544. Nepal recognized Portugal&#8217;s commitment to promote and protect human rights, and 
congratulated Portugal on its being recognized by the United Nations as the best country in 
the area for the provision of support services and immigrant&#8217;s rights. Nepal noted with 
appreciation that the existing asylum law enshrined the fundamental rights of immigrants 
and protected the interests of asylum-seekers. Nepal appreciated the measures taken to curb </p>


<p>violent crimes, domestic violence and trafficking in human beings. Nepal applauded the 
efforts to promote gender equality and encourage women&#8217;s entrepreneurship.  
</p>
<p><i> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>545. The Ombudsman of Portugal noted the achievements made by Portugal in the 
effective implementation of human rights, but underlined the importance of furthering work 
in some fields. He commended the Government for accepting a significant number of 
recommendations. Concerning the situation in prisons, while acknowledging the 
improvements achieved, he encouraged the Government to take further steps, particularly 
by pursuing ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and 
establishing the national preventive mechanism. He also encouraged the continuation of 
efforts to strengthen the protection of vulnerable groups, including children and women, 
and called for further efforts to provide assistance and to ensure full integration of 
immigrants. He expressed his commitment to following closely the implementation stage of 
universal periodic review recommendations.  
</p>
<p>546. Interfaith International, in a joint statement with the Al-Hakim Foundation, noted 
that the acceptance of most of the recommendations showed the openness of Portugal to all 
Council mechanisms. It noted that Portugal was one of the few countries in the European 
Union that had provided specific treatment for nationals of its former colonies in terms of 
administrative regularization. It urged the Government to combat domestic violence 
effectively and to take appropriate measures to punish those responsible for such acts. It 
encouraged Portugal to set up a programme on education to citizenship concerning the 
rights and duties of citizens for migrants living in the territory. 
</p>
<p>547. The Charitable Institute for Protecting Social Victims, in a joint statement with the 
Institute for Women&#8217;s Research and Studies and the Islamic Women&#8217;s Institute of Iran, 
commended the efforts made for the promotion and improvement of gender equality and 
the implementation of the national campaign on combating domestic violence against 
women and children over the period 2007&#8211;2009, but it noted that domestic violence 
remained an ongoing concern. It called upon the Government to continue its activities to 
increase awareness of all forms of violence against women and children and to continue its 
campaign through a prevention policy as one of the priorities of the Government&#8217;s plans. It 
condemned the cases of racism and racial discrimination against migrants and ethnic 
minorities and the unsuitable conditions of prisons and detentions centres. It called upon the 
Council to investigate these issues and the Government to plan and create a mechanism for 
the elimination of racism and to fight against all its forms. It also stressed the need to 
strengthen efforts for the integration of the Roma community. 
</p>
<p>548. The Organization for Defending Victims of Violence, in a joint statement with the 
Iranian Elite Research Centre, invited the Government, in addition to intensifying its efforts 
to create a culture of tolerance in society, to increase efforts to strengthen programmes, 
projects and other measures to prevent discrimination against vulnerable groups, including 
Roma women, asylum-seekers and migrants. It called on the Government to expand and 
strengthen training of law enforcement officials, and to enhance public awareness in 
relation to respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of immigrants, refugees 
and ethnic minorities. It also called on the Government to consider strengthening efforts to 
combat violence against women, including domestic violence and trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children by, inter alia, ensuring the full implementation of related 
laws and legislation, and also through the continued provision of adequate funding and the 
creation of a monitoring mechanism. 
</p>
<p>549. The European Region of the International Lesbian and Gay Federation, in a joint 
statement with Federatie van Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie Van 
Homoseksualiteit and COC Netherland, commended Portugal for accepting the </p>


<p>recommendation to take further measures to provide police, prison and judicial staff with 
human rights training, with a focus on the protection of rights of women, children, ethnic or 
national minorities, and persons of minority sexual orientation or gender identity, and to 
strengthen the accountability of such personnel for their conduct, particularly when dealing 
with cases of hate crimes. It also commended Portugal for accepting the recommendation to 
continue efforts to raise public awareness on human rights and to effectively combat 
racism, racial discrimination and intolerance, recommending explicit inclusion of gender 
identity as a ground in anti-discrimination legislation. It recognized the positive steps taken 
to counter discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and 
encouraged Portugal to share best practices in this field and to consider applying the 
Yogyakarta Principles as a guide to assist in policy development. 
</p>
<p><i> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i></p>
<p>550. Portugal had embraced the universal periodic review as an opportunity to take stock 
of its accomplishments and the challenges that lay ahead. Portugal regarded the review as a 
valuable road map to keep improving human rights, nationally and internationally. Its 
preparation allowed for the identification of areas where progress had been accomplished 
and others where improvement could still be achieved, thus representing an added value in 
identification of current and future priorities in the field of human rights at the national 
level.  
</p>
<p><b>  Bhutan 
</b></p>
<p>551. The review of Bhutan was held on 4 December 2009 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Bhutan in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/BTN/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/BTN/2);  
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/BTN/3). 
</p>
<p>552. At its 31st meeting, on 18 March 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Bhutan (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>553. The outcome of the review on Bhutan comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/13/11), the views of Bhutan concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/13/11/Add.1 and A/HRC/13/11/Add.1/Corr.1). 
</p>
<p><i> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions, as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>554. The head of the delegation, Ambassador Yeshey Dorji, Permanent Representative of 
Bhutan to the United Nations in Geneva, stated that Bhutan, along with other States, 
recognized the universal periodic review mechanism as an excellent opportunity to 
undertake a review of the human rights situations on the ground in all countries, in a 
constructive and cooperative spirit, guided by the principles of universality and non-
selectivity. Bhutan thus considered the review a productive and rewarding experience. It 
underlined the inclusive approach that it had taken in drafting its national report, noting its </p>


<p>intention to pursue the follow-up to the review also in a spirit of openness, transparency and 
partnership.  
</p>
<p>555. Bhutan expressed its gratitude for the high level of interest shown by delegations in 
the Working Group, and expressed satisfaction at the recognition of its efforts, particularly 
its holistic approach to development, guided by the philosophy of gross national happiness, 
and its efforts in strengthening civil and political rights through the transformation of its 
system of governance and the rule of law. With regard to the comments and 
recommendations made during the review, including with regard to the scope of Bhutan&#8217;s 
international human rights commitments, the strengthening of support for civil society 
organizations, measures to combat domestic violence and trafficking, and complex 
humanitarian issues, Bhutan expressed its commitment to addressing these issues.  
</p>
<p>556. Reaffirming its conviction that human rights must be viewed in a holistic manner, as 
indivisible, interrelated and mutually reinforcing, Bhutan stated that the universal periodic 
review process had imbued a sense of growing confidence among many national agencies 
involved in the protection and promotion of human rights. Bhutan had considered all 99 
recommendations made during the interactive dialogue in a constructive spirit, it had 
responded to each of the recommendations in writing, and had accepted the vast majority of 
them. Many recommendations were already in various stages of implementation, and some 
were already adequately addressed by existing legal provisions. The remaining 
recommendations were taken note of, with comments reflected in the addendum to the 
Working Group report. 
</p>
<p>557. Bhutan also noted that the universal periodic review had allowed it to take a closer 
look at persisting challenges in its efforts to meet its international human rights obligations. 
As a small, landlocked and least developed country in the process of consolidating its 
political and institutional transition, great efforts and investments would still be required to 
fulfil those obligations. However, Bhutan was determined to meet those challenges and 
strive for further progress, with the support and cooperation of the international community. 
</p>
<p><i> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i></p>
<p>558. Algeria welcomed the open and transparent manner in which Bhutan had engaged in 
the universal periodic review process. Bhutan had endorsed most of the recommendations 
made, including those made by Algeria. Algeria also noted that Bhutan had achieved 
encouraging results in resolving problems related to food security, particularly in rural 
areas. It encouraged Bhutan to formulate, if needed, requests for assistance from relevant 
United Nations funds and programmes in order to consolidate its national strategy for food 
security. Algeria commended Bhutan for its efforts to ensure equality between men and 
women. It also reiterated its recommendation on the continuation of efforts to ensure that 
the right to health could be enjoyed by all, within the context of attaining the Millennium 
Development Goals. It encouraged Bhutan to search for a sustainable solution to the issue 
of refugees.  
</p>
<p>559. Cuba noted that Bhutan had accepted a significant number of recommendations and 
made significant efforts to implement them, which showed the will of the Government to 
promote the human rights of its citizens. Bhutan was making positive efforts to promote 
and protect human rights in spite of being a small developing country and a victim of an 
unjust international economic order. Bhutan had demonstrated its commitment to 
eliminating all forms of discrimination against women and guaranteeing equal rights for 
women and men. Cuba appreciated the fact that Bhutan had accepted its recommendation in 
a spirit of cooperation and constructive dialogue. Cuba encouraged Bhutan to continue its 
efforts in the field of human rights </p>


<p>560. India expressed its appreciation for the approach taken by Bhutan to the universal 
periodic review mechanism. The review had benefited from a wide participation by States, 
with 53 statements and 99 recommendations made. India was encouraged by the fact that 
Bhutan had accepted most recommendations made, and that it had provided detailed 
responses on each one. India congratulated Bhutan on its successful review and expressed 
confidence that Bhutan would further intensify its efforts within the next four years to 
implement the recommendations that it had accepted.  
</p>
<p>561. Pakistan<b> </b>thanked the delegation of Bhutan for the comprehensive presentation, 
which reaffirmed the country&#8217;s resolve to work constructively for the realization of all 
human rights. Pakistan noted that Bhutan had accepted the majority of the 
recommendations made and welcomed its frank and realistic approach to implementation. 
Pakistan appreciated Bhutan&#8217;s intention to establish a multisectoral task force to consider 
the possible ratification of specific human rights treaties, as recommended during the 
review process. It shared Bhutan&#8217;s views on the importance of first evaluating domestic 
feasibility before taking a decision to establish a national human rights institution. Pakistan 
expressed the hope that the international community would extend all possible assistance to 
Bhutan to help implement universal periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>562. The United States of America commended Bhutan&#8217;s constructive engagement with 
the committees on the rights of the child and on the elimination of discrimination against 
women, as well as with regional human rights bodies, noting that these engagements had 
contributed to the development of legislative instruments and the principles embodied in 
the promotion of &#8220;gross national happiness&#8221;. The United States supported the 
recommendations that Bhutan should promote and protect the rights of persons belonging 
to the ethnic Nepalese minority. It also shared the opinion that Bhutan should enhance 
efforts to implement a durable solution for the refugees currently residing in seven camps in 
a neighbouring State, and that it resume dialogue with that State and enhance cooperation 
with UNHCR and the core group in order to allow some refugees of special humanitarian 
concern to return immediately to Bhutan. It appreciated Bhutan&#8217;s expressed commitment to 
women&#8217;s rights, but shared concerns expressed by several other States regarding the levels 
of domestic violence in the country.  
</p>
<p>563. Sri Lanka commended Bhutan&#8217;s cooperation in the universal periodic review 
process and noted with satisfaction that the Government had provided its views on 
recommendations in an addendum to the report of the Working Group. Bhutan had made 
significant efforts in the area of economic, social and cultural rights, consistent with its 
philosophy of gross national happiness, while at the same time building a strong democracy 
that promoted and protected civil and political rights. Sri Lanka believed that the 
recommendations contained in the report would facilitate the intensification of the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to build a harmonious society based on the principle of non-
discrimination, which had been central to all Government policies and actions. It added 
that, through the universal periodic review process, Bhutan had concretized its commitment 
to constructive engagement with the international community on human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>564. China thanked Bhutan for its presentation, which showed its commitment to 
effective cooperation in the universal periodic review process. It appreciated the importance 
that Bhutan attached to the review outcome and to seeking active feedback with a view to 
implementation. China welcomed Bhutan&#8217;s commitment to promoting economic, social and 
cultural rights and to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, including in areas such 
as poverty reduction and primary education. It supported the priority accorded by Bhutan to 
the promotion of human rights in these fields. China acknowledged the challenges faced by 
Bhutan, but expressed confidence that it would succeed in its efforts to implement universal 
periodic review recommendations with the support of the international community. </p>


<p>565. Saudi Arabia noted Bhutan&#8217;s commitment to human rights, as illustrated by its 
acceptance of most recommendations contained in the universal periodic review report, as 
well as its cooperation with all mechanisms and procedures of the United Nations human 
rights system. Bhutan&#8217;s commitment to human rights was also shown by its willingness to 
continue international cooperation and a true dialogue on human rights. Saudi Arabia 
encouraged Bhutan to continue along this path. 
</p>
<p>566. Botswana welcomed the comprehensive presentation by Bhutan as well as its 
decision to accept most of the recommendations made. Botswana commended the efforts 
made by Bhutan, noting in particular its commitment to strengthen its institutional 
framework. It hoped that Bhutan, a landlocked and developing country like Botswana, 
would benefit from the support of the international community.  
</p>
<p><i> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>567. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network addressed recommendation 60 of the 
Working Group report, aimed at repealing provisions in the Penal Code criminalizing 
sexual activities between consenting adults of the same sex. The organization recalled the 
view of the Human Rights Committee in <i>Toonen v. Australia </i>(1994), that laws 
criminalizing homosexual conduct violated the rights to privacy and non-discrimination, 
even if not actively enforced, as they stigmatized marginalized populations and undermined 
human dignity, in addition to compromising HIV/AIDS prevention programmes. It 
welcomed the Government&#8217;s willingness to review these provisions in the future and urged 
that necessary steps should be taken to bring them into line with international laws as soon 
as possible. 
</p>
<p>568. The Lutheran World Federation appreciated the concerns expressed and 
recommendations made by many States regarding the unresolved refugee crisis and issues 
concerning the treatment of minorities in Bhutan. It recalled that Bhutan had reiterated its 
commitment to finding a lasting solution to the refugee problem through a process of 
bilateral negotiations. It noted Bhutan&#8217;s participation in a joint verification process in one 
of the refugee camps, which had resulted in the verification of hundreds of refugees who 
should have been allowed to return to Bhutan, but were still unable to do so. The 
organization urged Bhutan to demonstrate its true commitment to resolving this issue, and 
to assume its responsibility for the voluntary repatriation of refugees in conditions of safety 
and dignity, with full guarantees for their human rights. 
</p>
<p><i> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i></p>
<p>569. Bhutan thanked the President of the Council, all States participating in the review, 
the troika and the Secretariat. Bhutan also thanked the representatives of civil society who 
had taken the floor. Bhutan&#8217;s own civil society was growing quickly. In this regard, Bhutan 
expressed regret that representatives from its own community of non-governmental 
organizations had been unable to attend owing to the lack of resources. In the light of the 
potential value that these organizations could add to the process, Bhutan suggested that the 
Council consider means to facilitate the participation of non-governmental organizations 
from developing and least developed countries in the universal periodic review process, 
particularly during the plenary phase.  
</p>
<p>570. Bhutan emphasized that its legal framework, administrative machinery and growing 
civil society provided a sound environment for the promotion and protection of human 
rights. The Government expressed its determination to ensure that the principles of the new 
Constitution were upheld, that the rule of law was respected and that all Bhutanese could 
benefit from the democratic transformation. In this spirit, the Government would continue 
to strive for the realization of all human rights by its people.  </p>


<p><b>  Dominica 
</b></p>
<p>571. The review of Dominica was held on 7 December 2009 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: <b> 
</b></p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Dominica in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/DMA/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/DMA/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/DMA/3). 
</p>
<p>572. At its 31st meeting, on 18 March 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Dominica (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>573. The outcome of the review on Dominica comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/13/12), the views of Dominica concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><i> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions, as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>574. The Permanent Representative of Dominica to the United Nations<b> </b>stated that the 
issue of universal human rights had always been and continued to be a matter of great 
significance to the Government and people of Dominica. Dominican institutions &#8212; 
executive, legislative and judiciary &#8212; continued to hold high the ideals of the rule of law 
and had been very responsive to international norms, conventions and customs.  
</p>
<p>575. Over the years, Dominica had signed, ratified and acceded to several documents 
aimed at protecting human rights, especially the rights of the most vulnerable members of 
the population. Despite technical and financial constraints, Dominica had clearly 
demonstrated its willingness to work with hemispheric and international institutions.  
</p>
<p>576. With reference to the recommendations made during the review in the Working 
Group, Dominica provided the comments below.  
</p>
<p>577. With regard to conventions and protocols, the Government was committed to make 
every possible effort to complete the following steps in the next three months: 
</p>
<p> (a) To ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; 
</p>
<p> (b) To accede to the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime; 
</p>
<p> (c) To ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance; 
</p>
<p> (d) To ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination; 
</p>
<p> (e) To accede to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women; 
</p>
<p> (f) To ratify the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Optional Protocol thereto. </p>


<p>578. The Government was committed to the international principles of human rights, 
social justice and equity; however, it was constrained by the absence of resources, both 
technical and financial, to meet its commitments (a) to give domestic legal effect to 
international human rights norms and standards as contained in the United Nations 
conventions, and (b) to submit reports to the respective bodies in a timely manner.  
</p>
<p>579. Dominica called on the United Nations, and in particular on OHCHR, to provide 
technical and financial resources to assist it to meet its commitments, especially those 
currently outstanding. This would enable the Government to make a plan for the 
submission of all overdue reports to treaty bodies. In that regard, the Permanent 
Representative reported that the United Nations Development Fund for Women was 
currently providing assistance for reporting under the Convention on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, and that efforts were made to meet reporting obligations 
under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>580. With regard to the recommendation relating to the ratification of the second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
Representative recalled that Dominica, as an English-speaking Caribbean country, had not 
abolished the death penalty, although there had been a self-imposed moratorium on the use 
of the death penalty since 1986. 
</p>
<p>581. The current law on the death penalty was based on the 2003 ruling of the Privy 
Council of England, the final court of appeal for Dominica, which made the death penalty 
the maximum penalty for murder, to be imposed only for the most serious killings, rather 
than as a mandatory penalty.  
</p>
<p>582. While the death penalty had not been used in Dominica since 1986, there was a 
popular sentiment in the country in favour of reinstating executions for persons convicted 
of murder. The Cabinet of Dominica had indicated that, as a democratically elected 
Government elected by the people to represent the people, the laws it would submit to the 
Parliament should, to the extent possible, reflect the sentiments and desires of the people. 
The Government decided to maintain the death penalty in its legislation.  
</p>
<p>583. As a signatory of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, signed 
on 30 March 2007, the Government of Dominica remained committed to the full inclusion 
of persons with disabilities into the mainstream, and efforts had been made to ratify the 
Convention. There had been a series of stakeholder and wider public consultations. Based 
on the plan of action, the ratification process would be completed in the next three months, 
although, owing to resources constraints, Dominica faced difficulties in meeting the spirit 
and obligations of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>584. With regard to discrimination based on sexual orientation, the Constitution of 
Dominica guaranteed the protection of all citizens from discrimination based on their race, 
place of origin, political opinions, colour, creed or sex. The Constitution also provided for a 
legal mechanism to be utilized by persons who felt discriminated against. The Government 
promoted non-discrimination against all its citizens, and called on institutions and 
individuals to do the same. It also recognized that laws were to be enforced and could not 
be seen to condone the violation of the law. Through its national HIV/AIDS programme, 
Dominica provided support for persons who had been infected and affected by the disease. 
This was done without any request for the disclosure on the part of the victim of their 
sexual orientation.  
</p>
<p>585. The position of the Government of Dominica remained the same with regard to the 
criminalization of sexual relations between consenting adults of the same sex. The laws of 
Dominica, which have been on the statute books since colonial times, remained unchanged. 
The Government was not prepared to introduce to Parliament any legislation to 
decriminalize sexual relations between consenting adults of the same sex. Thus, it was </p>


<p>difficult to promote a public-awareness campaign, which would seek a sensitization to 
persons who have been considered to have violated the laws. Dominica remained sensitive 
to people affected and infected by HIV/AIDS, and treatment continued to remain available 
to persons infected regardless of their sexual orientation.  
</p>
<p>586. On corporal punishment, the Educational Act No. 11 (1997), which set out the 
policies for dealing with student behavioural and discipline problems, allowed for the 
administration of corporal punishment. The contents of section 49 (2) stated that corporal 
punishment could be administered where no other punishment was considered suitable or 
effective, and only by the principal, deputy principal or any teacher appointed in writing by 
the principal for the purpose, in a manner in conformity with the guidelines issued in 
writing by the chief education officer. 
</p>
<p>587. Corporal punishment was therefore not applied arbitrarily, and was seen as a 
measure of last resort for serious offences in the school system. Those who applied corporal 
punishment were guided by the code developed by the Ministry of Education. Corporal 
punishment was also used in the family, while there had been a tremendous effort to assist 
parents in the parenting of children and the use of alternative measures of discipline. Fully 
aware of the risk of abuse, the Welfare Department of the Ministry of Social Services was 
constantly engaged with parents and children who had complained of abuse. While 
recognizing the position taken in the Working Group, Dominica was not prepared to 
remove corporal punishment from its statute books. 
</p>
<p>588.<b> </b>The Government of Dominica remained committed to the principles of universal 
human rights established by the United Nations conventions, covenants and declarations, as 
well as international norms and customs. These rights were also guaranteed by the 
Constitution. Dominica&#8217;s inability to submit reports to the relevant bodies and 
organizations of the United Nations was by no means due to a lack of interest in human 
rights. The reality was that Dominica was constrained by a lack of technical and financial 
resources. It was extremely difficult to meet the demands of the population, especially in 
the areas of education, health care, housing, sanitation, basic infrastructure and services, 
while providing, at the same time, the resources to meet its obligations. Dominica 
recognized the need to enhance its institutional capacity to meet its obligations under the 
conventions; it therefore called on the United Nations and all its organs to provide 
assistance in this regard. This must not be limited to technical assistance and training in the 
areas relevant to United Nations conventions, but must also extend to the areas of 
adaptation and mitigation to climate change, as well as recognition of Dominica&#8217;s special 
and differential position with regard to trade. 
</p>
<p><i> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i></p>
<p>589. Algeria noted the efforts made by Dominica to ensure the full and effective 
implementation of economic, social and cultural rights, despite its economic and 
environmental challenges. Algeria reiterated its call to United Nations programmes and 
institutions to provide Dominica with the technical and financial assistance necessary to 
overcome these challenges. It commended the efforts to promote the right to education, 
including the establishment of special programmes and the allocation of funds, particularly 
for poor children. Algeria encouraged Dominica to continue to promote and protect 
women&#8217;s rights as part of its plan of action for gender equality. Algeria welcomed 
Dominica&#8217;s acceptance of its recommendation regarding the establishment of a juvenile 
justice system.  
</p>
<p>590. Cuba noted that Dominica, throughout the universal periodic review process, had 
demonstrated the will of its people and the Government to fully respect human rights for 
all, despite the difficulties caused by powerful and devastating hurricanes. The presentation 
of Dominica reflected its Government&#8217;s commitment to the promotion and protection of </p>


<p>human rights. Cuba noted the priority areas identified in the field of human rights and the 
measures taken to protect vulnerable groups, as well as the considerable progress made to 
empower women and to promote women&#8217;s rights. Cuba reiterated its appeal to developed 
countries and relevant United Nations programmes to meet the request for cooperation and 
assistance contained in the national report of Dominica. 
</p>
<p>591. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) noted the challenges faced by Dominica in its 
exposure to the vicissitudes of nature, as well as the economic difficulties now aggravated 
by the world financial crisis. It acknowledged the Government&#8217;s efforts to prepare the 
national report with the participation of various sectors of civil society. Venezuela 
expressed satisfaction at Dominica&#8217;s reply regarding the improvement in living conditions 
of indigenous populations, particularly the Kalinago people, with considerable investment 
being made in housing and the water supply. 
</p>
<p>592. The United States of America commended the progress made in the advancement 
and promotion of women&#8217;s rights and gender mainstreaming, and the efforts to curb 
gender-based violence and discrimination in the areas of health, economic development, 
education and decision-making. It reiterated its strong support for the recommendation 
regarding the creation of public campaigns to combat social discrimination against those 
with HIV/AIDS. It urged Dominica to consider promoting legislation to guarantee the 
protection of citizens who had been discriminated against on the basis of their sexual 
orientation, gender identity or the fact that they had HIV/AIDS. It appreciated Dominica&#8217;s 
commitment to improve prison and detention conditions, its acceptance of the 
recommendations for the separation of prisoners based on the severity of crimes committed 
and the creation of a separate judicial and detention system for minors.  
</p>
<p><i> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>593. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, in a joint statement with the International 
Lesbian and Gay Association (Europe), noted the recommendations to ensure non-
discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity and HIV status, and to 
develop awareness programmes on these grounds, urging Dominica to accept these 
recommendations. It regretted that Dominica had not accepted the recommendations to 
decriminalize sexual relations between consenting adults of the same sex. It commended 
Dominica&#8217;s support for the Organization of American States resolution on sexual 
orientation, gender identity and human rights, adopted by consensus in 2009. It urged the 
Government to fulfil the commitment by bringing its criminal legislation into conformity 
with international law and ensuring that all Dominicans were protected from 
discrimination, including on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity.  
</p>
<p><i> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i></p>
<p>594. The Permanent Representative of Dominica thanked Member States and civil 
society for their comments. He reiterated the constraints faced by Dominica, particularly 
with regard to the issues of trade, which had seriously affected the country&#8217;s ability to 
survive economically. He also referred to the impact of climate change and the enormous 
financial amounts spent on the coastal areas owing to the severity of the hurricanes.  
</p>
<p>595. In response to recommendations 3, 6, 7 and 8 of paragraph 71 of the Working Group 
report, the Representative reiterated Dominica&#8217;s position that the Government provided 
social services to those affected by HIV/AIDS, irrespective of their sexual orientation, and 
that there was no policy of discrimination. It was extremely difficult, however, to promote 
sensitivity to persons who had been affected by this disease because of a particular sexual 
orientation, by virtue of the fact that same-sex relations were a criminal offence in 
Dominica. The Government of Dominica was not currently in a position to support 
recommendations 3, 6, 7 and 8.  </p>


<p>596. In response to the United States, the Permanent Representative stated that efforts 
were being made vigorously with regard to the issue of separate detention centres and the 
separation of prisoners. However, because of limited resources, it was extremely difficult to 
provide the kind of facilities that had been called for in order to separate prisoners. 
Recently, an additional prison block had been constructed, which would improve the 
separation of prisoners significantly. 
</p>
<p>597. Dominica was also engaged in judicial reform with the other member States of the 
Eastern Caribbean to implement a family court system, which would see the prosecution, 
litigation and correction of juveniles being dealt with in accordance with the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child. A detention centre would also be completed for juveniles who 
faced problems with the law.  
</p>
<p><b>  Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
</b></p>
<p>598. The review of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea was held on 7 December 
2009 in conformity with all the relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and 
was based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/PRK/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/ PRK/2);  
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/PRK/3). 
</p>
<p>599. At its 31st meeting, on 18 March 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on the State under review (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>600. The outcome of the review on the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
comprises the report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review 
(A/HRC/13/13), the views of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group.  
</p>
<p><i> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions, as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>601. The head of the delegation of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, Mr. Ri 
Tcheul, Ambassador and Permanent Representative, expressed his sincere thanks to many 
countries for their constructive recommendations. He also thanked the troika members, 
South Africa, Mexico and Norway, and the secretariat. 
</p>
<p>602. The universal periodic review mechanism was the most innovative and cooperative 
mechanism in the Council. The State participated in the sixth session of the Working Group 
in December 2009, and had had open and frank dialogue with the international community. 
Since then, it had distributed the report of the Working Group to Government agencies and 
more than 20 social and academic institutions engaged in the drafting of the universal 
periodic review national report. A group of officials and experts had held a series of 
consultations on the recommendations received.  
</p>
<p>603. Several countries recommended that the Government of the State under review put 
emphasis on measures to promote the economic and social rights of people by overcoming </p>


<p>economic difficulties, while consolidating and developing its political, economic and social 
system.   
</p>
<p>604. The Government deemed it essential to bring about early solutions to the difficulties 
in people&#8217;s everyday lives, caused by consecutive natural disasters in the 1990s and by the 
ongoing economic blockade and sanctions by the hostile forces against the State. To that 
end, in 2010, the Government was working towards a radical turn in improving the living 
standards of its people. 
</p>
<p>605. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea was pushing ahead with measures for a 
great productive increase in all fields of national economy. It was also taking practical steps 
to give full play to people-oriented policies, including complete and universal medical care 
and 11 years of free and compulsory education.  
</p>
<p>606. With regard to the recommendations on the rights of women and children, the policy 
consistently maintained by the State since its foundation was that children were the future 
of the country.  
</p>
<p>607. Women actively participated in State and social affairs. Additional measures would 
be taken to increase the ratio of women in public offices and to promote them to important 
positions of State and public institutions; comprehensive laws aimed at guaranteeing the 
rights of children and women would also be adopted. 
</p>
<p>608. The livelihood of vulnerable groups, including women, children and the elderly, was 
being considerably improved. Their rights and welfare would be further promoted as the 
overall economy was revitalized and raised to a higher standard. 
</p>
<p>609. The Government would continue to study the recommendations, such as the 
strengthening of human rights education, attaining the Millennium Development Goals and 
improving education and public health. Simultaneously, it would strive to take necessary 
legal, judicial and administrative measures to implement them. 
</p>
<p>610. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea had rejected 50 recommendations at the 
Working Group stage, since they were in total conflict with its principled stand against the 
politicization of human rights; they therefore did not enjoy its support. Regrettably, those 
recommendations focused on issues that were extraneous to genuine human rights issues 
and were purely put forward out of hostility towards the country.  
</p>
<p>611. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea wished to emphasize the question of 
discrimination raised in comments and recommendations by certain countries. 
Discrimination did not exist in the country, where equal rights and freedoms were fully 
guaranteed to all people in all fields of State and social life. No discrimination was 
stipulated or allowed in laws or norms. 
</p>
<p>612. With regard to the recommendations on cooperation with international human rights 
mechanisms and special procedures, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea rejected 
politicization and pursued genuine dialogue and cooperation. It did not recognize and 
therefore categorically rejected the so-called &#8220;resolutions&#8221; against the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea, as well as the mandate of &#8220;special rapporteur&#8221; imposed by them.  
</p>
<p>613. The so-called &#8220;resolutions&#8221; and the mandate of &#8220;special rapporteur&#8221; were 
confrontational in nature and not conducive to cooperation on human rights, because they 
were politically motivated. The practice of anachronistic &#8220;resolutions&#8221; and the &#8220;special 
rapporteur&#8221; on the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea must no longer be tolerated in 
the Council. 
</p>
<p>614. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea attached importance to the role that 
thematic special rapporteurs played, and would continue to pay special attention to the </p>


<p>pursuit of genuine cooperation with them, on the basis of the principle of non-politicization, 
non-selectivity, impartiality and objectivity. 
</p>
<p>615. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea needed technical cooperation in various 
fields of human rights, and sought its realization to complement sector-specific legislation, 
draft reports on the implementation of the international human rights instruments to which 
the country was a party, and to prepare human rights education curricula. Regrettably, in 
the case of the country, technical cooperation in human rights was being imposed as a 
means of pressure.  
</p>
<p>616. The State had acceded to several international human rights instruments and 
honoured its obligations, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>617. The State was implementing core elements of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Racial Discrimination, of which the State was not a party, by incorporating them into 
sector laws. The State would further intensify studies on the possibility of accession to 
instruments to which it was not a party. 
</p>
<p>618. With regard to the reunification of separated families and relatives, the root of the 
question had its origins in the continued division of Korea imposed by outside forces and 
foreign interference for the last 65 years. Since the first day of division, the Government 
had spared no effort to translate reunifications into reality. In the new century alone, dozens 
of investigations on the fates of separated family members had been undertaken.  
</p>
<p>619. The year 2010 marked the tenth anniversary of the North-South Joint Declaration of 
15 June 2008. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea would do its best to pave the 
way for improved inter-Korean relations and to achieve national reconciliation and unity.  
</p>
<p>620. The people of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea had themselves embodied 
the philosophy of <i>Juche</i>, thereby making themselves the masters of their own destiny. The 
State would further develop its human rights protection system in keeping with the 
country&#8217;s reality and people&#8217;s aspirations, while vigorously pushing ahead with the building 
of an economically powerful country.  
</p>
<p><i> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i></p>
<p>621. Japan acknowledged the participation of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
in the universal periodic review, but noted that it was not clear which recommendations had 
been accepted, and requested the State to express clearly its position on the 
recommendations. Japan referred to the country&#8217;s statement made in the Working Group 
asserting that the issue of the abduction of Japanese nationals had been completely settled. 
Such a statement contradicted the facts. Japan reiterated its call to the State to change its 
position on the abduction issue and to establish a committee to commence investigations in 
accordance with the agreement reached between the two countries in 2008. Japan urged the 
State to take concrete steps to improve the situation of human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p>622. Algeria recalled that the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea had participated in 
the interactive dialogue on issues such as the harmonization of domestic legislation with 
international instruments, women, agriculture production and education. It welcomed the 
State&#8217;s readiness to benefit from technical cooperation and noted that the country was 
facing natural disasters, a food crisis and the international financial crisis, which 
complicated its ability to respond to the needs of its citizens. The Council should take into 
account the situation and think of ways to be more helpful instead of showing an attitude of 
confrontation. </p>


<p>623. The Republic of Korea expressed its disappointment at the statement of the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, which demonstrated the absence of specific 
commitment to improve the human rights situation. The Republic of Korea remained 
concerned about the State&#8217;s refusal to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. It was 
disappointed that the State had rejected the recommendation to end public and extrajudicial 
executions, torture, arbitrary detention, labour camps and punishment of those forced to 
return from abroad. It was also disappointed at its negative response regarding the issues of 
prisoners of war and abductees. The Republic of Korea called upon the international 
community to respect the principle of non-refoulement, refraining from returning a person 
to a territory where he or she would be in danger of being subject to torture or punishment. 
</p>
<p>624. Cuba regretted that some recommendations were politically motivated, thus 
confirming the counterproductive nature of the confrontational approach. There was no 
justification to the ongoing mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, a manifestation of politicization, 
selectivity and double standards. Through its participation in the Working Group, the State 
had demonstrated its commitment to the Council, respect for human rights, the Charter of 
the United Nations and international human rights instruments.   
</p>
<p>625. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) noted that the participation of the State in the 
universal periodic review demonstrated its Government&#8217;s readiness to cooperate with 
human rights mechanisms for the realization of human rights. The review enabled it to 
register progress in the field of education, with a 100 per cent school enrolment rate at the 
primary level and illiteracy completely eradicated. Venezuela acknowledged the efforts 
made by the State in human rights, despite the economic difficulties as a result of the 
blockade. 
</p>
<p>626. Pakistan expressed its appreciation for the constructive engagement of the State in 
the universal periodic review. Pakistan took note of its willingness to elaborate existing 
legislation and mechanisms to advance the rights of the child and women in line with the 
recommendations. Pakistan was confident that the State would give due attention to all 
rights while introducing necessary legislative and administrative reforms. Pakistan was 
encouraged to note that the State was ready to improve the quality of life of its citizens by 
putting special emphasis on economic and agricultural development. Pakistan was 
confident that the State would take steps to improve the human rights situation by involving 
all stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>627. The Sudan thanked the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea for its commitment 
to the universal periodic review process. It noted the State&#8217;s achievements in guaranteeing 
free education and access to health care on the basis of figures of enrolment rates and 
health-care coverage. The economic blockade on the State had a negative impact on the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to promote social, economic, civil and political rights, including the 
rights to food and education, and the situation had been exacerbated by a series of national 
disasters. The Sudan encouraged the State to continue to promote human rights. 
</p>
<p>628. The Islamic Republic of Iran took note of the measures taken by the State, 
particularly in the field of economic, social and cultural rights and the advancement of the 
rights of women and children. Nevertheless, it noted that the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
of Korea, like all countries, had areas that required further action. It encouraged the State to 
intensify its efforts to make the necessary improvements with a view to achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals. It supported the international community in its 
constructive cooperation with the State and emphasized that countries should always seek 
to solve their differences in the field of human rights on the basis of equality and mutual 
respect. </p>


<p>629. The United States of America hoped that the State&#8217;s engagement in the universal 
periodic review process represented an opportunity to begin an in-depth dialogue on human 
rights issues. It remained concerned by reports of human rights abuses, including of 
extrajudicial execution, torture, the systematic deprivation of due process, the denial of 
freedom of speech, expression, movement and religion, forced labour and government-led 
mobilization campaigns, and about the abduction issue. It noted the State&#8217;s willingness to 
consider establishing an independent human rights mechanism and urged it to accept 
technical assistance from OHCHR and seek accreditation from the International 
Coordinating Committee of National Institutions. It also urged the State to join ILO, ratify 
its core conventions and allow related monitoring. It further urged the State to expand its 
efforts to protect women&#8217;s rights and to invite the special rapporteurs on violence against 
women and on torture to visit the country.  
</p>
<p>630. Qatar noted the effective participation of the State in the universal periodic review. 
It encouraged the State to continue its efforts to promote and protect human rights. It hoped 
for a dialogue and strengthened cooperation between the State and United Nations 
mechanisms in order to protect human rights and preserve the dignity of all. 
</p>
<p>631. China was pleased to note that the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea attached 
importance to the universal periodic review outcome and continued to pay great attention to 
the development of social, economic and cultural rights, building the education system, the 
medical system, protecting the rights of vulnerable groups and achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals. National disasters, food and financial crises had had a negative impact 
on development. China therefore hoped that the international community would objectively 
assess the human rights situation in the country and support it in its efforts to achieve 
economic development and improve living standards. 
</p>
<p>632. France stated that, like other delegations, it failed to understand which of the 117 
recommendations had been accepted. It recalled that, at this stage of the process, the 
position on recommendations should be clear and transparent and thus put the question to 
the State delegation, expecting an immediate reply to allow the Council to give its views on 
the adoption of the Working Group report. France concluded that, without a clear response, 
the State could not be seen as having cooperated with the Council. 
</p>
<p>633. Sri Lanka hoped that the State would continue to make all efforts to implement the 
conclusions and recommendations of the report. The creation of a conducive environment 
was essential to further the promotion and protection of human rights, and Sri Lanka hoped 
that international mechanisms, such as the universal periodic review, would facilitate the 
achievement of this end.  
</p>
<p><i> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>634. Human Rights Watch stated that the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea had 
demonstrated neither the political commitment nor the requisite understanding of what it 
meant to comply with international human rights standards. Repression was so severe that 
the country lacked any independent civil society organizations. Numerous people who had 
escaped had testified how the Government systematically suppressed freedom of speech, 
the press, assembly and other freedoms. It expressed concern about the existence of labour 
camps, public executions and torture, and called on the Council to extend the mandate of 
the Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>635. Interfaith International, in a joint statement with Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense 
des droits de l&#8217;homme, stated that the rejection of half of the recommendations did not 
reassure the Council about the political will to implement the accepted recommendations. It 
urged the State to cooperate with the special procedures of the Council, and exhorted it to 
respect ILO standards and ensure freedom of the press.  </p>


<p>636. Amnesty International urged the State to implement the recommendations on the 
right to food by facilitating the effective distribution of international humanitarian aid to 
people in need and cooperating constructively with humanitarian agencies. It had not had 
access to the State since 1995, and requested the Government to extend an invitation, 
together with other human rights and humanitarian organizations, to visit the country. It 
urged the State to implement the recommendations on cooperation with the special 
procedures and to reconsider the recommendations it had rejected, with a view to 
supporting them in due course. 
</p>
<p>637. The Indian Movement &#8220;Tupaj Amaru&#8221;, in a joint statement with the World Peace 
Council, stated that the European Union, the United States, Japan and their allies supported 
a resolution that had yet once again put the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea in the 
dock for supposed human rights violations, and imposed a special rapporteur to the 
detriment of the State&#8217;s sovereignty. The European Union, Japan and the United States 
were maintaining hostility and harassment against the State. The North Korean Human 
Rights Act, promulgated by the United States Senate in 2004, was a clear intention of 
threatening the State&#8217;s sovereignty. 
</p>
<p>638. The Organization for Defending Victims of Violence asked the State to intensify 
efforts to promote a human rights culture, ensure that goals of economic development by 
2012 contributed to a decisive turn in human rights, increase efforts in human rights for 
specific groups, increase cooperation with international humanitarian and human rights 
bodies and mechanisms, and try to reach a balance between the enjoyment of civil and 
political rights with that of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p><i> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i></p>
<p>639. The delegation of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea stated that 
recommendations made in good faith would be considered as a sign of encouragement and 
support. Conversely, some comments were made based on groundless information, which 
seriously distorted reality. Should these comments be due to lack of knowledge, the State 
were ready to provide assistance for their proper understanding; but if they were based on 
dishonest intent, which had nothing to do with human rights, the State would categorically 
reject them. 
</p>
<p>640. In its introductory statement, the State had provided responses to the 
recommendations in a clustered manner for easier coverage. It had taken note of those 
recommendations for which, in some countries&#8217; views, it did not present a clear position 
despite its efforts. The delegation reaffirmed the State&#8217;s compliance with international 
instruments and the promotion of sincere dialogue and cooperation through international 
mechanisms such as the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>641. Statements were made before the adoption of the outcome of the review.  
</p>
<p>642. With reference to the recommendations, Norway failed to understand which 
recommendations had been accepted and which rejected, thus remaining unclear as to the 
outcome of the interactive dialogue. Norway sought the advice of the President and 
proposed a brief suspension of proceedings.  
</p>
<p>643. Although it was not opposed to a suspension of proceedings, Cuba believed that the 
head of delegation had clearly stated the position of his country on the recommendations.  
</p>
<p>644. The delegation of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea stated that, as a 
sovereign country, it had the right to decide which recommendations could be accepted, 
further studied or rejected. It reiterated that it had taken note of those recommendations 
that, in some countries&#8217; opinion, were not properly reflected.  </p>


<p>645. France stated that it understood that none of the recommendations included in the 
Working Group report had been accepted.  
</p>
<p>646. Cuba agreed with the State&#8217;s interpretation on the implementation of 
recommendations, which belonged to States. Consequently, it was up to them to decide 
which recommendations to accept and which to reject. 
</p>
<p><b>  Brunei Darussalam 
</b></p>
<p>647. The review of Brunei Darussalam was held on 8 December 2009 in conformity with 
all the relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Brunei Darussalam in accordance with the 
annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/BRN/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/BRN/2);  
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/BRN/3). 
</p>
<p>648. At its 32nd meeting, on 19 March 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Brunei Darussalam (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>649. The outcome of the review on Brunei Darussalam comprises the report of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/13/14), the views of Brunei 
Darussalam concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary 
commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in 
the Working Group (see also A/HRC/13/14/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><i> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions, as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>650. The delegation of Brunei Darussalam reiterated its support for the universal periodic 
review process as an integral part of the work of the Council. It welcomed the opportunity 
to engage in a dialogue with other delegations and members of non-governmental 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>651. Following its review, the Government of Brunei Darussalam had held several 
consultations with all relevant agencies to examine the recommendations made. Specific 
discussions were also held to review Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s reservations to articles under the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women. A detailed study was under way with regard to the 
reservations to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>652. With regard to ratification of human rights treaties, Brunei Darussalam was 
progressively reviewing the situation and was presently in the process of ratifying or 
acceding to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; the Supplementary 
Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices 
Similar to Slavery; the International Convention against Apartheid in Sports; and the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict. It would also consider looking into other related human rights 
instruments. 
</p>
<p>653. Another significant development cited by the delegation since its review in 
December 2009 was the entry into force of the Children and Young Persons Order on 1 
March 2010, replacing the Children Order 2000. The new Order included the establishment </p>


<p>of juvenile courts and action teams on child protection. It further enhanced the rights of 
children and safeguarded their welfare, and also provided for approved homes and 
approved schools for children in need of protection, and proper remand homes and places 
of detention for children admitted to legal custody. There were also provisions ensuring the 
recovery and social reintegration of child victims of crimes. 
</p>
<p>654. In response to questions raised during the interactive dialogue, the delegation 
informed the Council that, with regard to articles 37, 39 and 40 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, those provisions had been included in chapter 22 of the Penal Code, 
chapter 7 of the Criminal Procedure Code and in the recently enforced Children and Young 
Persons Order 2006. 
</p>
<p>655. On human rights training and education in schools and society, the Government had 
taken several measures. Training and education were undertaken to raise society&#8217;s 
perspective on human rights through electronic and print media, roadshows and ongoing 
talks. 
</p>
<p>656. Regarding the protection of women&#8217;s rights, the delegation cited various laws, 
including the Women and Girls Protection Act (chapter 120), the Married Women Act 
(chapter 190), the Islamic Family Law Order 1999, the Penal Code (chapter 22) and the 
Criminal Procedure Code (chapter 7). To enhance women&#8217;s active participation in national 
development, the country&#8217;s long-term development plan (Brunei Vision 2035) also 
encouraged equal opportunities for women in the workforce and in nation-building. The 
new Employment Order 2009 and Employment (Domestic Workers) Regulations 2009 did 
not discriminate on the basis of age, gender or race. Citing figures indicating that women 
constituted 56.9 per cent of the civil service force, where they occupied 28 per cent of 
senior management posts, the delegation added that more women were now employed in 
male-dominated fields such as the army, police force and fire and rescue services. 
</p>
<p>657. Brunei Darussalam fully recognized the important role of women in the country&#8217;s 
socio-economic development. More than half of the small and medium-sized enterprises in 
the country were owned by women, and this sector was responsible for 92 per cent of 
employment opportunities in the private sector. Furthermore, nearly two thirds of women 
were beneficiaries of financial assistance schemes provided by the Government, including 
the enterprise facilitation scheme, the microcredit financial scheme and the working capital 
credit fund. 
</p>
<p>658. With regard to the work of the National Council on Social Issues, the delegation 
informed the Council that it comprised six special committees looking into poverty, societal 
mentality, immoral activities, crime prevention, women&#8217;s issues and the family, as well as 
the elderly and persons with special needs. In line with Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s national vision 
to achieve zero poverty by 2035, several tasks were currently under way, including defining 
poverty within the context of Brunei Darussalam; studying and analysing the root causes of 
poverty in the country; making recommendations on how to address them appropriately; 
and setting up a comprehensive database on the sectors of the population living in poverty, 
such as the elderly, persons with special needs, single parents and the unemployed. 
</p>
<p><i> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i></p>
<p>659. Algeria expressed appreciation for Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s commitment to further 
consolidate the enjoyment of human rights, and commended its acceptance of the 
recommendation to ratify the remaining core international human rights instruments. 
Algeria welcomed the Government&#8217;s efforts in the areas of health, education, adequate 
housing and employment, as well as in promoting the role of women and their participation 
in society. In line with measures already taken in favour of foreign workers, Algeria 
encouraged the Government to consider ratifying the International Convention on the </p>


<p>Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and 
welcomed Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s intention to further examine the possibility of doing so. 
</p>
<p>660. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic commended Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s 
acceptance of recommendations made during its review. It hoped that the Government 
would take all necessary measures to address pending human rights issues and fulfil its 
commitment to promote and protect human rights in the country in accordance with its 
tradition, culture and specific situation, to ensure well-being, stability, peace, development 
and prosperity, and to achieve the national vision of zero poverty by 2035. 
</p>
<p>661. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) celebrated the openness and constructive 
attitude of Brunei Darussalam during its review. The delegation had given concrete 
responses, particularly about achievements in the implementation of health policies. The 
Government had spared no effort to provide citizens with an excellent system of total health 
care, offering basic and free services to all, preventive and curative services, and medical 
attention for rehabilitation. It encouraged the Government to maintain and increase its 
support for social policies, particularly in the field of health and in protecting and 
guaranteeing the well-being of its population. 
</p>
<p>662. Cambodia appreciated Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s inclusive and constructive approach in 
preparing its national report and in the follow-up to recommendations, citing the country as 
a good example. Cambodia was pleased by the Government&#8217;s acceptance of most 
recommendations relating to achieving equitable socio-economic development. It praised 
the steps taken to consider ratification of, inter alia, the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. Cambodia was confident that 
Brunei Darussalam would spare no effort to ensure that accepted recommendations would 
be translated into concrete actions, especially regarding the improvement of living 
standards, social welfare and gender equity, as reflected in its national vision to achieve 
zero poverty by 2035. 
</p>
<p>663. Viet Nam commended Brunei Darussalam for its positive engagement with the 
Council and appreciated its response to the recommendations made by Viet Nam. It 
welcomed the steps already taken by the Government to implement accepted 
recommendations, particularly in the areas of child protection, the participation of women 
in national development, the protection of the elderly, of persons with special needs and the 
unemployed, poverty reduction and active cooperation with the human rights treaties. Viet 
Nam encouraged Brunei Darussalam to realize its national plan to implement the 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>664. Thailand welcomed Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s establishment of a ministerial-level 
national council on social issues and its efforts to promote free access to services satisfying 
its citizens&#8217; basic needs, particularly in education and health care. Thailand appreciated the 
fact that its recommendations enjoyed the support of Brunei Darussalam, and noted with 
satisfaction the Government&#8217;s efforts to become party to the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. Thailand hoped that Brunei Darussalam would consider 
implementing the other recommendations as well. It pledged close cooperation with Brunei 
Darussalam to promote and protect human rights, particularly at the regional level, with the 
recently established ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>665. The Philippines congratulated Brunei Darussalam for its constructive engagement, 
and noted with appreciation its acceptance of a number of recommendations. It welcomed 
the Government&#8217;s intention to become party to international human rights instruments, such 
as the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Acknowledging progress in 
socio-economic development and the high ranking in the Human Development Index of the 
United Nations Human Development Report, it also noted the priority the Government </p>


<p>placed in fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals, which it was close to achieving. It 
encouraged Brunei Darussalam to continue its efforts to promote and protect the rights of 
its people, especially of vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>666. Cuba commended Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s commitment to the universal periodic 
review. It noted the country&#8217;s commitment to economic and social development, as shown 
by the excellent chance it had of achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. 
The delegation of Brunei Darussalam had provided detailed information in the course of its 
review on human rights. Cuba welcomed Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s decision to accept the 
recommendations made by Cuba in a spirit of cooperation and constructive dialogue. 
</p>
<p>667. Indonesia expressed appreciation for Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s acceptance of 
recommendations, particularly Indonesia&#8217;s recommendation for harmonization of national 
legislation with international norms. Indonesia fully supported recommendations calling for 
the establishment of a legal and institutional framework to provide better human rights 
protection in Brunei Darussalam, and encouraged the State to consider accession to other 
international human rights instruments. Indonesia commended the efforts of Brunei 
Darussalam to fulfil its human rights obligations regarding socio-economic development, 
and appreciated the Government&#8217;s voluntary pledges to strengthen cooperation with civil 
society on human rights issues. It encouraged Brunei Darussalam to enhance and strengthen 
the work of the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>668. Pakistan valued the efforts and commitments of the Government of Brunei 
Darussalam in human rights promotion and protection, particularly in shaping pertinent 
social policies to improve the welfare of its citizens. Pakistan was encouraged to note that 
Brunei Darussalam was considering taking the necessary steps to develop technical 
expertise to gain a better understanding of its obligations to ensure effective 
implementation of human rights instruments. Pakistan welcomed the fact that the country 
was in the process of establishing an effective and inclusive mechanism to follow up on 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>669. The United States of America commended Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s enforcement of 
labour statutes protecting workers from abusive employers, and supported the 
recommendation to enforce such statutes to protect immigrant and temporary migrant 
workers. It strongly supported the recommendation to rescind the Sedition Act and the 
Newspaper Act, and appreciated Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s attention to the recommendations to 
allow religious groups to proselytize and practise their beliefs freely. It also expressed 
appreciation for the Government&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations to increase protection 
for women, children and vulnerable groups and underlined the importance of 
recommendations to criminalize all acts of rape and sexual violence against women and 
children. It supported recommendations for the further strengthening of human rights 
infrastructure and training for officials. 
</p>
<p>670. Nepal applauded Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s candid commitment to human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. It appreciated the emphasis on inter-religious and inter-ethnic 
harmony, and traditional family values as the fundamentals of social fabric. It noted Brunei 
Darussalam&#8217;s policy of providing a healthy environment, quality education, adequate 
housing, food and job security. It was pleased to see developments on the economic, social, 
cultural and political fronts, contributing to the realization of human rights, and 
congratulated Brunei Darussalam on ranking high in the United Nations Human 
Development Index. 
</p>

recommendations and measures taken to follow up on them. It supported the Government&#8217;s 
vision to further develop economic, social and cultural rights to eliminate poverty and 
improve the living standards of its people. China appreciated the attention given to the </p>


<p>rights of vulnerable groups such as children, women and the elderly. It was convinced that 
Brunei Darussalam would continue to work on the basis of the realities of the country and 
make further progress in human rights. 
</p>
<p><i> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>672. Federatie Van Netherlandse Verenigingen Tot Integratie Van Homoseksualiteit 
COC Nederland addressed the recommendation made by a number of States calling for the 
repeal of or amendment to the Penal Code section providing for criminal sanctions against 
&#8220;carnal intercourse against the order of nature&#8221;. It noted that such ambiguous language was 
often used to criminalize sexual activity between same-sex consenting adults, and urged 
Brunei Darussalam to bring its legislation into conformity with international human rights 
standards by repealing such provisions. It noted that legislation criminalizing same-sex 
activities also created a dangerous impediment to the effective prevention and treatment of 
HIV/AIDS, citing figures that HIV transmission could be up to 10 times greater in countries 
with repressive laws against homosexuality, as they made it less likely for gays and lesbians 
to seek treatment. 
</p>
<p><i> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i></p>
<p>673. The delegation of Brunei Darussalam expressed its sincere gratitude to all States 
Members and observers of the Council and to the non-governmental organizations that 
participated in its review. It also thanked the delegations that recognized Brunei 
Darussalam&#8217;s achievements in the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>674. The delegation reiterated that the universal periodic review had been very useful for 
Brunei Darussalam, and stated that it had learned much on the importance of this 
mechanism in promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms through 
the interactive dialogue. The constructive comments and recommendations would help 
Brunei Darussalam further in its efforts to promote and protect the human rights of its 
people. Brunei Darussalam assured that it would continue to work and cooperate with the 
related United Nations bodies, including on matters relating to the rights of women and 
children.  
</p>
<p><b>  Costa Rica  
</b></p>
<p>675. The review of Costa Rica was held on 8 December 2009 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Costa Rica in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/CRI/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/CRI/2);  
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/CRI/3). 
</p>
<p>676. At its 32nd meeting, on 19 March 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Costa Rica (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>677. The outcome of the review on Costa Rica comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/13/15), the views of Costa Rica 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/13/15/Add.1). </p>


<p><i> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions, as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>678. The delegation of Costa Rica thanked Member and observer States for their active 
participation and interest in the universal periodic review of Costa Rica. It wished to 
provide additional information and responses on issues raised during the dialogue, and to 
share its views on the functioning of the review, hoping to contribute in this regard to the 
analysis of the Council as a whole. 
</p>
<p>679. As a country with a long-standing democracy and recognized respect for the human 
rights of its people, Costa Rica stated that the universal periodic review process allowed it 
to undertake an assessment of its reality with an external perception.  
</p>
<p>680. The delegation reiterated Costa Rica&#8217;s firm conviction about the value and potential 
of the universal periodic review, noting in particular the usefulness of the mechanism with 
regard to enriching the debate between countries, the sharing of good practices and the 
contribution to the improvement of human rights situations. Costa Rica supported the view 
that the review mechanism should evolve in order to become a more meaningful and useful 
tool for States under review, in terms of the focus, pertinence and realities of each situation. 
</p>
<p>681. In the internal process of analysis, review and dissemination of the 
recommendations, it became clear to Costa Rica that a good number of recommendations 
referred to situations already or being addressed; others were of a general nature and/or 
were aimed at encouraging Costa Rica to continue in the same direction in the promotion 
and protection of human rights. Costa Rica considered that recommendations should focus 
more on areas where countries might have problems and/or to address gaps in public 
policies. It shared the concern expressed by many States and stakeholders and wished to 
make some suggestions for the universal periodic review to be a more balanced, just and 
effective exercise for all. 
</p>
<p>682. The delegation reported that from the 101 recommendations contained in the 
Working Group report (A/HRC/13/15, paras. 89, 91 and 92), 3 had already been fully 
implemented. These were those referring to the ratification of the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities (para. 89, recommendation 1), submission of the fifth and sixth 
reports to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
(recommendation 11) and the strengthening of criminal legislation with regard to 
trafficking of children and women (recommendation 40). A total of 77 other 
recommendations coincided with decisions and State policies already adopted and were 
already being implemented before the review. These included, for example, some referring 
to the ratification of international instruments, such as the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, which was signed by Costa Rica in 
2007, and for which the legislative approval process had been under way since September 
2009 (recommendation 2). The same applied to the ratification process of the UNESCO 
Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions being 
considered by the Legislative Assembly (recommendation 4). 
</p>
<p>683. With regard to gender issues, Costa Rica provided information on the objectives of 
the inter-institutional/sectoral committee known as Women&#8217;s Legislative Agenda, 
established in 2006, the work of the Women&#8217;s National Institute and the national strategy 
and system to prevent and address violence against women and domestic violence 
(PLANOVI 2010&#8211;2015). 
</p>
<p>684. The delegation also provided information on the national policy for children and 
adolescents for the period 2009&#8211;2021, as well as related legislation to prohibit corporal 
punishment against children approved in 2008, and amendments to the penal legislation 
through the law to strengthen the fight against the sexual exploitation of children. </p>


<p>685. On the issue of trafficking in persons, the delegation referred to important measures 
taken to address the issue, in particular the law for the protection of victims and witnesses, 
as well as a new law on migration, which contemplated the regularization of victims of 
trafficking migration.  
</p>
<p>686. Costa Rica had been a strong advocate of the eradication of torture and other cruel 
and inhumane treatment, according high priority to its prevention. In this regard, the 
national preventive mechanism conducted periodic visits to detention centres, including 
administrative detention centres for irregular migrants. 
</p>
<p>687. Regarding the issue of migrant workers, the delegation referred to the new law on 
migration, which included a human rights perspective, and guaranteed closer supervision of 
enterprises and employers for the effective respect of labour rights, also setting a limit of 24 
hours for the detention of foreigners in irregular situations. 
</p>
<p>688. Costa Rica did not accept two recommendations, 1 and 5 of paragraph 92. The 
delegation explained that it had not, nor would it in the near future consider the ratification 
of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families, as this instrument did not reflect a common interest between 
countries of origin with important migration movements and recipient countries. Costa Rica 
had legislation and jurisprudence that reflected the principles of the Convention, 
guaranteeing the full enjoyment of their rights to migrant workers and their families. It did 
not accept a recommendation which would refer to a provision within the Central American 
regional integration system, as it considered it not to be applicable to the sphere of human 
rights, but more to the regional political framework.  
</p>
<p>689. The delegation referred to the recommendation to ratify the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (para. 92, recommendation 
3), which it had initially not accepted, but did now.  
</p>
<p>690. Costa Rica took note of four recommendations that remained pending (see 
A/HRC/13/15/Add.1). Since the country had recently elected a new president, a number of 
decisions were pending the definition of new policies and actions by the new 
administration. Three of the recommendations related to the rights of homosexuals and 
transgender persons. The fourth referred to granting the same status to all religious 
marriages, which had to be evaluated by the Legislative Assembly, which would have a 
new composition in May 2010.  
</p>
<p>691. Costa Rica stressed that it remained committed to its development model and the 
social rule of law.  
</p>
<p>692. In conclusion, the delegation highlighted Costa Rica&#8217;s commitment to the universal 
periodic review, noting that it was important, within the framework of the review, to 
develop the necessary modalities for the recommendations to be more useful and of a better 
quality. In line with the provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, Costa Rica 
suggested that the troika, with the assistance of OHCHR, should filter and group the 
recommendations better. It suggested the elimination of recommendations on issues already 
implemented, those that referred to issues on the normal functioning of government, those 
that had no relevance to human rights, as well as all congratulatory statements. It was also 
important not to duplicate or replicate recommendations from the treaty bodies and special 
procedures mechanisms. Costa Rica supported the idea put forward by the High 
Commissioner to establish a follow-up mechanism to the universal periodic review 
outcomes, and hoped that more support in this regard would be provided, including to 
systematize the recommendations and to establish follow-up mechanisms.  </p>


<p><i> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i></p>
<p>693. Algeria thanked Costa Rica for providing additional information and for replying to 
recommendations, including those made by Algeria. It noted Costa Rica&#8217;s positive 
approach to the universal periodic review, which demonstrated its commitment to human 
rights. It also noted with appreciation the measures taken by Costa Rica to reduce poverty, 
improve the status of disadvantaged groups, promote the status of women and gender 
equality, as well as the implementation of the right to education of all to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals, and the extension of that right to cover the children of 
irregular migrants.  
</p>
<p>694. The United States of America welcomed Costa Rica&#8217;s decision to support 
recommendations relating to combating trafficking in persons, and the amendment of its 
Penal Code, which defined trafficking as a crime and increased penalties. The United States 
supported Austria&#8217;s recommendations that Costa Rica should continue its efforts to reduce 
all forms of violence against women by providing sufficient resources to the police and the 
judiciary, as well as training to law enforcement officials. It commended Costa Rica for 
having supported recommendations on the strengthening of measures to protect children 
against prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation, the prevention of child labour 
and the prosecution and punishment of perpetrators. Lastly, it commended Costa Rica&#8217;s 
constant engagement with the promotion of human rights and the universal periodic review.  
</p>
<p>695. Nepal commended Costa Rica for its active cooperation with the universal periodic 
review process and for further explaining its position regarding several recommendations. It 
noted with appreciation that in the State&#8217;s Constitution, human rights took precedence over 
other regulations. It praised Costa Rica for its recognized human rights record as well as for 
public investment in social sectors. Free education, health care and programmes focused on 
disabled persons were also noteworthy. Nepal praised Costa Rica for its experience in 
fighting poverty.  
</p>
<p>696. Morocco welcomed the exemplary cooperation of Costa Rica in accepting almost all 
recommendations.<b> </b>Morocco noted with satisfaction that two of its recommendations 
relating to human rights education and to development were among those the 
implementation of which had already started. It congratulated Costa Rica on its success in 
the review, and encouraged it to continue its cooperation with international human rights 
bodies. Morocco shared Costa Rica&#8217;s view regarding the lack of clarity of some 
recommendations, an issue to be addressed during the review process. 
</p>
<p><i> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>697. The European Region of the International Lesbian and Gay Federation<b> </b>congratulated 
Costa Rica on having accepted recommendations to join the 2008 General Assembly 
statement on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity and to pursue efforts to 
favour LGBT people. It was encouraged by Costa Rica&#8217;s decision to allocate sufficient 
resources to its preventive mechanism within the framework of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture. It encouraged Costa Rica to accept recommendations to 
intensify measures for the protection of sexual orientation and identity and to facilitate the 
issuance of identification documents to transsexuals. It also encouraged Costa Rica to 
accept the recommendation to address discriminations against homosexuals and transgender 
persons. It commended Costa Rica for its support to OAS resolution on sexual orientation, 
gender identity and human rights. 
</p>
<p><i> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i></p>
<p>698. Costa Rica thanked States and other stakeholders participating in the process. The 
delegation reiterated its commitment to the work of the Council and to find ways to make </p>


<p>the universal periodic review an effective and useful tool, with a view to implementing the 
human rights agenda in individual countries. It remained committed to continue working 
with the Council in this regard.  
</p>
<p><b>  Equatorial Guinea 
</b></p>
<p>699. The review of Equatorial Guinea was held on 9 December 2009 in conformity with 
all the relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Equatorial Guinea in accordance with the 
annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/GNQ/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/GNQ/2);  
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/GNQ/3). 
</p>
<p>700. At its 32nd meeting, on 19 March 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Equatorial Guinea (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>701. The outcome of the review on Equatorial Guinea comprises the report of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/13/16), the views of Equatorial 
Guinea concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary 
commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in 
the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><i> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions, as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>702. The delegation recalled that, during its review by the Working Group in December 
2009, the Government of Equatorial Guinea made a detailed report to the Council on the 
human rights situation in the country and endeavoured to show its unequivocal commitment 
to the ideals and values of the promotion and protection of the rights inherent to human 
dignity.  
</p>
<p>703. During the interactive dialogue, delegations had expressed their recognition of the 
achievements regarding the promotion and protection of human rights and made 
recommendations. Equatorial Guinea committed itself to study each and every 
recommendation carefully, with the will to implement them.  
</p>
<p>704. A total of 86 recommendations (75 per cent of the total number of 
recommendations) had already been included in the Government&#8217;s plan of action on this 
matter. The plan was an incentive that would undoubtedly encourage the Government to 
redouble its efforts to implement the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>705. The legal process needed for the possible incorporation into national law of the 
majority of human rights international treaties not yet ratified by Equatorial Guinea had 
been triggered, in particular with regard to the International Convention for the Protection 
of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, the Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families.  
</p>
<p>706. The authorities had redoubled their efforts to effectively enforce the law against 
torture, bringing to justice the alleged perpetrators of acts of torture. In some cases, trials 
were still ongoing, and in others, sentences had been passed, some of which had been made </p>


<p>available to the Council. The delegation emphasized that the effective implementation of 
the law against torture was a political priority for the Government of Equatorial Guinea.  
</p>
<p>707. The delegation stressed that a number of political and legal measures aimed at 
combating discrimination against women were in an advanced stage of preparation and 
would be approved once finalized. The delegation drew attention to a bill against gender 
violence recently drafted and presented by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Promotion of 
Women.  
</p>
<p>708. The process to approve a criminal code in line with modern standards had been 
initiated. It would replace the current code inherited from colonial times.  
</p>
<p>709. The institutional mechanism to protect and shelter minors in need had been 
reinforced within the framework of the general policy of the promotion of the rights of the 
child. Access to public subsidies by the relevant specialized associations had been made 
flexible.  
</p>
<p>710. Many other measures were being developed and taken in line with the 
recommendations received. As an example, the delegation mentioned the areas of the 
freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of association, detention conditions, 
the judiciary, juvenile delinquency and the eradication of poverty.  
</p>
<p>711. With regard to the remaining recommendations, their possible incorporation into the 
plan of action of the Government would continue to be carefully studied, considering the 
concrete circumstances of the country. The Government had accepted all universal periodic 
review recommendations received, except for three of them, namely, one on the ratification 
of the statute of the International Criminal Court, one on the ratification of the Optional 
Protocol to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on the abolition of the death penalty 
and one on granting access to the Special Rapporteur on torture to military facilities. The 
Government had serious difficulties on a legal and a social conscience basis with these 
three recommendations, and therefore it was not able to accept them.  
</p>
<p>712. In conclusion, the delegation renewed its readiness to continue working, with the 
technical assistance and cooperation of the Council and OHCHR, for the elimination of the 
legal, institutional, political, economic, social and cultural obstacles that continued to 
prevent or limit the full enjoyment of internationally and nationally recognized human 
rights in Equatorial Guinea.  
</p>
<p><i> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i></p>
<p>713. Algeria noted with satisfaction the endorsement by Equatorial Guinea of many 
recommendations, including all those made by Algeria, which reflected its commitment to 
promote and protect human rights. It appreciated measures to reduce poverty and achieve 
the Millennium Development Goals, and referred in particular to the free education system 
ensuring compulsory primary education. Algeria appreciated the efforts made to promote 
women and their participation in decision-making processes, as well as the measures taken 
to facilitate their access to justice. 
</p>
<p>714. Cuba commended Equatorial Guinea for accepting the majority of the 
recommendations. Despite being a developing country, victim of the unjust international 
economic order, Equatorial Guinea had made advances in areas such as education, health, 
the promotion of gender equality and the protection of children. Cuba stressed also the 
efforts made in the areas of infrastructure building, social accommodation, drinking water, 
energy, telecommunications and access to information. These efforts should be supported 
through cooperation and financial assistance, especially from developed countries. 
</p>
<p>715. The United States of America recognized the steps taken to strengthen the judiciary. 
However, the people of Equatorial Guinea were still denied their human rights by the </p>


<p>judiciary. It encouraged the Government to develop an independent judiciary, end arbitrary 
detention and provide detainees with immediate access to a judicial authority. It also 
encouraged the Government to follow through and seek assistance on the implementation 
of recommendations relating to ending the use of torture, eliminating impunity and 
reforming the penal, law enforcement and judicial systems. It urged the Government to 
accept the recommendation calling to stop the requirement for non-governmental 
organizations to seek approval from and report to the Ministry of the Interior, and to 
reconsider the recommendation to allow political parties and the media to operate freely. 
</p>
<p>716. China took note of the Government&#8217;s positive attitude to present the efforts and 
difficulties faced in ensuring human rights, and of Equatorial Guinea&#8217;s political will to 
further protect human rights. It also took note of the acceptance of most of the 
recommendations. China appreciated the commitment of the Government to the universal 
periodic review follow-up, and expressed its support to Equatorial Guinea&#8217;s continued 
efforts to combat poverty, raise living standards, improve the quality of education and 
provide better health care. China expressed its hope that the international community would 
help the Government to address its challenges and achieve progress in human rights. 
</p>
<p>717. Senegal welcomed the acceptance of the recommendations regarding the realization 
of economic and social rights, in particular access to education and combating maternal 
mortality and poverty. It congratulated the Government on its efforts to improve the 
condition of women and children, as well as its relations with civil society. It appealed to 
the relevant institutions to provide technical support to Equatorial Guinea in its initiatives to 
promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>718. Morocco appreciated Equatorial Guinea&#8217;s sincere commitment to the universal 
periodic review and the acceptance of its recommendation regarding the strengthening of 
synergy and coordination among the various national human rights institutions. Equatorial 
Guinea&#8217;s resolve to respect its international human rights commitments should be supported 
by the international community, which should work with this country to identify ways and 
means to ensure sustainable development for the people. Morocco reiterated its full support 
for Equatorial Guinea&#8217;s efforts to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>719. Cameroon welcomed the efforts made by Equatorial Guinea to promote and protect 
human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights, namely through the 
establishment of free primary education and the progress in women and children&#8217;s rights. 
Cameroon encouraged Equatorial Guinea to implement all the recommendations accepted. 
It called on the Council and the community of the United Nations to provide Equatorial 
Guinea with strengthened technical assistance to ensure better human rights protection in 
the country. 
</p>
<p>720. The Congo appreciated the acceptance of the majority of recommendations and 
welcomed the support for the question of the promotion and protection of the rights of 
women and children and the fight against cultural stereotypes and customs that hinder the 
full enjoyment of women&#8217;s rights. By renewing its commitment to work closely with 
human rights mechanisms, Equatorial Guinea showed its keenness to promote and protect 
human rights. The Congo called on the international community to provide the necessary 
technical assistance to the Government for the implementation of the recommendations.   
</p>
<p><i> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>721. The International Commission of Jurists expressed its support for the 
recommendations calling on the Government of Equatorial Guinea to guarantee the 
independence of the judiciary through institutional and legal reforms to put an end to the 
culture of impunity. The protection of human rights would not be possible if lawyers were 
attacked in representing their clients. The Government&#8217;s acceptance of the </p>


<p>recommendations to address the lack of judicial independence was a first positive step. The 
Commission highlighted the fact that the fulfilment of the Government&#8217;s human rights 
obligations would require guaranteeing the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>722. The Open Society Institute noted Equatorial Guinea&#8217;s support for recommendations 
to combat corruption and improve accountability and transparency. The Government had to 
be encouraged to fully carry out these recommendations. It urged the Government to 
monitor and report, in consultation with civil society, on progress made in relation to the 
implementation of recommendations, in particular the extension of transparency principles 
to the budgetary process, the publication of the national budget, the clear identification of 
foreign bank accounts, verifiable declaration of assets by Government representatives and 
accession to the United Nations Convention against Corruption. 
</p>
<p>723. The Centre for Economic and Social Rights noted that the Government should 
implement recommendations calling for the distribution of national resources to eradicate 
poverty and guarantee economic and social rights to the entire population. Implementation 
should be accompanied by the establishment of an international and national monitoring 
system, with the participation of civil society. It regretted the rejection of recommendations 
regarding the implementation of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders and the 
elimination of requirements for legalizing non-governmental organizations. It encouraged 
the Government to ratify the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, and to issue a standing invitation to special procedures mandate 
holders. 
</p>
<p>724. Human Rights Watch noted that the universal periodic review had served to 
highlight the conditions of repression and deprivation in Equatorial Guinea. The 
Government had failed to engage with civil society in the universal periodic review process 
and used, inter alia, burdensome non-governmental organization registration and reporting 
requirements to hinder the capacity of civil society to engage in human rights. There was no 
legally registered human rights group in the country. It acknowledged that the Government 
had accepted many of the recommendations, but noted with concern that promises made in 
the past had failed to affect the Government&#8217;s behaviour. It highlighted the need for follow-
up mechanisms with civil society participation and international monitoring to translate the 
recommendations into action. 
</p>
<p>725. Rencontre africaine pour la promotion des droits de l&#8217;homme welcomed the 
acceptance of most of the recommendations, but regretted that the authorities had not 
authorized the Special Rapporteur on torture to visit detention centres to investigate real 
detention conditions and the inhumane treatment inflicted upon certain politicians and 
opponents to the authorities. Several human rights defenders and press organs had paid a 
heavy price for their commitment to open the country to democratic processes. It called on 
Equatorial Guinea to guarantee the independence of the judiciary and the national human 
rights commission, authorize without unjustified restriction the registration of human rights 
organizations and commit to human rights awareness-raising and education. 
</p>
<p>726. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network commended Equatorial Guinea for 
accepting the majority of the recommendations. It welcomed the acceptance of the 
recommendation in support of human rights education and training, which would help 
ensure that authorities would be able to respond more effectively to the needs of all 
members of society, including women, children and those who had been marginalized 
because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It encouraged Equatorial Guinea to 
take steps to ensure that there was no legal and social discrimination on these grounds. 
</p>
<p>727. Amnesty International welcomed the support of the Government for a number of 
recommendations, including on ending the practice of abducting Equatorial Guineans 
exiled in neighbouring countries, which were relevant in the light of reports of the </p>


<p>abduction in late January 2010 of four Equatorial Guineans from a neighbouring country. It 
acknowledged the reduction in reported instances of torture, but noted that the practice 
persisted. Amnesty International urged the Government to allow access to places of 
detention for lawyers and national and international human rights monitors, including the 
Special Rapporteur on torture. It called on reconsidering the rejection of the 
recommendation to allow political parties and the media to operate freely. 
</p>
<p>728. Human Rights First noted that violence against women remained a common practice 
and that the Government had not made significant progress to end the gender gap. Ethnic 
minorities were underrepresented and excluded from meaningful participation in political 
and economic affairs. It acknowledged the Government&#8217;s support for recommendations to 
remedy these ongoing abuses and hoped that they were not, like in the past, empty 
promises. It urged the members of the Council to ensure that the Government work with 
civil society, take steps to end ethnic and gender-based discrimination and promote freedom 
of expression, opinion and the press. 
</p>
<p>729. Conectas Direitos Humanos noted that the Government had not involved any 
independent non-governmental organization in the universal periodic review process. While 
there were fewer restrictions than in the past, many civil society organizations were unable 
to have their legal status recognized. It called for the implementation of recommendations 
on creating an environment conducive to the establishment and functioning of non-
governmental organizations, and promoting dialogue with civil society and the participation 
of all civil society groups in the implementation of the Iniciativa de Transparencia en la 
Industria Extractiva. It also called on the Council to promote and monitor the 
implementation of the recommendations.  
</p>
<p><i> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i></p>
<p>730. The delegation had listened in good faith to every statement and would make every 
effort to implement the suggestions thereon. For that purpose, it called for technical 
assistance and was committed to inform the Council regularly on new human rights 
developments. The delegation concluded by reiterating the sincere political will of 
Equatorial Guinea to promote and protect human rights.   
</p>
<p><b>  Ethiopia 
</b></p>
<p>731. The review of Ethiopia was held on 9 December 2009 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Ethiopia in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/ETH/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/ETH/2);  
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/ETH/3). 
</p>
<p>732. At its 33rd meeting, on 19 March 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Ethiopia (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>733. The outcome of the review on Ethiopia comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/13/17), the views of Ethiopia concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/13/17/Add.1). </p>


<p><i> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions, as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>734. The delegation stated that, by actively participating in the review, the Government 
had demonstrated its readiness to cooperate with United Nations human rights mechanisms. 
It appreciated the questions, comments and recommendations. Some recommendations had 
required further consideration and deliberation among relevant authorities.  
</p>
<p>735. Ethiopia was encouraged that many delegations had appreciated, inter alia, the 
federal arrangement which allowed for greater protection of diverse nations, nationalities 
and peoples, the strengthening of democratic and human rights institutions, the human 
rights education policy and the generous refugee policy. Delegations had also highlighted 
Ethiopia&#8217;s efforts to broaden freedom of expression by issuing licences to a number of 
press outlets, encouraged the continued expansion of social services, welcomed efforts to 
reduce child and maternal mortality and supported the food security policy.  
</p>
<p>736. On 7 March 2010, the Council of Ministers had recommended that the House of 
Peoples Representatives should consider ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities. Ethiopia therefore accepted this recommendation; the ratification of one 
of the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child was also considered 
favourably. Furthermore, Ethiopia pledged to consider the ratification of additional 
instruments to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Ethiopia was also committed to 
signing the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance and was considering its ratification in due course. 
</p>
<p>737. Ethiopia had one of the most progressive constitutions, particularly in ensuring 
cultural diversity. The delegation admitted that, occasionally, resource competition, 
particularly in the lowlands of the country, had triggered communal tension and conflicts. 
Measures at the federal and local levels had been taken to find an effective solution to these 
conflicts, including by the House of Federation and the Ministry of Federal Affairs. 
Ethiopia therefore considered favourably the recommendation requesting the Government 
to strengthen efforts made to address the causes of ethnic conflicts. 
</p>
<p>738. Regarding the recommendation to raise the minimum age for criminal responsibility, 
the revised federal criminal code stipulated that different categories, namely of youths 9&#8211;15 
and 15&#8211;18 years of age, may assume certain responsibilities. Reforming criminal law would 
require deliberate consideration, which Ethiopia would continue to undertake. 
</p>
<p>739. The delegation stated that, contrary to some unfounded allegations, Ethiopia had a 
well-disciplined national army. Legislation provided for the minimum age for recruitment, 
and the armed forces did not recruit children below the age of 18 years. Regular training 
had been held, often in cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross, to 
train the national defence force in human rights and humanitarian law. Necessary 
constitutional and legal frameworks ensured civilian control of the military. In a few cases 
where credible cases indicated a possible involvement of individual members of the 
military in human rights violations, the Government had taken unequivocal steps, including 
the creation of an independent inquiry. In the case of the conflict in Gambella in 2003, the 
outcome of that inquiry had resulted in the criminal prosecution of some members of the 
defence forces. While these exceptional situations were swiftly handled, the Government 
found it difficult to accept recommendations implying that members of the defence forces 
often violated human rights with impunity.  
</p>
<p>740. The Government had taken measures to ensure that the upcoming elections were 
free and fair. Both the ruling party and most opposition parties had signed a code of </p>


<p>conduct. A free and unrestricted political campaign, based on a mutually agreed framework 
on a fair and equitable use of publicly owned media, had already commenced. An 
independent and well-funded national electoral board had been established. Vibrant private 
media were engaged in the process, and the Government had invited international observers 
to observe the elections.  
</p>
<p>741. Ethiopia referred to questions raised on laws regarding the media, non-governmental 
organizations and charities, and combating terrorism. While willing to engage in dialogue, 
the Government had found no merit in recommendations to repeal laws for which enormous 
resources had been spent to articulate and were considered vital. Sufficient time should be 
given to the implementation of these laws to identify possible gaps, if any, and consider 
how these gaps could be filled. Some of the criticisms expressed with respect to the 
proclamation on charities and societies were quite unfounded. All existing non-
governmental organizations had been registered without any restrictions, in line with the 
procedures of the proclamation. The Government believed that the civil society law helped 
to further implement international norms and principles governing the role of human rights 
defenders, including the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.  
</p>
<p>742. The delegation addressed questions raised regarding the &#8220;detention and arrest of 
prisoners&#8221;, including the case of Birtukan Midekssa, who was among a number of 
opposition leaders arrested in 2005 and released after being granted a conditional pardon in 
line with proclamation 395/2004. While Ms. Midekssa had chosen to publicly proclaim that 
she had never requested a pardon, relevant Government officials, consistent with the 
procedure for revocation of pardon as stipulated in the proclamation, had given sufficient 
warning and opportunity for Ms. Midekssa to rectify her statement. 
</p>
<p>743. With regard to recommendations to abolish the death penalty, pursuant to the revised 
federal criminal code, the death penalty was only applied for exceptionally grave crimes, 
and actual executions rarely occurred, amounting to a de facto moratorium.  
</p>
<p>744. The Federal Constitution explicitly guaranteed the right of the child to be free from 
corporal punishment. The Criminal Code provided for measures and penalties applicable to 
young persons, and these enumerations did not include corporal punishment.  
</p>
<p>745. The delegation recalled that Ethiopia was unable to accept only a small number of 
recommendations. It emphasized that not being able to accept for the time being some 
recommendations did not necessarily amount to reservations or policy pronouncements cast 
in stone. The Government&#8217;s position was to continue to study and consider seriously all 
recommendations, and had taken note of the recommendations in question.  
</p>
<p>746. While highlighting the fact that many shortcomings stemmed from 
underdevelopment and poverty, the delegation stated that the Government continued, 
nevertheless, to improve its capacity even further. It accepted all recommendations calling 
for greater collaboration with OHCHR. In this regard, a national consultative workshop on 
devising a road map for the development of a national action plan for the promotion and 
protection of human rights in Ethiopia had been held in Addis Ababa on 15 March 2010, 
organized by the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission in collaboration with the OHCHR 
Regional Office for East Africa. Specific measures would be taken as a follow-up to the 
recommendations of the workshop, which had enjoyed the participation of all levels of 
Government, national human rights institutions, members of civil society and other 
stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>747. According to the delegation, the review process had proven an important venue for 
the assessment of human rights performance, and hoped that all engaged would continue to 
support endeavours to implement the outcome.  </p>


<p><i> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i></p>
<p>748. Algeria<b> </b>thanked Ethiopia for the additional information provided and welcomed 
Ethiopia&#8217;s acceptance of a number of recommendations. Algeria encouraged the 
Government to continue poverty reduction efforts, while acknowledging that this 
represented a major challenge for many developing countries. Algeria welcomed the 
continuous progress made in the realization of economic, social and cultural rights and the 
Government&#8217;s determination to persevere in protecting and promoting human rights.  
</p>
<p>749. Cuba<b> </b>congratulated Ethiopia on having accepted many recommendations. It 
highlighted Ethiopia&#8217;s advances in health, education and culture, and with regard to persons 
with disabilities, children and women, areas that had been affected by the world financial 
and economic crisis. One way of implementing human rights programmes was through 
support, cooperation and financial assistance from countries of the developed world. Cuba 
congratulated Ethiopia on the results achieved to date and urged it to continue its efforts.   
</p>
<p>750. Pakistan<b> </b>was encouraged by the fact that Ethiopia had accepted most 
recommendations and was willing to implement them with the involvement of all 
stakeholders. Pakistan appreciated the efforts made to improve the quality of life by 
introducing relevant social and economic policies, which would ensure sustainable 
development. The international community should extend support in this regard. Pakistan 
commended Ethiopia&#8217;s readiness to consider ratifying a number of human rights 
instruments, which would improve its national human rights infrastructure.  
</p>
<p>751. Canada<b> </b>appreciated Ethiopia&#8217;s acceptance to formulate a national plan of action on 
human rights and to strengthen the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, but was deeply 
concerned by its refusal to amend the 2009 charities and societies proclamation. It 
expressed disappointment at Ethiopia&#8217;s refusal to release imprisoned opposition party 
members and to allow their participation in the May 2010 election. It welcomed the 
continued efforts made to address female genital mutilation. Canada urged Ethiopia to 
consider becoming a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and the 
optional protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women.  
</p>
<p>752. China<b> </b>stated that Ethiopia had adopted a positive approach in presenting its 
achievements and challenges, and had conducted a constructive dialogue. It was pleased 
that Ethiopia had accepted most recommendations and was preparing for the follow-up. It 
hoped that Ethiopia would make greater progress in the areas of poverty reduction, health 
and education, and reach the Millennium Development Goals at an early date. China was 
convinced that Ethiopia would implement in earnest the universal periodic review outcome 
and make real headway in the human rights field. 
</p>
<p>753. Djibouti welcomed the willingness demonstrated by Ethiopia to promote and protect 
human rights. It also welcomed the fact that most recommendations had been accepted. 
Djibouti looked forward to continuing its cooperation with Ethiopia, with a view to 
protecting and promoting human rights, and the rights to peace, international solidarity and 
regional security in the Horn of Africa. 
</p>
<p>754. The Congo congratulated Ethiopia on its commitment to implement the 
recommendations concerning the signing and ratification of several international 
instruments, and the recommendations related to combating sexual violence committed by 
members of the armed forces. It noted with satisfaction that Ethiopia had accepted to 
increase efforts in the area of women&#8217;s rights and had accepted most other 
recommendations. It encouraged Ethiopia to continue the dialogue with the Council with a 
view to strengthening respect for human rights. </p>


<p>755. Morocco welcomed Ethiopia&#8217;s openness throughout the process and its acceptance 
of a large number of recommendations, including with regard to the signing and ratification 
of a number of international human rights treaties. It expressed satisfaction at Ethiopia&#8217;s 
long-standing positive approach to promoting the principles of tolerance, coexistence and 
respect for religious freedom and cultural diversity. Morocco welcomed Ethiopia&#8217;s 
intention to elaborate a national plan of action for the promotion and realization of human 
rights, including through the implementation of the universal periodic review outcome. 
</p>
<p>756. Italy<b> </b>welcomed Ethiopia&#8217;s acceptance of most recommendations, and had noted the 
explanations given. It recalled that it was in the interest of States under review to provide a 
clear status of recommendations accepted and not accepted, since this was also necessary 
for a meaningful follow-up. Italy hoped that Ethiopia would reconsider its position on the 
death penalty and encouraged it to apply a legal moratorium with a view to its abolition. 
Italy also looked forward to a more positive working environment for civil society and non-
governmental organizations.  
</p>
<p>757. Saudi Arabia noted that Ethiopia had demonstrated its commitment to human rights 
by accepting most recommendations and by cooperating with all mechanisms and 
procedures of the United Nations human rights system. Ethiopia&#8217;s commitment was also 
shown by its willingness to continue international cooperation and constructive dialogue.  
</p>
<p>758. Botswana<b> </b>stated that Ethiopia&#8217;s commitment to meet its human rights obligations 
was evident from the constructive engagement during the review, the information provided 
and the many recommendations accepted. Ethiopia had clearly acknowledged the 
challenges and accepted all recommendations relating to collaboration with relevant 
institutions to continue endeavours in the promotion and protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>759. Cameroon welcomed Ethiopia&#8217;s efforts, particularly those to combat all forms of 
discrimination through legislative amendments aimed at reducing gender inequality, 
including amendments to the family law enabling women to enjoy the same rights as men 
in marriage and child custody matters. Cameroon welcomed Ethiopia&#8217;s acceptance of 
recommendations, many of which were already being implemented. Cameroon called on 
the Council and the international community to work towards increasing technical 
assistance to strengthen human rights protection in Ethiopia. 
</p>
<p>760. The Russian Federation expressed its satisfaction at the comprehensive presentation 
and the detailed comments on the recommendations. It welcomed the constructive approach 
of the delegation during the consideration of the report by the Working Group and at the 
present session. It highlighted the high quality of the national report submitted, in which 
Ethiopia had approached all issues covered by the review with great sincerity. 
</p>
<p><i> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>761. Human Rights Watch expressed disappointment at Ethiopia&#8217;s rejection of important 
recommendations. The environment for independent voices, such as those of human rights 
defenders, had dramatically worsened, and reversing this trend should be a major priority 
throughout the implementation of the universal periodic review outcome. It urged Ethiopia 
to amend the charities and societies proclamation, which violated the Constitution and had 
resulted in broader governmental hostility towards independent civil society. It called for 
the immediate and unconditional release of political opposition members. The security 
forces continued to commit serious abuses, and it therefore called for an investigation by 
United Nations special procedures and other independent investigators.  
</p>
<p>762. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies stated that the Government was failing 
to protect the rights of human rights defenders, and that intimidation of defenders was 
widespread. The proclamation on charities and societies was restrictive and already had a 
significant impact on the ground, and the anti-terrorism proclamation contained a very </p>


<p>broad definition of what constituted encouragement of terrorism and terrorist acts. It called 
on the Government to respect and promote the rights of human rights defenders, notably by 
significantly amending these laws. It asked whether the Government would be willing to 
extend an invitation to the special rapporteurs on the situation of human rights defenders 
and on the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>763. Amnesty International urged Ethiopia to review the rejection of recommendations to 
amend the charities and societies proclamation, as well as the rejection of amending the 
anti-terrorism proclamation to make it consistent with international human rights standards. 
It welcomed the acceptance of the recommendations to upgrade land and water resources 
and to request technical assistance in relation to education, health, housing and food 
security. It encouraged Ethiopia to facilitate the visits of the Special Rapporteur on torture 
and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, requested in 
2005 and 2008 respectively.  
</p>
<p>764. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network stated that the criminal prohibitions on 
sexual activity between consenting adults of the same sex under article 629 of the Penal 
Code were a violation of established international human rights law. It urged Ethiopia to 
repeal legislative provisions that criminalized sexual activity between consenting adults of 
the same sex. It also urged Ethiopia to take measures to recognize and protect the rights of 
sexual and gender minorities, and to extend HIV intervention programmes in this regard.  
</p>
<p>765. Interfaith International congratulated Ethiopia on the institutional reforms 
undertaken in recent years, and encouraged it to engage in a sincere dialogue to consider 
the possibility of implementing recommendations that it had not accepted. It recalled that, 
after the parliamentary elections in 2005, many cases of violence, torture and arrests of 
protesters had taken place. Interfaith International called upon Ethiopia to shed light on the 
grave violation of human rights committed against demonstrators, and encouraged it to 
conduct an investigation with a view to prosecuting all those responsible for crimes and 
grave violations of human rights during the prior administration.  
</p>
<p>766. The World Alliance for Citizen Participation (CIVICUS) regretted that Ethiopia was 
unwilling to repeal or amend the recently enacted civil society law, and urged it to 
reconsider its rejection of recommendations 23 to 27. This law violated Ethiopia&#8217;s 
obligations under international human rights law. The impact of this law was that many 
human rights organizations had abandoned their work or had ceased to exist. It referred to 
the code of conduct for political parties, and stated that one of the leading opposition parties 
had been left out of the negotiations on the code, but had raised issues of the fairness of the 
electoral platform.  
</p>
<p><i> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i></p>
<p>767. The delegation appreciated the positive comments and observations, which would 
encourage Ethiopia to persevere in the promotion and protection of human rights. 
Regarding the non-governmental organizations that had spoken, it could not reply because 
they were outside the rules of procedure of the Council with regard to the universal periodic 
review. The issues should have been raised under other agenda items, so the delegation 
would not respond to them. The delegation regarded some of the non-governmental 
organizations as well-known detractors. It had asked them to be fair, objective and 
constructive, but this had repeatedly failed. The delegation thanked the non-governmental 
organizations that had made constructive comments.  
</p>
<p>768. In closing, the delegation stressed that, in general, it would take all 
recommendations into consideration. It took note of all recommendations, including those 
that, for the time being, it had rejected, but which would be further studied. With regard to 
the recommendations on the two optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the </p>


<p>Child, the Government had taken note of both and was favourably inclined to ratifying one 
of them.  
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>  Administrative and programme budget implications of 
resolutions adopted by the Council at its thirteenth session 
</b></p>
<p><b>  13/4. 
The right to food 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraphs 36 and 38 of draft resolution A/HRC/13/L.17 (adopted as resolution 
13/4), the Human Rights Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decided to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food 
for a period of three years, to continue to work in accordance with the mandate established 
by the Council in its resolution 6/2; 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to continue to provide all necessary human and financial resources for 
the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>2. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, $55,800 per annum or 
$111,600 per biennium would be required to implement the activities. 
</p>
<p>3. The estimated requirements of $111,600 have been included under section 23 of the 
programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. Since the period of the terms of the draft 
resolution extends into the biennium 2012&#8211;2013, it is considered that the requirements for 
that period will be met within the provisions to be included in the proposed programme 
budget for the biennium 2012&#8211;2013. No additional appropriations would be required as a 
result of the adoption of the draft resolution. 
</p>
<p>4. With regard to paragraph 38, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. 
</p>
<p><b>  13/9. 
Follow-up to the report of the United Nations Independent 
International Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict 
</b></p>
<p>5. In paragraphs 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 15 of draft resolution A/HRC/13/L.30 (adopted 
as resolution 13/9), the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decided to establish a committee of independent experts in international 
humanitarian and human rights laws to monitor and assess any domestic, legal or other 
proceedings undertaken by both the Government of Israel and the Palestinian side in 
accordance with General Assembly resolution 64/254, including the independence, 
effectiveness, genuineness of these investigations and their conformity with international 
standards; 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested the High Commissioner to appoint the members of the committee 
of independent experts and to provide them with all the administrative, technical and </p>


<p>logistical assistance required to enable them to fulfil their mandate promptly and 
efficiently; 
</p>
<p> (c) Requested the committee of independent experts to present its report to the 
Council at its fifteenth session; 
</p>
<p> (d) Requested the Secretary-General to transmit all the information submitted by 
the Government of Israel and the Palestinian side pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 of General 
Assembly resolution 64/254 to the committee of independent experts; 
</p>
<p> (e) Also requested the Secretary-General to present a comprehensive report on 
the progress made in the implementation of the recommendations of the Fact-Finding 
Mission by all concerned parties, including United Nations bodies, in accordance with 
paragraph 3 of section B of Council resolution S-12/1, to the Council at its fifteenth 
session; 
</p>
<p> (f) Requested the High Commissioner to present a report on the implementation 
of the resolution to the Council at its fifteenth session; 
</p>
<p> (g) Also requested the High Commissioner to submit to the Council, at its 
fourteenth session, a progress report on the implementation of the present resolution. 
</p>
<p>6. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, an estimated additional 
amount of $531,100 would be required to provide for pre-session documentation and 
interpretation, travel of the experts and staff, general temporary assistance for one and a 
half months and general operating expenses to implement the activities called for, as 
follows. 
</p>
<p><i> United States dollars 
</i></p>
<p>Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs 
and Conference Management $169 500 
</p>
<p>Section 23, Human Rights $361 600 
</p>
<p><b>Total $531 100 
</b></p>
<p>7. Provisions have not been made to meet the estimated additional requirements under 
the 2010&#8211;2011 programme budget. Additional resources are not required at this time, 
however, as the Secretariat will, to the extent possible, seek to identify areas from where 
the anticipated additional requirements of $531,100 can be redeployed within the 
provisions approved for sections 2 and 23 for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p>8. The additional requirements of $531,100 to implement the activities called for in the 
draft resolution will be presented to the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session in a 
revised estimates report resulting from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Council, in 
the context of its consideration on the absorption capacity within the approved 
appropriations for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011, or the additional requirements will be subject 
to the procedures that govern the use of the contingency fund for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. </p>


<p><b>  13/11. 
Human rights of persons with disabilities: national implementation and 
monitoring and introducing as the theme for 2011 the role of 
international cooperation in support of national efforts for the 
realization of the rights of persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>9. In paragraphs 10, 11, 13 and 14 of draft resolution A/HRC/13/L.8 (adopted as 
resolution 13/9), the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decided that its next annual interactive debate on the rights of persons with 
disabilities would be held at its sixteenth session; 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) to prepare a study to enhance awareness of the role played by 
international cooperation in support of national efforts for the realization of the purpose and 
objectives of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in consultation with 
relevant stakeholders, including States, regional organizations, including regional 
integration organizations, the Special Rapporteur on Disability of the Commission for 
Social Development, civil society organizations, including organizations of persons with 
disabilities, and national human rights institutions, and requested that the study be made 
available on the OHCHR website, in an accessible format, prior to the sixteenth session of 
the Council; 
</p>
<p> (c) Requested the Secretary-General to continue to ensure that OHCHR, in its 
mandates on the rights of persons with disabilities, and the Committee on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities be adequately resourced for the fulfilment of their tasks; 
</p>
<p> (d) Requested the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner to continue the 
progressive implementation of standards and guidelines for the accessibility of facilities and 
services of the United Nations system, also taking into account relevant provisions of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and underlined that the Council, 
including its Internet resources, should be fully accessible to persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>10. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, it is anticipated that a total 
amount of $50,100 would be required in respect of the provision of sign language 
interpretation and simultaneous text translation and travel of experts to participate in the 
interactive dialogue called for in paragraph 10, as follows. 
</p>
<p><i> United States dollars 
</i></p>
<p>Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs 
and Conference Management $1 600 
</p>
<p>Section 23, Human Rights $48 500 
</p>
<p><b>Total $50 100 
</b></p>
<p>11. The secretariat does not have in-house capacity for specialized translation nor 
international sign language interpretation; however, on the basis of recent experience, it is 
estimated that, for the one-day interactive debate, the cost would amount to $1,600. 
Although provision has not been made in the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;
2011 to provide for the associated costs of the event outlined in paragraph 3 above, the 
secretariat will, to the extent possible, seek to identify areas from where the anticipated 
additional requirements of $50,100 can be redeployed within the provisions approved for 
sections 2 and 23 for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. Hence, additional appropriations would not 
be required as a result of adoption of the draft resolution. </p>


<p>12. With regard to paragraph 11, the requested study would be carried out within 
resources available under section 23 (Human Rights) for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p>13. With regard to paragraph 14 of the draft resolution, it is recalled that, in paragraph 
14 of the report of the Secretary-General on the revised estimates resulting from the entry 
into force of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional 
Protocol thereto (A/63/583), it was stated that comprehensive arrangements in accordance 
with article 9 of the Convention, including standards and guidelines for the accessibility of 
facilities and services by the United Nations system, would be progressively developed. In 
his seventh annual progress report on the implementation of the capital master plan 
(A/64/346), the Secretary-General informed the General Assembly on measures taken to 
eliminate physical communication or technical barriers to persons with disabilities at 
Headquarters. To date, no standards have been established for the production of official 
documentation for persons with sight disabilities, including which languages and/or formats 
of Braille should be utilized. Likewise, standards for simultaneous interpretation for 
persons with hearing disabilities are yet to be formalized, including languages/type of sign 
language interpretation and/or simultaneous text translation. Access to Internet-based 
resources is another question. Until these fundamental issues are addressed so that official 
standards of accessibility for United Nations meetings can be promulgated, measures for 
the implementation of standards and guidelines for accessibility as requested by the Council 
in the draft resolution can only be ad hoc in nature and scope. Determination of the full 
financial implications of a comprehensive programme of accessibility equally requires an 
agreed set of standards for provisions of services to be costed. It is hoped that this issue of 
establishment of standards and guidelines for accessibility will be taken up by the 
Assembly as a matter of priority. 
</p>
<p>14. With regard to paragraph 13, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. 
</p>
<p><b>  13/14. 
Situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea 
</b></p>
<p>15. In paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 of draft resolution A/HRC/13/L.13 (adopted as resolution 
13/14), the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decided to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, in accordance with 
Council resolution 10/16, for a period of one year; 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with all 
the assistance and adequate staffing necessary to carry out his mandate effectively and to 
ensure that the mechanism worked with the support of OHCHR; 
</p>
<p> (c) Invited the Special Rapporteur to submit regular reports on the 
implementation of his mandate to the Council and the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>16. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, a total amount of $60,100 per 
annum would be required under section 23 to support the activities of the Special 
Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>17. The activities and the related requirements of the Special Rapporteur are part of the 
programme of work envisaged under section 23 of the programme budget for the biennium </p>


<p>2010&#8211;2011. No additional appropriations would therefore be required should the draft 
resolution be adopted. 
</p>
<p>18. With regard to paragraph 7, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. 
</p>
<p><b>  13/15. 
United Nations declaration on human rights education and training 
</b></p>
<p>19. In paragraphs 1, 2, 4 and 5 of draft resolution A/HRC/13/L.22 (adopted as resolution 
13/15), the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decided to establish an open-ended intergovernmental working group with 
the mandate of negotiating, finalizing and submitting to the Council the draft United 
Nations Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training on the basis of the draft 
submitted by the Advisory Committee; 
</p>
<p> (b) Also decided that the working group should meet for a maximum of five 
working days before its sixteenth session; 
</p>
<p> (c) Requested OHCHR to provide the working group with the necessary 
assistance for it to fulfil its mandate, including by circulating to all Member States and in 
all official languages of the United Nations the draft declaration contained in the study of 
the Advisory Committee (A/HRC/13/41); 
</p>
<p> (d) Requested the President of the Council to invite the Rapporteur of the 
Advisory Committee drafting group on the draft declaration to participate in the meetings 
of the working group. 
</p>
<p>20. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, an additional $181,200 would 
be required to provide for conference servicing, travel of the Rapporteur of the Advisory 
Committee and general temporary assistance at the P-4 level for one month to implement 
the activities called for under its terms, as follows. 
</p>
<p><i> United States dollars 
</i></p>
<p>Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs 
and Conference Management $154 000 
</p>
<p>Section 23, Human Rights $23 500 
</p>
<p>Section 28 E, Administration, Geneva $3 700 
</p>
<p><b>Total $181 200 
</b></p>
<p>21. Since no provisions have been made to meet the estimated requirements, additional 
resources are not required at this time, as the secretariat will, to the extent possible, seek to 
identify areas whence the anticipated additional requirements of $181,200 can be 
redeployed within the provisions approved for sections 2, 23 and 28 E for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p>22. The additional requirements of $181,200 to implement the activities called for in the 
draft resolution will be presented to the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session in a 
revised estimates report resulting from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Council, in </p>


<p>the context of its consideration on the absorption capacity within the approved 
appropriations for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011, or the additional requirements will be subject 
to the procedures that govern the use of the contingency fund for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p><b>  13/16. 
Combating defamation of religions 
</b></p>
<p>23. In paragraph 21 of draft resolution A/HRC/13/L.1 (adopted as resolution 13/16), the 
Council requested the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to report on all manifestations of 
defamation of religions, and in particular on the ongoing serious implications of 
Islamophobia, on the enjoyment of all rights by their followers, to the Council at its 
fifteenth session. 
</p>
<p>24. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, an amount of $36,000<b> </b>would 
be required under section 23 (Human Rights) for (a) travel of the Special Rapporteur to 
present the report to the Council ($8,000); and (b) general temporary assistance at the P-3 
level for two months ($28,000). 
</p>
<p>25. The requirements for the Special Rapporteur are part of the programme of work 
envisaged under section 23 of the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
Although it is anticipated that an additional sum of $36,000 will be required for the 
programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011 in order for the Special Rapporteur to 
implement the activities called for under the draft resolution, no additional resources are 
requested, as the secretariat will seek to identify areas from which resources can be 
redeployed to meet the requirements within the provisions approved for section 23 for the 
biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p><b>  13/24. 
Protection of journalists in situations of armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>26. In paragraphs 1 and 2 of draft resolution A/HRC/13/L.12 (adopted as resolution 
13/24), the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decided to convene, within existing resources, a panel discussion at its 
fourteenth session on the issue of protection of journalists in armed conflict; 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested OHCHR to liaise with the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) 
and all concerned parties and stakeholders, including relevant press organizations and 
associations and United Nations bodies and agencies, with a view to ensuring their 
participation in the panel discussion. 
</p>
<p>27. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, the participation of the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression in the panel would be 
absorbed within existing resources, as he is scheduled to present his annual report to the 
Council at its fourteenth session. The participation of a Geneva-based representative of 
ICRC will be arranged without financial implications to the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>28. It is estimated, however, that an additional $18,000 would be required in the 
biennium 2010&#8211;2011 for the travel to Geneva of three additional representatives of 
concerned parties and stakeholders, including relevant press organizations and associations 
and United Nations bodies and agencies to sit on the panel. Should the draft resolution be 
adopted by the Council, no additional resources would be requested, as the secretariat will </p>


<p>seek to identify areas from which resources can be redeployed to meet the requirements 
within the provisions approved for section 23 for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p>29. With regard to paragraph 1, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.

<p><b>  13/25. 
Situation of human rights in Myanmar 
</b></p>
<p>30. In paragraphs 20, 22 and 23 of draft resolution A/HRC/13/L.15 (adopted as 
resolution 13/25), the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decided to extend for one year the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar, in accordance with Commission on Human Rights 
resolutions 1992/58 and 2005/10 and Council resolutions 7/32 and 10/27; 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested the Special Rapporteur to submit a progress report to the General 
Assembly at its sixty-fifth session and to the Council in accordance with its annual 
programme of work; 
</p>
<p> (c) Called upon OHCHR to provide the Special Rapporteur with all necessary 
assistance and resources to enable him to discharge his mandate fully. 
</p>
<p>31. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, a total amount of $70,200 per 
annum would be required under section 23 to support the activities of the Special 
Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>32. The activities and related requirements of the Special Rapporteur are part of the 
programme of work envisaged under section 23 of the programme budget for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011. No additional appropriations would therefore be required should the draft 
resolution be adopted. 
</p>
<p>33. With regard to paragraph 23, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. 
</p>
<p><b>  13/117. 
Trafficking in persons, especially women and children 
</b></p>
<p>34. Under the terms of paragraphs (a) and (b) of draft decision A/HRC/13/L.25 (adopted 
as decision 13/117), the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decided to hold a panel discussion at its fourteenth session to give voice to 
victims of trafficking in persons, with due consideration for the psychological well-being of 
the victims involved, with a view to reinforcing the centrality of their human rights and 
needs, and taking into account their recommendations in devising actions to combat human 
trafficking; </p>


<p> (b) Requested OHCHR to organize the panel discussion within existing 
resources, with the participation of the High Commissioner, the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and the victims of trafficking in 
persons. 
</p>
<p>35. It is estimated that an additional sum of $20,300 would be required under section 23 
(Human Rights) in the biennium 2010&#8211;2011 to provide for the travel of five 
victims/survivors of trafficking from five different regions to participate in the panel 
discussion. Additional requirements would not arise for travel of the Special Rapporteur, as 
provision has been made in the 2010&#8211;2011 programme budget. 
</p>
<p>36. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, no additional resources would 
be required, as the secretariat will seek to identify areas from which resources can be 
redeployed to meet the additional requirements of $20,300 within the provisions approved 
for section 23 for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p>37. With regard to paragraph 2, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. </p>
