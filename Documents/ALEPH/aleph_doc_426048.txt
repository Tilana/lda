(1) Cash flow from operations and cash flow from operations per unit are non-GAAP terms that represent cash generated from operating
activities before changes in non-cash working capital and other operating items. The Trust’s cash flow from operations may not be
comparable to other companies. The Trust considers cash flow a key measure of performance as it demonstrates the Trust’s ability to
generate the cash flow necessary to fund future distributions and capital investments.
(2) Number of trust units outstanding includes the conversion of exchangeable shares at the respective exchange ratios in effect at the end
of the reporting periods.
(3) Oil equivalent amounts have been calculated using a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil. BOEs
may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf :1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion
method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.
(4) Reserves information as at December 31, 2005 and 2004 is prepared in accordance with NI 51-101.

2005 was a watershed year. Global supply/demand fundamentals for crude oil,
combined with geopolitical tension in key producing regions of the world,
drove oil prices to unprecedented levels at a breathtaking pace. Benchmark
WTI  crude  oil  began  in  January  around  US$42  per  barrel,  and  climbed
relentlessly to near US$70 per barrel in September. The 2005 average WTI
price of US$56.56 represents a 37 percent increase over the previous record
of US$ 41.40 set one year ago. Natural gas prices in North America traded
in  similar  fashion,  with  NYMEX  futures  averaging  US$8.55  per  Mcf  and
AECO-C spot prices averaging C$8.71 per Mcf during the year, easily eclipsing
all  previous  records.  These  pricing  developments  led  to  apparent  general
acceptance that high energy prices will prevail in the foreseeable future.
Highlights of the Year
Aided by these favourable conditions, Baytex successfully executed a business
plan  that  added  high  quality  assets  with  multi-year  development  potential, 
as  well  as  building  our  financial  strength  to  underpin  future  operations.
Highlights of the year include:
• established multi-year, low-cost development inventory at Seal and Stoddart
for heavy oil and natural gas, respectively;
• acquired complementary heavy oil assets at Celtic at excellent purchase
metrics and added numerous development opportunities;
• completed  a  $100  million  convertible  debentures  financing  which
significantly enhanced Baytex’s financial flexibility;
• increased cash flow from operations by 56 percent to $3.38 per trust unit;
• maintained monthly distributions at $0.15 per trust unit while reducing
payout ratio to 50 percent from 83 percent in 2004;
• achieved  finding  and  development  costs  of  $4.69  per  boe  and  capital
investment recycle ratio of 4.7;
• replaced production by 260 percent;
• grew reserves per trust unit by 13 percent to 1.96 boe;
• improved reserve life index by 21 percent to 11.0 years; and
• enhanced net asset value per trust unit by 103 percent to $19.96.

Successful Capital Programs
Capital expenditures during 2005 totalled $152 million, with $130 million spent
on exploration and development activities and $22 million spent on acquisitions
net of dispositions of assets.
Our internal development program, led by drilling at Stoddart and Seal, was
an unequivocal success. Total expenditures incurred of $130 million, though
relatively  modest  at  57  percent  of  cash  flow  from  operations,  replaced  128
percent  of  our  production  during  the  year.  This  outstanding  program  was
augmented by an excellent acquisition at Celtic, which added 16.5 million boe
of heavy oil and natural gas reserves at $1.33 per boe. Our overall finding and
development  costs  of  $4.69  per  boe  and  capital  investment  recycle  ratio  of 
4.7  should  place  Baytex  amongst  the  best  in  our  industry  in  2005.  More
impressively, we replaced production by 260 percent, increased reserves per 
trust unit by 13 percent and improved reserve life index by 21 percent, all by
spending two-thirds of our cash flow.
The  benefits  of  this  capital  program  will  be  realized  for  years  to  come.  At
Stoddart, we drilled a total of nine wells during the year, resulting in eight
successful natural gas wells with high yields of NGL. Production from this area
has grown to over 4,500 boe/d from the 3,300 boe/d at the time of acquisition
in  December  2004.  Baytex  has  identified  approximately  40  future  drilling
locations in this area, and is planning to drill six of these locations in 2006 to
help sustain our natural gas and NGL production. We will continue to grow
Stoddart through land purchases and seismic activities commensurate with our
increasing knowledge of this area.
At  Seal,  six  horizontal  wells  drilled  in  the  2004/05  winter  were  producing
approximately 500 bbl/d. Two horizontal wells and three vertical stratigraphic
test wells are being drilled this winter to further delineate this land block, on
which Baytex has identified in excess of 100 development locations. Owing to
a lack of production infrastructure, current production is being sold at a large
discount  to  market  prices  for  heavy  oil  in  areas  with  more  developed
infrastructure.  We  are  working  on  improving  our  marketing  arrangements
before embarking on a large scale development program. We are very excited
about the vast potential for development on our 100 sections of land in this
area, and are certain that Seal will anchor our heavy oil production needs for
the coming years.
In September 2005, we purchased 3,500 boe/d of mainly heavy oil production
at Celtic for $69 million. An unsolicited offer in December resulted in Baytex
selling the SAGD production just acquired for $45.3 million. Our decision to

acquire these assets was based on the primary (cold) development opportunities
which have been retained by Baytex. Production from the retained assets has
grown to a current rate of over 3,000 boe/d from the original 1,750 boe/d at
the time of acquisition. An active capital program has been planned for this area
in 2006, including the drilling of 30 wells. This acquisition complements existing
operations in our core area of Tangleflags and provides numerous low cost
development opportunities.
Record Financial Results
Oil  and  gas  production  during  2005  averaged  35,177  boe/d,  an  increase  of 
3 percent over the prior year. Combined with a 25 percent increase in average
wellhead oil price and a 27 percent increase in average wellhead gas price, cash
flow from operations for the year set a record at $227 million, representing an
increase of 67 percent over that of 2004.
The rapid ascent of oil prices from an average of US$31.04 for WTI crude in
2003 to US$56.56 in 2005 resulted in Baytex incurring significant losses from
its hedging program. Losses from WTI derivative contracts in 2005, although
an improvement over the $82 million incurred in 2004, totalled $48 million. With
the expiry of these low price contracts at the end of 2005, Baytex looks forward
to reporting financial results in 2006 that, for the first time since our inception
as an income trust, reflect the true cash flow capacity of our production base.
During the year, Baytex maintained its monthly distributions at $0.15 per unit.
Despite the significant hedging losses incurred, payout ratio in 2005 improved
to 50 percent from 83 percent one year ago. The low payout ratio in 2005
brought our cumulative payout ratio since inception to the end of 2005 to a
more sustainable 65 percent.
Total  debt  at  year-end  2005  was  $418  million,  including  $74  million  of
convertible debentures issued in June 2005, with a conversion price of $14.75
per trust unit. As of the end of February 2006, $45 million of the original issue
of $100 million of these debentures had been tendered for conversion. The
majority  of  our  remaining  debt  is  in  the  form  of  US$  denominated  senior
subordinated  term  notes  maturing  in  2010.  Baytex  has  excellent  financial
flexibility as outstanding revolving bank debt amounts to less than half a year
of current cash flow.
Promising 2006 Outlook
Our  exploration  and  development  capital  budget  for  2006  is  initially  set  at 
$105 million, with 60 percent of it allocated to heavy oil activities and 40 percent
to natural gas and light oil activities. One of our biggest challenges in 2006 is

controlling our cost structure in an inflationary environment caused by record
demand  for  properties  and  services.  Our  production  target  for  the  year  is 
35,000 boe/d, comprising 21,000 bbl/d of heavy oil, 3,800 bbl/d of light oil 
and NGL and 61.2 MMcf/d of natural gas. No acquisition or disposition is
included in this capital budget.
We have increased our monthly distributions in 2006 to $0.18 per unit. Under
current  commodity  prices,  and  with  the  expiry  of  the  low  price  derivative
contracts at the end of 2005, we expect cash flow from operations during 2006
to  be  sufficient  to  fully  fund  our  cash  distributions  and  exploration  and
development capital expenditures. In addition, our financial flexibility will allow
Baytex to continue to pursue other opportunities to further enhance value for
unitholders.
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has approved our application for the
listing of our trust units, with trading expected to commence in late March 2006.
Baytex has been a reporting issuer in the United States since the issuance of
our  senior  subordinated  term  notes.  We  believe  that  the  NYSE  listing  will
improve the trading liquidity of our trust units and further enhance future access
to the capital markets in the United States.
Baytex  trust  units  delivered  a  price  appreciation  and  cash  distribution
combined  return  of  56  percent  during  2005,  ranking  us  as  a  top  quartile
performer  amongst  all  oil  and  gas  royalty  and  income  trusts.  Although  our
returns have outperformed our peer group and all relevant indices since our
inception, our trust unit price is still relatively under-valued based on parameters
such as enterprise value to debt-adjusted cash flow, and trading price to net asset
value.  Accordingly,  with  improving  assets  and  operating  metrics,  as  well  as
continuous prudent financial practices, Baytex is confident that it will again
outperform in 2006.

Growth  was  reflected  in  cash  flow,  production,  and  reserves  additions.  Efficiency  was
demonstrated by industry-leading finding and development costs and capital investment recycle

plus  generating  solid  prospects  for  the  future  in  an  inflationary  climate  are  notable

Our asset portfolio offers a higher degree of diversification by product
type  than  is  typical  of  energy  trusts.  This  diversification  is  valuable
for  risk  management  and,  ultimately,  sustainability.  Approximately

Baytex is organized into two operating districts, Heavy Oil and
Light  Oil/Natural  Gas,  to  develop  specific  expertise  in
production and development of each product type. These two
districts are in turn comprised of a total of nine geographically-
based  operating  teams.  Our  philosophy  is  that,  over  the 
long  term,  success  in  this  industry  will  be  determined  by 
the  ability  of  the  company  to  create  real  value  through
technical  work  on  oil  and  gas  assets.  Accordingly,  Baytex 
has a full complement of technical professionals (engineers,
geoscientists and landmen) staffing each operating team.
Heavy Oil
Maintaining a significant emphasis on heavy oil provides a
number  of  advantages  to  Baytex.  First,  finding  and
development costs are typically lower than for light oil and
natural  gas.  To  a  significant  degree,  this  finding  and
development cost advantage offsets the lower price received
for the heavy oil product. As a result, rates of return on heavy
oil investments are comparable to, or in excess of, rates of
return on light oil and natural gas investments. In addition,
there are  fewer  competitors  with  expertise  and  operating
infrastructure in heavy oil than in light oil and natural gas.
Consequently,  when  considering  heavy  oil  acquisitions  or
mineral leasing opportunities, Baytex has a greater ability to
execute  highly  accretive  transactions  such  as  the  Celtic
acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2005. Finally, because of
the large resource base and low development cost associated
with heavy oil properties, Baytex has the capability to maintain
its  production  and  cash  flow  while  continuing  to  make
significant distributions to unitholders.
Baytex’s  heavy  oil  assets  are  geographically  focused  in  two
areas:  the  Lloydminster  area  straddling  the  Alberta-
Saskatchewan border and the Peace River oil sands area in
northern Alberta. This geographic concentration has allowed
Baytex to develop specific expertise in heavy oil production
in these areas and to maximize operating and infrastructure
economies.

CHIEF  OPERATING
OFFICER
Mr. Marino is responsible
for the oil and gas
operations of the Trust,
providing strategic
direction over the current
and future development 
of Baytex’s asset base.
The Celtic field in southwest Saskatchewan, acquired late in
2005, is typical of Baytex’s approach to heavy oil production.
We buy or discover heavy oil fields with large oil resources
in place and apply our expertise in drilling and producing wells
by  cold  production  methods.  Net  of  divestiture  of  the
thermally-enhanced heavy oil production from this field at
year-end,  Baytex  paid  $23.7  million  for  1,750  boe/d  of
primarily  cold  heavy  oil  production.  After  investing
approximately  $8  million  into  new  wells  and  workovers  of
existing  wells,  production  at  the  end  of  February  2006
increased to over 3,000 boe/d. With 16 million barrels of oil
equivalent proved plus probable reserves, the Celtic field will
be a source of production and cash flow for years to come.
The Seal field in the Peace River oil sands region of northern
Alberta will be another source of production growth for Baytex
over the long term. Seal is a heavy oil field with unusually high
per well productivity and, correspondingly, low development
and operating costs per boe. Early in 2006, Baytex is producing
approximately 500 bbl/d from six wells at Seal. The developed
P E R S P E C T I V E
“Our approach is to apply a full complement 
of technical professionals to each of our major
assets. This technical focus, in concert with the
quality and diversification of our asset base,
creates the potential to fully fund our distri-
butions and capital program out of cash flow
and to generate projects for years to come.”

area encompasses approximately one-half square mile out of
100 square miles of long-term oil sands leases held by Baytex.
Based on the test well data obtained thus far, we estimate that
each square mile averages approximately 50 million barrels of
oil resource in place, of which approximately three percent
may prove recoverable under cold primary recovery methods.
Thermally-enhanced  oil  recovery  processes  could  result  in
considerably  higher  recovery  rates.  As  of  year-end  2005,
Baytex has booked only four million barrels of proved and
probable reserves at Seal. The Seal field provides relatively
low  wellhead  oil  pricing  as  a  result  of  its  distance  from
connections to heavy oil pipelines. However, due to the large
oil resource in the region, infrastructure is rapidly expanding.
Baytex intends to conduct a judiciously-paced development
program, including drilling several delineation wells during
2006, and a larger scale development drilling program in 2007
as pipeline infrastructure reaches the area.
In addition to Celtic and Seal, Baytex has several significant
heavy  oil  properties  in  central  eastern  Alberta  and  central
western Saskatchewan, with production totaling approximately 
17,500  bbl/d  of  oil.  Major  assets  include  the  Ardmore,
Carruthers and Tangleflags fields. These properties have been
key contributors to the Trust since its inception. Their large
heavy oil resource and well-developed operating infrastructure
provide Baytex with ample project inventory to replace heavy
oil production at low unit cost for the foreseeable future.
Light Oil and Natural Gas
Baytex has a growing suite of opportunities in its light oil and
natural  gas  properties.  Over  the  past  two  and  a  half  years,
Baytex has increased its light oil and natural gas production
by 2,000 boe/d to approximately 14,000 boe/d. Moreover, the
geographic  scope  of  our  light  oil  and  gas  operations  has
expanded to include northeast British Columbia, providing
exposure to one of the most prospective areas for natural gas
production in North America.

acquired this gas-concentrated asset producing 3,300 boe/d
in December 2004 for $90 million. Baytex shot a 16 square-
mile, 3D seismic program in 2005 and began a geophysically-
targeted drilling program that has yielded 10 producing wells
at an 83 percent success rate. Since acquisition, Stoddart has
produced operating cash flow of more than $55 million for
Baytex,  and  after  re-investment  of  $30  million,  is  now
producing  4,600  boe/d.  Baytex  has  identified  another  40
drilling locations, providing a multi-year stream of natural gas
investment opportunities.
Baytex has several other focus areas to underpin its light oil
and  natural  gas  production.  In  northern  Alberta,  Baytex
conducted a 10-well drilling program in winter-only access
areas  during  the  winter  of  2005/2006.  In  central  Alberta,
Baytex initiated a coalbed methane delineation program in
both  the  Horseshoe  Canyon  and  Mannville  formations
which we expect will ultimately provide a large inventory of
high reserve life index investment opportunities.
New Ventures
Baytex has initiated a grassroots exploration program to add
new field areas, primarily targeting light oil and natural gas.
We are emphasizing raw land acquisition adjacent to existing
operating core areas of the Trust. The prospects generated will
be at the lower-risk end of the exploration spectrum as defined
by probability of success and well cost. Our objective is to add
two high-quality exploration plays to our investment portfolio
each year. We believe this grassroots program will enhance
our long-term sustainability and growth by providing light oil
and natural gas inventory to complement producing property
acquisitions.
Throughout this report, where we disclose reserves for particular properties, the estimates
of reserves and future net revenues for individual properties may not reflect the same
confidence level as estimates and future net revenues for all properties, due to the effects
of aggregation.

Oil and Gas Reserves
Reserves levels and the costs required to replace reserves are
key measures of an oil and gas entity’s sustainability and capital
effectiveness. By both measures, Baytex’s performance in 2005
was exceptional. Our reserve life index increased significantly
and our reserves replacement costs were among the lowest in
the industry.
Our  2005  reserves  report  demonstrates  the  following
achievements of Baytex:
• Total  proved  reserves  increased  20  percent  to  101
MMboe and total proved plus probable reserves increased
17 percent to 140 MMboe.
• Production was replaced 235 percent on a proved basis
and 260 percent on a proved plus probable basis.
• Finding, development and acquisition (FD&A) costs were
$5.19  per  boe  proved  and  $4.69  per  boe  proved  plus
probable before future development capital (FDC) and
$8.45  per  boe  proved  and  $7.69  per  boe  proved  plus
probable including FDC.
• Capital  investment  recycle  ratio  of  4.7  is  among  the
leaders in our sector.
• Reserve  life  index  based  on  total  proved  plus  probable
reserves increased 21 percent to 11.0 years from 9.1 years
in 2004.
• Reserves per trust unit increased 13 percent to 1.96 boe
from 1.74 boe one year ago.
• Net present value of total proved plus probable reserves,
discounted at 10 percent before tax, increased 75 percent
from 2004.
• Net asset value increased 103 percent to $19.96 per unit
from $9.84 per unit in 2004 on a proved plus probable
basis due to higher reserves volumes and value.
These  are  outstanding  results  which  speak  to  the  quality 
and sustainability of the Baytex property portfolio and our
ability to efficiently add value to our assets. All of Baytex’s
reserves  were  evaluated  by  our  independent  reserves 
engineers,  Sproule  Associates  Limited,  in  accordance  with 
the requirements of National Instrument 51-101.

The aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally
will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year.
NI 51-101 requires that, where disclosure of finding and development costs is made, the disclosure includes results for the cost of proved and proved plus probable reserve additions
including future development costs, but excluding acquisition costs. Additional disclosure is made including the impact of net expenditures on acquisitions in order to provide a more
complete reflection of the capital investment activity of the Trust.
Net Asset Value
The following net asset value calculation utilizes what is generally referred to as the “produce-out” net present value of Baytex’s
oil and gas reserves as evaluated by independent evaluators. It does not take into account the possibility of Baytex being able to
recognize additional reserves in its existing properties beyond those included in the 2005 year-end report.
P E R S P E C T I V E
“Acquisitions and divestitures are opportunistic
in nature, and Baytex is fortunate to have a
multi-year internal development inventory
which allows us to be patient in identifying
and executing high value transactions.”

The  following  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  (“MD&A”),  dated  March  8,  2006,  should  be  read  in
conjunction with Baytex Energy Trust’s (the “Trust” or “Baytex”) audited consolidated financial statements for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Per barrel of oil equivalent (“boe”) amounts have been calculated
using a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil.
The Trust evaluates performance based on net income and cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operations
and cash flow per unit are not measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), but are
financial terms commonly used in the oil and gas industry. Cash flow represents cash generated from operating
activities before changes in non-cash working capital, deferred charges and other assets and deferred credits. The
Trust’s determination of cash flow may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities.
The Trust considers it a key measure of performance as it demonstrates the ability of the Trust to generate the
cash flow necessary to fund future distributions to unitholders and capital investments.
The  Trust  also  uses  certain  key  performance  indicators  and  industry  benchmarks  such  as  operating  netbacks
(“netbacks”), finding, development and acquisition costs (“FD&A”), recycle ratio and total capitalization to analyze
financial and operating performance. These key performance indicators and benchmarks as presented do not have
any standardized meaning prescribed by Canadian GAAP and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation
of similar measures for other entities.
This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or future performance.
In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “expects”,
“projects”, “plans”, “anticipates” and similar expressions. These statements
represent management’s expectations or beliefs concerning, among other
things, future operating results and various components thereof or the
economic performance of the Trust. The projections, estimates and beliefs
contained in such forward-looking statements necessarily involve known
and  unknown  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  the  business  risks
discussed in the MD&A as at and for the years ended December 31, 2005
and 2004, which may cause actual performance and financial results in
future  periods  to  differ  materially  from  any  projections  of  future
performance  or  results  expressed  or  implied  by  such  forward-looking
statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on any such forward-
looking  statements,  which  speak  only  as  of  the  date  they  were  made.
Mr. Aylesworth is
responsible for Baytex’s
capital markets, financial
reporting and compliance,
financial risk management
as well as the tax and
treasury functions.

The Trust is not obligated to publicly update or revise the forward-looking statements relating to future events or
future performance to reflect any change in management’s expectations or events.
Baytex Energy Trust (the “Trust”) was established on September 2, 2003 under a Plan of Arrangement. The Trust
is an open-ended investment trust created pursuant to a trust indenture. Subsequent to the Plan of Arrangement,
Baytex Energy Ltd. (the “Company”) is a subsidiary of the Trust.
Prior to the Plan of Arrangement, the consolidated financial statements included the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries and partnership. After giving effect to the Plan of Arrangement, the consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a continuity of interests basis which recognizes the Trust as the successor to the Company.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Trust and its subsidiaries and have been prepared
by management in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

On  June  6,  2005  the  Trust  issued  $100  million  principal  amount  of  6.5%  convertible  unsecured  subordinated
debentures for net proceeds of $95.8 million. The debentures pay interest semi-annually and are convertible at the
option of the holder at any time into fully paid trust units at a conversion price of $14.75 per trust unit. The debentures
mature on December 31, 2010 at which time they are due and payable. The net proceeds were used to reduce
outstanding bank indebtedness.
On September 30, 2005 we completed the acquisition of certain heavy oil producing properties in the Celtic area
in Saskatchewan for a net cash consideration of $69 million. The assets acquired consisted of 3,350 bbl/d of heavy
oil  (13  –  15  API)  and  0.9  MMcf/d  of  natural  gas.  Production  from  this  acquisition  represented  approximately 
10 percent of our existing production. The assets acquired also included approximately 7,500 net acres of undeveloped
land. The Celtic properties are situated approximately 30 miles east of Lloydminster and are adjacent to Tangleflags,
Baytex’s  second  largest  producing  area  within  its  heavy  oil  operations.  The  expanded  Celtic/Tangleflags 
operating region will improve economies of scale and allow for better control over costs. The acquisition also 
included in excess of 100 opportunities for development drilling and recompletions for additional primary (cold)
heavy oil production and natural gas production which added immediate low-cost development inventory. The
acquisition  also  included  1,750  bbl/d  of  SAGD  (steam  assisted  gravity  drainage)  production,  representing 
Baytex’s first  steam-assisted  enhanced  recovery  project.  As  part  of  this  transaction,  Baytex  has  entered  into  a 
price-sharing  arrangement  and  a  net  profits  agreement  for
future SAGD development with the vendor with respect to the
assets acquired.
P E R S P E C T I V E
“The financial position of Baytex has never
looked brighter. Our 2006 cash flow is protected
with solid commodity price contracts, we 
have an inventory which allows us to replace
production inexpensively, and our balance 
sheet offers us much financial flexibility.”
On December 30, 2005 we sold the recently acquired SAGD
assets  in  the  Celtic  area  of  Saskatchewan  for  a  net  cash
consideration of $45.3 million. These proceeds were used to
repay bank borrowings.

Principal Properties
Baytex’s crude oil and natural gas operations are organized into two operating districts – the Heavy Oil District
and the Light Oil and Natural Gas District. Each district has an extensive portfolio of operated properties and
development prospects with considerable upside potential. Baytex has established several geographically-organized
teams  with  a  full  complement  of  technical  professionals  (engineers,  geoscientists  and  landmen)  within  each 
district. Each team has a mandate to apply its specific knowledge and expertise to its operating area. This focused
approach aids in the evaluation and execution of exploration, development and acquisition opportunities and improves
cost efficiency.
Heavy Oil District
The Heavy Oil District accounts for approximately 60 percent of current production, three-quarters of oil-equivalent
reserves and one-half of cash flow from operations. Baytex’s heavy oil operations consist largely of cold primary
production, without the assistance of steam injection. In some cases, heavy oil reservoirs containing lower-than-
average viscosity crudes are waterflooded, occasionally with hot water. Baytex’s heavy oil fields often have multiple
productive zones, some of which can be commingled within the same producing wellbore. Production is generated
from vertical, slant and horizontal wells using progressive cavity pumps capable of handling large volumes of heavy
oil combined with gas, water and sand. Initial production from these wells usually averages between 40 and 100
bbl/d of low gravity crude with gravities ranging from 11 to 18 API. Once produced, the oil is trucked or pipelined
to markets in both Canada and the United States. The crude oil is then sold by Baytex and may be upgraded into
lighter grades of crude or refined into petroleum products such as fuel oil, lubricants and asphalt by the crude
purchasers.
In 2005, production in the Heavy Oil District averaged 21,265 bbl/d of heavy oil and 7.5 MMcf/d of natural gas
(22,515 boe/d). Baytex drilled 67 (65.4 net) wells in the Heavy Oil District resulting in 59 (57.4 net) oil wells, 
one (1.0 net) gas well, four (4.0 net) stratigraphic test wells, and three (3.0 net) dry and abandoned wells, for a 
success rate of 96 percent (95 percent net).
The Heavy Oil District possesses a large inventory of development projects within the west-central Saskatchewan,
Cold Lake/Ardmore, and Peace River/Seal heavy oil sands. Baytex’s ability to generate relatively low-cost replacement
production through conventional cold production methods is key to offsetting the Trust’s overall production decline
rate. Because of Baytex’s large inventory of heavy oil investment projects, the Trust is able to regulate the timing
and level of its capital investment program while generally maintaining production rates.
Baytex will continue to build value through internal heavy oil property development and selective acquisitions. Future
heavy oil development will focus on the development of the Seal field and the newly acquired Celtic property, along
with continued drilling and re-completion activity throughout Baytex’s Saskatchewan properties. Company net
undeveloped lands in this district totalled approximately 313,900 acres at year-end 2005.
A R D M O R E :  Acquired in 2002 at a production rate of 2,200 bbl/d, this property has since been extensively developed
in the Sparky, McLaren and Colony formations. Average production during 2005 was approximately 4,100 bbl/d
of oil and 800 Mcf/d of natural gas (4,200 boe/d). Current production is approximately 3,900 bbl/d and 700 Mcf/d
of natural gas (4,000 boe/d). Sixteen successful oil wells and no dry holes were drilled in the area during 2005.

During 2006, Baytex anticipates drilling eight to ten wells. In 2005, operating expenses were maintained at $5.50/boe
by using a Company-owned water disposal facility and continuing to conserve solution gas that is produced in
conjunction with the heavy oil. Company net undeveloped lands were 41,800 acres at year-end 2005.
C A R R U T H E R S :   The Carruthers property was acquired by Baytex in 1997. This property consists of separate
“North” and “South” oil pools in the Cummings formation. A typical vertical oil well will initially produce at 
40  bbl/d  and  provide  an  ultimate  recovery  of  approximately  60,000  barrels  of  reserves.  During  2005,  average
production was approximately 2,700 bbl/d of heavy oil and 900 Mcf/d of natural gas (2,900 boe/d). Five successful
oil wells were drilled in South Carruthers during 2005. This area represents a very stable production base with
continued development drilling expected to total three to five wells annually. Current production is approximately 
2,900 bbl/d and 900 Mcf/d of natural gas (3,100 boe/d). Company net undeveloped lands were 12,400 acres at 
year-end 2005.
C E LT I C :   This producing property was acquired in October 2005, in a transaction which included approximately
1,750 bbl/d of SAGD production. The SAGD production was divested at the end of 2005, leaving Baytex with the
cold  heavy  and  gas  production  from  this  property.  At  the  time  of  the  purchase,  cold  production  rates  were
approximately 1,600 bbl/d of heavy oil and 0.9 MMcf/d of natural gas. Current production has increased to over
3,000 boe/d. Celtic is a key asset for Baytex because, like the adjacent Tangleflags property, it contains a huge resource
base (455 million barrels of original oil in-place) within multiple prospective horizons. The Celtic property provides
a multi-year inventory of drilling locations and re-completion opportunities. Also like Tangleflags, the heavy oil is
relatively gas saturated and the existing infrastructure allows for efficient capture and marketing of co-produced
solution gas. In 2006, Baytex expects to drill 30 wells and recomplete 25 to 30 additional wells. In addition, it is
anticipated that between 500 and 1,000 Mcf/d of solution gas sales will be added through on-going tie-in projects.
Company net undeveloped lands were 7,100 acres at year-end 2005.
C O L D   L A K E :  Located on Cold Lake First Nations lands, this heavy oil property was acquired by Baytex in 2001.
Production is primarily generated from the Colony formation. Average oil production was 700 bbl/d for 2005, 
during which time Baytex drilled two (1.8 net) oil wells and no dry wells. Current production is approximately 
670 bbl/d. Up to five new drills are anticipated during 2006. Company net undeveloped lands were 15,000 acres
at year-end 2005.
M A R S D E N / E P P I N G / M A C K L I N / S I LV E R D A L E :   This area of Saskatchewan is characterized by low access costs
and generally higher quality crude oils that range up to 18 API gravity. Initial production rates are typically 40 to
70 bbl/d. Primary recovery factors can be as high as 30 percent of the original oil in place because many of the oil
pools in this area have a strong natural water drive. Average oil production in this area during 2005 was approximately
4,400 bbl/d. Eight oil wells were drilled in 2005 and current oil production is approximately 3,600 bbl/d. In addition,
a solution gas tie-in project that currently sells 300 Mcf/d of natural gas was completed at Marsden. During 2006,
a 300 Mcf/d solution gas project at Macklin is expected to be put on-stream and eight to 10 new wells are planned.
Company net undeveloped lands were 19,600 acres at year-end 2005.
S E A L :   Seal is a highly prospective property located in the Peace River oil sands area of northwest Alberta. Baytex
holds a 100 percent working interest in approximately 100 sections of long-term oil sands leases. These oil deposits
can be produced through horizontal well-bores at initial rates of approximately 150 bbl/d without resorting to more
capital intensive steam injection methods. A four-well stratigraphic test program completed during the first quarter

of 2005 proved up significant extensions to our current development area located on the western block of these
land  holdings.  Six  horizontal  wells  drilled  in  late  2004  and  early  2005  are  currently  producing  approximately 
500 bbl/d. The prospective undeveloped area of this westernmost block of Baytex leases comprises over 25,000
acres, and during 2006 we will drill three additional stratigraphic test wells to further delineate this acreage. In
addition, two multi-lateral horizontal wells drilled with upper and lower production legs to more efficiently tap
the 20 meter thick oil sand deposit will be completed and brought on-stream in 2006. Operators of adjoining lands
are  pursuing  aggressive  development  programs  that  will  contribute  to  vital  infrastructure  and  allow  enhanced
marketing solutions for the region. As the region continues to develop, the Seal property will take an increasingly
more prominent role in the Trust’s development activities. Company net undeveloped lands in this area were 67,000
acres at year-end 2005.
TA N G L E F L A G S :  Baytex acquired the Tangleflags property in 2000. Tangleflags is characterized by multiple-zone
reservoirs  with  production  from  the  Colony,  McLaren,  Waseca,  Sparky,  General  Petroleum  and  Lloydminster
formations. As such, this property supplies longer-term development potential through a considerable number of
uphole recompletion opportunities. Average production during 2005 was approximately 3,500 bbl/d of heavy oil
and 1.4 MMcf/d of natural gas (3,700 boe/d). Current production is approximately 3,000 bbl/d and 2.1 MMcf/d.
The growth in natural gas production was achieved through the conservation of solution gas produced in conjunction
with the heavy oil. During 2006, Baytex plans to add three to five new wells, conduct 10 to 20 recompletions and
continue tie-in of solution gas production. Company net undeveloped lands were 10,200 acres at year-end 2005.
Light Oil and Natural Gas District
Although Baytex is best known as a “heavy oil” energy trust, we also possess a growing array of light oil and natural
gas properties that currently provide approximately half of our cash flow. When Baytex converted from a traditional
E&P company to an energy trust in 2003, Baytex Energy Trust produced approximately 12,000 boe/d of light oil
and natural gas concentrated in southeastern and northern Alberta. Over the last two and a half years, Baytex’s light
oil and gas production has grown to its current level of approximately 14,000 boe/d through a combination of
acquisitions and development activities. Moreover, the geographic scope of our light oil and gas operations has
expanded to southwest Alberta and northeast British Columbia, providing exposure to some of the most prospective
areas in Western Canada.
The Light Oil and Natural Gas District produces light and medium gravity crude oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids from various fields in Alberta and British Columbia. In 2005, production averaged 52.9 MMcf/d of natural
gas and 3,842 bbl/d of hydrocarbon liquids (12,662 boe/d). In 2005, the District drilled 51 (41.9 net) wells resulting
in 40 (33.4 net) gas wells, five (3.0 net) oil wells, and six (5.5 net) dry and abandoned wells for a success rate of 
88 percent (88 percent net). Company undeveloped lands in this district were approximately 425,600 net acres at
year-end 2005.
B O N   A C C O R D ,   A L B E RTA :  This multi-zone property was acquired by Baytex in 1997. Production, which is from
the Belly River, Viking and Mannville formations, averaged approximately 6.0 MMcf/d of gas and 300 bbl/d of
hydrocarbon liquids (1,300 boe/d) in 2005. Natural gas is processed at two Company-operated plants and oil is
treated at three Company-operated batteries. Baytex plans to drill three wells in this area during 2006. Company
net undeveloped lands were 27,400 acres at year-end 2005.

D A RW I N / N I N A ,   A L B E RTA :   Both properties in this winter-access area produce natural gas from the Bluesky
formation.  Natural  gas  production  is  processed  at  two  Company-operated  gas  plants.  Production  during  2005
averaged approximately 4.0 MMcf/d (700 boe/d). Baytex plans to drill three wells during 2006 in the Nina/Darwin
area. Company net undeveloped lands were 52,000 acres at year-end 2005.
L E A H U R S T,   A L B E RTA :   Production averaged approximately 5.0 MMcf/d (800 boe/d) in 2005 from this multi-
zone, year-round access area. Natural gas from the Edmonton, Belly River, Viking and Mannville formations is
processed at several plants, one of which is Company-operated. In 2005, Baytex drilled 14 (11.3 net) wells for coalbed
methane production from the Horseshoe Canyon Coals (three of which were also completed in the Belly River
formation), and four (4.0 net) Mannville natural gas wells. In 2006, Baytex may drill up to 12 Horseshoe Canyon
CBM/Belly River wells and one Mannville well in the Leahurst area. Company net undeveloped lands were 20,600
acres at year-end 2005.
R E D   E A RT H / G O O D F I S H ,   A L B E RTA :  This winter-access, multi-zone property was acquired by Baytex in 1997.
Relatively shallow decline oil production from Granite Wash and Slave Point pools is treated at two Company-
operated sweet oil batteries. Natural gas production from the Bluesky formation is handled at two gas plants, one
of which is Company-operated. Production during 2005 from this area averaged approximately 6.0 MMcf/d and 
900 bbl/d of hydrocarbon liquids (1,900 boe/d). Baytex plans to drill four wells during 2006 in the Red Earth/Goodfish
area. Company net undeveloped lands were 49,900 acres at year-end 2005.
R I C H D A L E / S E D A L I A ,   A L B E RTA :   In  2001,  Baytex  acquired  its  initial  position  in  this  area  and  significantly
increased its presence with a 2004 acquisition. During 2005, production averaged approximately 9.0 MMcf/d and
21 bbl/d of hydrocarbon liquids (1,500 boe/d). This area has advantages of year-round access and multi-zone potential
(Second White Specks, Viking and Mannville). Most of the gas production is processed by two Company-operated
gas plants. Baytex plans to drill three wells during 2006 in this area. Company net undeveloped lands were 60,300
acres at year-end 2005.
S T O D D A RT,   B R I T I S H   C O L U M B I A :   The Stoddart asset acquisition was completed in December 2004. Oil and
liquids rich gas production from this largely year-round-access area comes from the Doig, Halfway, Baldonnel, 
Coplin and Bluesky formations. Oil is treated at two Company-operated batteries and natural gas is compressed
at four Company-operated sites and sent for further processing at the outside-operated West Stoddart and Taylor
Younger plants. Production during 2005 from this area averaged approximately 12.0 MMcf/d and 1,700 bbl/d of
hydrocarbon liquids (3,700 boe/d). Baytex drilled nine wells in 2005 resulting in eight gas wells and one abandoned
well, and plans to drill six wells and recomplete three wells in 2006. Company net undeveloped lands were 34,500
acres at December 31, 2005.
T U R I N ,   A L B E RTA :   This multi-zone, year-round access property was acquired in 2004. Production during 2005
averaged approximately 2.0 MMcf/d and 700 bbl/d of hydrocarbon liquids (1,000 boe/d). Production comes from
the Second White Specks, Milk River, Bow Island, Mannville, Sawtooth and Livingstone formations. Oil production
is treated at three Company-operated batteries and gas is processed at two outside-operated gas plants. Baytex plans
to drill three wells and recomplete five additional wells during 2006 in the Turin area. Company net undeveloped

Crude Oil
World crude oil prices rose in 2005 as strong economic growth combined with supply disruptions and geopolitical
events to continue the upward momentum from 2004. World demand for oil and products grew by 1.3 percent in
2005,  a  modest  increase  following  the  enormous  growth  of  3.8  percent  in  2004.  The  resulting  price  increase
demonstrated that crude oil and products supplies were not able to respond to the continued demand growth as
the world’s drilling and refining operations were already operating at capacity. In North America, the largest impact
on crude oil supplies came from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in August and September 2005. Much of U.S. Gulf
of Mexico oil and gas producing operations were forced offline, losing approximately 110 million barrels of cumulative
oil production through year-end.
The lack of excess OPEC productive capacity also contributed to record prices in 2005. After increasing production
in late 2004 to meet surging Asian demand, OPEC production remained fairly flat. Geopolitical events again played
a role as the ongoing conflict in Iraq, unrest in Nigeria, politics in Russia and the more-recent Iranian nuclear 
stand-off have left market participants very nervous.
Benchmark WTI prices began the year around US$42.00 per bbl, climbed to an all-time high of US$69.81 per bbl
on August 30th, and ended the year over US$61 per bbl. The average WTI price for 2005 was US$56.56 per bbl,
an increase of 37 percent from US$41.40 in 2004.
Canadian crude oil prices, while enjoying the strength in world prices, were tempered by the rising Canadian dollar
against its U.S. counterpart. Canadian Par crude at Edmonton averaged $68.75 per bbl in 2005, up 31 percent from
$52.57 in 2004.
With OPEC increasing production in late 2004, supplies of heavy and sour crude oil increased and prices versus
benchmark  light  sweet  prices  deteriorated  during  2005.  Canadian  heavy  oil  prices  mirrored  this  trend  as  the
differential between WTI and Lloyd blend prices in Alberta averaged US$21.82 per bbl in 2005 (39 percent of
WTI) compared to US$14.01 per bbl in 2004 (34 percent of WTI).
Baytex’s light oil and natural gas liquids prices averaged $53.84 per bbl before hedging in 2005 compared to $48.64
in 2004. Our heavy oil prices averaged $37.38 per bbl in 2005, compared to $30.32 in 2004.
In October 2002, Baytex signed a five-year crude oil supply agreement
with Frontier Oil and Refining Company (“Frontier”) of Houston, Texas.
The agreement calls for Baytex to deliver 20,000 bbl/d of Lloyd Blend
(LLB”) quality crude at Hardisty, Alberta through the Express Pipeline
to Guernsey, Wyoming. The blended crude is comprised of approximately
16,000 barrels of Baytex production and 4,000 bbl/d of diluent. Prices 
are fixed at 71 percent of WTI or a 29 percent LLB differential which
represents the long-term average differential since 1986. This contract
significantly  reduces  the  volatility  of  Baytex’s cash  flow  from  its  heavy 
oil operations.
R A L P H   G I B S O N
VICE  PRESIDENT,
MARKETING
Mr. Gibson is responsible
for the transportation 
and marketing of 
Baytex’s production and
implementing the Trust’s
commodity price risk
mitigation strategies.
Going forward, Baytex has entered into a series of costless collar contracts which will provide significant downside
protection on the oil price while still allowing Baytex to participate in upside price potential. WTI costless collars
have been put in place for 2006 on 8,000 bbl/d at a weighted average price from US$55.00 to US$84.39 per bbl
and for 5,000 bbl/d for 2007 at a weighted average price from US$55.00 to US$83.69 per bbl.
Baytex is working to develop a solution to the marketing and infrastructure issues present in the Seal area and
management is optimistic that solutions can be developed which will accelerate full-scale field development.
Natural Gas
Natural gas prices in North America were strong again in 2005, reflecting high oil prices, concerns over gas supplies
and the severe loss of production from the hurricane activity, where 570 Bcf of production was lost during the fourth
quarter. U.S. gas prices represented by the NYMEX futures contract averaged US$8.55 per Mcf in 2005, an increase
of 40 percent from US $6.09 in 2004. Daily prices for Alberta gas delivered to the AECO “C” trading hub averaged
$8.71 per Mcf in 2005, up 33 percent from $6.53 in 2004. Five-year averages are US$5.54 per Mcf for the NYMEX
contract and $6.00 for Alberta daily prices.
Baytex received an average of $8.22 per Mcf for 2005 natural gas sales compared to $6.46 in 2004.
For 2006 Baytex has entered into several physical forward sales contracts. These agreements have locked in seasonal
natural gas prices over the year at prices above the current forward strip.

Production
The Trust’s average production for fiscal 2005 increased by three percent to 35,177 boe/d from 34,022 boe/d for
fiscal 200.
Light oil and NGL production increased by 76 percent to 3,842 bbl/d from 2,172 bbl/d for last year. Heavy oil
production  for  2005  was  down  seven  percent  to  21,265  bbl/d  compared  to  22,703  bbl/d  in  2004.  Natural  gas
production increased by 10 percent to average 60.4 MMcf/d for 2005 compared to 54.9 MMcf/d for 2004. The
reasons for the increase in production for light oil and NGL and natural gas is due to the acquisition completed
in 2004 and the subsequent development of these assets. The decrease in heavy oil production is due to the reduction
in drilling, where 66 net heavy oil wells were drilled in 2005 compared to 95 net wells drilled in 2004.

Revenue
Petroleum and natural gas sales for 2005 increased by four percent to $546.9 million from $420.4 million for fiscal
2004. Benchmark WTI crude oil averaged US$56.56 per barrel for 2005, representing a 37 percent increase over
the US$41.40 per barrel for 2004. However, the Trust’s realized wellhead prices were reduced by a strengthening
Canadian dollar, which averaged US$ 0.8253 in 2005 compared to US$ 0.7683 in 2004. The Trust’s light oil and
NGL price increased to $53.84 per barrel from $48.64 per barrel. The heavy oil price increased 23 percent to $37.38
per barrel in 2005 from $30.32 per barrel in 2004. Natural gas prices were 27 percent higher in 2005, averaging
$8.22 per Mcf compared to $6.46 per Mcf during the previous year. Overall, after accounting for $48.5 million of
realized losses on financial derivative contracts, the Trust averaged $38.82 per boe for 2005, a 41 percent increase
from $27.48 per boe received in the prior year.
For 2005, light oil and NGL revenue increased 95 percent from the same period last year due to an 11 percent
increase in wellhead prices and a 76 percent increase in production. Revenue from heavy oil increased 15 percent
due to a 23 percent increase in wellhead prices partially offset by a 7 percent decrease in production. Revenue from
natural gas increased 40 percent compared to 2004, as production increased 10 percent combined with a price increase
of 27 percent.

Royalties
For the year ended December 31, 2005, royalties increased to $81.9 million from $66.0 million for last year. Total
royalties in 2005 were 15.0 percent of sales, compared to 15.7 percent of sales for 2004. For 2005, royalties were
15.1 percent of sales for light oil and NGL, 12.4 percent for heavy oil and 19.0 percent for natural gas. These rates
compared to 14.1 percent, 13.3 percent and 20.9 percent, respectively, for 2004. The royalty rate for natural gas
was lower in 2005 due to a retroactive adjustment in the gas cost allowance used in the calculation of royalties.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for 2005 increased to $110.6 million from $89.1 million in 2004. Operating expenses were $8.62
per boe for 2005 compared to $7.15 per boe for the prior year. In 2005, operating expenses were $9.06 per barrel
of light oil and NGL, $9.56 per barrel of heavy oil and $1.08 per Mcf of natural gas versus $9.51, $7.83 and $0.82,
respectively, for the same period a year earlier.
Transportation Expenses
Transportation expenses for 2005 were $22.4 million compared to $18.7 million for 2004. These expenses were
$1.74 per boe in 2005 compared to $1.50 in 2004. Transportation expenses were $2.11 per barrel of oil and $0.14
per Mcf of natural gas in 2005, and $1.66 per barrel of oil and $0.18 per Mcf of natural gas in 2004.

General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses for the year were $16.0 million, compared to $15.2 million for the prior year.
On a per sales unit basis, these expenses were $1.25 per boe in 2005 and $1.22 per boe in 2004. In accordance with
our full cost accounting policy, no expenses were capitalized in either 2005 or 2004.

Unit Based Compensation Expense
Compensation expense related to the Trust’s unit rights incentive plan was $5.3 million for 2005 compared to 
$4.6 million for 2004.
Compensation expense associated with rights granted under the plan is recognized in income over the vesting period
of the plan with a corresponding increase or decrease in contributed surplus. The exercise of trust unit rights are
recorded as an increase in trust units with a corresponding reduction in contributed surplus.
Until July 1, 2005, the Trust accounted for stock based compensation based on the intrinsic value of the awards at
each reporting date. Effective July 1, 2005, on a prospective basis, the Trust began valuing options using the fair
value based method. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Trust determined that the fair value methodology should
have been applied to all grants since CICA 3870 was adopted, and the financial statements of prior periods have
been restated accordingly.
Interest Expense
In 2005, interest expense was $33.1 million for the year compared to $19.4 million last year. The increase in total
interest expense is primarily due to the increased debt used to finance acquisitions completed in 2004, plus a gradual
increase in interest rates.
Foreign Exchange
The foreign exchange gain for 2005 was $6.8 million compared to $16.0 million in the prior year. The 2005 gain
is based on the translation of the U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt at 0.8577 at December 31, 2005 compared
to 0.8308 at December 31, 2004. The 2004 gain is based on translation at 0.8308 at December 31, 2004 compared
to 0.7737 at December 31, 2003.
Depletion, Depreciation and Accretion
Depletion, depreciation and accretion increased to $167.1 million for 2005 compared to $160.8 million for last
year. On a sales-unit basis, the provision for the current year was $13.02 per boe compared to $12.91 per boe 
for 2004.
Income Taxes
Current tax expenses were $8.7 million for 2005 compared to $9.0 million last year. The current tax expense is
comprised of $6.9 million of Saskatchewan Capital Tax and $1.8 million of Large Corporation Tax compared to
$7.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, in 2004.

Cash Flow from Operations
Cash flow from operations in 2005 increased 67 percent to $227.5 million from $136.0 million for the previous
year. On a barrel of oil equivalent basis, cash flow from operations was $17.72 for 2005 compared to $10.03 for 2004.
The increase is due to higher sales revenue and a lower realized loss from financial derivative contracts in 2005.

Net Income
Net income for 2005 was $79.9 million compared to $16.8 million for 2004. The increased petroleum and natural
gas sales realized through higher wellhead prices in 2005 were offset by increased operating expenses, a lower foreign
exchange gain and a lower future income tax recovery. Net income for each year has also been reduced by an amount
equivalent to the non-controlling interest proportionate share of the Trust’s consolidated net income relating to
the outstanding exchangeable shares.

Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures during 2005 totaled $152 million, with $130 million spent on exploration and development
activities and $22 million spent on acquisitions net of dispositions of assets.
For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Trust participated in the drilling of 118 (107.3 net) wells, resulting in
64 (60.4 net) oil wells, 41 (34.4 net) gas wells, four (4.0 net) stratigraphic test wells and nine (8.5 net) dry holes
compared to prior year activities of 138 (135.0 net) wells, including 104 (103.1 net) oil wells, 16 (14.4 net) gas wells,
seven (6.5 net) stratigraphic test wells and 11 (11.0 net) dry holes. In September 2005, Baytex purchased 3,500 boe/d
of mainly heavy oil production at Celtic for $69 million. An unsolicited offer in December resulted in the sale of
the SAGD production just acquired for $45.3 million. The decision to acquire these assets was based on the primary
(cold) development opportunities which have been retained by Baytex. Production from the retained assets has grown
to a current rate of over 3,000 boe/d from the original 1,750 boe/d at the time of acquisition. An active capital
program has been planned for this area in 2006, including the drilling of 30 wells. This acquisition complements
existing operations in the core area of Tangleflags and provides numerous low cost development opportunities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2005, total net debt (including working capital, but excluding notional mark-to-market assets or
liabilities) was $423.7 million compared to $412.5 million at December 31, 2004. The modest increase in total debt
at year-end 2005 compared to 2004 is reflective of the Trust’s ability to fund distributions and capital expenditures
by cash flow from operations.
On  June  6,  2005  the  Trust  issued  $100  million  principal  amount  of  6.5%  convertible  unsecured  subordinated
debentures for net proceeds of $95.8 million. The debentures pay interest semi-annually and are convertible at the
option of the holder at any time into fully paid trust units at a conversion price of $14.75 per trust unit. The debentures
mature on December 31, 2010 at which time they are due and payable. The net proceeds were used to reduce
outstanding bank indebtedness.
The debentures have been classified as debt net of the fair value of the conversion feature which has been classified
as unitholders’ equity. This resulted in $95.2 million being classified as debt and $4.8 million being classified as
equity as at the date of issue. Issue costs are amortized over the term of the debentures, and the debt portion will

accrete up to the principal balance at maturity. The accretion, amortization of issue costs and the interest paid are
expensed as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As at December 31, 2005, $22.8 million
principal amount of debentures had been tendered for conversion into trust units.
The Company has a credit agreement with a syndicate of chartered banks. The credit facilities consist of an operating
loan and a 364-day revolving loan. Advances under the credit facilities or letters of credit can be drawn in either
Canadian or U.S. funds and bear interest at the agent bank’s prime lending rate, bankers’ acceptance rates plus
applicable margins or LIBOR rates plus applicable margins. The facilities aggregating $250 million are subject to
semi-annual review and are secured by a floating charge over all of the Company’s assets. At December 31, 2005
at total of $123.6 million had been drawn under the credit facilities.
Another component of the Company’s debt is the US$179.7 million of 9.625 percent senior subordinated notes
due July 15, 2010. They are unsecured and are subordinate to the Company’s bank credit facilities. The Company
entered into an interest rate swap contract converting the fixed rate to a floating rate reset quarterly at the three
month LIBOR rate plus 5.2 percent until the maturity of these notes.
Pursuant to various agreements with Baytex’s creditors, we are restricted from making distributions to unitholders
where the distribution would or could have a material adverse effect on the Trust’s or its subsidiaries’ ability to
fulfill its obligations under Baytex’s credit facilities.
The Trust believes that cash flow generated from its operations, together with existing capacity under the bank
facilities, will be sufficient to finance current operations and planned capital expenditures for the next year. The
timing of most of the capital expenditures is discretionary and there are no material long-term capital expenditure
commitments.
U N I T H O L D E R S ’   E Q U I T Y
The Trust is authorized to issue an unlimited number of trust units.
On  October  18,  2004,  the  Trust  implemented  a  Distribution  Reinvestment  Plan  (“DRIP”).  Under  the  DRIP,
Canadian unitholders are entitled to reinvest monthly cash distributions in additional trust units of the Trust. At
the discretion of the Trust, these additional units will be issued from treasury at 95 percent of the “weighted average
closing price”, or acquired on the market at prevailing market rates. For the purposes of the units issued for treasury,
the “weighted average closing price” is calculated as the weighted average trading price of trust units for the period
commencing on the second business day after the distribution record date and ending on the second business day
immediately prior to the distribution payment date, such period not to exceed 20 trading days. The Trust can also
acquire trust units to be issued under the DRIP at prevailing market rates.
On December 20, 2004, the Trust issued 3,600,000 trust units at $12.80 per unit for gross proceeds of $46.1 million
pursuant to a prospectus.
Non-controlling Interest
The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of exchangeable shares. The exchangeable shares can
be converted (at the option of the holder) into trust units at any time up to September 2, 2013. Up to 1.9 million
exchangeable shares may be redeemed annually by the Company for either cash or the issue of trust units. At
December 31, 2005, there were 1.6 million exchangeable shares outstanding. During 2005, a total of 0.3 million

exchangeable shares were exchanged for trust units. The number of trust units issuable upon conversion is based
upon the exchange ratio in effect at the conversion date. The exchange ratio is calculated monthly based on the
cash distribution paid divided by the weighted average trust unit price of the five-day trading period ending on the
record date. The exchange ratio at December 31, 2005 was 1.37201 trust units per exchangeable share (December 31,
2004 – 1.21472 trust units per exchangeable share). Cash distributions are not paid on the exchangeable shares.
The exchangeable shares are not publicly traded, although they may be transferred by the holder without first being
converted to trust units.
The exchangeable shares of the Company are presented as a non-controlling interest on the consolidated balance
sheet because they fail to meet the non-transferability criteria necessary for them to be classified as equity. Net
income has been reduced by an amount equivalent to the non-controlling interest proportionate share of the Trust’s
consolidated net income with a corresponding increase to the non-controlling interest on the balance sheet.
Cash Distributions 
During 2005 total cash distributions of $1.80 per unit were declared. The monthly cash distribution of $0.15 per
unit has been maintained since the inception of the Trust in September 2003 and was increased to $0.18 per unit
in 2006.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
The Trust has assumed various contractual obligations and commitments, as detailed in the table below, in the normal
course  of  operations  and  financing  activities.  These  obligations  and  commitments  have  been  considered  when
assessing the cash requirements in the above discussion of future liquidity.

The Trust also has ongoing obligations related to the abandonment and reclamation of well and facility sites which
have reached the end of their economic lives. Programs to abandon and reclaim well and facility sites are undertaken
regularly in accordance with applicable legislative requirements.
Risk and Risk Management
The exploration for and the development, production and marketing of petroleum and natural gas involves a wide
range of business and financial risks, some of which are beyond the Trust’s control. Included in these risks are the
uncertainty of finding new reserves, the fluctuations of commodity prices, the volatile nature of interest and foreign
exchange rates, and the possibility of changes to royalty, tax and environmental regulations. The petroleum industry
is highly competitive and the Trust competes with a number of other entities, many of which have greater financial
and operating resources.

The  business  risks  facing  the  Trust  are  mitigated  in  a  number  of  ways.  Geological,  geophysical,  engineering,
environmental and financial analyses are performed on new exploration prospects, development projects and potential
acquisitions to ensure a balance between risk and reward. The Trust’s ability to increase its production, revenues
and cash flow depends on its success in not only developing its existing properties but also in acquiring, exploring
for and developing new reserves and production and managing those assets in an efficient manner.
Despite best practice analysis being conducted on all projects, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating
quantities of petroleum and natural gas reserves, including future oil and natural gas prices, engineering data, projected
future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures. The process of estimating petroleum and natural
gas reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly for new discoveries.
An independent engineering firm evaluates the Trust’s properties annually to determine a fair estimate of reserves.
The Reserves Committee, consisting of qualified members of the Company’s Board of Directors, assists the Board
in their annual review of the reserve estimates.
The provision for depletion and depreciation in the financial statements and the ceiling test are based on proved
reserve estimates. Any future significant revisions could result in a full cost accounting write-down or material changes
to the annual rate of depletion and depreciation.
The financial risks that the Trust is exposed to as part of the normal course of its business are managed, in part,
with  various  financial  derivative  instruments,  in  addition  to  fixed-price  physical  delivery  contracts.  The  use  of
derivative instruments is governed under formal internal policies and subject to limits established by the Board of
Directors. Derivative instruments are not used for speculative or trading purposes.
The  Trust’s  financial  results  can  be  significantly  affected  by  the  prices  received  for  petroleum  and  natural  gas
production as commodity prices fluctuate in response to changing market forces. This pricing volatility is expected
to continue. As a result, The Trust has a risk management program that may be used to protect the prices of oil
and natural gas on a portion of the total expected production. The objective is to decrease exposure to market volatility
and ensure the Trust’s ability to finance its distributions and capital program.
The Trust’s financial results are also impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar
and the US dollar. Crude oil and, to a large extent, natural gas prices are based on reference prices denominated
in US dollars, while the majority of expenses are denominated in Canadian dollars. The exchange rate also impacts
the valuation of the US dollar denominated long-term notes. The related foreign exchange gains and losses are
included in net income. There is no plan at this time to fix the exchange rate on any of the Trust’s long-term
borrowings.
The Trust is exposed to changes in interest rates as the Company’s banking facilities are based on our lenders’ prime
lending rate and short-term Bankers’ Acceptance rates. Changes in interest rates also impact the Company’s interest
rate swap contract which converts the fixed interest rate of 9.625 percent on the US$179.7 million notes to a floating
rate reset quarterly at the three month LIBOR rate plus 5.2 percent until the maturity of these notes.
The Trust’s current position with respect to its financial derivative contracts is detailed in note 17 of the consolidated
financial statements.
A summary of certain risk factors relating to our business is included in our Annual Information Form under the
Risk Factors section.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the financial results of the Trust. These critical
estimates are discussed below.
Oil and Gas Accounting 
The Trust follows the full-cost accounting guideline to account for its petroleum and natural gas operations. Under
this method, all costs associated with the exploration for and development of petroleum and natural gas reserves
are capitalized in one Canadian cost centre. These capitalized costs, along with estimated future development costs,
are depleted and depreciated on a unit-of-production basis using estimated proved petroleum and natural gas reserves.
By  their  inclusion  in  the  unit-of-production  calculation,  reserves  estimates  are  a  significant  component  of  the
calculation of depletion and depreciation and site restoration expense.
Independent engineers engaged by the Trust use all available geological, reservoir, and production performance
data to prepare the reserves estimates. These estimates are reviewed and revised, either upward or downward, 
as new information becomes available. Revisions are necessary due to changes in assumptions based on reservoir
performance,  prices,  economic  conditions,  government  restrictions  and  other  relevant  factors.  If  reserves 
estimates are revised downward, net income could be affected by increased depletion and depreciation.
Impairment of Petroleum and Natural Gas Assets
Companies that use the full-cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas operations are required to perform
a ceiling test each quarter that calculates a limit for the net carrying cost of petroleum and natural gas assets. The
net amount at which petroleum and natural gas properties are carried is subject to a cost recovery test (the “ceiling
test”). The ceiling test is a two-stage process which is to be performed at least annually. The first stage of the test
is a recovery test which compares the undiscounted future cash flow from proved reserves at forecast prices plus
the cost less impairment of unproved properties to the net book value of the petroleum and natural gas assets to
determine if the assets are impaired. An impairment loss exists when the net book value of the petroleum and natural
gas assets exceeds such undiscounted cash flow. The second stage determines the amount of the impairment loss
to be recorded. The impairment is measured as the amount by which the net book value of the petroleum and
natural gas assets exceeds the future discounted cash flow from proved plus probable reserves at forecast prices. If
reserve estimates are revised downward, net income could be affected by any additional depletion and deprecation
recorded under the ceiling test calculation and could result a significant accounting loss for a particular period.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The amounts recorded for asset retirement obligations were estimated based on the Trust’s net ownership interest
in all wells and facilities, estimated costs to abandon and reclaim the wells and the facilities and the estimated time
period during which these costs will be incurred in the future. Any changes to these estimates could change the
amount recorded for asset retirement obligations and may materially impact the consolidated financial statements
of future periods.

Unit-Based Compensation
Until July 1, 2005, the Trust accounted for stock based compensation based on the intrinsic value of the awards at
each reporting date. Effective July 1, 2005, on a prospective basis, the Trust began valuing options using the fair
value based method. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Trust determined that the fair value methodology should
have been applied to all grants since CICA 3870 was adopted, and the financial statements of prior periods have
been restated accordingly.
As a result of retroactively adopting the fair value method of estimating compensation expense, net income for the
comparative year ended December 31, 2004 was increased by $3.0 million, net of non-controlling interest of $0.09
million. The opening 2004 accumulated deficit was increased by $1.7 million, net of non-controlling interest of
$0.1 million. There was also a decrease in unitholders’ capital of $0.07 million during 2004 relating to the transfer
of value from contributed surplus on exercise of unit option rights. There was no impact on cash flow as a result
of adopting this policy.

Financial Instruments
In January 2005 the CICA issued three new standards relating to the reporting of financial instruments in financial
statements.  These  standards  introduce  new  requirements  for  the  recognition  and  measurement  of  financial
instruments and comprehensive income. Section 3855, “Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement”
requires that all financial instruments, including derivatives, are to be included on a company’s balance sheet and
measured, either at their fair values or, in limited circumstances when fair value may not be considered most relevant,
at cost or amortized cost. The standard also provides guidance on when gains and losses as a result of changes in
fair values are to be recognized in the income statement.
The issuance of the new Section 3855 will result in amendments to Section 3860 “Financial Instruments – Disclosure
and Presentation” to make the scope and definitions consistent with that of the new Section 3855, including expanding
the scope to include certain commodity-based contracts, and to update certain disclosures in light of the introduction
of Section 3855. Other Handbook Sections have also been amended for conformity with the new standards.
Section 3865 “Hedges”, extends the existing requirements for hedge accounting currently under AcG-13. This 
new section allows for the optional treatment of accounting for financial instruments that are designated as either
fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of a net investment in a self-sustaining foreign operation. For a fair
value hedge, the gain or loss on a derivative hedging item, or the gain or loss on a non-derivative hedging item
attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized in net income in the period of change together with the offsetting
loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted
for the hedged risk. For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the hedging item’s gain or loss is initially reported
in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to net income when the hedged item affects net income.
For a hedge of a net investment in a self-sustaining foreign operation the same accounting is followed as for a cash
flow hedge.

A new location for recognizing certain gains and losses – other comprehensive income – has been introduced with
the issued of Section 1530, “Comprehensive Income”. An integral part of the accounting standards on recognition
and measurement of financial instruments is the ability to present certain gains and losses outside net income, in
other Comprehensive Income. This standard requires that a company should present comprehensive income and
its components in a financial statement displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements that
constitute a complete set of financial statements, in both annual and interim financial statements. Exchange gains
and losses arising from the translation of the financial statements of a self-sustaining foreign operation, previously
recognized in a separate component of shareholders’ equity, in accordance with Section 1650, “Foreign Currency
Translation”, will now be recognized in a separate component of other comprehensive income.
These three new Handbook Sections are effective date for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning on
or after October 1, 2006. The Trust is evaluating the impact the adoption of these new standards will have on its
consolidated financial statements.
Non-Monetary Transactions
In June 2005, The CICA issued Section 3831 “Non-Monetary Transactions”, which replaces the culmination of
earnings test with a commercial substance test as the criteria for fair value measurement. In addition, fair value
measurement is clarified. The Trust does not expect application of this new standard to have a material impact on
its consolidated financial statements.

The following discussion reviews the Trust’s results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2004.
Light oil and NGL production for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased by 44 percent to 4,022 bbl/d from 2,786 bbl/d
a year earlier. Heavy oil production increased seven percent to 24,051 bbl/d for the fourth quarter of 2005 compared
to 22,490 bbl/d a year ago. Natural gas production increased by six percent to 58.9 MMcf/d for the fourth quarter
of 2005 compared to 55.5 MMcf/d for the same period last year. The increase in light oil and NGL and natural
gas production is due to the acquisitions completed in 2004 and the subsequent development of these assets. The
increase in heavy oil production is attributable to the Celtic acquisition made during the year.
Petroleum  and  natural  gas  sales  increased  46  percent  to  $162.4  million  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2005  from 
$111.5 million for the same period in 2004. Revenue from light oil and NGL for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased
60 percent from the same period a year ago due to a 44 percent increase in production and a 11 percent increase
in wellhead prices. Revenue from heavy oil increased 29 percent due to a seven percent increase in production and
a 21 percent increase in wellhead prices. Revenue from natural gas increased 72 percent as the result of a 62 percent
increase in wellhead prices and a six percent increase in production.
Total royalties increased to $27.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 from $17.4 million in 2004. This increase
is reflective of the increase in total revenue. Total royalties for the fourth quarter of 2005 were 16.8 percent of sales
compared to 15.6 percent of sales for the same period in 2004. For the fourth quarter of 2005, royalties were 
16.2 percent of sales for light oil and NGL, 11.7 percent for heavy oil and 24.3 percent for natural gas. These rates
compared to 15.9 percent, 13.5 percent and 19.5 percent, respectively, for the same period last year.

Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased to $33.3 million from $24.3 million in the corresponding
quarter last year. Operating expenses were $9.55 per boe for the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to $7.63 per boe
for the fourth quarter of 2004. The increase in operating expenses per boe was primarily due to an inflationary
cost environment for fuel and oilfield services, and the addition of heavy oil production utilizing SAGD technology
which was disposed of at year-end 2005. For the fourth quarter of 2005, operating expenses were $6.28 per barrel
of light oil and NGL, $11.00 per barrel of heavy oil and $1.22 per Mcf of natural gas. The operating expenses for
the same period a year ago were $8.57, $8.61 and $0.83, respectively.
Transportation expenses for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $6.0 million compared to $4.6 million for the fourth
quarter of 2004. These expenses were $1.71 per boe for the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to $1.43 for the same
period  in  2004.  Transportation  expenses  were  $2.02  per  barrel  of  oil  and  $0.14  per  Mcf  of  natural  gas.  The
corresponding amounts for 2004 were $1.58 and $0.17, respectively.
General  and  administrative  expenses  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2005  increased  slightly  to  $4.6  million  from 
$4.1 million in 2004. On a per sales unit basis, these expenses were $1.32 per boe for the fourth quarter of 2005
compared to $1.28 per boe for the same period in 2004. In accordance with our full cost accounting policy, no
general and administrative expenses were capitalized in either the fourth quarter of 2005 or 2004.
Compensation expense related to the Trust’s unit rights incentive plan was $1.8 million for the fourth quarter of
2005 compared to $1.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2004.
Interest expense increased to $9.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 from $6.4 million for the same quarter
last year, primarily due to the increased debt used to finance acquisitions, plus a gradual increase in interest rates.
Foreign exchange in the fourth quarter of 2005 was a loss of $0.9 million compared to a gain of $10.9 million in
the prior year. The loss is based on the translation of the US dollar denominated long-term debt at 0.8577 at
December 31, 2005 compared to 0.8613 at September 30, 2005. The 2004 gain is based on translation at 0.8308
at December 31, 2004 compared to 0.7912 at September 30, 2004.
The provision for depletion, depreciation and accretion at $41.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 is almost
unchanged from the same quarter a year ago despite higher production, due to a lower depletion rate resulting
from low-cost proved reserves added from the Celtic acquisition. On a sales-unit basis, the provision for the current
quarter was $11.91 per boe compared to $13.04 per boe for the same quarter in 2004.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $35.2 million compared to $42.7 million for the fourth quarter in
2004. The variance was the result of higher production and higher sales prices, offset by foreign exchange losses
and an increase in future tax provision.

See note 17 to the December 31, 2005 consolidated financial statements for description of accounting treatment
of these derivative contracts.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Raymond Chan, the President and Chief Executive Officer, and Derek Aylesworth, the Chief Financial Officer of
Baytex (together the “Disclosure Officers”), are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls
and procedures for Baytex. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Disclosure Officers evaluated the effectiveness
of the disclosure controls and procedures. As a result of this evaluation, the Disclosure Officers have concluded
that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that all material or potentially
material information about the activities of the Trust is made known to them by others within Baytex.
It should be noted that while our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer believe that
Baytex’s disclosure controls and procedures provide a reasonable level of assurance that they are effective, they do
not expect that the disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all
errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Management,  in  accordance  with  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  has  prepared  the
accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Baytex  Energy  Trust.  Financial  and  operating  information
presented throughout this Annual Report is consistent with that shown in the consolidated financial statements.
Management is responsible for the integrity of the financial information. Internal control systems are designed and
maintained to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded from loss or unauthorized use and to produce
reliable accounting records for financial reporting purposes.
Deloitte & Touche LLP were appointed by the Trust’s unitholders to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements.  Their  examination  included  such  tests  and  procedures,  as  they  considered  necessary,  to  provide  a
reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles.
The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that management fulfills its responsibilities for financial reporting
and internal control. The Board exercises this responsibility through the Audit Committee, with assistance from
the  Reserves  Committee  regarding  the  annual  review  of  our  petroleum  and  natural  gas  reserves.  The  Audit
Committee  meets  regularly  with  management  and  the  independent  auditors  to  ensure that  management’s
responsibilities are properly discharged, to review the consolidated financial statements and recommend that the
consolidated financial statements be presented to the Board of Directors for approval. The Audit Committee also
considers the independence of the external auditors and reviews their fees. The external auditors have access to the
Audit Committee without the presence of management.

To the Unitholders of Baytex Energy Trust
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Baytex Energy Trust (the “Trust”) as at December 31, 2005
and 2004 and the consolidated statements of operations and accumulated income (deficit) and cash flows for the
years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the management of the Trust. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require
that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  consolidated  financial  statement
presentation.
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Trust as at December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then
ended in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.
On March 7, 2006, we reported separately to the Trustee and Unitholders of Baytex Energy Trust on the consolidated
financial statements for the same period, prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting
principles  but  which  included  Note  19,  Differences  between  Canadian  and  United  States  Generally  Accepted
Accounting Principles.

Baytex Energy Trust (the “Trust”) was established on September 2, 2003 under a Plan of Arrangement. The Trust
is an open-ended investment trust created pursuant to a trust indenture. Subsequent to the Plan of Arrangement,
Baytex Energy Ltd. (the “Company”) is a subsidiary of the Trust.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Trust and its subsidiaries and have been prepared
by management in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles as described in note 2.

Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Trust and its wholly owned subsidiaries from the
respective dates of acquisition of the subsidiary companies. Inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated
upon consolidation.
Measurement Uncertainty
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results can
differ from those estimates.
In particular, amounts recorded for depreciation and depletion and amounts used for ceiling test calculations are
based on estimates of petroleum and natural gas reserves and future costs required to develop those reserves. The
Trust’s reserve estimates are evaluated annually by an independent engineering firm. By their nature, these estimates
of  reserves  and  the  related  future  cash  flows  are  subject  to  measurement  uncertainty,  and  the  impact  on  the
consolidated financial statements of future periods could be material.
The amounts recorded for asset retirement obligations were estimated based on the Trust’s net ownership interest
in all wells and facilities, estimated costs to abandon and reclaim the wells and the facilities and the estimated time
period during which these costs will be incurred in the future. Any changes to these estimates could change the
amount recorded for asset retirement obligations and may materially impact the consolidated financial statements
of future periods.

Cash and Short-term Investments
Cash and short-term investments include monies on deposit and short-term investments, accounted for at cost,
which have an initial maturity date of not more that 90 days.
Crude Oil Inventory
Crude oil inventory, consisting of production in transit in pipelines at the balance sheet date pursuant to a long-
term crude oil supply agreement, is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
Petroleum and Natural Gas Operations
The Trust follows the full cost method of accounting for its petroleum and natural gas operations whereby all costs
relating to the exploration for and development of petroleum and natural gas reserves are capitalized in one Canadian
cost centre and charged against income, as set out below. Such costs include land acquisition, drilling of productive
and non-productive wells, geological and geophysical, production facilities, carrying costs directly related to unproved
properties and corporate expenses directly related to acquisition, exploration and development activities and do
not include any costs related to production or general overhead expenses. These costs along with estimated future
capital costs that are based on current costs and that are incurred in developing proved reserves are depleted and
depreciated on a unit of production basis using estimated proved petroleum and natural gas reserves, with both
production and reserves stated before royalties. For purposes of this calculation, petroleum and natural gas reserves
are converted to a common unit of measurement on the basis of their relative energy content where six thousand
cubic feet of gas equates to one barrel of oil. Costs of acquiring and evaluating unproved properties are excluded
from costs subject to depletion and depreciation until it is determined whether proved reserves are attributable to
the properties or impairment occurs. Unproved properties are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis.
Gains or losses on the disposition of petroleum and natural gas properties are recognized only when crediting the
proceeds to costs would result in a change of 20 percent or more in the depletion rate.
The net amount at which petroleum and natural gas properties are carried is subject to a cost recovery test (the
“ceiling test”). The ceiling test is a two-stage process which is to be performed at least annually. The first stage of
the test is a recovery test which compares the undiscounted future cash flow from proved reserves at forecast prices
plus the cost less impairment of unproved properties to the net book value of the petroleum and natural gas assets
to determine if the assets are impaired. An impairment loss exists when the net book value of the petroleum and
natural gas assets exceeds such undiscounted cash flow. The second stage determines the amount of the impairment
loss to be recorded. The impairment is measured as the amount by which the net book value of the petroleum and
natural gas assets exceeds the future discounted cash flow from proved plus probable reserves at forecast prices.
Any impairment is recorded as additional depletion and depreciation.
Goodwill
Goodwill is the residual amount that results when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the fair value
for accounting purposes of the net identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business. Goodwill is stated at
cost less impairment and is not amortized. The goodwill balance is assessed for impairment annually at year-end
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The test for
impairment is conducted by the comparison of the net book value to the fair value of the reporting entity. If the
fair value of the Trust is less than the net book value, impairment is deemed to have occurred. The extent of the
impairment is measured by allocating the fair value of the Trust to the identifiable assets and liabilities at their fair
values. Any remainder of this allocation is the implied value of goodwill. Any excess of the net book value of goodwill
over this implied value is the impairment amount. Impairment is charged to income in the period in which it occurs.

Convertible Unsecured Subordinated Debentures
The debentures have been classified as debt net of the fair value of the conversion feature which has been classified
as unitholders’ equity. Issue costs will be amortized over the term of the debentures, and the debt portion will accrete
up to the principal balance at maturity. The accretion, amortization of issue costs and the interest paid are expensed
as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. If the debentures are converted to trust units, a
portion of the value of the conversion feature under unitholders’ equity will be reclassified to unitholders’ capital
along with the principal amounts converted.
Asset Retirement Obligation
The Trust recognizes a liability at discounted fair value for the future abandonment and reclamation costs associated
with the petroleum and natural gas properties. The fair value of the liability is capitalized as part of the cost of the
related asset and amortized to expense over its useful life. The liability accretes until the date of expected settlement
of the retirement obligations. The related accretion expense is recognized in the statement of operations. The
provision will be revised for the effect of any changes to timing related to cash flow or undiscounted abandonment
costs. Actual expenditures incurred for the purpose of site reclamation are charged to the asset retirement obligations
to the extent that the liability exists on the balance sheet. Differences between the actual costs incurred and the
fair value of the liability recorded are recognized in income in the period the actual costs are incurred.
Joint Interests
A portion of the Trust’s exploration, development and production activities is conducted jointly with others. These
consolidated financial statements reflect only the Trust’s proportionate interest in such activities.
Foreign Currency Translation
Foreign currency denominated monetary items are translated into Canadian dollars at the exchange rate in effect
at the balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses on long-term monetary items that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are recognized in income.
Revenue and expenses are translated at the monthly average rate of exchange. Translation gains and losses are included
in net income.
Deferred Charges and Other Assets
Financing costs related to the exchange of the senior subordinated notes have been deferred and are amortized
over the term of the notes on a straight-line basis.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids is recognized when title passes to the
purchaser, normally at the pipeline delivery point for natural gas and at the wellhead for crude oil.
Financial Derivative Contracts
The Trust formally documents its risk management objectives and strategies to manage exposures to fluctuations
in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The risk management policies included
the permitted use of derivative financial instruments, including swaps and collars, used to manage these fluctuations.
All transactions of this nature entered into by the Trust are related to an underlying financial instrument or to future
petroleum and natural gas production. The Trust does not use financial derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
Financial derivative contracts used as hedging transactions must be documented and it must be demonstrated that
the hedges are sufficiently effective in order to continue accrual accounting for positions hedged with financial

derivative contracts. Financial derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in the
balance sheet and measured at fair value, with changes in fair value reported separately in the statement of operations
as income or expense.
Future Income Taxes
The Trust is a unit trust for income tax purposes, and is taxable on taxable income not allocated to the unitholders.
From inception on September 2, 2003, the Trust has allocated all of its taxable income to the unitholders, and
accordingly, no provision for income taxes is required at the Trust level.
The Company is subject to corporate income taxes and follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes.
Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method of tax allocation, which determines future income taxes
based on the differences between assets and liabilities reported for financial accounting purposes and those reported
for tax purposes. Future income taxes are calculated using tax rates anticipated to apply in periods that temporary
differences are expected to reverse.
Unit-based Compensation
The Trust Unit Rights Incentive Plan is described in note 12. The exercise price of the rights granted under the
Plan may be reduced in future periods in accordance with the terms of the Plan. The Trust uses the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to calculate the estimated fair value of the outstanding rights.
Compensation expense associated with rights granted under the plan is recognized in income over the vesting period
of the plan with a corresponding increase in contributed surplus. The exercise of trust unit rights are recorded as
an increase in trust units with a corresponding reduction in contributed surplus.
Non-controlling Interest
The exchangeable shares of the Company are presented as a non-controlling interest on the consolidated balance
sheet because they fail to meet the non-transferability criteria necessary in order for them to be classified as equity.
Net income has been reduced by an amount equivalent to the non-controlling interest proportionate share of the
Trust’s consolidated net income with a corresponding increase to the non-controlling interest on the consolidated
balance sheet. As the exchangeable shares are converted to Trust units, the exchange is accounted for as a step-
acquisition where Unitholders’ capital was increased by the fair value of the Trust units issued. The difference between
the fair value of the Trust units issued and the book value of the exchangeable shares is recorded as an increase in
petroleum and natural gas properties.
Per-unit Amounts
Basic net income per unit is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of trust units
outstanding during the year. Diluted per unit amounts reflect the potential dilution that could occur if trust unit
rights were exercised or exchangeable shares were converted or convertible debentures were fully converted. The
treasury stock method is used to determine the dilutive effect of trust unit rights, whereby any proceeds from the
exercise of trust unit rights or other dilutive instruments and the amount of compensation expense, if any, attributed
to future services and not yet recognized are assumed to be used to purchase trust units at the average market price
during the period.

Unit-Based Compensation 
Until July 1, 2005, the Trust accounted for unit based compensation based on the intrinsic value of the grants at
each reporting date. Effective July 1, 2005, on a prospective basis, the Trust began valuing unit rights using the
fair value based method. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Trust determined that the fair value methodology should
have been applied to all grants since CICA 3870 was adopted, and the financial statements of prior periods have
been restated accordingly.
As a result of retroactively adopting the fair value method of estimating compensation expense, net income for 
the comparative year ended December 31, 2004 was increased by $3.0 million, net of non-controlling interest of
$0.09 million. The opening 2004 accumulated deficit decreased by $1.7 million, net of non-controlling interest of
$0.1 million. There was also a decrease in unitholders’ capital of $0.07 million during 2004 relating to the transfer
of value from contributed surplus on exercise of unit option rights. There was no impact on cash flow as a result
of adopting this policy (note 12).

Effective September 22, 2004, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of a private oil and
gas company with operations in Alberta. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
The estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition is summarized below.
Subsequent to the acquisition, the private company was amalgamated with the Company.

In calculating the depletion and depreciation provision for 2005, $46.6 million (2004 – $61.7 million) of costs 
relating to undeveloped properties and materials were excluded from costs subject to depletion and depreciation.
No general and administrative expenses have been capitalized since the inception of operations as a trust effective
September 2, 2003.
The petroleum and natural gas properties are subject to a ceiling test, which was calculated at December 31, 2005

The prices and costs subsequent to 2010 have been adjusted for inflation at an annual rate of 1.5 percent. Based
on the ceiling test calculation, the Trust’s estimated undiscounted future net cash flows associated with the proved
reserves plus the cost less impairment of unproved properties exceeded the book value of the petroleum and natural
gas properties.

The Company has a credit agreement with a syndicate of chartered banks. The credit facilities consist of an operating
loan and a 364-day revolving loan. Advances under the credit facilities or letters of credit (note 18) can be drawn
in either Canadian or U.S. funds and bear interest at the agent bank’s prime lending rate, bankers’ acceptance rates
plus applicable margins or LIBOR rates plus applicable margins. The facilities aggregating $250 million are subject
to semi-annual review and are secured by a floating charge over all of the Company’s assets. At December 31, 2005
a total of $123.6 million had been drawn under the credit facilities.

On  June  6,  2005  the  Trust  issued  $100  million  principal  amount  of  6.5%  convertible  unsecured  subordinated
debentures for net proceeds of $95.8 million. The debentures pay interest semi-annually and are convertible at the
option of the holder at any time into fully paid trust units at a conversion price of $14.75 per trust unit. The debentures
mature on December 31, 2010 at which time they are due and payable.
The debentures have been classified as debt net of the fair value of the conversion feature which has been classified
as unitholders’ equity. This resulted in $95.2 million being classified as debt and $4.8 million being classified as
equity. Issue costs are being amortized over the term of the debentures, and the debt portion will accrete up to the
principal balance at maturity. The accretion, amortization of issue costs and the interest paid are expensed as interest
expense in the consolidated statements of operations. If the debentures are converted to trust units, a portion of
the value of the conversion feature under unitholders’ equity will be reclassified to unitholders’ capital along with
the principal amounts converted.

(1) The change in estimate was primarily due to the significant increase in recent and forecasted market price of petroleum and natural gas. Consequentially, the
projected economic life of the wells and facilities are extended, resulting in wells and facilities being abandoned and reclaimed further out in the future and
thus a lower present value of asset retirement obligations.
The Trust’s asset retirement obligations are based on the Trust’s net ownership in wells and facilities. Management
estimates the costs to abandon and reclaim the wells and the facilities and the estimated time period during which
these costs will be incurred in the future. These costs are expected to be incurred over the next 52 years with the
majority of costs incurred between 2044 and 2057. The undiscounted amount of estimated cash flow required to
settle the retirement obligations at December 31, 2005 is $218 million. Estimated cash flow has been discounted
at a credit-adjusted risk free rate of 8.0 percent and an inflation rate of 2.5 percent for the years 2006 to 2008, and
1.5 percent thereafter.

On  October  18,  2004,  the  Trust  implemented  a  Distribution  Reinvestment  Plan  (“DRIP”).  Under  the  DRIP,
Canadian unitholders are entitled to reinvest monthly cash distributions in additional trust units of the Trust. At
the discretion of the Trust, these additional units will be issued from treasury at 95% of the “weighted average
closing price”, or acquired on the market at prevailing market rates. For the purposes of the units issued from treasury,
the “weighted average closing price” is calculated as the weighted average trading price of trust units for the period
commencing on the second business day after the distribution record date and ending on the second business day
immediately prior to the distribution payment date, such period not to exceed 20 trading days. The Trust can also
acquire trust units to be issued under the DRIP at prevailing market rates.
On December 20, 2004, the Trust issued 3,600,000 trust units at $12.80 per unit for gross proceeds of $46.1 million
pursuant to a prospectus.
1 1 . N O N - C O N T R O L L I N G   I N T E R E S T
The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of exchangeable shares. The exchangeable shares can
be converted (at the option of the holder) into trust units at any time up to September 2, 2013. Up to 1.9 million
exchangeable shares may be redeemed annually by the Company for either cash or the issue of trust units. The
number of trust units issued upon conversion is based upon the exchange ratio in effect at the conversion date. The
exchange ratio is adjusted monthly based on the cash distribution paid divided by the weighted average trust unit
price for the five-day trading period ending on the record date. The exchange ratio at December 31, 2005 was
1.37201 trust units per exchangeable share (2004 – 1.21472 trust units per exchangeable share). Cash distributions
are not paid on the exchangeable shares. The exchangeable shares are not publicly traded, although they may be
transferred by the holder without first being converted to trust units.
The exchangeable shares of the Company are presented as a non-controlling interest on the consolidated balance
sheet because they fail to meet the non-transferability criteria necessary in order for them to be classified as equity.
Net income has been reduced by an amount equivalent to the non-controlling interest proportionate share of the
Trust’s consolidated net income with a corresponding increase to the non-controlling interest on the balance sheet.

As the exchangeable shares are converted to Trust units, the exchange is accounted for as a step-acquisition where
Unitholders’ capital was increased by the fair value of the Trust units issued. The difference between the fair value
of the Trust units issued and the book value of the exchangeable shares is recorded as an increase in petroleum and
natural gas properties.

The Trust has a Trust Unit Rights Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) whereby the maximum number of trust units issuable
pursuant to the plan is a “rolling” maximum equal to 10% of the outstanding trust units plus the number of trust
units which may be issued on the exchange of outstanding exchangeable shares. Any increase in the issued and
outstanding units will result in an increase in the available number of trust units issuable under the plan, and any
exercises of incentive rights will make new grants available under the plan, effectively resulting in a re-loading of
the number of rights available to grant under the plan. Trust unit rights are granted at the volume weighted average
trading price of the trust units for the five trading days prior to the date of grant, vest over three years and have a
term of five years. The Plan provides for the exercise price of the rights to be reduced in future periods by a portion
of the future distributions.
The Trust recorded compensation expense of $5.3 million for the year ending December 31, 2005 ($4.6 million
in 2004) (note 3).
The Trust used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the estimated fair value of the outstanding
rights. The following assumptions were used to arrive at the estimate of fair values:
Expected annual right’s exercise price reduction
Expected volatility
Risk-free interest rate
Expected life of option (years)

The Trust applies the treasury stock method to assess the dilutive effect of outstanding trust unit rights on net income
per unit. The weighted average exchangeable shares outstanding during the year, converted at the year-end exchange
ratio, and the trust units issuable on conversion of convertible debentures, have also been included in the calculation
of the diluted weighted average number of trust units outstanding:
Weighted average number of units outstanding, basic
Trust units issuable on conversion of exchangeable shares

The dilutive effect of trust unit incentive rights above did not include 3.9 million trust unit rights (2004 – 3.1 million)
because the respective exercise prices exceeded the average market price of the trust units during the year and the
amount of compensation expense attributed to future services and not yet recognized.

The Trust’s financial instruments recognized in the balance sheet consist of cash and short-term investments, accounts
receivable, current liabilities and long-term borrowings. The estimated fair values of the financial instruments have
been  determined  based  on  the  Trust’s  assessment  of  available  market  information  and  appropriate  valuation
methodologies; however, these estimates may not necessarily be indicative of the amounts that could be realized
or settled in a market transaction.
The fair values of financial instruments other than bank debt and long-term borrowings approximate their book
amounts due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. The fair value of the bank debt approximates its book
value  as  it  is  at  a  market  rate  of  interest.  At  December  31,  2005,  the  trading  value  of  the  Company’s  senior
subordinated term notes was 105 percent in relation to par (2004 – 105 percent). The market value of the Trust’s
convertible debentures at December 31, 2005 was 118 percent in relation to par.

Most of the Trust’s accounts receivable relate to oil and natural gas sales and are exposed to typical industry credit
risks. The Trust manages this credit risk by entering into sales contracts with only credit worthy entities and reviewing
its exposure to individual entities on a regular basis. The book value of the accounts receivable reflects management’s
assessment of the associated credit risks.
The Trust is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of its floating rate debts.

The nature of the Trust’s operations results in exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, exchange rates and
interest rates. The Trust monitors and, when appropriate, utilizes derivative contracts to manage its exposure to
these risks. The Trust is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counter-parties to
these contracts.

Under the CICA guideline for hedge accounting, the Trust’s financial derivative contracts for oil collars do not
qualify as effective accounting hedges. Accordingly, these contracts have been accounted for based on the fair value
method. At December 31, 2005, the Trust recorded an asset of $5.2 million (2004 – a liability of $9.5 million) on
the mark-to-market value of the outstanding non-hedging financial derivatives. The change in the mark-to-market
value of the non-hedging financial derivatives during 2005 has been recorded as an unrealized gain on non-hedging
financial derivatives of $14.7 million (2004 – $0.6 million) in the consolidated statement of operations. The Trust
is applying hedge accounting to the interest rate swap and gains and losses are netted against interest expense.

Notes:
(1) “Gross” reserves are the working interest share of remaining reserves, before deduction of any royalties and excluding any royalty interest.
(2) “Net” reserves means Baytex’s gross reserves less all royalties payable to others.
(3) Oil equivalent amounts have been calculated using a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil. BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in
isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf : 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency
at the wellhead.

Baytex employees may report misconduct without the threat or fear of dismissal, harassment or other retaliation.
Code of Ethics for Principal Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers
While Baytex and its unitholders expect honest and ethical conduct in all aspects of our business from all employees,
officers and directors, Baytex and its unitholders expect the highest possible standard from our financial managers.
This code of ethics is applicable to the President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller
and any other person performing a similar function. These individuals are setting an example for other employees
and are expected to foster a culture of transparency, integrity and honesty. Compliance with this code is an essential
condition of employment for the financial officers and any violations will be met with immediate sanction.

Effective October 18, 2004, Baytex implemented a Distribution Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”). The DRIP provides
a convenient mechanism for unitholders to reinvest their monthly cash distributions in additional trust units. The
DRIP permits the purchase of Baytex trust units from treasury at a discounted price. This plan is currently only
available to Canadian resident unitholders.
The benefits to eligible Baytex unitholders under the DRIP are:
• Trust units purchased from treasury under the DRIP will be issued at a five percent discount from the weighted
average closing price of the trust units on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In instances where Baytex elects to
purchase trust units for the DRIP through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange, rather than issuance
from treasury, the price of trust units to participants will be the average market price of trust units during the
period of up to 20 trading days following the relevant distribution record date. Generally, Baytex expects to
issue trust units from treasury at the five percent discount to satisfy the requirements of the DRIP.
• Participants in the DRIP do not pay brokerage commissions or any costs associated with the administration of
the plan. However, unitholders who enroll in the DRIP through a broker, trust company, bank or other nominee
may be subject to fees in accordance with their agreement with their nominee.
Statements  of  account  are mailed  to  each  participating  registered  unitholder  on  a  quarterly  basis  detailing  the
investment made on their behalf.
Beneficial owners of trust units whose trust units are not registered in their own names may participate in the DRIP
by either: (a) having their trust units transferred into their own names or (b) by instructing their broker, trust company,
bank or other nominee to participate in the DRIP on their behalf while maintaining the trust units in their nominee’s
account. It is not necessary for beneficial owners of trust units to remove their trust units from their account
with a broker or other nominee to enroll in the DRIP.
Canadian unitholders may join the plan at any time by completing an enrollment form, or by having their nominee
complete an enrollment form, and submitting it to Valiant Trust Company at 310, 606 – 4th Street S.W., Calgary,
Alberta T2P 1T1 Attention: Income Trust Department Fax: (403) 233-2857. A detailed explanation of the terms
and conditions of the DRIP and related enrollment forms are available on the Baytex website at www.baytex.ab.ca
or by contacting the Investor Relations Department toll free at 1 (800) 524-5521 or (403) 269-4282.

(1) Cash flow from operations is a non-GAAP term that represents cash generated from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital and other
operating items. The Trust’s cash flow from operations may not be comparable to other companies. The Trust considers cash flow a key measure of performance
as it demonstrates the Trust’s ability to generate the cash flow necessary to fund future distributions and capital investments.
(2) Reserves information from 2001 to 2002 is prepared in accordance with National Policy 2-B. Probable reserves presented herein for those years represents 
50 percent of the total probable reserves then assigned to allow more appropriate comparison with probable reserves under NI 51-101 as at December 31, 2003.
(3) Restated due to retroactive adoption of the fair value method of estimating compensation expense.

Certain statements in this report are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the United States Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Specifically, this report contains forward-looking statements relating to Management’s approach
to operations, expectations relating to the number of wells, amount and timing of capital projects, foreign exchange rates, interest
rates, worldwide and industry production, prices of oil and gas, heavy oil differentials, company production, cash flow, debt levels
and cash distribution practices. The reader is cautioned that assumptions used in the preparation of such information, although
considered reasonable by Baytex at the time of preparation, may prove to be incorrect. Actual results achieved during the forecast
period will vary from the information provided herein as a result of numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties and
other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: general economic, market and business conditions; industry capacity;
competitive action by other companies, fluctuations in oil and gas prices; the ability to produce and transport crude oil and natural
gas to markets; the result of exploration and development drilling and related activities; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange
rates; the imprecision of reserve estimates; the ability of suppliers to meet commitments; actions by governmental authorities
including increases in taxes; decisions or approvals of administrative tribunals; change in environmental and other regulations;
risks associated with oil and gas operations; the weather in the Trust’s areas of operations; and other factors, many of which are
beyond the control of the Trust. There is no representation by Baytex that actual results achieved during the forecast period will
be the same in whole or in part as those forecast.

* BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. 
In accordance with NI 51-101, a BOE conversion ratio for
natural gas of 6 Mcf : 1 bbl has been used, which is based on 
an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable
at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency 
at the wellhead.
