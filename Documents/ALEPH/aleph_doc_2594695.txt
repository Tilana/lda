ROCKIES REGION 2006 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2016
(unaudited)
Note 1 - General and Basis of Presentation
Rockies Region 2006 Limited Partnership (this “Partnership” or the “Registrant”) was organized
in 2006 as a limited partnership, in accordance with the laws of the State of West Virginia, for the
purpose of engaging in the exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties.
Business operations commenced upon closing of an offering for the private placement of
Partnership units. Upon funding, this Partnership entered into a Drilling and Operating
Agreement (“D&O Agreement”) with the Managing General Partner which authorizes PDC to
conduct and manage this Partnership's business. In accordance with the terms of the Limited
Partnership Agreement (the “Agreement”), the Managing General Partner is authorized to
manage all activities of this Partnership and initiates and completes substantially all Partnership
transactions.
As of June 30, 2016, there were 1,974 limited partners ("Investor Partners") in this Partnership.
PDC is the designated Managing General Partner of this Partnership and owns a 37% Managing
General Partner ownership in this Partnership. According to the terms of the Agreement,
revenues, costs and cash distributions of this Partnership are allocated 63% to the Investor
Partners, which are shared pro rata based upon the number of units in this Partnership, and 37%
to the Managing General Partner. The Managing General Partner may repurchase Investor
Partner units under certain circumstances provided by the Agreement, upon request of an
individual Investor Partner. Through June 30, 2016, the Managing General Partner had
repurchased 164 units of Partnership interest from the Investor Partners at an average price of
$2,351 per unit. As of June 30, 2016, the Managing General Partner owned 39.3% of this
Partnership, including the repurchased interest. The Managing General Partner made no limited
partner unit repurchases during the three months ended June 30, 2016.
In the Managing General Partner's opinion, the accompanying condensed financial statements
contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair
statement of this Partnership's results for interim periods in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") and with the
instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Accordingly, pursuant to
such rules and regulations, certain notes and other financial information included in the audited
financial statements have been condensed or omitted. The December 31, 2015 condensed
balance sheet data was derived from financial statements audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, as indicated in their report filed with the SEC
on March 25, 2016, but does not include disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. The information
presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with this
Partnership's audited financial statements and notes thereto included in this Partnership's 2015
Form 10-K. This Partnership's accounting policies are described in the Notes to Financial
Statements in this Partnership's 2015 Form 10-K and updated, as necessary, in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. The results of operations and cash flows for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year
or any future period.
Note 2 - Going Concern
This Partnership has historically funded its operations with cash flows from operations. This
Partnership’s most significant cash outlays have related to its operating expenses, capital
program and distributions to partners. The market price for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs
decreased significantly during 2015 and continued to be depressed during the six months ended
June 30, 2016. Although this Partnership's production increased 48% during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year period, as a result of the
continued depressed commodity prices, this Partnership generated modest revenue of $386,000
during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Further, there was no improvement in this
Partnership's liquidity during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as cash flows generated from
crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales were utilized for operating activities.
This Partnership's strained liquidity position resulting from declining commodity prices raises
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Due to the significant decrease
in liquidity experienced in 2015 that has continued into 2016 and anticipated future capital
expenditures required to remain in compliance with certain regulatory requirements and to satisfy
asset retirement obligations, the Managing General Partner believes that cash flows from
operations will be insufficient to meet this Partnership’s obligations. One of this Partnership's
most significant obligations is to the Managing General Partner, which is currently due for
reimbursement of costs paid on behalf of this Partnership by the Managing General Partner.
Such amounts are generally paid to third parties for general and administrative expenses and
equipment and operating costs, as well as monthly operating fees payable to the Managing
General Partner. Beginning in the second quarter of 2015 and continuing during the six
- 6-
ROCKIES REGION 2006 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2016
(unaudited)
months ended June 30, 2016, this Partnership made no quarterly cash distributions to the
Managing General Partner or Investor Partners.
The ability of this Partnership to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to
attain a satisfactory level of cash flows from operations. Greater cash flow would most likely
occur from improved commodity pricing and, to a lesser extent, a sustained increase in
production. However, historically, as a result of the normal production decline in a well's
production life cycle, this Partnership has not experienced a sustained increase in production
without capital expenditures.
The Managing General Partner is considering various options to mitigate risks that raise
substantial doubt about this Partnership’s ability to continue as a going concern, including, but
not limited to, deferral of payment of certain obligations, continued suspension of distributions to
partners, partial or complete sale of assets and the shutting-in of wells. However, there can be no
assurance that this Partnership will be able to mitigate such conditions. Failure to do so could
result in a partial asset sale or some form of bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of this
Partnership.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of
accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and satisfaction of
liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not
reflect any adjustments that might result if this Partnership is unable to continue as a going
concern.
Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") and the International
Accounting Standards Board issued their converged standard on revenue recognition that
provides a single, comprehensive model that entities will apply to determine the measurement of
revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The underlying principle is that an entity will
recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the
entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The standard outlines a
five-step approach to apply the underlying principle: (1) identify the contract with the customer, (2)
identify the separate performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price,
(4) allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations and (5) recognize revenue
when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied. In March 2016, the FASB issued an
update to the standard intended to improve the operability and understandability of the
implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations when recognizing revenue.
The revenue standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The revenue standard can be
adopted under the full retrospective method or simplified transition method. Entities are permitted
to adopt the revenue standard early, beginning with annual reporting periods after December 15,
2016. The Managing General Partner of this Partnership is currently evaluating the impact these
changes may have on this Partnership's financial statements.
In August 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to the disclosure of uncertainties about
an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard will explicitly require
management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern every reporting period
and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The new standard will be
effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016, with early
adoption permitted. This Partnership expects to adopt this standard in the fourth quarter of 2016.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, this Partnership made no quarterly
cash distributions to the Managing General Partner or Investor Partners as cash flows
generated from crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales were utilized for operating activities.
Cash distributions during the six months ended June 30, 2015 include $767 related to cash
distributions for Investor Partner units repurchased by PDC.
Note 5 - Fair Value Measurements
This Partnership's fair value measurements were estimated pursuant to a fair value hierarchy that
requires this Partnership to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the
transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date, giving
the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to
unobservable data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in
different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these cases, the lowest level input that is significant
to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the applicable level in the fair value
hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its
entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability, and may affect the
valuation of the assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.
The carrying value of the financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities
approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

ROCKIES REGION 2006 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2016
(unaudited)
The Managing General Partner utilizes fair value, on a non-recurring basis, to perform
impairment testing on this Partnership's crude oil and natural gas properties by comparing net
capitalized costs, or carrying value, to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows. If net
capitalized costs exceed undiscounted future net cash flows, the measurement of impairment is
based on estimated fair value and is measured by the amount by which the net capitalized costs
exceed their fair value.
Note 6 - Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
Neither this Partnership nor PDC, in its capacity as the Managing General Partner of this
Partnership, are party to any pending legal proceeding that PDC believes would have a
materially adverse effect on this Partnership's business, financial condition, results of operations
or liquidity.
Environmental
Due to the nature of the oil and gas industry, this Partnership is exposed to environmental risks.
The Managing General Partner has various policies and procedures in place to prevent
environmental contamination and mitigate the risks from environmental contamination. The
Managing General Partner conducts periodic reviews to identify changes in this Partnership's
environmental risk profile. Liabilities are accrued when environmental remediation efforts are
probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities are reduced as
remediation efforts are completed or are adjusted as a consequence of subsequent periodic
reviews.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, as a result of the Managing General
Partner's periodic review, no new environmental remediation projects were identified and this
Partnership's expense for environmental remediation efforts was not significant. This Partnership
had no liabilities for environmental remediation efforts as of June 30, 2016 or December 31,
2015.
The Managing General Partner is not currently aware of any environmental claims existing as of
June 30, 2016 which have not been provided for or would otherwise have a material impact on
this Partnership's condensed financial statements; however, there can be no assurance that
current regulatory requirements will not change or that unknown past non-compliance with
environmental laws or other potential sources of liability will not be discovered on this
Partnership's properties.
In August 2015, the Managing General Partner received a Clean Air Act Section 114 Information
Request (the "Information Request") from the United States Environmental Protection Agency
("EPA"). The Information Request seeks, among other things, information related to the design,
operation, and maintenance of certain production facilities in the Denver-Julesburg Basin of
Colorado. The Information Request focuses on historical operation and design information for 46
production facilities, of which one relates to this Partnership, and asks that the Managing General
Partner conduct certain sampling and analyses at the identified 46 facilities. The Managing
General Partner responded to the Information Request in January 2016. The Managing General
Partner continues to meet with the EPA and provide additional information, but cannot predict the
outcome of this matter at this time.
In addition, in December 2015, the Managing General Partner received a Compliance Advisory
pursuant to C.R.S. § 25-7-115(2) from the Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment's Air Quality Control Commission's Air Pollution Control Division alleging that the
Managing General Partner had failed to design, operate, and maintain certain condensate
collection, storage, processing and handling operations to minimize leakage of volatile organic
compounds to the maximum extent possible at 65 facilities consistent with applicable standards
under Colorado law. Certain of this Partnership's wells were included in this list of 65 facilities.
The Managing General Partner is in the process of responding to the advisory, and working with
the agency on specific response processes, but cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this
time.

Note 7 - Asset Retirement Obligations
The following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of the asset retirement
obligations associated with this Partnership's working interest in crude oil and natural gas
properties:

The current portion of the asset retirement obligations relates to wells that are producing minimal
or no hydrocarbons and are expected to be plugged and abandoned within the next 12 months.
This Partnership's estimated asset retirement obligation liability is based on historical experience
in plugging and abandoning wells, estimated economic lives, estimated plugging and
abandonment cost and federal and state regulatory requirements. The liability is discounted
using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate estimated at the time the liability is incurred or revised. In
periods subsequent to initial measurement of the liability, this Partnership must recognize period-
to-period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time, revisions to either the amount
of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows or changes in inflation factors and changes to
this Partnership's credit-adjusted risk-free rate as market conditions warrant.
Note 8 - Impairment of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, this Partnership recognized an impairment charge
of approximately $3.3 million to write-down its proved crude oil and natural gas properties. The
impairment charge represented the amount by which the carrying value of the crude oil and
natural gas properties exceeded the estimated fair value, and was therefore not recoverable. The
estimated fair value of approximately $1.0 million, excluding estimated salvage value of $1.1
million, was determined based on estimated future discounted net cash flows, a Level 3 input,
using estimated production and prices at which the Managing General Partner reasonably
expects this Partnership's crude oil and natural gas will be sold. This Partnership had no
impairments during the six months ended June 30, 2016.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Partnership Overview
Rockies Region 2006 Limited Partnership engages in the development, production and sale of
crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. This Partnership began crude oil and natural gas operations in
September 2006 and currently operates 63 gross (62.9 net) wells located in the Wattenberg Field
of Colorado. The Managing General Partner markets this Partnership's crude oil, natural gas and
NGLs production to midstream marketers. Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold primarily
under market-sensitive contracts in which the price varies as a result of market forces. PDC does
not charge a separate fee for the marketing of the crude oil, natural gas and NGLs because these
services are covered by the monthly well operating charge. Seasonal factors, such as effects of
weather on realized commodity prices, costs incurred and availability of PDC or third-party
owned pipeline capacity, and other factors such as high line pressures in the gathering system,
whether caused by heat or third-party facilities issues, may impact this Partnership's results.
Partnership Operating Results Overview
Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales increased 13%, or $44,000, for the six months ended June
30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, attributable to a 48% increase in sales volume,
offset in part by a decrease in the average sales price per barrel of crude oil equivalent ("Boe") of
23%. The average sales price per Boe was $22.63 for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $29.56 for the same period a year ago.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, this Partnership had a negligible net cash flow deficit
from operating activities as compared to a cash flow deficit from operating activities of $48,000 for
the comparable period of 2015. During six months ended June 30, 2016, this Partnership made
no quarterly cash distributions to the Managing General Partner or Investor Partners as cash
flows generated from crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales were utilized for operating activities
and this Partnership currently has outstanding payables to the Managing General Partner.
Modest crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales and negative cash flows from operations, as well
as anticipated future capital expenditures and asset retirement obligations, raise substantial
doubt about this Partnership’s ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 2, Going
Concern, to this Partnership's financial statements and Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital
Resources for additional information.

Crude Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Sales
Changes in Crude Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Sales Volumes. For the six months ended June
30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs
production, on an energy equivalency-basis, increased 48%, primarily attributable to a reduction
in system line pressures and, to a lesser extent, resumed production from certain wells that were
shut-in during the comparable 2015 period for well-bore integrity testing, per state regulations.
This Partnership experienced lower line pressures in the six months ended June 30, 2016 when
compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015 as gathering system line pressures decreased
following the commissioning of DCP Midstream’s Lucerne II plant in the summer of 2015 and the
Grand Parkway gas gathering project in December 2015 down to levels that were consistent with
the Managing General Partner's projections. Line pressures on the midstream system decreased
from an average of approximately 185 pounds per square inch ("psi") during the six months
ended June 30, 2015 to an average of approximately 135 psi during the six months ended June
30, 2016.As a result of the reduction in line pressures during the six months ended June 30,
2016, production from this Partnership's vertical wells increased by 48% compared to the six
months ended June 30, 2015. Despite experiencing lower pressures during the first six months of
2016 as compared to the comparable period of 2015, line pressures began to build toward the
end of the second quarter of 2016 as system volumes increased and the region experienced
warmer weather. Other contributing factors to the increase in line pressures were DCP Midstream
experiencing significant unexpected downtime during the quarter on some of its major plants, as
well as performing extensive scheduled maintenance on one of its higher capacity gas plants.
The Managing General Partner expects the gathering system pressures on the system to
stabilize and then decrease as cooler weather arrives by the end of the third quarter. Over time,
however, potential improvement will be offset by natural production declines. This Partnership
relies on its third-party midstream service provider to construct compression, gathering and
processing facilities to keep pace with production growth. As a result, the timing and availability
of additional facilities going forward is substantially beyond the Managing General Partner's
control. Falling commodity prices have resulted in reduced investment in midstream facilities by
some third parties, increasing the risk that sufficient midstream infrastructure will not be available
in future periods.
Changes in Crude Oil Sales. The approximate $34,000, or 12%, increase in crude oil sales for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the same prior year period, was attributable
to a production volume increase of 41%, offset in part by a decrease in the average selling price
of 20% per Bbl. The average selling price per Bbl was $34.73 for the current year six month
period compared to $43.61 for the same prior year period.
The decrease in crude oil sales for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the
same prior year period, was attributable to a decrease in the average selling price of 15% per
Bbl, offset in part by a production volume increase of 16%. The average selling price per Bbl was
$40.83 for the current year three month period compared to $48.04 for the same prior year period.
Changes in Natural Gas Sales. The 6% increase in natural gas sales during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the same prior year period, was attributable to a production
volume increase of 70%, offset in part by a decrease in the average selling price of 37% per Mcf.
The average selling price per Mcf was $1.45 for the current year six month period compared to
$2.31 for the same prior year period.
The approximate 17% increase in natural gas sales during the three months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to the same prior year period, was attributable to a production volume
increase of 79%, offset in part by a decrease in the average selling price of 35% per Mcf. The
average selling price per Mcf was $1.38 for the current year three month period compared to
$2.13 for the same prior year period.

(A West Virginia Limited Partnership)
Changes in NGLs Sales. The approximate $8,000, or 31%, increase in NGLs sales during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the same prior year period, resulted from the 38%
increase in production volume, partially offset by a 5% decrease in the average selling price per
Bbl. The average selling price per Bbl was $10.34 for the current year six month period
compared to $10.94 for the same prior year period.
The approximate $9,000, or 72%, increase in NGLs sales during the three months ended June
30, 2016 as compared to the same prior year period, resulted from the 36% increase in the
average selling price per Bbl and the 26% increase in production volume. The average selling
price per Bbl was $12.74 for the current year three month period compared to $9.35 for the same
prior year period.
Crude Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Pricing. This Partnership's results of operations depend upon
many factors, particularly the price of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, and the Managing General
Partner's ability to market this Partnership's production effectively. Crude oil, natural gas and
NGLs prices are among the most volatile of all commodity prices. While the price of crude oil
decreased during the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015, prices during the second
quarter of 2016 increased substantially compared to the first quarter of 2016 as the number of US
crude oil rigs and inventories declined. Natural gas prices also decreased during the first half of
2016 when compared to the same prior year period. Due to an oversupply of nearly all domestic
NGLs products, this Partnership's average realized sales price for NGLs during the first half of
2016 reflected the same low levels seen during the last quarter of 2015, although NGLs prices
were somewhat higher in the second quarter relative to the prior year period. With the initiation of
ethane exports and increased NGLs demand, NGLs prices are starting to trend upward.
This Partnership's crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales are recorded under the “net-back” as
purchasers of the commodities also provide transportation, gathering and processing services.
This Partnership sells commodities at the wellhead and collects a price and recognizes revenues
based on the wellhead sales price as transportation and processing costs downstream of the
wellhead are incurred by the purchaser and reflected in the wellhead price. The net-back method
results in the recognition of a sales price that is below the indices for which the production is
based.
Crude Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Production Costs
Generally, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production costs vary with changes in total crude oil,
natural gas and NGLs sales and production volumes. Production taxes are estimates by the
Managing General Partner based on tax rates determined using published information. These
estimates are subject to revision based on actual amounts determined during future filings by the
Managing General Partner with taxing authorities. Production taxes vary directly with crude oil,
natural gas and NGLs sales. Fixed monthly well operating costs increase on a per unit basis as
production decreases. In addition, general oil field services and all other costs vary and can
fluctuate based on services required, but are expected to increase as wells age and require more
extensive repair and maintenance. These costs include water hauling and disposal, equipment
repairs and maintenance, snow removal, environmental compliance and remediation and service
rig workovers.
Six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to six months ended June 30, 2015
Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production costs for the six months ended June 30, 2016
decreased $19,000 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily attributable to a decrease in
well swabbing costs and wireline work, fittings and lift system repair costs, offset in part by an
increase in production taxes, labor costs and metering charges by this Partnership's midstream
provider.
Three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to three months ended June 30, 2015
Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production costs for the three months ended June 30, 2016
decreased $16,000 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily attributable to a decrease in
well swabbing costs and wireline work, fixed monthly well operating costs, fittings and lift system
repair costs, offset in part by an increase in production taxes, labor costs and metering charges
by this Partnership's midstream provider.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
Six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to six months ended June 30, 2015
Depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A") expense related to crude oil and natural gas
properties is directly related to proved reserves and production volumes. DD&A expense
decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30,
2015 due to a decrease in the DD&A expense rate, partially offset by increased production
volumes. The DD&A expense rate per Boe decreased to $6.26 for the first six months of 2016
compared to $12.07 during the same period in 2015 due to the effect of impairments recorded in
2015 to write-down certain capitalized well costs on this Partnership's proved crude oil and
natural gas properties. Partially offsetting this decrease was the decline in proved developed
reserves at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014, as a result of the significant
decrease in SEC commodity prices utilized in the December 31, 2015 reserve report and the
removal of vertical re-fracs and re-completions from the proved developed reserves, due to the
current depressed commodity price environment.
Three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to three months ended June 30, 2015
DD&A expense increased for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three
months ended June 30, 2015 due to an increase in the DD&A expense rate and an increased
production volumes. The DD&A expense rate per Boe increased to $6.38 for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to $4.86 during the same period in 2015 due to the decline in
proved developed reserves at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014, as a
result of the significant decrease in SEC commodity prices utilized in the December 31, 2015
reserve report and the removal of vertical re-fracs and re-completions from the proved developed
reserves, due to the current depressed commodity price environment.

Impairment of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties
Six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to six months ended June 30, 2015
During the six months ended June 30, 2015 , this Partnership recognized an impairment charge
of approximately $3.3 million to write-down its proved crude oil and natural gas properties. The
impairment charge represented the amount by which the carrying value of the crude oil and
natural gas properties exceeded the estimated fair value, and was therefore not recoverable. The
estimated fair value of approximately $1.0 million, excluding estimated salvage value of $1.1
million, was determined based on estimated future discounted net cash flows, a Level 3 input,
using estimated production and prices at which the Managing General Partner reasonably
expects this Partnership's crude oil and natural gas will be sold. Further deterioration of
commodity prices could result in additional impairment charges to this Partnership's crude oil and
natural gas properties. See Note 8, Impairment of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties, to this
Partnership's financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.
Asset Retirement Obligations and Accretion Expense
Six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to six months ended June 30, 2015
Of the 63 wells in this partnership, 31 wells had an increase in production totaling approximately
8.0 MBoe, or 69%, during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same prior year
period and eight wells had a decrease in production totaling approximately 1.6 MBoe, or 14%,
during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same prior year period. The
remaining 24 wells did not produce or produced minimal amounts of hydrocarbons during both
periods. The Managing General Partner is reviewing the Partnership's wells that have the
potential to increase production during this lower line pressure environment by incurring minimal
expense. The Managing General Partner expects that a portion of this Partnership's wells may be
uneconomical to operate and may be plugged and abandoned. As a result, as of June 30, 2016,
this Partnership has classified a portion of the asset retirement obligation as a current liability.
Accretion of asset retirement obligations ("ARO") expense for the six months ended June 30,
2016 increased $21,000 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily attributable to an
increase in asset retirement obligations recorded in December 2015 to reflect increased
estimated costs for materials and services related to the plugging and abandonment of certain
vertical wells, as well as a decrease in the estimated useful life of these wells.
Three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to three months ended June 30, 2015
ARO expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased $11,000 compared to the
same period in 2015, primarily attributable to an increase in asset retirement obligations recorded
in December 2015 to reflect increased estimated costs for materials and services related to the
plugging and abandonment of certain vertical wells, as well as a decrease in the estimated
useful life of these wells.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Historically, this Partnership's primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operating
activities. Fluctuations in this Partnership's operating cash flows are substantially driven by
changes in commodity prices and sales volumes. This source of cash has been primarily used to
fund this Partnership's operating costs, direct costs-general and administrative, capital program
and distributions to the Investor Partners and the Managing General Partner.
This Partnership's future operations are expected to be conducted with available funds and
revenues generated from crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production activities. Greater cash flow
would most likely occur from improved commodity pricing and, to a lesser extent, a sustained
increase in production. However, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production from existing
properties are generally expected to continue a gradual decline in the rate of production over the
remaining life of the wells. Accordingly, this Partnership anticipates a lower annual level of crude
oil, natural gas and NGLs production and, therefore, lower revenues unless commodity prices
increase. Under these circumstances, decreased production would have a material adverse
impact on this Partnership's operations and may result in a continued lack of cash distributions to
the Managing General Partner and Investor Partners through 2016 and beyond. This Partnership
generated no liquidity during the six months ended June 30, 2016, as cash flows generated from
crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales were utilized for operating activities. Due to the significant
decrease in liquidity experienced in 2015 that has continued into 2016 and anticipated future
capital expenditures required to remain in compliance with certain regulatory requirements and to
satisfy asset retirement obligations, the Managing General Partner believes that cash flows from
operations will be insufficient to meet this Partnership’s obligations. Commodity prices during the
three months ended June 30, 2016 have shown improvement over pricing experienced during
the three months ended March 31, 2016. This level of price improvement alone is not likely to be
sufficient to alleviate concerns of this Partnership’s ability to meet its obligations. To meet such
obligations, this Partnership would likely need to continue to experience the production volume
improvement seen during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and commodity pricing would
need to significantly improve over pricing seen during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Beginning in the second quarter of 2015 and continuing through the six months ended June 30,
2016, this Partnership made no quarterly cash distributions to the Managing General Partner or
Investor Partners. See Note 2, Going Concern, included elsewhere in this report for additional
information.
Working Capital
At June 30, 2016, this Partnership had a working capital deficit of $356,000 compared to a
working capital deficit of $361,000 at December 31, 2015. The $5,000 decrease from
December 31, 2015 to June 30, 2016 was primarily due to the following changes:
•an increase in accounts receivable of $16,000; and
- 16-
Index
ROCKIES REGION 2006 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
(A West Virginia Limited Partnership)
•an increase in crude oil inventory of $15,000.
Offset in part by:
•an increase in the current portion of asset retirement obligations of $15,000; and
•an increase in amounts due to managing general partner, net of $10,000.
Although the D&O Agreement permits this Partnership to borrow funds on its behalf for
Partnership activities, the Managing General Partner does not anticipate electing to fund a
portion of this Partnership's activities, if any, through borrowings. Partnership borrowings, should
any occur, will be non-recourse to the Investor Partners. Accordingly, this Partnership, rather than
the Investor Partners, will be responsible for repaying any amounts borrowed.
Cash Flows
Operating Activities
This Partnership's cash flows from operating activities in the six months ended June 30, 2016
were primarily impacted by commodity prices, production volumes, operating costs and direct
costs-general and administrative expenses. The key components of the changes in this
Partnership's cash flows from operating activities are described in more detail in Results of
Operations above.
Net cash flow deficits from operating activities was negligible during the six months ended June
30, 2016 compared to net cash flow deficits from operating activities of $48,000 for the
comparable period in 2015. The increase of $48,000 in cash from operating activities was due
primarily to the following:
•an increase in crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales of $44,000;
•a decrease in production costs of $19,000; and
•a decrease in direct costs - general and administrative of $4,000.
Offset in part by:
•an decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities of $19,000.
In 2016, this Partnership plans to fund its operations from cash flows from operating activities;
however, this is dependent upon the commodity price environment. Greater cash flow would
most likely occur from improved commodity pricing and, to a lesser extent, a sustained increase
in production. The Managing General Partner is considering various options to maximize the
Partnership's liquidity, including, but not limited to, deferral of payment of certain obligations,
continued suspension of distributions to partners, partial or complete sale of assets and the
shutting-in of wells. However, there can be no assurance that this Partnership will be able to
generate sufficient liquidity. Failure to do so could result in a partial asset sale or some form of
bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of this Partnership.
Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities consist of investments in equipment. From time to time, this
Partnership invests in equipment which supports treatment, delivery and measurement of crude
oil, natural gas and NGLs or environmental protection. During the six months ended June 30,
2016, there was no cash expended for investment in equipment compared to $28,000 during the
six months ended June 30, 2015.
Financing Activities
This Partnership initiated monthly cash distributions to investors in May 2007 and has distributed
