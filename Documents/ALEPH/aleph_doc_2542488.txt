PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Through the second quarter of 2015, Enerplus continued to focus on operational execution under a disciplined capital program. We delivered production growth,
improved cost performance and maintained a strong financial position.
Production volumes grew by 7% quarter over quarter to 107,429 BOE per day. This growth was primarily driven by increased activity in North Dakota, where
production averaged approximately 27,100 BOE per day, up over 25% from the first quarter of 2015. We also saw growth from our gas portfolio with our Canadian
Deep Basin and Marcellus assets showing production increases over the first quarter of 2015. Our production mix was essentially unchanged from the previous
quarter, with crude oil and natural gas liquids accounting for 43% of production.
As a result of continued operational outperformance, we are increasing our average annual production guidance for both liquids and gas to 100,000-104,000 BOE
per day from 97,000-103,000 BOE per day. We expect approximately 44,000-46,000 barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids. This guidance includes
year to date divestments of approximately 1,900 BOE per day.
We spent $148 million in our core areas during the quarter, and are on track to meet our annual capital spending guidance of $540 million, despite the weak
Canadian dollar. Approximately 75% of spending in the quarter was directed to our North Dakota properties. In total we drilled 7.8 net wells and brought 22 net
wells on-stream across our portfolio in the second quarter.
Both operating costs and G&A expenses for the quarter came in lower than forecast, at $7.85 per BOE and $2.03 per BOE, respectively. Based on our cost
savings realized to date and our increased production target, we are decreasing our annual operating cost guidance to $9.25 per BOE from $9.75 per BOE and our
G&A expense guidance to $2.25 per BOE from $2.40 per BOE, representing a combined decrease of $0.65 per BOE.
Funds flow increased by 47% to $160 million from the first quarter. This was largely a result of higher production, lower costs and improved crude oil prices, and
despite slightly weaker gas pricing. Funds flow was also supported by our hedging program which generated gains of $73 million during the second quarter.
We incurred a non-cash asset impairment charge in the quarter of $497 million. Under U.S. GAAP we are required to use twelve month trailing average prices to
determine impairment, and consequently the impairment reflects the low commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first half of 2015.
During the quarter, we closed our previously announced non-core asset sales, along with the sale of additional minor non-core properties for proceeds of
$188 million.
Our focus on cost control, strong 2015 hedge position, divestment proceeds, and disciplined capital spending have helped preserve our strong financial position.
We ended the quarter with an improved trailing debt to funds flow ratio of 1.6 times, down from 1.7 times in the first quarter of 2015. At June 30, 2015, we were
approximately 8% drawn on our $1 billion credit facility. Following the next scheduled repayment of our senior notes in October 2015 of US$10.8 million, we have
no scheduled debt repayments until June of 2017.

Asset Activity
We re-established production growth in North Dakota in the second quarter of 2015. Production from Fort Berthold averaged approximately 27,100 BOE per day
during the quarter, up over 25% from the first quarter of 2015. We drilled 5.5 net wells in Fort Berthold with 9.2 net wells brought on-stream during the quarter for a
total capital outlay of $111 million.
We continue to run a one-rig drilling program as we work through our inventory of drilled uncompleted wells at Fort Berthold and expect to drill approximately 8 net
wells in the second half of the year. We are ahead of schedule on our 2015 completions activity. During the first six months of 2015 we brought approximately
13 net wells on stream. We expect to bring up to 10 additional net wells on stream during the second half of the year. This activity is broadly weighted towards
the third quarter and we expect production growth through the remainder of the year. Our high intensity completion design continues to yield excellent results. The
average initial 30 day production rate (IP30) of our operated on-stream wells in the quarter was over 2,000 BOE per day, exceeding our high end type curve. We
continue to see improved well costs with current costs down over 20% from 2014 levels.
In the Marcellus, continued low levels of spending ($12.6 million in the second quarter) led to 0.7 net wells drilled and 3.2 net wells on-stream. Despite the
reduced activity, well outperformance resulted in production of 201 MMcf per day during the second quarter, a modest increase from the previous quarter.
In the Deep Basin, we drilled three excellent wells at our Ansell pad. The average peak 30 day production rate for a well on the pad was approximately 10 MMcf
per day, on trend with our high end type curve.
4      ENERPLUS 2015 Q2 REPORT
Crude Oil & Natural Gas Pricing
The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark price for crude oil increased by 19% quarter-over-quarter to average US$57.94 per barrel in the second quarter.
The strength in WTI prices combined with the narrowing of crude oil differentials in both Canada and the U.S. resulted in a 32% improvement in the selling price
for our crude oil compared to the previous quarter. The average realized sales price for our crude oil was $58.26 per barrel during the quarter with crude oil
properties generating approximately 90% of our corporate netback.
On the natural gas side, both AECO and NYMEX weakened from the previous quarter due to continued high production and increased storage levels across the
continent. In the Marcellus, our realized differential widened US$0.07 per Mcf from the previous quarter to average US$1.39 per Mcf. Overall, as a result of lower
benchmark pricing and continued pricing weakness in the Marcellus producing region, our realized sales price for gas fell by 19% compared to the previous
quarter to average $2.09 per Mcf.
We continued to add to our commodity hedge position for both 2015 and 2016. For the second half of 2015, we have an average of 11,250 barrels per day of
crude oil hedged (representing approximately 35% of our expected crude oil production net of royalties) at an average floor price of US$84.58 per barrel through a
combination of swaps and three way collar structures. For 2016, we have an average of 11,000 barrels per day of crude oil hedged (representing approximately
34% of our expected crude oil production net of royalties) at an average floor price of US$64.35 per barrel through a combination of swaps and three way collar
structures.
We have also added to our NYMEX gas hedging position. For the second half of 2015, we are swapped on an average of 128 MMcf per day at an average price of
US$3.82 per Mcf, representing approximately 47% of our forecasted natural gas production after royalties. For 2016, we have 25 MMcf per day, or 9% of our
forecasted natural gas production after royalties, hedged through three-way collars with an average floor price of US$3.00 per Mcf.
Outlook
We delivered another quarter of strong operating results. On the back of this operational momentum and improved cost efficiencies, we are increasing our 2015
production guidance and reducing our operating and G&A expense guidance.
We continue to navigate through this challenging commodity price environment with a strong balance sheet and hedging program that will support our funds flow.
We remain focused on driving improvement in our operational efficiencies through both reducing our cost structures and optimizing well performance. Above all,
the low commodity prices have not stopped us from committing the time and resources to ensure safe, responsible and sustainable operations across
our business.

MD&A
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ("MD&A")
The following discussion and analysis of financial results is dated August 6, 2015 and is to be read in conjunction with:
•
•
•
the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Enerplus Corporation ("Enerplus" or the "Company") as at and for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 (the "Interim Financial Statements");
the audited consolidated financial statements of Enerplus as at December 31, 2014 and 2013 and for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and
2012; and
our MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2014 (the "Annual MD&A").
The following MD&A contains forward-looking information and statements. We refer you to the end of the MD&A under "Forward-Looking Information and
Statements" for further information. The following MD&A also contains financial measures that do not have a standardized meaning as prescribed by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). See "Non-GAAP Measures" below for further information.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The Interim Financial Statements and notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP including the prior period comparatives. All amounts are stated in
Canadian dollars unless otherwise specified and all other references relate to the notes included in the Interim Financial Statements.
Where applicable, natural gas has been converted to barrels of oil equivalent ("BOE") based on 6 Mcf:1 BOE and oil and natural gas liquids ("NGL") have been
converted to thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent ("Mcfe") based on 0.167 bbl:1 Mcfe. BOE and Mcfe measures are based on an energy equivalent conversion
method primarily applicable at the burner tip and do not represent a value equivalent at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of
natural gas as compared to crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an
indication of value. Use of BOE and Mcfe in isolation may be misleading. All production volumes are presented on a Company interest basis, being the
Company's working interest share before deduction of any royalties paid to others, plus the Company's royalty interest unless otherwise stated. Company interest
is not a term defined in Canadian National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities and may not be comparable to information
produced by other entities.
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, oil and gas sales are presented net of royalties in our Interim Financial Statements. Under International Financial Reporting
Standards, industry standard is to present oil and gas sales before deduction of royalties and as such this MD&A presents production, oil and gas sales, and
BOE measures on this basis to remain comparable with our peers.
NON-GAAP MEASURES
The Company utilizes the following terms for measurement within the MD&A that do not have a standardized meaning or definition as prescribed by U.S. GAAP
and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other entities:
"Netback" is used by Enerplus and is useful to investors and securities analysts in evaluating operating performance of our crude oil and natural gas assets. The
term netback is calculated as oil and natural gas sales less royalties, production taxes, cash operating costs and transportation.

"Debt to Funds Flow Ratio" is used by Enerplus and is useful to investors and securities analysts in analyzing leverage and liquidity. The debt to funds flow
ratio is calculated as total debt net of cash, divided by a trailing 12 months of funds flow. This measure is not equivalent to Debt to Earnings before Interest,
Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization and other non-cash charges ("EBITDA") and is not a debt covenant.
"Adjusted Payout Ratio" is used by Enerplus and is useful to investors and securities analysts in analyzing operating performance, leverage and liquidity. We
calculate our adjusted payout ratio as cash dividends plus capital and office expenditures divided by funds flow.

Cash dividends exclude stock dividend plan proceeds in 2014.
In addition, the Company uses certain financial measures within the "Overview" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" sections of this MD&A that do not have a
standardized meaning or definition as prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other entities.
Such measures include "Senior Debt to EBITDA", "Total Debt to EBITDA", "Total Debt to Capitalization", "maximum debt to consolidated present value of total
proven reserves" and "EBITDA to Interest" and are used to determine the Company's compliance with financial covenants under its bank credit facility and
outstanding senior notes. Calculation of such terms is described under the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD&A.
ENERPLUS 2015 Q2 REPORT      7
OVERVIEW
Our strong operational performance continued in the second quarter as we delivered production growth and met or exceeded all our guidance targets. As a result,
we are increasing our 2015 production guidance and lowering our operating cost and general and administrative ("G&A") expense guidance by $0.65/BOE,
combined. All other guidance targets are maintained.
Average daily production for the second quarter was 107,429 BOE/day, exceeding our annual average production guidance range of 97,000-103,000 BOE/day.
Production increased approximately 6,600 BOE/day or 7% from the first quarter of 2015. The majority of the production growth was driven by our ongoing
development in Fort Berthold, North Dakota, where production increased 26% or approximately 5,600 BOE/day compared to the first quarter. Natural gas
production increased 6% from the prior quarter due to the ongoing development of our Canadian deep gas properties and well outperformance in the Marcellus.
Based on our continued operational success, we are increasing our production guidance range to 100,000-104,000 BOE/day and expect approximately 44,000-
46,000 bbls/day of crude oil and natural gas liquids.
We maintained a disciplined capital program with spending of $148.0 million in our core areas during the quarter and are on track to meet our annual capital
spending guidance of $540.0 million.
Both operating costs and G&A expenses came in below guidance, at $76.7 million or $7.85/BOE and $19.9 million or $2.03/BOE, respectively. As a result of our
continued focus on cost control and increased production target, we are decreasing our operating cost guidance to $9.25/BOE from $9.75/BOE and our G&A
expense guidance to $2.25/BOE from $2.40/BOE, representing a combined decrease of $0.65/BOE.
Funds flow increased by 47% to $160.4 million from $109.2 million in the first quarter as a result of production growth and higher oil prices, along with the impact
of one-time expenses experienced in the first quarter. Compared to the same period in 2014, funds flow decreased by approximately $52.8 million or 25% as oil
and natural gas sales reflected the significant decline in commodity prices. Our hedging program provided additional revenue, generating gains of $73.1 million in
the quarter compared to losses of $24.5 million in the same period of 2014.
Under U.S. GAAP, we recorded a net loss of $312.5 million for the quarter compared to net income of $40.0 million in the second quarter of 2014. The continued
decline in the twelve month trailing average commodity price resulted in an asset impairment of $497.2 million in the quarter. Year to date, we have recorded
cumulative asset impairments of $764.9 million. We expect the twelve month trailing prices used to calculate impairment charges in accordance with U.S. GAAP
to decline further, which may lead to additional write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties in the second half of 2015.
Despite a decline in commodity prices during the first half of 2015 we remain in a strong financial position. At June 30, 2015 we were approximately 8% drawn on
our $1.0 billion credit facility and had a conservative debt to funds flow ratio of 1.6x and senior debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5x. After a US$10.8 million senior note
repayment due in the fourth quarter of 2015 we will have no term debt principal repayments due until June of 2017. We have added significantly to our hedging
program during the quarter and continue to expect our risk management program to protect our balance sheet and a portion of our funds flow in the second half of
2015 and into 2016.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Production
Production for the second quarter totaled 107,429 BOE/day, exceeding our guidance range of 97,000-103,000 BOE/day and increasing 7% compared to
100,855 BOE/day in the first quarter of 2015. This increase was driven primarily by growth in our Fort Berthold production, which increased 26% or
5,600 BOE/day compared to the prior quarter. We brought on 9.2 net wells in Fort Berthold during the quarter compared to 3.6 net wells in the first quarter. Based
on our decision to accelerate the completion of eight additional wells during the second half of 2015 we expect modest production growth in the region. Natural
gas production increased by 6% from the prior quarter due to our ongoing development program in the Canadian Deep Basin as well as continued well
outperformance in the Marcellus.
Production in the second quarter of 2015 increased by 3% from 103,987 BOE/day in the same period of 2014 primarily due to an increase in Fort Berthold crude
oil production. Natural gas production remained relatively flat compared to the second quarter of 2014, with growth in our Marcellus and Canadian Deep Basin
production offset by the divestment of non-core Canadian natural gas properties in the second half of 2014.

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Liquids
WTI crude oil prices increased by 19% versus the previous quarter to average US$57.94/bbl during the second quarter of 2015. Although crude oil inventories in
the U.S. reached record levels of 491 million barrels in April, strong seasonal demand for gasoline and early indications of slowing crude oil production growth in
the U.S. resulted in inventory levels falling and WTI prices trading over US$60/bbl. However, increasing concerns over the Chinese economy and its potential
negative impact on crude oil demand growth, the nuclear agreement with Iran that will
ENERPLUS 2015 Q2 REPORT      9
eventually allow increased Iranian production to return to the market and the ongoing debt crisis in Greece all contributed to the decline of WTI to under US$50/bbl
by mid-July.
The strength in WTI prices during the second quarter combined with improved realized crude oil differentials resulted in a 32% improvement in selling price for our
crude oil compared to the previous quarter. Crude oil differentials in Canada strengthened considerably during the second quarter, due largely to scheduled oil
sands maintenance and other unplanned outages from forest fires in Northern Alberta reducing production. As a result, WCS differentials to WTI narrowed by
US$3.14/bbl to average US$11.59/bbl below WTI and light sweet crude oil differentials in Canada narrowed by US$3.74/bbl to average US$3.06/bbl below WTI.
The strength in light sweet differentials helped support our Bakken differentials as well, which narrowed by US$2.35/bbl quarter over quarter to average
US$9.30/bbl below WTI during the second quarter. We expect both heavy and light oil differentials in Canada and the U.S. to widen for the rest of the year relative
to the second quarter, as production is stabilizing in the affected regions.
The decline in crude oil prices over the past twelve months and the level of natural gas liquids production across the continent continues to depress North
American natural gas liquids prices, specifically propane. As propane production and inventories in Canada and the U.S. grow, it has resulted in negative
benchmark prices for propane during May and June. However, stronger WTI prices during the quarter helped stabilize market prices for butanes and condensate,
partially offsetting the weakness in propane prices. Our realized price for our natural gas liquids production fell by 7% quarter over quarter to average $20.88/bbl.
Natural Gas
Both AECO monthly index and NYMEX natural gas prices fell by 9% and 11%, respectively, versus the previous quarter due to continued high production and
increased storage levels across the continent. U.S. dry gas production in June was approximately 3.0 Bcf/day higher than last year while U.S. storage levels
ended the quarter in line with the five year average. Although production remains high, demand for natural gas fired power generation increased relative to
previous years as natural gas prices were low enough to incentivize generators to switch from coal to natural gas as a fuel for power generation. This increased
power demand, combined with higher than expected exports from the U.S. to Mexico, provided some price support by offsetting the continued strong North
American production. However, even with the extra demand and normal weather, the strong production may push storage inventories to test the upper end of
capacity levels by the end of October.
In Western Canada, there were ongoing service interruptions and restrictions in certain areas of the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. ("NGTL") pipeline system as
TransCanada was required by the National Energy Board to carry out thorough safety inspections of smaller diameter pipelines. These restrictions, combined with
other unplanned maintenance issues across the system, have caused many producers in Western Canada to curtail natural gas production. Overall, we have
been able to limit the impact on Enerplus through holding firm transportation in our key areas and actively managing transportation shortfalls at affected locations.
We had on average roughly 5 MMcfe/day of natural gas production temporarily curtailed during the quarter due to these restrictions. We anticipate the curtailment
of transportation services to ease somewhat before the end of the year, however, the issue may persist into 2016 as further NGTL safety inspections
are required.
Our overall realized sales price for natural gas fell by 19% compared to the previous quarter to average $2.09/Mcf. This is in line with the combination of weaker
NYMEX pricing and continued weakness in the Marcellus producing region. While the average of spot market prices in Northeast Pennsylvania at the Transco
Leidy and TGP Zone 4 Marcellus were roughly unchanged from the first quarter, outside of the northeast Pennsylvania producing region prices at Dominion South
Point fell by 24% to average US$1.40/Mcf in the quarter. With approximately 37% of our Marcellus production tied to markets outside the northeast Pennsylvania
producing region that all realized wider differentials to NYMEX versus the previous quarter, our overall realized discount to NYMEX for our Marcellus production
widened by 5% or US$0.07/Mcf versus the first quarter to average US$1.39/Mcf.
Foreign Exchange
The Canadian dollar strengthened during the second quarter, increasing a modest 2% as a result of higher crude oil prices. Subsequent to the quarter, we saw the
Canadian dollar fall to a six year low USD/CDN exchange rate of 1.30 following the Bank of Canada's decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points and lower
their forecasted economic growth for 2015. The majority of our oil and natural gas sales are based on U.S. dollar denominated indices and therefore a weaker
Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar increases the amount of our realized sales. Because we report in Canadian dollars, the weaker Canadian dollar also
increases our U.S. dollar denominated operating costs, capital spending and the principal and interest on our U.S. dollar denominated senior notes.
10      ENERPLUS 2015 Q2 REPORT
Price Risk Management
We have a price risk management program that considers our overall financial position, the economics of our capital program and potential acquisitions. We
continued to add to our commodity hedge position in both 2015 and 2016 as a result of the modest improvement in crude oil prices during the quarter along with
our decision to accelerate the completions of eight additional North Dakota wells. For the second half of 2015 we have an average of 11,250 bbls/day of crude oil
(approximately 35% of our expected crude oil production, net of royalties) hedged at an average floor price of US$84.58/bbl through a combination of swaps and
three-way collar structures. In 2016 we have an average of 11,000 bbls/day of crude oil (approximately 34% of our expected crude oil production, net of royalties)
hedged at an average floor price of US$64.35/bbl through a combination of swaps and three-way collar structures.
We continued to add to our NYMEX gas hedging program for 2015 and began hedging our 2016 gas production during the quarter. In the second half of 2015 we
are swapped on an average of 128,370 Mcf/day (approximately 47% of our forecasted natural gas production, net of royalties) at an average price of
US$3.82/Mcf. In 2016 we have 25,000 Mcf/day (approximately 9% of our forecasted natural gas production, net of royalties) hedged through three-way collars
with an average floor price of US$3.00/Mcf.

Based on weighted average price (before premiums), assumed average annual production of 100,000 – 104,000 BOE/day for
2015 and 2016, less royalties and production taxes of 21.0% in aggregate.
We have also entered into WCS and MSW differential swap positions to manage our exposure to Canadian crude oil differentials. At July 22, 2015, we have
4,000 bbls/day of WCS swapped at US$(16.61)/bbl and 1,000 bbls/day of MSW swapped at US$(3.50)/bbl in the second half of 2015 and 2,000 bbls/day of WCS
swapped at US$(14.50)/bbl in 2016.
We have physically hedged a portion of our exposure to AECO differentials versus NYMEX prices through to October 2019. These basis transactions are
intended to protect against weakening natural gas prices in Alberta as increased production from the Marcellus is expected to flow into Ontario and the
U.S. Midwest over the coming years. There is also a risk of weaker AECO prices as a result of continued growth in natural gas production in advance of potential
Canadian west coast liquefied natural gas exports.

In 2014 we entered into foreign exchange collars on US$24 million per month to hedge a floor exchange rate on a portion of our U.S. dollar denominated oil and
natural gas sales with upside participation in the event the Canadian dollar weakened. During the second quarter of 2015 we entered into U.S. dollar forward
exchange contracts on US$6 million per month at an exchange rate of USD/CDN 1.20 to partially mitigate our losses on these collars. As of July 22, 2015, we
effectively have US$18 million per month hedged for 2015 at an average USD/CDN floor of 1.1088, a ceiling of 1.1845 and a conditional ceiling of 1.1263. Under
these contracts, if the monthly foreign exchange rate settles above the ceiling rate the conditional celling is used to determine the settlement amount.

During the second quarter of 2015 we realized cash gains of $56.7 million on our crude oil contracts and $16.4 million on our natural gas contracts. In comparison,
during the second quarter of 2014 we realized cash losses of $21.2 million on our crude oil contracts and $3.3 million on our natural gas contracts. The cash
gains in 2015 were due to contracts which provided floor protection above market prices, while cash losses in 2014 were a result of prices rising above our fixed
price swap positions.
As the forward markets for crude oil and natural gas fluctuate and new contracts are executed and existing contracts are realized, changes in fair value are
reflected as either a non-cash charge or gain to earnings. At the end of the second quarter of 2015 the fair value of our crude oil and
12      ENERPLUS 2015 Q2 REPORT
natural gas contracts represented net gain positions of $60.1 million and $27.1 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 the
change in the fair value of our crude oil contracts represented losses of $71.1 million and $107.1 million, respectively, and our natural gas contracts represented
losses of $21.8 million and $22.2 million, respectively.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 we recorded total cash losses on our foreign exchange collars of $7.1 million and $15.7 million,
respectively. At June 30, 2015 the fair value of foreign exchange derivatives was a net loss of $12.5 million. See Note 15 for further information.

Royalties are paid to government entities, land owners and mineral rights owners. Production taxes include state production taxes, Pennsylvania impact fees,
freehold mineral taxes and Saskatchewan resource surcharges. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 royalties and production taxes decreased
to $60.9 million and $110.8 million, respectively, from $109.6 million and $216.7 million for the same periods in 2014, primarily due to lower realized prices.
Royalties and production taxes averaged 20% of oil and natural gas sales before transportation in the first half of 2015 compared to 22% for the same period
in 2014.
We continue to expect an average royalty and production tax rate of 21% in 2015.

As of January 1, 2015 we have reclassified Marcellus gathering costs from operating expenses to transportation costs. These charges relate to pipeline costs
paid to third parties to transport saleable natural gas from the lease to downstream points of sale. This is a presentation change
ENERPLUS 2015 Q2 REPORT      13
with no impact on our netback, funds flow or net income. All comparative periods have been presented to conform with the current period presentation.
Operating expenses continued to trend lower as a result of our cost saving initiatives. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 operating expenses
were $76.7 million or $7.85/BOE and $164.5 million or $8.72/BOE, respectively, compared to $86.0 million or $9.09/BOE and $165.9 million or $9.03/BOE for the
same periods in 2014. The decrease in operating costs during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to realized cost savings in repairs and maintenance and
well servicing, which were offset somewhat by the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar on our U.S. dollar denominated operating costs.
Based on our cost savings realized to date and our increased production guidance we are reducing our 2015 guidance for operating expenses to $9.25/BOE from
$9.75/BOE. Although year to date operating costs are below our revised guidance, we anticipate an increase in operating costs during the second half of 2015 as
a result of the seasonality of some spend and scheduled facility turnarounds.

As discussed previously in operating expenses, we have reclassified Marcellus gathering costs from operating expenses to transportation costs. This is a
presentation change with no impact on our netback, funds flow or net income. All comparative periods have been presented to conform with the current period
presentation.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 transportation costs were $28.0 million or $2.87/BOE and $54.5 million or $2.89/BOE, respectively, compared
to $22.6 million or $2.39/BOE and $45.0 million or $2.45/BOE for the same periods in 2014. The increase in transportation costs was due to higher
U.S. production and the impact of a weakening Canadian dollar on our U.S. dollar denominated costs.
We are maintaining our transportation cost guidance of $3.00/BOE.
Netbacks
The crude oil and natural gas classifications below contain properties according to their dominant production category. These properties may include associated
crude oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids volumes which have been converted to the equivalent BOE/day or Mcfe/day and as such, the revenue per BOE or per
Mcfe may not correspond with the average selling price under the "Pricing" section of this MD&A. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
with current period presentations.

Our crude oil properties accounted for 88% of our corporate netback before hedging for the first half of 2015 compared to 71% for the same period in 2014. Crude
oil and natural gas netbacks per BOE decreased significantly for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in 2014 primarily
due to the decline in commodity prices over the past twelve months. Realized cash hedging gains and lower royalty rates helped to offset the impact of
lower prices.

Cash G&A expenses during the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 were $19.9 million or $2.03/BOE and $41.3 million or $2.19/BOE, respectively,
compared to $18.7 million or $1.97/BOE and $39.2 million or $2.14/BOE for the same periods in 2014. The increase in cash G&A expenses from the prior year
related primarily to one-time severance payments of $2.5 million during the first half of 2015.
During the quarter, our share price decreased by 15% resulting in a cash SBC recovery of $1.2 million or $0.13/BOE compared to an expense of $10.7 million or
$1.12/BOE in the same period of 2014. We recorded non-cash SBC of $4.6 million or $0.47/BOE in the second quarter compared to $3.5 million or $0.37/BOE
during the same period in 2014. The increase in non-cash SBC was due to additional grants issued under the plans.
We have hedged a portion of the outstanding cash settled grants under our LTI plans. As a result of the decrease in our share price during the quarter we
recorded a non-cash mark-to-market loss of $1.0 million on these hedges. As of June 30, 2015 we had 524,000 units hedged at a weighted average price of
$16.51/share.
Based on our increased production guidance and continued focus on cost control, we are reducing our 2015 guidance for cash G&A expenses to $2.25/BOE from
$2.40/BOE. We do not provide guidance for SBC because it is dependent on our share price and our relative performance to our peers.

For the three and six month period ended June 30, 2015 we recorded total interest expense of $16.1 million and $33.2 million, respectively, compared to
$16.5 million and $31.7 million for the same periods in 2014. The increase in interest expense for the six month period corresponds to an increase in higher
interest rate senior notes following our September 2014 private placement of US$200 million and the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar on our U.S. dollar
denominated interest expense. This was somewhat offset by senior note repayments of $88.9 million in June funded by lower rate floating bank debt, along with
an overall decrease in our drawn credit facility balance following the receipt of net divestment proceeds of $187.8 million during the second quarter.
Non-cash amounts recorded in interest expense include amortization of deferred financing charges. See Note 11 for further details.
At June 30, 2015 approximately 93% of our debt was based on fixed interest rates and 7% on floating interest rates, with weighted average interest rates of 5.2%
and 2.6%, respectively.

Realized losses in the second quarter included net payments of $7.1 million on our foreign exchange collars and forward contracts along with losses on day-to-
day transactions recorded in foreign currencies. During the six months ended June 30, 2015 we recorded realized gains of $27.2 million primarily due to a
$39.9 million gain on the unwind of our US$175 million foreign exchange swaps and losses of $15.7 million on our foreign exchange collars.
Unrealized gains and losses include the translation of U.S. dollar debt and working capital and unrealized gains or losses on our foreign exchange derivatives.

$422.2 million for the same periods in 2014. Although spending has slowed in the first half of 2015 due to continued weakness in commodity prices, we continued
to invest modestly in our core areas. During the second quarter we spent $110.6 million on our Fort Berthold crude oil properties, $17.3 million on our Canadian
crude properties, $12.6 million on our Marcellus assets and $7.3 million on our deep gas properties in Canada.
During the second quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of non-core assets for combined proceeds of $187.8 million, net of closing costs, which includes the
previously announced sale of our Pembina waterflood assets.
ENERPLUS 2015 Q2 REPORT      17
There were no acquisitions during the second quarter of 2015, although we recorded adjustments pertaining to prior period property acquisitions. In comparison,
during the second quarter of 2014 we spent $3.2 million on minor property and land acquisitions.
Despite the impact of the weakening Canadian dollar on our U.S. dollar denominated spending we continue to expect annual capital spending of $540 million.

DDA&A of property, plant and equipment ("PP&E") is recognized using the unit-of-production method based on proved reserves. For the three and six months
ended June 30, 2015 DDA&A per BOE decreased when compared the same periods of 2014 primarily due to additional reserves recognized in the 2014 year-end
reserves evaluation and the effect of the previous impairment on our book value.
Impairment
Under U.S. GAAP, entities using full cost oil and gas accounting are subject to a ceiling test performed on a country by country basis using estimated after-tax
future net cash flows discounted at 10% from proved reserves using SEC constant prices ("Standardized Measure"). SEC prices are calculated as the
unweighted average of the trailing twelve first-day-of-the-month commodity prices. The Standardized Measure is not related to Enerplus' investment criteria and is
not a fair value based measurement, but rather a prescribed accounting calculation. Under U.S. GAAP impairments are not reversible in future periods.
The trailing twelve month average crude oil and natural gas prices decreased significantly in the first half of the year, resulting in non-cash impairments of
$497.2 million and $764.9 million (before tax) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. We did not record any ceiling test impairments on
our oil and natural gas properties in 2014. We expect the twelve month trailing prices used in the ceiling test calculation to decline further which may lead to
additional write downs of our oil and natural gas properties. See Note 5 for trailing twelve month prices and further information.
Asset Retirement Obligation
In connection with our operations we incur abandonment and reclamation costs related to assets such as surface leases, wells, facilities and pipelines. Total
asset retirement obligations included on our balance sheet are estimated by Enerplus based on our net ownership interest, anticipated costs to abandon and
reclaim and the timing of the costs to be incurred in future periods. We have estimated the net present value of our asset retirement obligation to be
$282.5 million at June 30, 2015 compared to $288.7 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to the Pembina property divestment in the
second quarter of 2015. Asset retirement obligation settlements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $2.6 million and $6.5 million,
respectively, compared to $4.2 million and $8.5 million for the same periods in 2014. See Note 8 for further information.

We recorded a total tax recovery of $221.8 million and $360.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively, compared to a $16.5 million
and $48.7 million expense for the same periods in 2014. The decrease in total tax expense is primarily due to lower income in
18      ENERPLUS 2015 Q2 REPORT
2015 which includes non-cash ceiling test impairments totaling $497.2 million and $764.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively.
Given the decrease in commodity prices and U.S. forecasted net income for the year, we expect current tax of less than 1% of our U.S. funds flow in 2015. Our
U.S. current tax is comprised mainly of Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT") payable with respect to our U.S. subsidiary. We expect to recover any AMT paid in
future years as an offset to regular U.S. income taxes otherwise payable. We do not expect to pay any cash taxes in Canada in 2015.
As a result, an overall current tax recovery of $0.1 million and nil has been recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively, compared
to a $3.8 million and $11.5 million expense for the same periods in 2014.
These estimates may vary depending on numerous factors including commodity prices, capital spending, tax regulations and acquisitions and divestment
activity. See Note 13 for further information.

20      ENERPLUS 2015 Q2 REPORT
Oil and natural gas sales increased during the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2015 as production volumes increased and oil prices improved.
From the first quarter of 2013, oil and natural gas sales increased steadily until the third quarter of 2014 when realized commodity prices began to decline
significantly. Net income in the first half of 2015 was impacted by asset impairments related to the decrease in the trailing twelve month average commodity
prices used to calculate impairments. We did not record any asset impairments in 2013 or 2014.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
There are numerous factors that influence how we assess our liquidity and leverage including commodity price cycles, capital spending levels, acquisition and
divestment plans, hedging and dividend levels. We also assess our leverage relative to our most restrictive debt covenant, which is a senior debt to EBITDA
threshold of 3.5x for a period of up to six months, after which it drops to 3.0x. At June 30, 2015 our senior debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.5x and our debt to funds
flow ratio was 1.6x. The debt to funds flow ratio is often used by investors and analysts to evaluate our liquidity, however, this measure is not part of our
debt covenants.
Total debt net of cash at June 30, 2015 was $1,120.7 million compared to $1,134.9 million at December 31, 2014. Total debt was comprised of $80.4 million of
bank indebtedness and $1,041.3 million of senior notes less $1.0 million in cash. At June 30, 2015 we were approximately 8% drawn on our $1.0 billion senior
unsecured bank facility.
During the second quarter, we repaid debt of $88.9 million on the final maturities of our US$40.0 million and $40.0 million senior notes. Following the
October 1, 2015 repayment of US$10.8 million on our maturing US$54 million senior notes, we have no scheduled debt repayments until June of 2017, with
remaining maturities extending to 2026.
Our working capital deficiency, excluding cash and current deferred financial and tax balances, decreased to $164.7 million at June 30, 2015 from $290.6 million
at December 31, 2014. We expect to finance our working capital deficit through funds flow and our bank credit facility.
Our adjusted payout ratio, which is calculated as cash dividends plus capital and office expenditures divided by funds flow, was 112% and 147% for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively, compared to 120% and 119% for the same periods in 2014. We have continued to maintain our financial flexibility
through an ongoing focus on cost efficiencies and the success of our non-core asset divestment program. After adjusting for net acquisition and divestment
proceeds, our adjusted payout ratio for the six months ended June 30, 2015 decreases to 75%.
As previously announced, in order to maintain our balance sheet strength we have reduced our monthly dividend by 44% to $0.05/share from $0.09/share
effective with our March 2015 dividend, paid in April. Although we have revised capital spending guidance to $540 million to accelerate North Dakota oil well
completions, our overall capital spending budget remains 33% lower than 2014 spending levels.
We have a $1.0 billion senior, unsecured, covenant-based bank credit facility that matures on October 31, 2017. Drawn fees range between 150 and 315 basis
points over Banker's Acceptance rates, with current drawn fees of 170 basis points. The bank credit facility ranks equally with our senior, unsecured, covenant-
based notes. At June 30, 2015 we were in compliance with all covenants under our bank credit facility and outstanding senior notes. Our bank credit facility and
senior note purchase agreements have been filed as material documents on our SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com.
The following table lists our financial covenants as at June 30, 2015:

"Senior Debt" is calculated as the sum of drawn amounts on our bank credit facility, outstanding letters of credit and the principal
amount of senior notes.
"EBITDA" is calculated as net income less interest, taxes, depletion, depreciation, amortization, accretion and non-cash gains and
losses. EBITDA is calculated on a trailing twelve month basis and is adjusted for material acquisitions and divestments. EBITDA for
the three months and the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2015 were $176.2 million and $780.6 million, respectively.
"Total Debt" is calculated as the sum of Senior Debt plus subordinated debt. Enerplus currently does not have any
subordinated debt.
"Capitalization" is calculated as the sum of total debt and shareholder's equity plus a $1.1 billion adjustment related to our adoption
of U.S. GAAP.
Footnotes

Upon completion of a material acquisition, the Total Debt to Capitalization maximum ratio may increase to 55% for a period
extending to and including the second full fiscal quarter after the completion of the acquisition.
Senior Debt to EBITDA maximum ratio for the senior notes may increase to 3.5x for a period of 6 months, after which the ratio
decreases to 3.0x.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 we reported total dividends of $30.9 million ($0.15/share) and $78.3 million ($0.38/share), respectively,
compared to $55.2 million ($0.27/share) and $110.1 million ($0.54/share) for the same periods in 2014.
Effective with the April 2015 payment, we reduced the monthly dividend by 44% from $0.09 per share to $0.05 per share to preserve our balance sheet strength.
During the second quarter, our dividends represented approximately 19% of our funds flow and at current levels we expect to spend approximately $124 million
annually on dividends, a decrease from $221.1 million in 2014. Additionally, in September 2014 we elected to suspend our stock dividend plan, thereby
eliminating any dilution resulting from issuing shares as part of our dividend plan.
The dividend is an important part of our strategy to create shareholder value and we will continue to monitor commodity prices and economic conditions and are
prepared to make adjustments as necessary.

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a – 15 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as defined in Canada under National Instrument 52-109,
Certification of disclosure in Issuer's Annual and Interim Filings. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Enerplus
Corporation have concluded that, as at June 30, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were effective. There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period beginning on April 1, 2015 and ended June 30, 2015 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information relating to Enerplus, including our current Annual Information Form, is available under our profile on the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com,
on the EDGAR website at www.sec.gov and at www.enerplus.com.
FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION AND STATEMENTS
This MD&A contains certain forward-looking information and forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws ("forward-looking
information"). The use of any of the words "expect", "anticipate", "continue", "estimate", "guidance", "objective", "ongoing", "may", "will", "project", "should",
"believe", "plans", intends", "budget", "strategy" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking information. In particular, but without limiting the
foregoing, this MD&A contains forward-looking information pertaining to the following: expected 2015 average production volumes and the anticipated production
mix; the proportion of our anticipated oil and gas production that is hedged and the effectiveness of such hedges in protecting our balance sheet and funds flow;
our commodity and foreign exchange risk management programs in 2015 and in the future; the results from our drilling program and the timing of related
production; oil and natural gas prices, including twelve month trailing prices used in calculation of a ceiling test impairment under U.S. GAAP; expectations
regarding our realized oil and natural gas prices; future royalty rates on our production and future production taxes; anticipated cash and non-cash G&A, share-
based compensation and financing expenses; operating and transportation costs; capital spending levels in 2015 and its impact on our production level; potential
future asset impairments; the amount of our future abandonment and reclamation costs and asset retirement obligations; future environmental expenses; our
future royalty and production and U.S. cash taxes; deferred income taxes, our tax pools and expectations regarding Canadian cash taxes; future debt and working
capital levels and debt-to-funds-flow ratio and adjusted payout ratio, financial capacity, liquidity and capital resources to fund capital spending and working capital
requirements; our future acquisitions and dispositions, including timing thereof and expected use of proceeds therefrom; and the amount of future cash dividends
that we may pay to our shareholders.
The forward-looking information contained in this MD&A reflects several material factors, expectations and assumptions including, without limitation: that we will
conduct our operations and achieve results of operations as anticipated; that our development plans will achieve the expected results; that lack of adequate
infrastructure will not result in further curtailment of production and/or reduced realized prices; current commodity price and cost assumptions; the general
continuance of current or, where applicable, assumed industry conditions; the continuation of assumed tax, royalty and regulatory regimes; the accuracy of the
estimates of our reserve and resource volumes; the continued availability of adequate debt and/or equity financing and funds flow to fund our capital, operating
and working capital requirements, and dividend payments, as needed; the continued availability and sufficiency of our funds flow and availability under our bank
credit facility to fund our working capital deficiency; the availability of third party services; and the extent of our liabilities. In addition, our 2015 guidance
contained in this MD&A is based on the following July 22, 2015 forward prices: a WTI price of US$51.99/bbl, a NYMEX price of US$2.89/Mcf, and AECO price of
$2.75/GJ and a CDN/USD exchange rate of 1.27.
We believe the material factors, expectations and assumptions reflected in the forward-looking information are reasonable but no assurance can be given that
these factors, expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct. The forward-looking information included in this MD&A is not a guarantee of future
performance and should be unduly relied upon. Such information involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results
or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking information including, without limitation: changes in, including further decline of,
commodity prices; changes in realized prices of Enerplus' products; changes in the demand for or supply of our products; unanticipated operating results, results
from our capital spending activities or production declines; curtailment of our production due to low realized prices or lack of adequate infrastructure; our risk
management programs, including commodity hedging, being less effective in protecting our balance sheet and funds flow than anticipated; changes in tax or
environmental laws, royalty rates or other regulatory matters; changes in our capital plans or by third party operators of our properties; changes in estimates of
our reserves and resource volumes; limited, unfavorable or a lack of access to capital markets; our inability to comply with covenants under our bank credit
facility and senior notes; increased costs; a lack of adequate insurance coverage; the impact of competitors; reliance on industry partners and third party service
providers; failure to complete any of the anticipated acquisitions or dispositions; and certain other risks detailed from time to time in our public disclosure
documents (including, without limitation, those risks and contingencies described under "Risk Factors and Risk Management" in our Annual MD&A and in our
other public filings).

1) REPORTING ENTITY
These interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ("interim Consolidated Financial Statements") and notes present the financial position and results of
Enerplus Corporation ("The Company" or "Enerplus") including its Canadian and U.S. subsidiaries. Enerplus is a North American crude oil and natural gas
exploration and development company. Enerplus is publicly traded on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the ticker symbol ERF. Enerplus' head
office is located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The interim Consolidated Financial Statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on

2) BASIS OF PREPARATION
Enerplus' interim Consolidated Financial Statements present its results of operations and financial position under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and the 2014 comparative periods. Certain information and notes
normally included with the annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been condensed or have been disclosed on an annual basis only. Accordingly,

The difference between the expected income taxes based on the statutory income tax rate and the effective income taxes for the current and prior period is
impacted by the following: expected annual earnings, foreign rate differentials for foreign operations, statutory and other rate differentials, the reversal or
recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets, non-taxable portions of capital gains and losses, and non-deductible share-based compensation.

15) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
a) Fair Value Measurements
At June 30, 2015 the carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, dividends payable and bank credit facilities approximated their fair value due
to the short-term maturity of the instruments.
At June 30, 2015 senior notes had a carrying value of $1,041.3 million and a fair value of $1,121.0 million (December 31, 2014 – $1,057.0 million and
$1,150.0 million, respectively).
There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels during the period.
b) Derivative Financial Instruments
The deferred financial assets and credits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets result from recording derivative financial instruments at fair value.

Enerplus is exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to its U.S. operations, and U.S. dollar denominated senior notes and working capital. Additionally,
Enerplus' crude oil sales and a portion of its natural gas sales are based on U.S. dollar indices. Enerplus manages currency risk through the derivative
instruments detailed below.
Foreign Exchange Derivatives:
During 2015 Enerplus entered into foreign exchange forward rate swaps for July through December 2015 to buy US$6 million per month at an average US$/CDN$
exchange rate of 1.20 to partially mitigate losses on the foreign exchange collars entered into in 2014.
During 2014 Enerplus entered into foreign exchange collars to protect a portion of its foreign exchange exposure on U.S. dollar denominated oil and gas sales with
upside participation in the event the Canadian dollar weakened. As of June 30, 2015 we have US$24 million per month hedged for the remainder of 2015 at an
average USD/CDN floor of 1.1088, a ceiling of 1.1845 and a conditional ceiling of 1.1263.
During 2011 Enerplus entered into foreign exchange swaps on US$175.0 million of notional debt at approximately par. During 2015 Enerplus unwound these
swaps and recognized a gain of $39.9 million and an offsetting non-cash loss of $27.6 million which have been included in foreign exchange gain/loss on the
Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss).
During 2007 Enerplus entered in foreign exchange swaps on US$54.0 million of notional debt at an average US$/CDN$ exchange rate of 1.02. The remaining
$10.8 million notional amount under the swap matures in October 2015 in conjunction with the final principal repayment on the US$54.0 million senior notes.
Interest Rate Risk:
At June 30, 2015 approximately 93% of Enerplus' debt was based on fixed interest rates and 7% was based on floating interest rates. At June 30, 2015 Enerplus
did not have any interest rate derivatives outstanding.
38      ENERPLUS 2015 Q2 REPORT
Equity Price Risk:
Enerplus is exposed to equity price risk in relation to its long-term incentive plans detailed in Note 14. Enerplus has entered into various equity swaps maturing
between 2015 and 2017 and has effectively fixed the figure settlement cost on 524,000 shares at weighted average price of $16.51 per share.
(ii) Credit Risk
Credit risk represents the financial loss Enerplus would experience due to the potential non-performance of counterparties to its financial instruments. Enerplus is
exposed to credit risk mainly through its joint venture, marketing and financial counterparty receivables.
Enerplus mitigates credit risk through credit management techniques including conducting financial assessments to establish and monitor counterparties' credit
worthiness, setting exposure limits, monitoring exposures against these limits and obtaining financial assurances such as letters of credit, parental guarantees, or
third party credit insurance where warranted. Enerplus monitors and manages its concentration of counterparty credit risk on an ongoing basis.
Enerplus' maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date consists of the carrying amount of its non-derivative financial assets and the fair value of its
derivative financial assets. At June 30, 2015 approximately 63% of Enerplus' marketing receivables were with companies considered investment grade.
At June 30, 2015 approximately $4.7 million or 3% of Enerplus' total accounts receivable were aged over 120 days and considered past due. The majority of
these accounts are due from various joint venture partners. Enerplus actively monitors past due accounts and takes the necessary actions to expedite collection,
which can include withholding production, netting amounts of future payments or seeking other remedies including legal action. Should Enerplus determine that
the ultimate collection of a receivable is in doubt, it will provide the necessary provision in its allowance for doubtful accounts with a corresponding charge to
earnings. If Enerplus subsequently determines an account is uncollectable the account is written off with a corresponding charge to the allowance account.
Enerplus' allowance for doubtful accounts balance at June 30, 2015 was $2.7 million (December 31, 2014 – $2.7 million).
(iii) Liquidity Risk & Capital Management
Liquidity risk represents the risk that Enerplus will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they become due. Enerplus mitigates liquidity risk through
actively managing its capital, which it defines as debt (net of cash) and shareholders' capital. Enerplus' objective is to provide adequate short and longer term
liquidity while maintaining a flexible capital structure to sustain the future development of its business. Enerplus strives to balance the portion of debt and equity
in its capital structure given its current oil and natural gas assets and planned investment opportunities.
Management monitors a number of key variables with respect to its capital structure, including debt levels, capital spending plans, dividends, access to capital
markets, as well as acquisition and divestment activity.
At June 30, 2015 Enerplus was in full compliance with all covenants under the bank credit facility and outstanding senior notes.
16) CONTINGENCIES
Enerplus is subject to various legal claims and actions arising in the normal course of business. Although the outcome of such claims and actions cannot be
predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect these matters to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In instances where the
Company determines that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, an accrual is recorded.
