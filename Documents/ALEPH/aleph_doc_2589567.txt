QUARTERLY REPORT
FOR THE PERIOD ENDING 30 JUNE 2016
HIGHLIGHTS OF THE QUARTER
OPERATIONS
•  Metals X Limited (MLX or the Company) made significant progress on its takeover 
offer for copper producer Aditya Birla Minerals Limited (ABY) and subsequent to 
the end of the quarter had achieved a 93.4% shareholding and had moved into the 
compulsory acquisition phase. 
The Gold Division produced 54,282 ounces (including Cannon) and sold 58,200 
ounces at a cash cost of sales of A$1,041 per ounce and an AISC of A$1,237 per 
ounce. The un-audited free cash flow (EBITDA) for the gold division for the quarter 
was A$36.78m, achieved from an average gold sales price of A$1,637 per ounce.
•
•  With the continued ramp-up of multiple projects, re-investment of free cash into 
mine development and pre-production works continued to be high, but has begun 
to  reduce  as  projects  exit  their  up-front  capital  phases.  At  the  South  Kalgoorlie 
Operations  rehab  of  the  old  decline  was  completed  and  development  toward 
the  higher  grade  virgin  areas  commenced.  At  Higginsville  Gold  Operations  pre-
production grade control, stripping and development for the start of mining at Mt 
Henry was also completed.
•
•  Metals X’s Gold Division completed its annual Mineral Resource and Ore Reserves 
update which resulted in a 19% year-on-year increase in Mineral Resources to 15.4 
million ounces and a 30% year-on-year increase in Ore Reserves to 2.89 million 
ounces.
The Tin Division completed a changeover from contractor to owner operator which 
impacted ore production during May. Renison mine (MLX 50%) outputs were lower 
as a result with mine selling 1,450 tonnes of tin metal. 1,152 tonnes of tin metal 
were produced at a cash cost of sales of A$17,506 and an AISC of A$22,989 per 
tonne of tin metal. An unaudited free cash flow of $3.74m was generated from tin 
sales at an average tin sales price of A$22,235 per tonne.
The  Nifty  Copper  operations  (MLX  93.4%+  and  being  compulsory  acquired) 
produced 7,571 tonnes of copper at a cash operating cost of A$2.96 per pound. The 
rolling 12 month output was 33,838 tonnes of copper at a cash operating cost of 
A$2.51per pound.
The Nickel Division received advice that its lengthy Public Environmental Review 
process  was  recommended  for  approval  by  the  Environment  Minister  after  no 
appeals were received.
•
•
CORPORATE
•  Metals X closed the quarter with a cash and working capital of $41 million. ABY had
cash and working capital of $92.4 million as at 30 June 2016.
•  Metals X drew on a $25m bridge loan from Citibank to pay the increased $0.08 per
share consideration to all shareholders of ABY.
•  On completion of the ABY takeover, Metals X will have 527,819,382 shares on issue.

GOLD DIVISION
OVERVIEW
Total gold sold for the quarter was 58,200 ounces at an average $1,673 per ounce. Cash cost of sales were A$1,041 per 
ounce generating a free cash flow (un-audited EBITDA) of $36.8 million. 
All-in sustaining costs were A$1,237 per ounce reflecting the various stages of the individual projects.
Overall performance for the gold group improved progressively over the previous quarter as Higginsville Gold Operations 
(HGO) output increased following improvements at the Trident Mine. The Central Murchison Gold Project (CMGP) continued 
to ramp up production. Approximately one third of plant capacity from South Kalgoorlie Operations was dedicated to third 
party toll processing campaigns during the quarter.

Highlights of the Gold Division were:
•  Metals X’s Gold Division completed its annual Mineral Resource and Ore Reserves update which resulted in a 19% 
year-on-year increase in Mineral Resources to 15.4 million ounces and a 30% year-on-year increase in Ore Reserves 
to 2.89 million ounces.
•  Continued ramp-up at the CMGP with the project transitioning to net cash generation by the end of the quarter. 
•
Improvements  to  productivity  and  grade  from  the  Trident  Mine  at  HGO  and  the  completion  of  pre-production 
preparations for mining at Mt Henry which will become the key feed source for the operations in ensuing years.
•  Good outputs from the HBJ mine and the Georges Reward Pit at the South Kalgoorlie Operations (SKO) with improved
•
•
•
gold production despite only operating the plant for two thirds on SKO ores. 
The completion and announcement (ASX:MLX of June 22, 2016) of the initial 5-year development plan for the Fortnum 
Gold Project (FGP). This showed a low-risk and low-capital cost plan to deliver 322,000 ounces over five years at an 
estimate cash cost of sales of A$1,070 per ounce and an all-in cost of A$1,290 per ounce.
The  Cannon  Mine  continued  to  progress  with  excellent  reconciliations  and  cost  outcomes.  MLX  continues  to  be 
financier of the project and has profit share of 50% of the surplus after all cost are repaid. Latest The latest estimates 
are that there remains 39,430 ounces to be mined at an indicated all in cost ofA$700 per ounce which will be 
completed early in 2017.
The acquisition of the Gunga Project (30 km west of the SKO Jubilee plant) was completed for$1.5 million in cash and 
a further $1 million in a milestone payment when production exceeds 30,000 ounces. The current resource at the 
Gunga Project is 1.33 million tonnes at 1.7g/t Au containing 73,000 ounces. Gunga is expected to provide a blended 
feed for the SKO Jubilee plant post Cannon until mid-2018.
•  Gold hedging at the end of the quarter stood at 187,000 ounces at an average price of A$1,632 per ounce.

MINERAL RESOURCE AND ORE RESERVE UPDATES
Following  a  year  of  continued  acquisitions  and  some  re-working  of  resources  at  different  cut-off  grades,  Metals  X 
completed its annual Mineral Resource and Ore Reserves estimates for the gold division as at 30 June 2016.
This resulted in a 19% year-on-year increase in total Mineral Resource estimates to 15.4 million ounces (The Rover Project 
is excluded due its polymetallic associations). There has been a 30% year-on-year increase in Ore Reserves across the 
gold division to 2.89 million ounces.
The tables below summarise the positions by project and by Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve classification category in 
each project. Attached in Appendix 2 are tables which summarise the position by each mine and prospect in each Mineral

QUARTERLY REPORT 7
CENTRAL MURCHISON GOLD PROJECT (CMGP) (MLX 100%)
The CMGP progressed its ramp-up with its second full quarter of production in what is a twelve year plan. Output for the 
quarter increased by 30% over the previous quarter to 15,951 ounces. 266,585 tonnes were processed at an average 
grade of 1.60 g/t with metallurgical recoveries of 92.9%. 
The project continued through the last of its key capital mine development phases for the Paddy’s Flat underground and 
undertook significant pre-strips at the Jack Ryan and Callisto pits at Reedy’s. Cash operating costs were A$1,135 per 
ounce and AISC estimates for the quarter were A$1,380.
Importantly, Paddy’s Flat completed the transition to stoping on both the Prohibition and the Viivien-Consols lodes and 
monthly production is now at steady state levels with both lots of stope grades reporting positive reconciliations against 
pre-mined estimates.
Mining at the problematic Whangamata and Batavia open pits was completed during the quarter and the Bluebird pit will 
complete early in the ensuing quarter. Encouraging signs for underground development at Bluebird are noted and under 
review. Open pit mining will move into Bluebird and then Surprise near the plant whilst at the Reedy Mining Centre (60 km 
south of the plant) mining continues at Jack Ryan and Callisto and will do so for the ensuing six months.
Dewatering at Big Bell made good progress with re-access to the old portal expected late in the September quarter. A 
revised development plan using the higher cut-off resource estimate was completed. When operational, Big Bell will 
become  the  cornerstone  production  feed  for  the  CMGP  providing  approximately  50%  of  long-term  mill  feed  and  over 
80,000 - 100,000 ounces per annum to overall output.
A development plan to commence underground mining at the Comet Mine near Cue was also commenced and submissions 
for statutory approvals have been lodged. Comet is expected to provide a bridge production feed whilst Big Bell is re-
established and builds its production rates.
CMGP EXPLORATION
As mining has progressed at CMGP's Paddy’s Flat underground mine, the site geology team has invested significant effort 
in defining the orebody in advance of the mining front. Completion of the first program of drilling within both the Prohibition 
and Vivian - Consol’s areas of the mine continues to show the potential of this significant historical producer. Highlights 
this quarter include 9.75 m at 7.65 g/t Au from 45 m (16VIDD099) and 9 m at 6.68 g/t Au from 35 m (16VIDD105) at 
Prohibition along with 8.9 m at 6.68 g/t Au from 35 m (16VIDD105) at Vivian - Consol’s.
On the open pit development front, work continues to define the next tranche of pits both in the area immediately to 
the north of Paddy’s Flat and at Reedy’s where MLX is currently undertaking open pit mining. Better results this quarter 
include 8.4 m at 3.59 g/t Au from 96 m in 16FMRC002 and 9.3 m at 4.04 g/t Au from 98 m in 16FMRC003 at Five Mile 
Well (north of Paddy’s Flat) and 4.50 m at 7.16 g/t Au from 6m in 16TTRC032 at Midway (Reedy).
HIGGINSVILLE GOLD OPERATIONS (HGO) (MLX 100%)
The key focus at HGO during the quarter was to finalise preparation for the shift in long term feed-stock for the plant to Mt 
Henry open pits as production from Trident slows and it progresses towards closure. 
Mining will commence at Mt Henry early in the next quarter with bulk-tonnage lower grade pits being carted 75 km to 
HGO for processing. Mining continued at Trident during the quarter at a steady rate respective of issues of seismicity 
and paste-fill requirements. Open pit mining continued at the Cowan Group of pits and on the Fairplay pit close to the 
plant. Numerous assessments were made of additional underground mining areas south of the Trident mine with an 
expectation that they can become small swing producers providing top-up feeds in future years.
Quarterly gold production increased 36% over the previous quarter 25,479 ounces resulting in corresponding reductions 
in quarterly cash operating costs of A$1,022 per ounce and an AISC of A$1,218 per ounce.
FOR THE PERIOD ENDING 30 JUNE 2016
QUARTERLY REPORT 8
HGO EXPLORATION
With the long-term future of the HGO site secured by the recent acquisition of the Mt Henry mine, there has been a 
renewed focus on conceptual exploration in this heavily endowed region. Strong grassroots anomalies have been defined 
along and adjacent to the favourable Speedway Shear system (the control on the Invincible deposit at Saint Ives) in both 
the Republican (2.8 km long with anomaly peak of 246 ppb) and Implausible areas (+4 km long anomaly with peak 79 
ppb). In addition to aggressive follow-up of these targets and continued evaluation of open pit and underground resource 
opportunities, MLX anticipates being able to test the highly prospective Igloo target with a lake diamond rig in the coming 
quarter.
SOUTH KALGOORLIE OPERATIONS (SKO) (MLX 100%)
Underground mining at HBJ, open pit mining at Georges Reward and Cannon continued to be the main focus at SKO for 
the quarter. Production drilling at the newly acquired Gunga Project was also completed to have it ready as a alternate 
feed at the end of the Cannon campaigns. During the quarter approximately one third of plant capacity was dedicated to 
third party toll processing runs.
Directly attributable production for the quarter totalled 199,201 tonnes at 1.83 g/t Au and a 91.1% recovery to yield 
10,756 ounces. An additional 33,704 tonnes at 2.09 g/t Au for 2,095 ounces was produced from Cannon.
Underground production from HBJ was steady and continued to focus on lower grade remnant stoping. HBJ production 
totalled 116,479 tonnes at 2.50 g/t. Importantly, rehabilitation of the old decline was completed to its base and new 
development into the virgin higher grade areas commenced. 
HBJ ore was supplemented from open pit mining at the Georges Reward Pit at Bulong and low-grade stocks. Open pit 
production was 51,291 tonnes at 2.72g/t Au.
Directly attributable financial performance (excluding Cannon) resulted in cash operating costs of A$947 per ounce of 
gold produced and AISC were estimated at $1,070/oz for the quarter.
SKO EXPLORATION
At SKO drilling continues to be undertaken at the HBJ underground mine as underground drill platforms become available. 
The Company continues to be pleased with the magnitude of results returned from drilling below the COZ and SOZ areas 
of the mine as development approaches the upper limits of the virgin section of the orebody. Better results this quarter 
have included 7.66 m at 10.08 g/t Au from 67.3 m in HBJUG0174, 5.83 m at 23.5 g/t Au from 103.4 m in HBJUG0198 and 
29.87 m at 2.37 g/t Au from 18.0 m in HBJUG0200.
Open pit development work has continued at both the recent acquired Gunga West deposit (19 m at 5.65 g/t Au from 64.0 
m in GURC008) and at the Company’s existing Hansel Mundey project (21 m at 2.21 g/t Au from 3.0 m in HMRC0029 and 
20 m at 2.12 g/t Au from 11.0 m in HMRC0043). MLX expects to be mining at Gunga West prior to the end of the calendar 
year.
Grassroots exploration also recommenced this quarter at South Kalgoorlie with drilling along the Wildcatter Shear corridor 
at Mephisto. Whilst mineralisation was encountered validating the Company’s targeting process, no areas for priority 
follow-up were identified. Conceptual exploration in the next quarter will move onto the Zuleika shear zone as it extends 
south into MLX tenure from the prolific Kundana gold camp.

CANON GOLD MINE (MLX 50% PROFIT SHARE)
MLX has a financing and profit sharing agreement with Southern Gold Limited (SAU) over the Cannon Mine at Bulong in 
Western Australia. Pursuant to this agreement, MLX manages all technical aspects of the mining operation as well as 
funding all costs involved with the operation of the mine. 
All ore from the mine is batched processed through the Jubilee Mill at SKO and all revenue first goes to repay costs. On the 
completion of mining surplus funds are split on 50:50 basis (the profit share). MLX has made loan funds available to SAU 
of up to $2.5 million to fund its other working capital requirements. The loan funds earn interest at 8% per annum and are 
secured by a mortgage over the Canon tenure. To date SAU has drawn on $1 million of these loan funds.
Mining has been underway at Cannon since September 2015. The current mine plan will see mining and processing 
continue  until  February  2017,  after  which  assessment  of  underground  mining  opportunities  will  take  place.  Mining 
undertook the major cut-back, funded by MLX during the quarter. With major expenses and only one process run for 2,095 
ounces produced, actual costs per ounce for the quarter were high, but significant ore remains on stockpile. The pit is 
about to enter its glory period in the ensuing six months with lower strip ratios and much higher grades. Gold production 
and total costs of approximately A$700 per ounce are expected for the remainder of the ores. Pit to date statistics are:

FORTNUM GOLD PROJECT (FGP) (MLX 100%)
Significant progress toward a re-start of gold operations at Fortnum was made during the quarter with the release of the 
initial five year development plan (refer ASX announcement of 15 July 2016).
This plan concluded a robust and low-capital risk start-up plan for the project. The key outputs of the initial five year plan 
are summarised:
Capital and infrastructure refurbishment cost
Refurbishment time-frame  
Initial Ore Feeds
Existing Low Grade Stocks
Planned Open Pits
Planned Underground Mining

There  remains  significant  opportunity  to  upscale  and  accelerate  the  project  ramp-up  by  taking  a  more  aggressive 
development approach, however this would require higher upfront capital development. Significantly longer mine life 
exists beyond this initial five year plan from known resources which require more validation and drilling, especially the 
Peak Hill region which is yet to be considered in the development strategy.

FORTNUM EXPLORATION
On the back of the recent announcement that the Fortnum Gold Project will become MLX’s fourth gold operation, the 
Company is pleased to provide the highlights of its maiden drilling campaign at Yarlarweelor, the resource which will be 
the first open pit mined during the restart of operations. Best results from the limited campaign of confirmatory drilling 
at Yarlarweelor include 13 m at 4.65g/t Au from 31.0 m in MXC0387, 7 m at 33.06g/t Au from 51.0 m in MXC0392 and 
0.54 m at 120g/t Au from 124.7 m in MXC0405.
ROVER GOLD PROJECT (MLX 100%)
No on-ground exploration work was conducted in the Northern Territory during the quarter. As  previously announced 
on 7 July 2016, Rover is the least advanced and only Metals X project requiring a new processing plant and virgin mine 
development. Metals X has received a number of expressions of interest from third parties in the project and has engaged 
Prime Corporate Finance (PCF) to deal with these in an organised manner.

TIN DIVISION
RENISON PROJECT (MLX 50%)
The key activity at the Renison Project during the quarter was the changeover from contract mining to owner-operator 
mining. Generally, it was a smooth transition with the inevitable impacts to quarterly production. The mining buffer through 
this process was a bulk low-grade stope in the CFB lode system where mining logistics were simpler and productivity 
could be higher. This however was counter-balanced by it overall lower grade.
Quarterly  tin  production  was  1,153  tonnes  after  taking  this  one-off  transition  impact.  EBITDA  for  the  quarter  for  the 
operation was A$1.9M for the quarter. (MLX 50% share $0.93M). The cash costs of tin sales was A$20,756 per tonne 
which is approximately 18% higher than the average over the last 12 months ($17,567) attributable to lower tin production.
World tin price continued to achieve a modest gain of 4% for the quarter (12% for the last 12 months) and currently sits 
in the A$23,000 – A$24,000 range. Although tin market fundamentals remain strong with low reported stock, the price 
continues to remain soft in-line with the general poor sentiment of commodities overall.
The transition to owner mining is part of the previously advised strategy to drive long-term costs structures at Renison 
to lower levels. The first step of which was to remove the contractor margins as skilled personnel and mining equipment 
availability freed up with the overall industry down-turn. The next step will be to improve overall head-grade and tin metal 
entering the tin concentrator circuit by applying modern ore sorting technology to remove intercalated gangue and ore 
dilution from the mill feed. Additional cost savings have started to be observed and is expected to flow through during 
the ensuing quarters..

WINGELLINA PROJECT (MLX 100%)
The final EPA report and recommendations were published in late June for a 14 day public review process. Metals X has 
been advised that there was no appeals received and that the general conditions of the approval have been finalised. It 
is anticipated that the final sign off by the Environmental Minister will be obtained shortly. 
Interaction with the State and Federal Governments in relation to infrastructure requirements within Central Australia 
continued during the quarter. An application has been submitted to the NT Government to obtain “Significant Project 
Status” for the road and gas infrastructure, which will result in further cooperation by the territory. The NT Major Projects 
Group sub committee has recommended that the project be presented to NT Cabinet which is expected to be presented 
shortly. Strong support from the other states and Commonwealth is ongoing.

JORC Code Explanation
•
Nature  and  quality  of  sampling  (eg  cut  channels,  random  chips,  or  specific  specialised 
industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such 
as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not 
be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate 
calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report.
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be relatively simple (eg 
‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to 
produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation may be required, such 
as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or 
mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.
Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, 
sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-
sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc).
Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed.
Measures  taken  to  maximise  sample  recovery  and  ensure  representative  nature  of  the 
samples.

HGO
Diamond Drilling
The bulk of the data used in resource calculations at Trident has been gathered from diamond 
core. Four types of diamond core sample have been historically collected. The predominant 
sample method is half-core NQ2 diamond with half-core LTK60 diamond, Whole core LTK48 
diamond  and  whole  core  BQ  also  used.  This  core  is  logged  and  sampled  to  geologically 
relevant intervals.
The bulk of the data used in resource calculations at Chalice has been gathered from diamond 
core. The predominant drilling and sample type is half core NQ2 diamond. Occasionally whole 
core has been sampled to streamline the core handling process. Historically half and whole 
core LTK60 and half core HQ diamond have been used. This core is logged and sampled to 
geologically relevant intervals.
Face Sampling
Each  development  face  /  round  is  chip  sampled  at  both  Trident  and  Chalice.  One  or  two 
channels are taken per face perpendicular to the mineralisation. The sampling intervals are 
domained  by  geological  constraints  (e.g.  rock  type,  veining  and  alteration  /  sulphidation 
etc.) with an effort made to ensure each 3kg sample is representative of the interval being 
extracted.  Samples  are  taken  in  a  range  from  0.1  m  up  to  1.2  m  in  waste  /  mullock.  All 
exposures within the orebody are sampled.
Sludge Drilling
Sludge drilling at Chalice and Trident is performed with an underground production drill rig. It 
is an open hole drilling method using water as the flushing medium, with a 64mm or 89mm 
hole diameter. Samples are taken twice per drill steel (1.9m steel, 0.8m sample). Holes are 
drilled at sufficient angles to allow flushing of the hole with water following each interval to 
prevent contamination.
RC Drilling
For Fairplay, Vine, Lake Cowan, Two Boys, Mousehollow, Pioneer and Eundynie the bulk of the 
data used in the resource estimate is sourced from RC drilling. Minor RC drilling is also utilised 
at Trident, Musket, Chalice and the Palaeochannels (Wills, Pluto, Mitchell 3 and 4).
Drill  cuttings  are  extracted  from  the  RC  return  via  cyclone.  The  underflow  from  each  1  m 
interval is transferred via bucket to a four tiered riffle splitter, delivering approximately three 
kilograms  of  the  recovered  material  into  calico  bags  for  analysis.  The  residual  material  is 
retained on the ground near the hole. Samples too wet to be split through the riffle splitter are 
taken as grabs and are recorded as such.

RAB / Air Core Drilling
Drill  cuttings  are  extracted  from  the  RAB  and  Aircore  return  via  cyclone.  4m  Composite 
samples are obtained by spear sampling from the individual 1m drill return piles; the residue 
material is retained on the ground near the hole. In the Palaeochannels 1m samples are riffle 
split for analysis.
There is no RAB or Aircore drilling used in the estimation of Trident, Chalice, Corona, Fairplay, 
Vine, Lake Cowan and Two Boys.
SKO
SKO is a long-term producing operation with a long history of drilling and sampling to support 
exploration and resource development.
Sampling Techniques
Chips from the RC drilling face-sampling hammer are collected for assaying. Sample return 
lines  are  cleaned  with  compressed  air  each  metre  and  the  cyclone  sample  collector  is 
cleaned following each rod. Samples are riffle split through a three-tier splitter with a split 
~3kg sample (generally at 1m intervals) pulverised to produce a 30g charge analysed via 
fire assay.
Diamond drill-core is geologically logged and then sampled according to geology (minimum 
sample length of 0.4 m to maximum sample length of 1.5 m) – where consistent geology is 
sampled, a 1m length is used for sampling the core. The core is sawn half-core with one half 
sent off for analysis.
Samples have been collected from numerous other styles of drilling at SKO, including but not 
limited to RAB, aircore, blast-hole, sludge drilling and face samples.
Drilling Techniques
Historical data includes DD, RC, RAB and aircore holes drilled between 1984 and 2010. Not 
all  the  historical  drilling  programmes  at  SKO  are  documented  and  many  historical  holes 
are assigned a drill type of ‘unknown’. Over 4,000 km of drilling has been completed on the 
tenure.
Drilling  by  the  most  recent  previous  owners  (Alacer  Gold  Corporation)  has  predominantly 
been RC, with minor DD and aircore drilling.
RC  drilling  is  used  predominantly  for  defining  and  testing  for  near-surface  mineralisation 
and utilises a face sampling hammer with the sample being collected on the inside of the 
drill-tube. RC drillholes utilise downhole single or multi shot cameras. Drillhole collars were 
surveyed by onsite mine surveyors.
Diamond drilling is used for either testing / targeting deeper mineralised systems or to define 
the orientation of the host geology. Many of these holes had RC pre-collars generally to a 
depth of between 60 – 120m, followed by a diamond tail. The majority of these holes have 
been drilled at NQ2 size with minor HQ sized core. All diamond holes were surveyed during 
drilling with downhole cameras, and then at end of hole using a Gyro Inclinometer at 5 or 10 
m intervals. Drillhole collars were surveyed by onsite mine surveyors.

Sample Recovery
Sample  recovery  is  generally  good,  and  there  is  no  indication  that  sampling  presents  a 
material risk for the quality of the evaluation of any deposit at SKO.
CMGP
Diamond Drilling
A significant portion of the data used in resource calculations at the CMGP has been gathered 
from diamond core. Multiple sizes have been used historically. This core is geologically logged 
and subsequently halved for sampling. Grade control holes may be whole-cored to streamline 
the core handling process if required.
Face Sampling
At each of the major past and current underground producers at the CMGP, each development 
face / round is horizontally chip sampled. The sampling intervals are domained by geological 
constraints  (e.g.  rock  type,  veining  and  alteration  /  sulphidation  etc.).  The  majority  of 
exposures within the orebody are sampled.
Sludge Drilling
Sludge drilling at the CMGP was / is performed with an underground production drill rig. It is 
an open hole drilling method using water as the flushing medium, with a 64mm (nominal) 
hole diameter. Sample intervals are ostensibly the length of the drill steel. Holes are drilled 
at sufficient angles to allow flushing of the hole with water following each interval to prevent 
contamination. Sludge drilling is not used to inform resource models.
RC Drilling
Drill cuttings are extracted from the RC return via cyclone. The underflow from each interval is 
transferred via bucket to a four tiered riffle splitter, delivering approximately three kilograms 
of the recovered material into calico bags for analysis. The residual material is retained on the 
ground near the hole. Composite samples are obtained from the residue material for initial 
analysis, with the split samples remaining with the individual residual piles until required for 
re-split analysis or eventual disposal.
RAB / Aircore Drilling
Combined scoops from bucket dumps from cyclone for composite. Split samples taken from 
individual bucket dumps via scoop. RAB holes are not included in the resource estimate.
Blast Hole Drilling
Cuttings  sampled  via  splitter  tray  per  individual  drill  rod.  Blast  holes  not  included  in  the 
resource estimate.
All geology input is logged and validated by the relevant area geologists, incorporated into 
this  is  assessment  of  sample  recovery.  No  defined  relationship  exists  between  sample 
recovery and grade. Nor has sample bias due to preferential loss or gain of fine or coarse 
material been noted.

FGP
Historic reverse circulation drilling was used to collect samples at 1m intervals with sample 
quality, recovery and moisture recorded on logging sheets. Bulk samples were composited 
to 4-5m samples by PVC spear. These composites were dried, crushed and split to produce a 
30g charge for aqua regia digest at the Fortnum site laboratory.
For Metals X (MLX) RC Drilling drill cuttings are extracted from the RC return via cyclone. The 
underflow from each interval is transferred via bucket to a four tiered riffle splitter, delivering 
approximately three kilograms of the recovered material into calico bags for analysis. The 
residual material is retained on the ground near the hole. Composite samples are obtained 
from  the  residue  material  for  initial  analysis,  with  the  split  samples  remaining  with  the 
individual residual piles until required for re-split analysis or eventual disposal.
In the case of grade control drilling, 1m intervals were split at the rig via a 3-tier splitter box 
below the cyclone and collected in calico bags with bulk samples collected into large plastic 
bags. These 1m splits were dried, pulverised and split to produce a 50g charge for fire assay 
at an offsite laboratory.

Historic  diamond  drilling  sampled  according  to  mineralisation  and  lithology  resulting  in 
samples of 10cm to 1.5m. Half core pulverised and split to produce a 50g charge for fire 
assay at an offsite laboratory.
Metals  X  surface  drill-holes  are  all  orientated  and  have  been  logged  in  detail  for  geology, 
veining, alteration, mineralisation and orientated structure. Metals X underground drill-holes 
are logged in detail for geology, veining, alteration, mineralisation and structure. Core has 
been logged in enough detail to allow for the relevant mineral resource estimation techniques 
to be employed.
Surface  core  is  photographed  both  wet  and  dry  and  underground  core  is  photographed 
wet. All photos are stored on the companies servers, with the photographs from each hole 
contained within separate folders.
Development faces are mapped geologically.
RC, RAB and Aircore chips are geologically logged.
Sludge drilling is logged for lithology, mineralisation and vein percentage.
Logging is quantitative in nature.

HGO
NQ2 and LTK60 diameter core is sawn half core using a diamond-blade saw, with one half 
of the core consistently taken for analysis. LTK48 and BQ are whole core sampled. Sludge 
samples are dried then riffle split.
The un-sampled half of diamond core is retained for check sampling if required.
For  the  onsite  Intertek  facility  the  entire  dried  sample  is  jaw  crushed  (JC2500  or  Boyd 
Crusher) to a nominal 85% passing 2mm with crushing equipment cleaned between samples. 
An analytical sub-sample of approximately 500-750 g is split out from the crushed sample 
using a riffle splitter, with the coarse residue being retained for any verification analysis. 
Sample preparation techniques are appropriate for the type of analytical process.
•
•
•
• 
•
•  Where  fire  assay  has  been  used  the  entire  half  core  sample  (3-3.5  kg)  is  crushed  and 
pulverised (single stage mix and grind using LM5 mills) to a target of 85-90% passing 75μm 
in size. A 200g sub-sample is then separated out for analysis.
Core and underground face samples are taken to geologically relevant boundaries to ensure 
each sample is representative of a geological domain. Sludge samples are taken to nominal 
sample lengths.
The sample size is considered appropriate for the grain size of the material being sampled.
For RC, RAB and Aircore chips regular field duplicates are collected and analysed for significant 
variance to primary results.
RAB and Aircore sub-samples are collected through spear sampling.
SKO
NQ2 and HQ diameter core is sawn half core using a diamond-blade saw, with one half of 
the core consistently taken for analysis. Smaller sized core (LTK48 and BQ) are whole core 
sampled. The un-sampled half of diamond core is retained for check sampling if required.
SKO staff collect the sample in pre-numbered calico sample bags which are then submitted to 
the laboratory for analysis. Delivery of the sample is by a SKO staff member.
RC samples are collected at 1m intervals with the samples being riffle split through a three-
tier splitter. The samples are collected by the RC drill crews in pre-numbered calico sample 
bags  which  are  then  collected  by  SKO  staff  for  submission.  Delivery  of  the  sample  to  the 
laboratory is by a SKO staff member.
Upon delivery to the laboratory, the sample numbers are checked by the SKO staff member 
against  the  sample  submission  sheet.  Sample  numbers  are  recorded  and  tracked  by  the 
laboratory using electronic coding.
Sample  preparation  techniques  are  considered  appropriate  for  the  style  of  mineralisation 
being tested for – this technique is industry standard across the Eastern Goldfields.

HGO
At the Intertek on-site facility, analysis is performed using a 500g PAL method. The accurately 
weighed  sub-sample  is  further  processed  utilising  a  PAL1000B  to  grind  the  sample  to  a 
nominal  90%  passing  75µm  particle  size,  whilst  simultaneously  extracting  any  cyanide 
amenable gold liberated into a Leachwell liquor. The resulting liquor is then analysed for gold 
content by organic extraction with flame AAS finish, with an overall method detection limit 
of 0.01ppm Au content in the original sample. This method is appropriate for the type and 
magnitude of mineralisation at Higginsville.
Quality control procedures include the use of standards, blanks and duplicates. Standards 
and duplicates are used to test both the accuracy and precision of the analytical process, 
while blanks are employed to test for contamination during the sample preparation stage. 
The analyses have confirmed the analytical process employed at Higginsville is adequately 
precise and accurate for use as part of the mineral resource estimation.
SKO
Only nationally accredited laboratories are used for the analysis of the samples collected at 
SKO.
The laboratory dry and if necessary (if the sample is >3kg) riffle split the sample, which 
is then jaw crushed and pulverised (the entire 3kg sample) in a ring mill to a nominal 90% 
passing 75 microns.  All recent RC and Diamond core samples are analysed via Fire Assay, 
which  involves  a  30g  charge  (sub-sampled  after  the  pulverisation)  of  the  analytical  pulp 
being fused at 1050°C for 45 minutes with litharge. The resultant metal pill is digested in
aqua regia and the gold content determined by atomic adsorption spectrometry – detection 
limit is 0.01 ppm Au.
Quality  Assurance  and  Quality  Control  (QA/QC)  samples  are  routinely  submitted  by  SKO 
staff and comprise standards, blanks, assay pills, field duplicates, lab duplicates and repeat 
analyses. The results for these QA/QC samples are routinely analysed by Senior Geologists 
with any discrepancies dealt with in conjunction with the laboratory prior to the analytical 
data being imported into the database.
There  is  limited  information  available  on  historic  QA/QC  procedures.  SKO  has  generally 
accepted the available data at face value and carry out data validation procedures as each 
deposit is re-evaluated.
The  analytical  techniques  used  are  considered  appropriate  for  the  style  of  mineralisation 
being tested for – this technique is industry standard across the Eastern Goldfields.
Ongoing production data generally confirms the validity of prior sampling and assaying of the 
mined deposits to within acceptable limits of accuracy.

Historic assaying of RC and core was done by 50g charge fire assay with Atomic Absorption 
Spectrometry finish at Analabs. The method is standard for gold analysis and is considered 
appropriate in this case. No Laboratory Certificates are available for historic assay results pre 
2008 however, evaluation of the database identified the following;
Standards are inserted at a ratio of 1:100, 
Assay repeats inserted at a ratio of 1 in 20.
QA/QC  analysis  of  this  historic  data  indicates  the  levels  of  accuracy  and  precision  are

Collar coordinates for surface drill-holes were generally determined by GPS, with underground 
drill-holes generally determined by survey pick-up. Downhole survey measurements for most 
surface  diamond  holes  were  by  Gyro-compass  at  5m  intervals.  Holes  not  gyro-surveyed 
were  surveyed  using  Eastman  single  shot  cameras  at  20m  intervals.  Downhole  surveys 
for underground diamond drill-holes were taken at 15 – 30m intervals by Reflex single-shot 
cameras. Routine survey pick-ups of underground and surface holes where they intersected 
development  indicates  (apart  from  some  minor  discrepancies  with  pre-Avoca  drilling)  a 
survey accuracy of less than 5m.
All drilling and resource estimation is undertaken in local mine grid at the various projects.
Topographic control is generated from Differential GPS. This methodology is adequate for the 
resource in question.
SKO
Collar coordinates for surface RC and diamond drill-holes were generally determined by either 
RTK-GPS or a total station survey instrument. Underground drill-hole locations (Mount Marion 
and HBJ) were all surveyed using a Leica reflectorless total station.
Recent  surface  diamond  holes  were  surveyed  during  drilling  with  down-hole  single  shot 
cameras and then at the end of the hole by Gyro-Inclinometer at 5 or 10mm intervals. Holes 
not gyro-surveyed were surveyed using Eastman single shot cameras at 20m intervals. RC 
drill-holes utilised down-hole single shot camera surveys spaced every 15 to 30m down- 
hole.
Down-hole surveys for underground diamond drill-holes were taken at 15 – 30m intervals by 
Reflex single-shot cameras.
The orientation and size of the project determines if the resource estimate is undertaken in 
local or MGA 94 grid. Each project has a robust conversion between local, magnetic and an 
MGA grid which is managed by the SKO survey department.
Topographic  control  is  generated  from  RTK  GPS.  This  methodology  is  adequate  for  the 
resources in question.
CMGP
All data is spatially oriented by survey controls via direct pickups by the survey department. 
Drillholes are all surveyed downhole, deeper holes with a Gyro tool if required, the majority 
with single / multishot cameras.
All  drilling  and  resource  estimation  is  preferentially  undertaken  in  local  mine  grid  at  the 
various sites.
Topographic control is generated from a combination of remote sensing methods and ground-
based surveys. This methodology is adequate for the resources in question.

The grid system used for historic Fortnum drilling is the established Fortnum Mine Grid. Control 
station locations and traverses have been verified by eternal survey consultants (Ensurv). 
Collar locations of boreholes have been established by either total station or differential GPS 
(DGPS). The Yarlarweelor, Callie’s and Eldorado open pits (currently abandoned) was picked 
up by DGPS at the conclusion of mining. The transformation between Mine Grid and MGA94 
Zone 50 is documented and well established.
A LIDAR survey over the project area was undertaken in 2012 and results are in agreement 
with survey pickups of pits, low-grade stockpiles and waste dumps.
Historic  drilling  by  Homestake  was  routinely  surveyed  at  25m,  50m  and  every  50m 
thereafter, using a single shot CAMTEQ survey tool. RC holes have a nominal setup azimuth 
applied. Perilya YLRC series holes had survey shots taken by gyro every 10m. Historic drilling 
in the area did not appear to have any significant problems with hole deviation.
Drilling by RNI / MLX was picked up by DGPS on MGA94. Downhole surveys were taken by 
digital single shot camera every 50m or via a gyro survey tool.
HGO
Drilling in the underground environment at Trident is nominally carried-out on 20m x 30m 
spacing for resource definition and in filled to a 10m x 15m spacing with grade control drilling. 
At Trident the drill spacing below the 500RL widens to an average of 40m x 80m.
Drilling at the Lake Cowan region is on a 20m x 10m spacing. Historical mining has shown this 
to be an appropriate spacing for the style of mineralisation and the classifications applied.
Compositing is carried out based upon the modal sample length of each project.
SKO
HBJ:
Drill spacing ranges from 10m x 5m grade control drilling to 100m x 100m at deeper levels 
of the resource. The majority of the Indicated Resource is estimated using a maximum drill

resource classifications applied.
Mount Martin:
Drill spacing ranges from 10m x 5m grade control drilling to 60m x 60m for the Inferred areas 
of the resource. The drill spacing for the majority of the Indicated Resource is 20m x 20m. The 
resource has been classified primarily on drill density and the confidence in the geological/
grade continuity – the data spacing and distribution is deemed adequate for the estimation 
techniques and classifications applied.
Pernatty:
Drill spacing for the reported resource is no greater than 60m x 60m with the majority of the 
Indicated resource based on a maximum spacing of 40m x 40m. The geological
interpretation of the area is well understood, and is supported by the knowledge from open pit 
and underground operations. However given the mineralisation is controlled by shear zones 
the mineralisation continuity is considered to be less understood. The resource is classified 
on a combination of drill density and the number of samples used to estimate the resource 
blocks.

HGO
Trident is hosted primarily within a thick, weakly differentiated gabbro with subordinate mafic 
and  ultramafic  lithologies  and  comprises  a  series  of  north-northeast  trending,  shallowly 
north-plunging  mineralised  zones.  The  deposit  comprises  two  main  mineralisation  styles; 
large  wallrock-hosted  ore-zones  comprising  sigmoidal  quartz  tensional  vein  arrays  and 
associated metasomatic wall rock alteration hosted exclusively within the gabbro;
and  thin,  lode-style,  nuggetty  laminated  quartz  veins  that  formed  primarily  at  sheared 
lithological contacts between the various mafic and ultramafic lithologies.
Lake Cowan mineralisation can be separated into two types. Structurally controlled primary 
mineralisation in ultramafics, basalts and felsics host (e.g. Louis, Josephine and Napoleon), 
and saprolite / palaeochannel hosted supergene hydromorphic deposits, including Sophia, 
Brigitte and Atreides.
SKO
HBJ:
The HBJ lodes form part of a gold mineralised system along the Boulder-Lefroy shear zone 
that is over 5km long and includes the Celebration, Mutooroo, HBJ and Golden Hope open-
pit and underground mines. The lodes are hosted within a steeply-dipping, north-northwest 
striking  package  of  mafic,  ultramafic  and  sedimentary  rocks  and  schists  that  have  been 
intruded by felsic to intermediate porphyries. Gold mineralisation is structurally controlled 
and is focused along lithological contacts, within stockwork and tensional vein arrays and 
within  shear  zones.  The  main  mineralised  zone  has  a  length  in  excess  of  1.9  km  and  an 
average width of 40 m in the Jubilee workings but is generally narrower to the north in the 
Hampton -Boulder workings.
Mount Marion:
The Mount Marion deposit is located on the eastern side of the Coolgardie Domain within a 
flexure in the Karramindie Shear Zone. It is hosted within a sub-vertical sequence of meta- 
komatiites intercalated with metasediments that have been metamorphosed to amphibolite 
facies.  Gold  mineralisation  occurs  in  a  footwall  and  hangingwall  lode,  each  ranging  in 
thickness from 2 to 15m. The mineralisation plunges steeply to the west and is open at depth.
Mount Martin:
The Mount Martin Tribute Area, is located within a regional scale north-northwest trending 
Archean  Greenstone  Belt.  Within  the  Mount  Martin  -  Carnilya  area,  the  greenstone  belt 
comprises  a  mixed  sequence  of  ultramafic  (predominantly  komatiitic)  and  fine-grained, 
variably  sulphidic  sedimentary  lithologies  with  subsidiary  mafic  units.  Known  gold  and 
nickel  mineralisation  at  the  Mount  Martin  Mine  is  associated  with  a  series  of  stacked, 
westerly  dipping,  sulphide  and  quartz-carbonate  bearing  lodes  which  are  mainly  hosted 
within intensely deformed and altered chloritic schists sandwiched between talc-carbonate 
ultramafic lithologies.

Pernatty:
• 
The Pernatty deposit is hosted within a granophyric phase of a gabbro and is controlled by 
a structurally complex interaction of a number of major shear zones. Shearing has altered 
the  original  granophyric  quartz  dolerite  to  a  biotite-carbonate-plagioclase-pyrite  schist. 
The sequence has also been intruded by mafic and felsic porphyritic dykes, which are also 
mineralised.
CMGP
The CMGP is located in the Achaean Murchison Province, a granite-greenstone terrane in the 
northwest of the Yilgarn Craton. Greenstone belts trending north-northeast are separated by 
granite-gneiss domes, with smaller granite plutons also present within or on the margins of 
the belts.
Mineralisation  at  Big  Bell  is  hosted  in  the  shear  zone  (Mine  Sequence)  and  is  associated 
with  the  post-peak  metamorphic  retrograde  assemblages.  Stibnite,  native  antimony  and 
trace  arsenopyrite  are  disseminated  through  the  K-feldspar-rich  lode  schist.  These  are 
intergrown with pyrite and pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite. Mineralisation outside the typical Big 
Bell host rocks (KPSH), for example 1,600N and Shocker, also display a very strong W-As-Sb 
geochemical halo.
Numerous gold deposits occur within the Cuddingwarra Project area, the majority of which 
are hosted within the central mafic-ultramafic ± felsic porphyry sequence. Within this broad 
framework,  mineralisation  is  shown  to  be  spatially  controlled  by  competency  contrasts 
across, and flexures along, layer-parallel D2 shear zones, and is maximised when transected 
by corridors of northeast striking D3 faults and fractures.
The  Great  Fingall  Dolerite  hosts  the  majority  gold  mineralisation  within  the  portion  of  the 
greenstone belt proximal to Cue (The Day Dawn Project Area). Unit AGF3 is the most brittle 
of all the five units and this characteristic is responsible for its role as the most favourable 
lithological host to gold mineralisation in the Greenstone Belt.
FGP
The Fortnum deposits are Paleoproterozoic shear-hosted gold deposits within the Fortnum 
Wedge, a localised thrust duplex of Narracoota Formation within the overlying Ravelstone 
Formation. Both stratigraphic formations comprise part of the Bryah Basin in the Capricorn 
Orogen, Western Australia.
The Horseshoe Cassidy deposits are hosted within the Ravelstone Formation (siltstone and 
argillite) and Narracoota Formation (highly-altered, moderate to strongly deformed mafic to 
ultramafic rocks). The main zone of mineralisation is developed within a horizon of highly 
altered magnesian basalt. Gold mineralisation is associated with strong vein stock works that 
are confined to the altered mafic. Alteration consists of two types; stockwork proximal silica-
carbonate-fuchsite-haematite-pyrite and distal silica-haematite-carbonate+/- chlorite.
The  Peak  Hill  district  represents  remnants  of  a  Proterozoic  fold  belt  comprising  highly 
deformed trough and shelf sediments and mafic / ultramafic volcanics, which are generally 
moderately metamorphosed (except for the Peak Hill Metamorphic Suite).

Current  and  historical  mining  activities  across  the  Higginsville  region  provide  significant

In  all  cases  the  local  lithological  and  structural  geology  has  been  used  to  inform  the 
interpretive  process.  All  available  information  from  drilling,  underground  mapping  and  pit 
mapping has been considered during interpretation.
The Trident, Corona, Fairplay, Vine and Two boys deposits are all hosted within a suite of east 
over west thrust repeated mafic, ultramafic and sedimentary rocks. In all cases the
•
•  most favourable host is of mafic composition, generally gabbro and to a lesser extent basalt. 
Together the deposits form what is locally referred to as the Higginsville Line of Lode, a 5km 
long, north-northeast striking mineralised corridor of historic and current mining operations. 
Steep  west  and  shallow  east  have  been  identified  as  the  most  favourable  structural 
orientations for mineralisation.
At  Chalice,  multiple  generations  of  unmineralised  felsic  intrusive  cross  cut  the  host 
amphibolite and influence both the volume and the grade, through contact remobilisation, of 
the mineralisation. The Resource Estimate is sensitive to the volume of unmineralised felsics 
within the mineralised horizon.
At both Chalice and Lake Cowan there is a lack of consistent visual proxies for mineralisation, 
making accurate ore delineation difficult.
High-grade zones within the palaeochannels are the result of a more preferential depositional 
environment due to changes in strike of the palaeochannel.

HBJ:
The  mineralisation  has  been  modelled  focussing  on  the  structural  (shear  zone)  and 
lithological  (porphyry  mainly)  controls.  The  large  scale  (1.9km  long  and  ~40m  wide) 
provides significant confidence in the geological and grade continuity within the deposit. The 
interpretation has used predominantly RC drilling with some DD used for the deeper parts of 
the resource.
There  is  an  alternative  interpretation  that  could  be  applied  to  this  deposit,  which  focuses 
on  defining  and  sub-domaining  higher  grade  mineralisation  that  is  evident  at  lithological 
contacts.
Mount Marion:
The lithological and structural model for the Mount Marion deposit is well understood as it is

The  mineralisation  is  hosted  along  a  dilational  flexure  within  the  lode  gneiss  with  clearly

model  is  used  as  the  basis  for  the  mineralisation  interpretation  and  has  been  derived 
from predominantly RC and Diamond drill-holes. The confidence of the geological controls 
on mineralisation is consistent with the resource classification applied to the deposit. No 
alternative interpretations have been devised for this deposit.
Mount Martin:
Gold mineralisation at Mount Martin is associated with chlorite schists (shear zones) hosted 
within talc-carbonate ultramafic lithologies. Within these controlling shear zones are a series 
of stacked, westerly-dipping, sulphide and quartz carbonate bearing lodes which host the 
majority  of  the  gold  mineralisation.  The  geological  and  mineralisation  interpretation  used 
in  this  resource  is  consistent  with  that  mined  historically  in  the  open  pit.  Although  other 
interpretations have been proposed they tend to be variations on the steep westerly-dipping 
lodes theme adopted for this resource and as such would not represent a significant change 
in the contained metal.
Pernatty:
Mineralisation  at  Pernatty  is  controlled  by  a  complex  arrangement  of  very  well-defined 
shear zones with the highest grade mineralisation associated with structural intersections 
and flexures along the three main shears. Given the consistency in orientation of the three 
main controlling shears, the confidence in the geological and mineralisation interpretation is 
deemed adequate.

CMGP
Mining has occurred since 1800’s providing significant confidence in the currently geological 
interpretation across all projects.
No alternative interpretations are currently considered viable.
Geological interpretation of the deposit was carried out using a systematic approach to ensure 
that the resultant estimated Mineral Resource figure was both sufficiently constrained, and 
representative of the expected sub-surface conditions. In all aspects of resource estimation 
the factual and interpreted geology was used to guide the development of the interpretation.
The structural regime is the dominant control on geological and grade continuity at the CMGP. 
Lithological factors such as rheology contrast are secondary controls on grade distribution.
FGP
Low-grade stockpiles are derived from previous mining of the mineralisation styles outlined 
above.
Geological matrixes were established to assist with interpretation and construction of the 
estimation domains.
Confidence in the interpretation is high as the geometry, geology, alteration and tenor of the 
mineralised zones was observed to be consistent along strike and down dip
The interpretations was based on 10m and 20m north-south spaced sections.
The  information  used  in  the  construction  and  estimation  of  the  respective  resources 
mineralisation is based on Air Core (AC), Reverse Circulation (RC) and Diamond Drill (DDH) 
hole information. The AC was included in the poorly information estimation domains and this 
was considered during the classification of these domains.
Oxidation  surfaces  were  constructed  from  the  logged  information  on  20m  north  south 
sections.

HGO
For Trident, Chalice, Two Boys, Vine and Lake Cowan the modelling and estimation work was 
undertaken  by  Alacer  Gold  and  carried  out  in  Vulcan  3D  mining  software.  For  Alacer  Gold 
estimates the drill hole data to be used in the process was first validated.
The initial interpretation was then completed on 1:250 scale hardcopy cross sections, long 
sections and level plans, this interpretation was then validated by either the senior geologists 
or the Chief Geologist before then being digitised into the Vulcan 3D modelling package. The 
digitised polygons form the basis of the three dimensional orebody wireframe. Wireframing 
is  then  carried  out  using  a  combination  of  automated  stitching  algorithms  and  manual 
triangulation  to  create  an  accurate  three  dimensional  representation  of  the  sub-surface 
mineralised body.
Drillhole  intersections  within  the  mineralised  body  are  defined,  these  intersections  are 
then used to flag the appropriate sections of the drillhole database tables for compositing 
purposes.  Drillholes  are  subsequently  composited  to  allow  for  grade  estimation.  In  all 
aspects of resource estimation the factual and interpreted geology was used to guide the 
development of the interpretation.
Once the sample data has been composited, a statistical analysis is undertaken to assist with 
determining estimation search parameters, top-cuts etc., this is carried out using Supervisor. 
Top cut analysis was carried out by assessing normal and log-histograms for extreme values 
and using a combination of mean variance plots and population disintegration techniques. 
Variographic  analysis  of  individual  domains  is  undertaken  to  assist  with  determining 
appropriate search parameters. In all cases knowledge of the geology was used to guide the 
analysis of the variogram fans in determining the orientation of maximum continuity.
An  empty  block  model  is  then  created  for  the  area  of  interest;  with  each  ore  wireframe 
used  to  assign  block  domain  codes  which  match  the  flag  used  for  the  composites.  This 
model contains attributes set at background values for gold as well as density, and various 
estimation parameters that are subsequently used to assist in resource categorisation. The 
block sizes used in the model will vary depending on orebody geometry, minimum mining 
units, estimation parameters and levels of informing data available.
Grade estimation is then undertaken, with ordinary kriging estimation as standard, although 
in some circumstances where sample populations are small, or domains are unable to be 
accurately  defined,  inverse  distance  weighting  estimation  techniques  will  be  used.  At 
Trident a grade assignment method has been employed for the Athena orebody. This uses 
face sampling/mapping on each level to identify runs of vein with similar width and grade 
profiles. For each run, the length of the run and average vein width is calculated as well as a 
width weighted average vein grade. Two or more grade runs are then joined up across levels 
to form a grade block, a long section is used to validate the plunge of each grade block against 
the diamond drilling. The length and width of each run is used to calculate a length weighted 
average grade and an average vein width for the block. A wireframe for each grade block is 
created at the specified average vein width for the block. This wireframe is then assigned the 
previously calculated block grade using a post process script.
No  by-products  or  deleterious  elements  are  estimated.  No  assumptions  have  been  made 
about the correlation between variables.

The estimation is validated using the following: a visual interrogation, a comparison of the 
mean composite grade to the mean block grade for each domain, a comparison of the
wireframe volume to the block volume for each domain, Grade trend plots (moving window 
statistics), comparison to the previous resource estimate.
The resource is then depleted for mining voids and subsequently classified in line with JORC 
guidelines utilising a combination of various estimation derived parameters and geological / 
mining knowledge.
Production reconciliation data is regularly used to check the performance of the estimate and 
to adjust parameters is necessary. Good reconciliation between mine claimed figures and 
milled figures is routinely achieved.
SKO
The  HBJ  mineral  resource  estimate  was  undertaken  in  December  2011  by  Widenbar  and 
Associates Pty Ltd. The grade interpolation method used was Ordinary Kriging (OK) in the 
Datamine ESTIMA process – a method that is appropriate for the style of mineralisation being 
estimated. A simple unfolding process has been applied to the data and model blocks in order 
to simplify the setup of search ellipses and allow searches to follow the varying dip and strike 
of the various domains.
Geological, mining as-built and mineralisation domains and a valid drillhole database were 
supplied by SKO personnel. The geological and mineralisation domains were used to control 
the interpolation as hard boundaries (mineralisation domains) and for the application of bulk 
density data (geological boundaries).
The  Mineral  Resource  estimates  for  Mount  Marion,  Mount  Martin  and  Pernatty  were 
undertaken by Alacer Gold in September 2011. The geological and mineralisation wireframes 
as well as the grade interpolation was undertaken in Vulcan 8.04 3-D modelling software 
with statistical analysis undertaken using Snowden Supervisor software. The interpolation 
method  used  was  Ordinary  Kriging  (OK)  –  a  method  that  is  appropriate  for  the  styles  of 
mineralisation being estimated.
Statistical  analysis  was  undertaken  to  determine  the  composite  length  (1m)  and  for  the 
application of top-cuts.
The search ellipses applied were based on a combination of drillhole spacing and variographic 
analysis.  Various  minimum  and  maximum  samples  were  used  in  the  first  search  with 
a  maximum  of  four  samples  per  drill-hole  allowed.  Several  passes  were  used  each  with 
increasing search ellipse sizes, all the blocks in the mineralised domains were informed in 
the first pass.
The  block  model  was  depleted  using  surfaces  /  domains  generated  by  the  SKO  Survey. 
Validation of the models was completed by visual inspection, statistical comparisons and 
comparison with reconciliation data, with the final model achieving a satisfactory validation.
No deleterious elements were estimated as they are considered not material.

All modelling and estimation work undertaken by Metals X is carried out in three dimensions 
via Surpac Vision.
After validating the drillhole data to be used in the estimation, interpretation of the orebody 
is undertaken in sectional and / or plan view to create the outline strings which form the 
basis  of  the  three  dimensional  orebody  wireframe.  Wireframing  is  then  carried  out  using 
a  combination  of  automated  stitching  algorithms  and  manual  triangulation  to  create  an 
accurate three dimensional representation of the sub-surface mineralised body.
Drillhole  intersections  within  the  mineralised  body  are  defined,  these  intersections  are 
then used to flag the appropriate sections of the drillhole database tables for compositing 
purposes.  Drillholes  are  subsequently  composited  to  allow  for  grade  estimation.  In  all 
aspects of resource estimation the factual and interpreted geology was used to guide the 
development of the interpretation.
Once the sample data has been composited, a statistical analysis is undertaken to assist with 
determining estimation search parameters, top-cuts etc. Variographic analysis of individual 
domains is undertaken to assist with determining appropriate search parameters. Which are 
then incorporated with observed geological and geometrical features to determine the most 
appropriate search parameters.
An empty block model is then created for the area of interest. This model contains attributes 
set at background values for the various elements of interest as well as density, and various 
estimation parameters that are subsequently used to assist in resource categorisation. The 
block sizes used in the model will vary depending on orebody geometry, minimum mining 
units, estimation parameters and levels of informing data available.
Grade estimation is then undertaken, with ordinary kriging estimation method is considered 
as  standard,  although  in  some  circumstances  where  sample  populations  are  small,  or 
domains  are  unable  to  be  accurately  defined,  inverse  distance  weighting  estimation 
techniques will be used. Both by-product and deleterious elements are estimated at the time 
of primary grade estimation if required. It is assumed that by-products correlate well with 
gold. There are no assumptions made about the recovery of by-products.
The resource is then depleted for mining voids and subsequently classified in line with JORC 
guidelines utilising a combination of various estimation derived parameters and geological / 
mining knowledge.
This approach has proven to be applicable to Metals X’s gold assets.
Estimation results are routinely validated against primary input data, previous estimates and

All modelling and estimation work undertaken by Metals X is carried out in three dimensions 
with Surpac Vision, Snowden’s Supervisor v8.3 and or Isatis 2015.
Ordinary  kriging  (OK)  and  Localised  Indicator  Kriging  (LIK)  has  been  used.  LIK  was  used 
for the estimation of all Jasperoid related estimation domains due to mosaic mineralisation 
style. Length weighting of assay values related to surveyed volumes was undertaken for low-
grade stockpiles.
All  estimates  were  validated  where  possible  against  historical  production  records  and 
previous estimates.
After validating the drillhole data to be used in the estimation, interpretation of the orebody is 
undertaken in sectional and / or plan view to create the outline strings which form the basis of 
the three dimensional orebody wireframe. Wireframing was carried out using a combination 
of  automated  stitching  algorithms  and  manual  triangulation  to  create  an  accurate  three 
dimensional representation of the sub-surface mineralised body. Domaining was constructed 
on 20m and 10m spaced sections and was based on logged lithologies, quartz percentage 
and gold value.
Drillhole intersections within the mineralised body are defined; these intersections are then 
used to flag the appropriate sections of the drillhole database tables for compositing purposes. 
Assay data was composited to 1m downhole using Surpac “best fit” algorithm. The “best fit” 
algorithm eliminates residual composites and the estimation domains boundaries defined 
the start and end position of the compositing routine. In all aspects of resource estimation; 
the factual and interpreted geology was used to guide the development of the interpretation.
Support analysis of the difference drill types (Air Core (AC), Reverse Circulation (RC) and 
Diamond Drill holes (DDH)) was performed and the mixing these deemed acceptable. The AC 
drill holes were used in the estimation of the poorly informed estimation domains.
Statistical  analysis  was  carried  out  on  the  composited  data  to  assist  with  determining 
estimation search parameters, top-cuts and spatial continuity. Data for some of the domains 
exhibit an increased degree of skewness and top-cuts were applied to reduce the skewness 
of distribution. The appropriateness of the top-cuts was assessed for each domain utilising 
log-probability plots, mean and variance plots, histograms and univariate statistics for the 
composite Au variable.
Variogram modelling was undertaken using Isatis™ software and defined the spatial continuity 
of gold within all domains and these parameters were used for the interpolation process. 
Indicator variograms were generated within the Jasperoid related estimation domains to the 
used in the LIK estimation process.
Volume models were generated in Surpac using topographic surfaces, oxidation surfaces and 
mineralised zone wireframes as constraints.
Quantitative Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis was used optimise the search parameters.

Search  ellipses  were  aligned  parallel  to  the  maximum  continuity  defined  during  the 
variographic  analysis.  The  search  dimensions,  generally,  approximated  the  ranges  of  the 
interpreted variograms and ranged from 50 to 100m. The minimum and maximum number of 
samples range from 7 to 11 and 18 to 30, respectively. Second and third pass searches were 
implement to fill the un-estimated cells / blocks if they were not estimated during the first 
search pass and these search parameters involved increasing in the search distances and 
reducing in the minimum number of samples used in the estimation process.
The extrapolation was control through the interpreted estimation domains, which was limited 
to half the drill hole spacing within section and half the section spacing between sections.
Block  estimation  for  gold  was  undertaken  using  Isatis™  and  hard  boundaries  were  used 
between domains for estimation of gold grade.
No assumptions were made about recovery during the OK and LIK estimation processes.
Grade estimation was undertaken, with the ordinary kriging (OK) estimation method for all 
non-jasperoid related estimation domains.
Check estimates were run using Localised Uniform Conditioning (LUC) for the LIK estimation 
domains,  which  produces  a  similar  form  of  result  to  LIK.  The  LIK  and  LUC  models  were 
compared, with reasonable agreement at lower cut-offs and differences at higher cut-offs 
reflecting higher estimated gold variability in the LIK model. The LIK is believed to be better 
suited to the style of mineralisation for the Jasperoid related estimation domains.
The  estimation  is  validated  using  the  following:  a  visual  interrogation,  a  comparison  of 
the mean composite grade to the mean block grade for each domain, a comparison of the 
wireframe volume to the block volume for each domain, grade trend plots (moving window 
statistics), comparison to the previous resource estimate. 
The only element of economic interest modelled is gold.
The  Isatis™  block  models  were  transferred  and  imported  to  Surpac  Mining  Software.  The 
transfer and importing process was validated against the Isatis™ block model. The resource 
was then depleted for mining voids and subsequently classified in line with JORC guidelines

Bulk density of the mineralisation at the CMGP is variable and is for the most part lithology 
rather than mineralisation dependent. Bulk density sampling is undertaken via assessments

A large suite of bulk density determinations have been carried out across the project area. 
The  bulk  densities  were  separated  into  different  weathering  domains  and  lithological 
domains (i.e. jasperoid domains). Density determinations were made on diamond drill core 
representing mineralisation utilised the water immersion method (Archimedes Principle).
Resources  are  classified  in  line  with  JORC  guidelines  utilising  a  combination  of  various 
estimation derived parameters, input data and geological / mining knowledge.
This approach considers all relevant factors and reflects the Competent Person’s view of the

Resource estimates are peer reviewed by the Corporate technical team.
No external reviews have been undertaken.
All currently reported resources estimates are considered robust, and representative on both

Description of the Mineral Resource estimate used as a basis for the conversion to an Ore 
Reserve.
Clear statement as to whether the Mineral Resources are reported additional to, or inclusive

Commentary
•
At all projects, all Resources that have been converted to Reserve are classified as either 
an  Indicated  or  Measured  Resource.  Indicated  Resources  are  only  upgraded  to  Probable 
Reserves  after  adding  appropriate  modifying  factors.  Some  Measured  Resource  may  be 
classified as Proven Reserves and some are classified as Probable Reserve based on whether 
they are capitally or fully developed.

The Fortnum Gold Mine Operation ceased production in May 2007 when owned by Gleneagle 
Gold. Previous to this the operation was operated by Perilya and Homestake, and first began 
commercial mining operations in the late 1980’s. Extensive mining and processing records 
are therefore available in each of the deposits. 
Various open pit styles and host domains have been mined since discovery of the area by 
Homestake  in  1980’s.  Mining  during  this  time  has  ranged  from  open  pit  cut  backs,  virgin 
surface excavations to extensional underground developments. 
The  Fortnum  Gold  Mine  Open  Pit  and  Underground  inventory  had  a  Pre-feasibility  study 
completed  by  MLX  in  early  2016.  Additional  cost  details,  operational  constraints  and  a 
revision  of  the  Resources  (with  classification)  have  continued  since  this  initial  financial 
evaluation. A Feasibility Study was completed on these revisions and therefore forms the 
basis for this Reserve statement. The Fortnum Gold Mine is now at a budgetary level analysis 
with specific details on processing components and reagent costs, specific mining contractor 
cost profiles, contractual haulage costs, power provider unit rates as well as site specific G&A
Underground Mines - Cut off grades were determined for the various mining methods and 
various mining sections in the mines. The COG’s have been applied to both development and 
stope production from their respective areas.
Open  Pit  Mines  -  The  pit  rim  cut-off  grade  (COG)  was  determined  as  part  of  the  Reserve 
estimation.  The  pit  rim  COG  determines  which  material  will  be  processed  by  equating  the 
operating cost of processing and selling to the value of the mining block in terms of recovered 
metal and the expected selling price. The COG is then used to determine whether or not a 
mining block should be delivered to the treatment plant for processing, stockpiled as low-
grade or taken to the waste dump as waste.
Ore Reserves have been undertaken on a ‘bottom up’ process – with the physicals reflecting 
mine designs rather than Resource conversion factors or Whittle optimisations.
HGO
Mining methodologies for underground Reserves centre on long hole open stoping. However, 
there are areas which are designed as narrow vein up hole or flat bench stoping. All methods 
described  in  the  Reserve  have  either  been  trialled  successfully  and/or  implemented 
historically. The stope design parameters take into account the different mining shapes and 
are based on specific geology and geotechnical domains associated with those areas. Stope 
shapes, level layouts and extraction sequences are designed cognisant of local and regional 
ground conditions. Where deteriorating ground conditions are expected or where significant 
fault planes run adjacent to mineralisation, stope shapes are altered to encompass these 
conditions and sequenced early to ensure recovery is possible.
Dilution  factors  vary  pending  the  orebody  style  and  host  rock  conditions  as  well  as  from 
mining sequence and development layouts.
Each mining method applied has a minimum width, which corresponds to sub level distances, 
blast hole drill accuracy constraints, nature of the mineralisation and/or fleet flexibility.

Open Pit Methodology.
Following consideration of the various modifying factors the following rules were applied to 
the reserve estimation process for the conversion of measured and indicated resource to 
reserve for suitable evaluation.
The  mining  shape  in  the  reserve  estimation  is  generated  by  a  wireframe  (geology 
interpretation of the ore zone) which overlays the block model. Where the wire frame cuts the 
primary block, sub blocks fill out the remaining space to the wire frame boundary (effectively 
the mining shape). It is reasonable to assume that the mining method can selectively mine to 
the wire frame boundary with the additional dilution provision stated in point 4 below.

Ore Reserves are based on Pit shape designs – with appropriate modifications to the original 
Whittle Shell outlines to ensure compliance with practical mining parameters. 
Geotechnical  parameters  allied  to  the  Open  Pit  Reserves  are  either  based  on  observed 
existing  pit  shape  specifics  or  domain  specific  expectations  /  assumptions.  Various 
geotechnical reports and retrospective reconciliations were considered in the 2016 design 
parameters. A majority of the open pits have a final design wall angle of 38-420, which is 
seen as conservative.   
Dilution of the ore through the mining process has been accounted for within the Reserve 
quoted inventory. Various dilution ratios are used to represent the style of mineralization. 
Where continuous, consistent ore boundaries and grade represent the mineralised system 
the following factors are applied: oxide 15%, transitional 17% and fresh 19%. In circumstances 
where the orebody is less homogenous above the COG then the following dilution factors are 
applied  in  order  to  model  correctly  the  inherent  variability  of  extracting  discrete  sections 
of the pit floor: oxide 17%, transitional 19% and fresh 21%.  To ensure clarity, the following 
percentages are additional ore mined in relation to excavating the wire frame boundary as 
identified in point 1 above, albeit at a grade of 0.0 g/t. The amount of dilution is considered 
appropriate  based  on  orebody  geometry,  historical  mining  performance  and  the  size  of 
mining equipment to be used to extract ore.
Expected mining recovery of the ore has been set at 93%.
Minimum Mining widths have been accounted for in the designs, with the utilization of 90T 
trucking parameters.   
No  specific  ground  support  requirements  are  needed  outside  of  suitable  pit  slope  design 
criteria based on specific geotechnical domains.
Mining sequence is included in the mine scheduling process for determining the economic 
evaluation and takes into account available operating time and mining equipment size and 
performance.
No Inferred material is included within the open pit statement, though in various pit shapes 
inferred material is present. In these situations this inferred material is classified as waste.
Underground Methodology.
All Underground Reserves are based on 3D design strings and polygon derived stope shapes 
following the Measured and Indicated Resource (in areas above the COG). A complete mine 
schedule is then derived from this design to create a LOM plan and financial analysis.  
Mining methodology is based on previous mining experience. All mining systems within the 
Reserve statement are standardized, mechanized Western Australian methods.
In  large  disseminated  orebodies  a  sub  level  open  stoping  or  single  level  bench  stoping 
production methodology is used. 
In narrow vein laminated quartz hosted domains a conservative narrow bench style mining 
method is used. 
In narrow flat dipping deposits a Flat Long Hole process is adopted (with fillets in the footwall 
for rill angle) and or Jumbo stoping.

Stope shape parameters have been based on historical data (where possible) or expected 
stable hydraulic radius dimensions.
Stope  inventories  have  been  determined  by  cutting  the  geological  wireframe  at  above 
the area specific COG and applying mining dilution and ore loss factors. The ore loss ratio 
accounts for pillar locations between the stopes (not operational ore loss) whilst dilution 
allows for conversion of the geological wireframe into a minable shape as well as hangingwall 
relaxation.  A 20% dilution factor and 10% loss ratio has been subsequently applied to the 
Starlight Reserve statement.
Minimum  mining  widths  have  been  applied  in  the  various  mining  methods.  The  only 
production style relevant to this constraint is ‘narrow stoping’ – where the minimum width is 
set at 1.5m in an 18.5m sub level interval. 
Mining  operational  recovery  for  the  underground  mines  is  set  at  100%  due  to  the  use  of 
remote loading units as well as paste filling activities. 
Stope  shape  dimensions  vary  between  the  various  methods.  Default  hydraulic  radii  are 
applied to each method, and are derived either from historical production or geotechnical 
reports / recommendations. Where no data or exposure is available conservative HR values 
are used based on the contact domain type.  
Mining sequence is included in the mine scheduling process for determining the economic 
evaluation and takes into account available operating time and mining equipment size and 
performance.
HGO
Gold extraction is achieved using staged crushing, ball milling with gravity concentration and 
Carbon in Leach. The Higginsville plant has operated since 2008 and historical recoveries on 
Trident ore average 97% 
Treatment of ore is via conventional gravity recovery / intensive cyanidation and CIL is applied 
as industry standard technology.
Additional  test-work  is  instigated  where  notable  changes  to  geology  and  mineralogy  are 
identified. Small scale batch leach tests on primary Louis ore have indicated lower recoveries 
(80%) associated with finer gold and sulphide mineralisation.
There have been no major examples of deleterious elements affecting gold extraction levels 
or bullion quality. Some minor variations in sulphide mineralogy have had short-term impacts 
on reagent consumptions.
No  bulk  sample  testing  is  required  whilst  geology/mineralogy  is  consistent  based  on 
treatment plant performance.

Trident reserves are reflective of current operating practices and mine planning processes. 
All currently reported reserve calculations are considered representative on a local scale. 
Regular  mine  reconciliations  occur  to  validate  and  test  the  accuracy  of  the  estimates  at 
Trident. A comprehensive production history confirms the validity of the Trident reserve.
Reserve calculations for open pits are cognisant of the historical geological, geotechnical and 
mining data. Confidence in the Reserve is further achieved with the validation of historical 
production data and observation of structural orientations on the existing pit walls.
SKO
All currently reported reserve calculations are considered representative on a local scale. 
Regular mine reconciliations occur to validate and test the accuracy of the estimates at SKO.
CMGP
The ore reserve has been completed to a DFS standard and benchmarked against local site 
historical production and experience, hence confidence in the estimates is high.
FGP
Various sensitivity analyses have been undertaken on the 2016 Reserve models in order to 
understand and subsequently control risk.

JORC Code Explanation
•
Nature  and  quality  of  sampling  (eg  cut  channels,  random  chips,  or  specific  specialised 
industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such 
as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not 
be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate 
calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report.
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be relatively simple (eg 
‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to 
produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation may be required, such 
as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or 
mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.
Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, 
sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-
sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc).
Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed.
Measures  taken  to  maximise  sample  recovery  and  ensure  representative  nature  of  the 
samples.

Diamond Drilling
The bulk of the data used in resource calculations at Renison has been gathered from diamond 
core. Three sizes have been used historically NQ2 (45.1mm nominal core diameter), LTK60 
(45.2mm nominal core diameter) and LTK48 (36.1mm nominal core diameter), with NQ2 
currently in use. This core is geologically logged and subsequently halved for sampling. Grade 
control holes may be whole-cored to streamline the core handling process if required.
NQ  and  HQ  core  sizes  have  been  recorded  as  being  used  at  Mount  Bischoff.  This  core  is 
geologically logged and subsequently halved for sampling.
There is no diamond drilling for the Rentails Project.
Face Sampling
Each  development  face  /  round  is  horizontally  chip  sampled  at  Renison.  The  sampling 
intervals  are  domained  by  geological  constraints  (e.g.  rock  type,  veining  and  alteration  / 
sulphidation etc.). Samples are taken in a range from 0.3m up to 1.2m in waste / mullock. All 
exposures within the orebody are sampled. A similar process would have been followed for 
historical Mount Bischoff face sampling.
There is no face sampling for the Rentails Project.
Sludge Drilling
Sludge  drilling  at  Renison  is  performed  with  an  underground  production  drill  rig.  It  is  an 
open hole drilling method using water as the flushing medium, with a 64mm (nominal) hole 
diameter. Sample intervals are ostensibly the length of the drill steel. Holes are drilled at 
sufficient angles to allow flushing of the hole with water following each interval to prevent 
contamination.
There is no sludge drilling for the Mount Bischoff Project. There is no sludge drilling for the 
Rentails Project.
RC Drilling
RC drilling has been utilised at Mount Bischoff.
Drill cuttings are extracted from the RC return via cyclone. The underflow from each interval is 
transferred via bucket to a four tiered riffle splitter, delivering approximately three kilograms 
of the recovered material into calico bags for analysis. The residual material is retained on the 
ground near the hole. Composite samples are obtained from the residue material for initial 
analysis, with the split samples remaining with the individual residual piles until required for 
re-split analysis or eventual disposal.
There is no RC drilling for the Renison Project.
There is no RC drilling for the Rentails Project.

Percussion Drilling
This drilling method was used for the Rentails project and uses a rotary tubular drilling cutter 
which was driven percussively into the tailings. The head of the cutting tube consisted of a 
50mm diameter hard tipped cutting head inside which were fitted 4 spring steel fingers which 
allowed the core sample to enter and then prevented it from falling out as the drill tube was 
withdrawn from the drill hole.
There is no percussion drilling for the Renison Project.

material been noted.
Diamond core is logged geologically and geotechnically.
RC chips are logged geologically.
Development faces are mapped geologically.
Logging is qualitative in nature.
All holes are logged completely, all faces are mapped completely.
Drill core is halved for sampling. Grade control holes may be whole-cored to streamline the 
core handling process.
Samples are dried at 90°C, then crushed to <3mm. Samples are then riffle split to obtain a 
sub-sample of approximately 100g which is then pulverized to 90% passing 75um. 2g of the 
pulp sample is then weighed with 12g of reagents including a binding agent, the weighed 
sample  is  then  pulverized  again  for  one  minute.  The  sample  is  then  compressed  into  a 
pressed powder tablet for introduction to the XRF. This preparation has been proven to be 
appropriate for the style of mineralisation being considered.
QA/QC is ensured during the sub-sampling stages process via the use of the systems of an 
independent NATA / ISO accredited laboratory contractor.
The sample size is considered appropriate for the grain size of the material being sampled.
The un-sampled half of diamond core is retained for check sampling if required.
For RC chips regular field duplicates are collected and analysed for significant variance to 
primary results.

Commentary
•
Assaying is undertaken via the pressed powder XRF technique. Sn, As and Cu have a detection 
limit 0.01%, Fe and S detection limits are 0.1%. These assay methodologies are appropriate for 
the resource in question.
All assay data has built in quality control checks. Each XRF batch of twenty consists of one 
blank,  one  internal  standard,  one  duplicate  and  a  replicate,  anomalies  are  re-assayed  to 
ensure quality control.
Specific gravity / density values for individual areas are routinely sampled during all diamond 
drilling where material is competent enough to do so.
Anomalous intervals as well as random intervals are routinely checked assayed as part of 
the internal QA/QC process.
Virtual twinned holes have been drilled in several instances across all sites with no significant 
issues highlighted. Drillhole data is also routinely confirmed by development assay data in 
the operating environment.
Primary data is loaded into the drillhole database system and then archived for reference.
All  data  used  in  the  calculation  of  resources  and  reserves  are  compiled  in  databases 
(underground and open pit) which are overseen and validated by senior geologists.
No primary assays data is modified in any way.
All data is spatially oriented by survey controls via direct pickups by the survey department. 
Drillholes  are  all  surveyed  downhole,  currently  with  a  GyroSmart  tool  in  the  underground 
environment  at  Renison,  and  a  multishot  camera  for  the  typically  short  surface  diamond 
holes.
All drilling and resource estimation is undertaken in local mine grid at the various sites.
Topographic control is generated from remote sensing methods in general, with ground based 
surveys undertaken where additional detail is required. This methodology is adequate for the 
resource in question.
Drilling in the underground environment at Renison is nominally carried-out on 40m x 40m 
spacing in the south of the mine and 25m, x 25m spacing in the north of the mine prior to 
mining occurring. A lengthy history of mining has shown that this data spacing is appropriate 
for the Mineral Resource estimation process and to allow for classification of the resource as 
it stands.
Drilling  at  Mount  Bischoff  is  variably  spaced.  A  lengthy  history  of  mining  has  shown  that 
this data spacing is appropriate for the Mineral resource estimation process and to allow for 
classification of the resource as it stands.
Drilling at Rentails is usually carried out on a 100m centres. This is appropriate for the Mineral 
resource estimation process and to allow for classification of the resource as it stands.
Compositing is carried out based upon the modal sample length of each individual domain.

Renison is one of the world’s largest operating underground tin mines and Australia’s largest 
primary tin producer. Renison is the largest of three major Skarn, carbonate replacement, 
pyrrhotite-cassiterite deposits within western Tasmania. The Renison Mine area is situated 
in the Dundas Trough, a province underlain by a thick sequence of Neoproterozoic-Cambrian 
siliciclastic  and  volcaniclastic  rocks.  At  Renison  there  are  three  shallow-dipping  dolomite 
horizons which host replacement mineralisation.
Mount  Bischoff  is  the  second  of  three  major  Skarn,  carbonate  replacement,  pyrrhotite- 
cassiterite deposits within western Tasmania. The Mount Bischoff Mine area is situated within 
the Dundas Trough, a province underlain by a thick sequence of Neoproterozoic- Cambrian 
siliciclastic and volcaniclastic rocks. At Mount Bischoff folded and faulted shallow-dipping 
dolomite horizons host replacement mineralisation with fluid interpreted to be sourced from 
the forceful emplacement of a granite ridge and associated porphyry intrusions associated 
with the Devonian Meredith Granite, which resulted in the complex brittle / ductile deformation 
of  the  host  rocks.  Lithologies  outside  the  current  mining  area  are  almost  exclusively 
metamorphosed siltstones. Major porphyry dykes and faults  such as the Giblin and Queen 
provided the major focus for ascending hydrothermal
fluids  from  a  buried  ridge  of  the  Meredith  Granite.  Mineralisation  has  resulted  in  tin-rich 
sulphide  replacement  in  the  dolomite  lodes,  greisen  and  sulphide  lodes  in  the  porphyry 
and fault / vein lodes in the major faults. All lodes contain tin as cassiterite within sulphide 
mineralisation with some coarse cassiterite as veins throughout the lodes.
The Rentails resource is contained within three Tailing Storage Facilities (TSF’s) that have 
been built up from the processing of tin ore at the Renison Bell mine over the period 1968 
to 2013.
