<p><b>  Report of the Secretary-General</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present report reflects the status of implementation of Human Rights Council 
resolution 19/22 of 23 March 2012, following the first report of the Secretary-General 
thereon (A/HRC/20/37), which covered the period up until 11 May 2012. The present 
report contains information on relevant developments up until 20 July 2012, a summary of 
the information submitted by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic in notes 
verbales addressed to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights during the reporting period,as well as information on measures and actions taken by 
relevant international stakeholders.  
</p>
<p> The ceasefire that came into effect on 12 April 2012 held for several days. From 16 
April until early May 2012, the cessation of armed violence was not fully respected, 
although a general reduction in violence was reported, including in the use of heavy 
weaponry. The presence of observers of the United Nations Supervision Mission in the 
Syrian Arab Republic in some areas appeared to have a calming effect. Since 10 May, the 
situation has deteriorated with a surge in the use of improvised explosive devises. At the 
same time, there were reports of intermittent fighting between the parties and the use of 
heavy weapons by Government forces. Late in May, conditions further deteriorated, with a 
rise in attacks by Government forces on population centres using heavy weapons and 
mechanized infantry as part of a campaign to clear anti-Government armed groups. These 
attacks were accompanied by an increase in attacks by anti-Government armed groups on

 * Late submission. 
</p>

<p>Government security forces, as well as Government and civilian infrastructure, using small 
arms, improvised explosive devices and rocket-propelled grenades. The continuous fighting 
between the parties, the use of heavy weapons by the Government and the increase in the 
use of improvised explosive devises resulted in heavy civilian casualties and mass 
displacement of civilians inside and outside the country.  
</p>
<p> During the period under review, reports were received of numerous human rights 
violations committed by Government forces, which may amount to crimes against 
humanity and, possibly, war crimes. There were also increasing reports that anti-
Government armed groups were committing serious human rights violations.  
</p>
<p> It should be noted that, throughout the period under review, the six-point plan 
proposed by the Joint Special Envoy remained central to the efforts aimed at achieving a 
peaceful resolution to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic.

with international standards, ensuring transparency, integrity and equal representation for 
all segments of society. It asserted that the new electoral system guarantees the rights to 
freedom of expression, opinion and peaceful assembly, and of belonging to political parties 
in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. According to the Government, 18 political parties 
took part in the elections, which reportedly represented a twofold increase in the number of 
licensed political parties. The Government pointed out that 5,<footnote name="1">See https://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php.

the ever-deepening confrontation and to cooperate with UNSMIS. I urged them to 
recommit in good faith to the fulfilment of their obligations under the six-point plan of the 
Joint Special Envoy, following the path outlined by the Action Group on 30 June 2012 with 
a view to paving the way for an inclusive Syrian-led political process to address the 
legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people.

</p>
<p>  A. Ending violence and human rights violations  ................................................  18&#8211;<footnote name="2">6. OHCHR received information indicating that Government forces continued to 
commit numerous human rights violations during the period under review, including 
arbitrary arrest and detention, torture and other forms of ill-treatment in detention, sexual 
violence, extrajudicial executions and unlawful killings. Similar violations were reportedly 
committed against women and children. There were also increasing reports of abductions, 
torture and ill-treatment and murder of captured members of Government forces, pro-
Government militia and civilians by anti-Government groups. Reports were also received 
of summary executions carried out by such groups of those in their custody after allegedly 
subjecting them to &#8220;speedy trials&#8221;.OHCHR received other information indicating that anti-
Government armed groups violated the rights to children, including by using children as 
soldiers. Other reports suggested that both Government forces and anti-Government armed 
groups had deployed snipers who targeted civilians.

&#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; had prevented humanitarian aid from reaching those in need and </footnote>4 9

<p>  C. Refugees outside the Syrian Arab Republic ...................................................  35&#8211;<footnote name="3">2.  In this context, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic recalled that, in March 
2012, it jointly led a process to assess the humanitarian needs of those affected by the crisis. 
It stressed that it had implemented its commitment to allow the distribution of humanitarian 
aid in accordance with the relevant United Nations memorandum of understanding. 
Nevertheless, as at mid-July, only a small portion of the Humanitarian Response Plan had 
been funded, thus hindering the humanitarian response. The Government reported that it 
was also directly providing humanitarian assistance, including medical aid, food and other 
services, to those in need, and was implementing projects to reconstruct buildings to 
facilitate the return of displaced persons to their homes.

</p>
<p>  D. Measures taken by the Government to meet the demands and aspirations  
   of the Syrian people ........................................................................................  39&#8211;<footnote name="4">3. The Government also referred to amendments made to the Constitution, which was 
approved through a referendum in February 2012. The amendments, according to the 
Government, included significant changes such as the abolition of article VIII of the 
Constitution, which articulated the role of the Baath Party in the leadership of the State and 
society, in addition to other paragraphs, taking into account reforms in the field of human 
rights and the State&#8217;s international obligations and commitments. 
</footnote>4 11 
</p>
<p>  E. Media and journalists ......................................................................................  45&#8211;<footnote name="4">2. The Government reported that it was carrying out democratic and comprehensive 
political, economic and social reforms, while prioritizing the issue of human rights. It stated 
that these reforms were aimed at achieving the demands of the people through elections and 
dialogue. It added that, within the framework of such reforms, it had revised the majority of 
laws in compliance with international standards, such as Election Law No. 101 (2011) and 
Political Parties Law No. 100 (2011), and abolished the Emergency Law and the State 
Security Court. The Government stressed that it adopted new laws, such as a law regulating 
peaceful demonstration, while taking into account international standards in the relevant 
fields.

my report to the Security Council on the implementation of Council resolution 2043 (2012) 
(S/2012/523), as well as my letters dated 25 and 27 May 2012 to the Council (S/2012/363

persons and persons involved in peaceful political activities, and to allow access to 
detention places. As noted in my report on the implementation of Security Council 
resolution 2043 (2012) (S/2012/523), progress in this area was insignificant in a context 
where the status and conditions of thousands of detainees across the country remained 
unclear. This includes not only persons engaged in armed fighting but also human rights 
defenders, political activists, women and children.

2012, at least 200 demonstrators were treated for bullet wounds at local hospitals in 
Aleppo, of whom 10 reportedly died. Credible sources also reported that at least six civilian 
casualties, including four deaths, resulted from indiscriminate shooting by Government 
forces during a demonstration held in Aleppo on 6 July 2012. Furthermore, several 
demonstrators were detained for participating in protests without due process and held 
incommunicado.  </footnote> 15

mechanisms &#8220;eschewing politicization&#8221; in accordance with the State&#8217;s commitments and 
international obligations. The Government also pointed out that it regularly provided </footnote>4 16

endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 66/253. In this context, I continued to 
support the efforts of the Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the League of Arab 
States, whose mandate was based on resolution 66/253 and therefore reflected all relevant 
decisions of the League of Arab States. A detailed account of my efforts in this context was 
presented in my letters dated 25 and 27 May 2012 to the Security Council (S/2012/363 and 
S/2012/368), as well as in my report on the implementation of Security Council resolution 
2043 (2012) (S/2012/523).

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council condemned in the strongest terms 
the sharply escalating widespread, systematic and gross violations of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms perpetrated by the Syrian authorities, and requested action from the 
authorities to put an immediate end to all violence and all human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>2. In resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council requested that I present a report on 
the implementation of that resolution at its twentieth and twenty-first sessions. On 27 June 
2012, my first report on the implementation of resolution 19/22, covering the period up 
until 11 May 2012, was presented to the Council (A/HRC/20/37). Pursuant to the request of 
the Council, the present report focuses on the status of implementation of resolution 19/22 
and outlines relevant developments on the ground up until 20 July 2012. It contains a 
summary of the information submitted by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic in 
notes verbales addressed to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) during the reporting period. Furthermore, the report includes 
information on measures taken by relevant international actors, including the Security 
Council, the General Assembly, the Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the 
League of Arab States on the Syrian Crisis and other United Nations entities.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Recent developments 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Current context 
</b></p>
<p>3.  It should be recalled that, on 8 May 2012, the International Committee of the Red 
Cross (ICRC) stated publicly that it had reached the conclusion that there was a non-
international armed conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic between Government forces and 
armed opposition groups present and operating, in particular in Homs and Idlib provinces. 
On 16 July 2012, ICRC further stated that the confrontations between Government forces 
and armed opposition groups in several areas of the country, including but not limited to 
Homs, Idlib and Hama, had met the threshold of a non-international armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>4. On 2 July 2012, the High Commissioner briefed the Security Council on the human 
rights situation in the Syrian Arab Republic. During her briefing, the High Commissioner 
recalled the obligation of both parties to abide by international human rights and 
humanitarian law. She reported on serious human rights violations committed by both 
parties that might amount to crimes against humanity and, possibly, war crimes, and urged 
that perpetrators be held accountable.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Efforts of the Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the League 
</b></p>
<p><b>of Arab States on the Syrian crisis 
</b></p>

<p>despite the efforts of the United Nations Supervision Mission in the Syrian Arab Republic 
(UNSMIS) to support the parties to de-escalate the crisis. He reported that human rights 
violations continued, and that violence by Government forces had intensified, while anti-
Government armed groups had declared that they would not respect the demand for the 
cessation of hostilities and intensified their attacks. On 30 June, in Geneva, the Joint 
Special Envoy convened a meeting of the Action Group for Syria consisting of the 
Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the League of Arab States, the European 
Union, the five permanent Members of the Security Council, as well as other countries with 
influence over the parties to the conflict. In its communiqu&#233; of 30 June 2012, the Action 
Group renewed the commitment to the six-point plan proposed by the Joint Special Envoy 
and set out principles and guidelines for a Syrian-led political transition.  
</p>
<p><b> C. United Nations Supervision Mission in the Syrian Arab Republic  
</b></p>
<p>7. It should be recalled that, following the announcement of the cessation of armed 
violence, brokered by the United Nations, that came into effect across the country on 12 
April 2012, the Security Council authorized, in its resolution 2043 (2012), the deployment 
of UNSMIS. The Mission was deployed for an initial period of 90 days to monitor the 
cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties, and to monitor and support the 
full implementation of the six-point plan endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 
2042 (2012). By 30 May 2012, UNSMIS was fully operational, and worked actively in 
support of all aspects of the six-point plan, while monitoring and supervising the cessation 
of violence. 
</p>
<p>8. In late May 2012, violence sharply increased throughout the country. The escalation 
of violence affected directly and indirectly UNSMIS observers and ultimately impeded the 
implementation of their mandated activities. On 15 June, UNSMIS temporarily suspended 
its operations owing to the increase in violence, the obstacles to monitoring the situation on 
the ground, and the direct targeting of its personnel and assets. UNSMIS resumed limited 
activities, subject to security conditions, on 26 June 2012. The Mission undertook visits to 
hospitals and schools in order to monitor, observe and report on the impact of the violence 
on the civilian population and to assess medical protection and humanitarian access.  
</p>
<p>9. On 20 July 2012, when the initial 90-day mandate of UNSMIS expired, the Security 
Council unanimously adopted resolution 2059 (2012), in which it renewed the mandate of 
the Mission for a final period of 30 days. The Council indicated that further renewals would 
be possible only if it could be confirmed that the use of heavy weapons had ceased and a 
reduction in violence by all parties was sufficient to permit UNSMIS to implement its 
mandate.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Information from the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic and its position with regard to Human Rights 
Council resolution 19/22 
</b></p>

<p>11. During the reporting period, OHCHR received 56 additional notes verbales from the 
Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic. Some were addressed to relevant special 
procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights Council, to treaty bodies and to the 
international independent commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic. Some of the 
notes verbales included statistics on casualty figures among citizens. others related to 
allegations of kidnappings, sabotage and looting of, and attacks on, private and public 
property, which the Government attributed to &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;, as well as 
information on the number of explosives either defused by Government forces or exploded. 
Several notes verbales included information on official investigations into incidents of mass 
killings at Al-Houla and Al Qubeir, committed in May and June 2012, respectively. The 
present report includes a summary of the notes verbales specifically addressed to OHCHR 
and containing information relevant to the implementation of Human Rights Council 
resolution 19/22. 
</p>
<p>12.  In its note verbale dated 16 July 2012, the Government reiterated that it continued to 
reject Human Rights Council resolution 19/22 on the grounds that it was political and went 
beyond the mandate of the Council to protect and promote human rights. The Government 
reiterated its committement to all human rights mechanisms that were not &#8220;politicized&#8221;. It 
stated that resolution 19/22 failed to recognize the considerable efforts made by the 
Government to meet its commitments and international obligations towards its population, 
as well as towards political and governance reform. In the same note verbale, the 
Government provided information on human rights violations reportedly perpetrated by 
what it called &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;. Information on alleged violations committed by 
Government forces or pro-Government militias was not provided..  
</p>
<p>13. The Government reiterated that armed groups continued to conduct criminal and 
terrorist acts against Syrian citizens while sabotaging public and private property. 
According to the Government, these groups received large quantities of weapons from 
some Member States, and manufactured others. The Government reported that it had 
discovered a large number of explosives and missiles in several warehouses and farms. It 
added that similar explosives were planted in crowded places, or targeted Government 
forces as well as citizens refusing to join or support &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>14.  The Government stated that, while Council resolution 19/22 attributed violations 
against children to the Syrian authorities, it disregarded violations committed by &#8220;terrorist 
armed groups&#8221; through killings, kidnappings and using children as human shields. 
According to the Government, these groups exploited children for political gain and for 
media purposes, inter alia, by filming children in emotional yet staged scenes attributing 
violations to Government forces. The Government reported that &#8220;armed terrorist groups&#8221; 
had prevented children from attending schools and attacked, set on fire and used schools as 
a base for terrorist acts and as detention facilities for torture and executions. In this context, 
the Government reiterated that it was aware of its responsibilities and obligations towards 
its population, in particular children, and that it had sought to raise awareness among 
parents on issues relating to child protection and the risks that they might face as a result of 
the acts of &#8220;armed terrorist groups&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>15.  In the Government&#8217;s opinion, the fact that the Human Rights Council did not 
condemn the acts of &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; in resolution 19/22 gave the green light to 
these groups to continue their brutal practices and human rights violations. According to the 
Government, the Council had failed to address funding, arming, training and harbouring by 
Member States of these &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>16. The Government reiterated its position that Human Rights Council resolution 19/ 22 had failed to address the issue of sanctions and their negative impact on the Syrian people  </p>
<p>and on the already dire humanitarian situation in the country. According to the 
Government, the Syrian Arab Republic had been &#8220;subjected to more than 60 packages of </p>


<p>illegal unilateral coercive sanctions by the United States, the European Union, the League 
of Arab States, Turkey, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Japan and others&#8221;. The 
Government pointed out that the sanctions targeted all aspects of life, including the 
economy, finance, agriculture, industry, food, medicine, tourism, transportation, science 
and culture. The Government described the sanctions as amounting to collective 
punishment aimed at obtaining political gain through pressure on the Syrian people, who 
were directly suffering from these unilateral measures. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 19/22 
</b></p>
<p>17. In its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council requested actions from the 
Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, particularly in paragraphs 3, 4, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17 
and 18. The Government, in its note verbale dated 16 July 2012, stated that the 
responsibility to implement the bulk of the demands to halt the violence and human rights 
violations made in resolution 19/22 lay on &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; and on the Member 
States funding, supporting and harbouring these groups. The Government called upon the 
international community to put an end to this foreign intervention and to assert pressure on 
these Member States to stop human rights violations by proxy through the acts of &#8220;terrorist 
armed groups&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Ending violence and human rights violations  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Violence  
</b></p>
<p>18. The Human Rights Council, in paragraphs 3, 4 and 13 (<i>a</i>) of resolution 19/22, 
strongly urged the Syrian authorities to put an immediate end to violence and all human 
rights violations, and demanded that it meet its responsibility to protect its population. In 
paragraph 13 (<i>c</i>), the Council demanded that the Government withdraw all military and 
armed forces from cities and towns in accordance with the Plan of Action of the League of 
Arab States of 2 November 2011 and the League&#8217;s decisions of 22 January and 12 February 
2012. 
</p>
<p>19. Under the six-point plan, the Government committed to bring an immediate end to 
all forms of violence by all parties and to protect civilians. It should be recalled that, in a 
communication addressed to the Joint Special Envoy on 1 April 2012, the Government had 
committed to the immediate cessation of troop movements, an end to the use of heavy 
weapons in population centres, and to begin to pull back military concentrations in and 
around population centres no later than 10 April 2012. Similar commitments to respect the 
cessation of violence from anti-Government armed groups were sought by the Joint Special 
Envoy.  
</p>
<p>20. The ceasefire that came into effect on 12 April held for several days. From 16 April 
until early May 2012, the cessation of armed violence was not fully respected; however, a 
general reduction in violence was reported, including in the use of heavy weaponry. The 
presence of UNSMIS observers in some areas appeared to have a calming effect. 
</p>
<p>21. In early May 2012, an increase in the number and size of improvised explosive 
devices marked a significant deterioration in the situation on the ground. On 10 May, in 
Damascus, two suicide-bomb attacks targeted Government facilities, resulting in the killing 
and injury of members of Government forces and of civilians. The following day, in 
Aleppo, a bomb exploded in a market area, and Government forces reportedly seized a 
truck carrying heavy explosive devices before it could detonate. At the same time, there 
were reports of intermittent fighting between the parties to the conflict and of an increase in 
the number of heavy weapons used by Government forces in or near population centres. </p>


<p>Anti-Government armed groups also attacked Government forces, installations and 
checkpoints.  
</p>
<p>22. In late May 2012, conditions deteriorated, as seen in the an increase in the number of 
attacks by Government forces on population centres, using heavy weapons, including tanks 
and artillery shelling, helicopter rockets, cannons and mechanized infantry, as part of a 
campaign to clear anti-Government armed groups. Heavy weapons were used particularly 
in Dar&#8217;a, Homs, Hama, Idlib and Rif Dimashq, and expanded to the larger urban areas of 
Deir el-Zour, Damascus and Aleppo. These attacks were accompanied by an increase in 
planned and coordinated attacks by anti-Government armed groups targeting Government 
forces, as well as Government and civilian infrastructure, using small arms, improvised 
explosive devices and rocket-propelled grenades.  
</p>
<p>23. Allegations were made of the indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force by 
Government forces during armed clashes that took place in populated areas. Such use of 
force resulted in heavy civilian casualties and mass displacement of civilians inside and 
outside the country. While the United Nations is unable to verify the number of casualties, 
the Government reported that more than 7,000 citizens had been killed. Some Syrian non-
governmental organizations and opposition groups reported that between 13,000 and 
17,000 citizens had been killed as a result of the crisis.  
</p>
<p>24. The Government did not provide any information on the withdrawal of heavy 
weapons from population centres during the reporting period, only stating that, when it had 
withdrawn heavy weapons from such areas during the visit of the League of Arab States 
observer mission, which was deployed in December 2011, the &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; had 
reinforced their position quickly and continued to terrorize and intimidate civilians.  
</p>
<p>25. In its note verbale dated 16 July 2012, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
reported that it had issued strict orders to security forces not to use weapons, except in cases 
of self-defence, armed clashes with &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; or to prevent horrifying acts 
against, or mass killings of, citizens in areas where the security forces were present. In the 
Government&#8217;s opinion, the security forces carried out their duties with utmost 
professionalism, accuracy and self-control towards civilians while protecting their right to 
life from crimes committed by &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Human rights violations 
</b></p>

<p>establishment of a national independent legal commission to investigate all crisis-related 
crimes, reporting that it had reviewed more than 6,<footnote name="4">1. The Government referred to a comprehensive national dialogue that it had launched 
in mid-2011, reportedly to reach a peaceful national solution. According to the 
Government, some parties continued to reject dialogue. It had nevertheless pursued its 
reform efforts, stating that the newly appointed national unity Government included a 
spectrum of national opposition members who rejected the use of weapons and were against 
foreign intervention. Furthermore, the Government pointed out that an opposition leader 
was acting as the Deputy Prime Minister, while another one had been appointed Minister to 
the newly-established Ministry of National Reconciliation to follow up on all the problems 
caused by the recent crisis and to find appropriate solutions in various fields.  
</footnote>00 complaints and referred a large 
number of cases to the competent authorities. The Government also referred to a special 
commission of inquiry that it had established to investigate the events of Al-Houla of May 
2012. The Government stated that both commissions enjoyed wide powers in accordance 
with the highest international standards, including the authority to demand access to any 
information deemed necessary. In the Government&#8217;s view, the commissions had proven 
their ability to provide justice at the national level. In this context, the Government stated 
that the relevant authorities had imposed disciplinary sanctions against a number of 
members of Government forces, while others remained under investigation or were facing 
trial by competent courts.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Humanitarian assistance 
</b></p>
<p>29. In paragraph 9 of its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council urged the Syrian 
authorities to ensure timely, safe and unhindered access for all humanitarian actors and to 
ensure the safe passage of humanitarian and medical supplies into the country. The 
humanitarian situation continued to deteriorate as a result of the intensified fighting. The 
continued violence and fighting hampered efforts to address humanitarian needs. 
Humanitarian actors estimated that, as at 13 July 2012, there were 1.5 million people 
affected by the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic.  
</p>
<p>30. During the period under review, attacks on hospitals, medical facilities and 
ambulances increased, as did direct threats to and killings of medical personnel. Moreover, 
access to health, especially for those perceived to be affiliated with the opposition or anti-
Government armed groups, was undermined by the occupation and use of hospitals as 
military bases or by the presence of Government forces inside or in the proximity of 
hospitals. Furthermore, there were reports of destroyed, burned or ransacked medical 
facilities by anti-Government armed groups. There were also reports that hospitals were 
used as military bases also by anti-Government armed groups. 
</p>
<p>31. Since my previous report on the implementation of resolution 19/22, the 
Government has agreed to the Syria Humanitarian Assistance Response Plan and the 
United Nations has scaled up its humanitarian assistance. Up to 800,000 people were 
provided with food assistance in July 2012. Non-food items, emergency health assistance, 
remedial education and other activities also increased. Despite the challenging security 
situation during the period under review, following the agreement with the Government, the 
United Nations was in the process of expanding its presence. Eight international non-
governmental organizations launched their humanitarian response to the affected population 
and an increasing number of national non-governmental and community-based 
organizations were participating in the humanitarian response as of 13 July 2012. These 
efforts, however, remain insufficient to meet the growing needs.  
</p>

<p>were targeting humanitarian workers. The Government attributed an attack made on 13 
June 2012 on a convoy of ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, which was targeted by 
an explosive device that wounded three workers, to &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;. The 
Government added that, in June 2012, it had made several attempts to give ICRC access to 
areas in Homs controlled by &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; to evacuate sick and wounded 
persons, the elderly, women, children and those with special needs, and to facilitate the 
provision of humanitarian aid. According to the Government, &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; 
refused to evacuate sick or wounded persons or to allow humanitarian assistance, and had 
targeted the humanitarian workers in the area for three weeks, until the Syrian National 
Reconciliation Committee, in coordination with relevant stakeholders, succeeded in 
evacuating 92 civilians. The Government stated that those who remained were used as 
human shields by &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; that disregarded their obligations under 
international human rights and humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>34. In June 2012, humanitarian actors reported that the implementation of a 
humanitarian ceasefire negotiated in Homs and Deir el-Zour with the parties to the conflict 
to allow the evacuation of civilians and bodies and the delivery of humanitarian and 
medical assistance had not been successful, with both parties not suspending hostilities as 
planned.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Refugees outside the Syrian Arab Republic 
</b></p>
<p>35. In paragraph 10 of resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council invited all relevant 
United Nations agencies, in particular the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR), to provide support to Syrian refugees and neighbouring countries 
hosting them.  
</p>
<p>36. As a result of the conflict, the refugee flow to countries neighbouring the Syrian 
Arab Republic continued unabated during the reporting period. The number of refugees has 
doubled since my previous report to the Human Rights Council. According to the Syria 
Regional Refugee Response compiled by UNHCR,1 a total of 119,<footnote name="6">9. It should be recalled that, under the six-point plan, the Government of the Syrian 
Arab Republic pledged to ensure respect for freedom of association and the right to 
demonstrate peacefully. As noted in my report on the implementation of Security Council 
resolution 2043 (2012) (S/2012/523), the broad context of human rights violations and 
intimidation in the Syrian Arab Republic does not constitute an environment in which 
citizens can express their opinions and demonstrate freely. Despite the risks of violence, 
protests continued to take place during the reporting period, albeit for shorter periods and 
on a smaller scale when compared with the demonstrations reported at the early stages of 
the crisis. Pro-Government demonstrations were also held in a range of locations.  
</footnote>18 Syrian refugees, of 
whom 75 per cent are women and children, were receiving assistance in neighbouring 
countries at 19 July 2012 (42,682 in Turkey, 36,<footnote name="4">0. During the period under review, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
announced additional initiatives within the framework of political and governance reforms 
that it considered to be in pursuit of political pluralism and a democratic political process. 
Following the referendum of 26 February 2012, parliamentary elections were held on 7 
May, and a new Government was appointed on 23 June. 
</footnote>50 in Jordan, 32,486 in Lebanon and 
8,000 in Iraq). UNHCR also reported that, owing to the increasing concern about the 
situation, more than 13,000 Iraqi refugees left the Syrian Arab Republic in the first half of 
2012, most returning to Iraq.2  
</p>
<p>37. Syrians escaping the conflict increasingly sought shelter beyond the region. In 
Europe, the number of Syrian asylum seekers markedly increased. According to UNHCR, 
as at 20 July 2012, some 12,000 Syrian asylum applications had been submitted for 
European countries.<footnote name="3">8. A revised refugee response plan was launched on 28 June 2012 to help Syrian 
refugees in neighbouring countries. As at 19 July, only 26 per cent of total needs were 
funded, putting host countries under considerable strain. In addition, an estimated 1 million 
internally displaced persons were reported in the Syrian Arab Republic as at the same date.  
</footnote>  
</p>

<p><b> D. Measures taken by the Government to meet the demands and 
</b></p>
<p><b>aspirations of the Syrian people 
</b></p>
<p>39. In paragraph 11 (<i>a</i>) of its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council urged the 
Syrian authorities to respect the demands and aspirations of the Syrian people. It should be 
recalled that the six-point plan and the communiqu&#233; of the Action Group were aimed at 
facilitating an inclusive Syrian-led political process to address the legitimate aspirations and 
concerns of the Syrian people. On 7 June 2012, in a briefing to the General Assembly and 
the Security Council, the Joint Special Envoy stated that the plan had not been implemented 
and that meaningful political dialogue was therefore not possible.  
</p>

<p><b> E. Media and journalists 
</b></p>
<p>45. In paragraph 11 (<i>b</i>) of its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council demanded 
that the Syrian authorities put an immediate end to all attacks on journalists and that they 
ensure adequate protection, fully respect freedom of expression and allow independent and 
international media to operate.  
</p>
<p>46. The Government pledged to ensure freedom of movement for journalists throughout 
the country and to ensure a non-discriminatory visa policy for them, in accordance with the 
six-point plan. After 25 March 2012, the Government accelerated the issuance of entry 
visas to journalists. During the period under review, OHCHR periodically received notes 
verbales from the Government concerning the number of international and Arab journalists 
and media organizations that had been issued entry visas. In the most recent communication 
on the subject, received on 16 July 2012 and covering the period from 25 March to 12 July 
2012, the Government stated that more than 237 international media outlets had entered the 
Syrian Arab Republic. In this connection, it also referred to its letter dated 31 May 2012 
from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic, addressed to the President 
of the Security Council and me (S/2012/389), in which it listed the names of 28 foreign 
journalists who had reportedly entered the country illegally. 
</p>
<p>47. As noted in my report to the Security Council on the implementation of Council 
resolution 2043 (2012) (S/2012/523), several international media outlets reported that visas 
had not been issued for several months to their journalists. Some Syrian journalists reported 
that they had been detained by Government forces or physically attacked or harassed by 
anti-Government gatherings. There were also reports that journalists affiliated to official 
Syrian media channels would not venture into areas controlled by anti-Government armed 
groups out of concern for their safety.  
</p>
<p>48. On 28 June 2012, the Government informed OHCHR that &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; 
had attacked the headquarters of the Syrian news channel Al-Ikhbariya, near Damascus, on 
27 June, destroying the station and killing three journalists, four team members and the 
security guards of the building. On 2 July, the Al-Nusra Front, on its website, claimed 
responsibility for the attack. 
</p>
<p>49.  In the opinion of the Government, the Human Rights Council had overlooked the 
issue of sanctions imposed on Syrian governmental and non-governmental media outlets, 
the press and bloggers by some Member States. The Government referred to, inter alia, the 
resolution of the League of Arab States of 2 June 2012, in which it requested the 
administrators of the Arab satellite communications organization to take the action 
necessary to stop broadcasting Syrian governmental and non-governmental satellite 
channels. In the view of the Government, the resolution was aimed at censoring and 
excluding alternative views from the mainstream media discourse. In this context, the 
Government also referred to a note verbale of 19 June 2012 addressed to the President of 
the Security Council and me (A/66/853-S/2012/461). The Government saw these measures 
as unilateral and aimed at silencing the Syrian national media, in blatant contradiction with 
the principle of freedom of media and information and with the provision of the six-point 
plan regarding the freedom of movement of journalists. According to the Government, such 
measures gave the green light to &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; to target Syrian journalists and 
media organizations.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Foreign nationals 
</b></p>
<p>50. In paragraph 11 (<i>c</i>) of its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council demanded 
that the Syrian authorities take immediate steps to ensure the safety of foreign nationals in </p>


<p>the Syrian Arab Republic, including refugees and diplomatic staff members, and the 
protection of their property. 
</p>
<p>51. The situation in the Syrian Arab Republic has gradually and significantly affected 
the situation of refugees living in the country, including 500,000 Palestinian refugees and 
more than 103,000 registered Iraqi refugees.4 In June 2012, UNHCR noted that refugees 
inside the Syrian Arab Republic had not been directly targeted during armed clashes, even 
though they were increasingly reporting security incidents affecting them. The conflict had 
a negative impact on the ability to deliver protection and assistance to such refugees.5  
</p>
<p>52. In its note verbale dated 16 July 2012, the Government pointed out that it guaranteed 
the security and safety of all diplomats, refugees and tourists, as evidenced by its history as 
a haven for people who sought refuge from persecution or discrimination. The Government 
reported that a certain number of refugees had been killed by gunfire, explosives or other 
criminal methods, referring also to the discovery of the corpses of 19 young Palestinian 
men near Aleppo who had allegedly been kidnapped by &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; and 
subsequently executed.  
</p>
<p>53.  The Government pointed out that there was a category of foreigners &#8220;sponsored by 
other Member States&#8221; who had illegally entered the Syrian Arab Republic to carry out 
terrorist attacks. It referred to its letter dated 16 May 2012 addressed to the Secretary-
Genera, the President of the Security Council and the Chairperson of the Security Council 
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) concerning counter-terrorism 
(S/2012/328), in which it listed the names of 10 non-Syrian citizens who had illegally 
entered the country and been killed while engaging in terrorist armed operations against the 
Syrian army.  
</p>
<p>54. Furthermore, the Government reported that it detained 26 foreigners who, it stated, 
were engaged in terrorist acts. It pointed out that the leadership of al-Qaida had called upon 
its members to go and fight in the Syrian Arab Republic. According to the Government, 
once the involvement of foreign nationals was revealed, &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; 
deliberately started disposing of the corpses of those killed, by burning or burying them in 
deserted areas or throwing them into rivers, to hide the proof of the involvementof 
foreigners. According to the Government, some of the Member States who had sponsored 
Human Rights Council resolution 19/22 were training, supporting and hiring mercenaries to 
fight in the Syrian Arab Republic, with complete disregard for international efforts to 
combat mercenaries, including relevant decisions of the General Assembly and the Council. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Cities under siege 
</b></p>
<p>55. In paragraph 11 (<i>d</i>) of its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council demanded 
that the Syrian authorities lift the blockade of all cities under siege. The Government did 
not provide OHCHR with information thereon.  
</p>
<p>56. Further reports indicate that the number of checkpoints controlled by Government 
forces and by anti-Government armed groups increased throughout the country. Lists of 
wanted persons were reportedly circulated and individuals were arrested at checkpoints in 
the governerates of Homs, Al Ladhiqiyah, Idlib, Aleppo, Dar&#8217;a and Damacus. Government 
checkpoints were also reportedly preventing access of patients to health care. 
</p>
<p>  
 4  Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Humanitarian Bulletin, Middle East and North 
</p>
<p>Africa, No. 2, May-June 2012. 
 5 The Government estimated the presence of some 1 million Palestinian refugees, and as many refugees 
</p>
<p>from Iraq. </p>


<p>57. Information received by OHCHR indicates a pattern of military operations on 
alleged anti-Government strongholds that included cordons, the use of heavy weapons and 
house-to-house search operations. According to that information, targeted areas were 
cordoned off by checkpoints and the supply of water, electricity and other basic services 
was cut off. Reports show that, once the areas were cordoned, artillery and tank units 
supported by helicopters conducted heavy shelling. Ground forces then entered the areas to 
complete the military operations.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Plan of Action of the League of the Arab States 
</b></p>
<p>58. In paragraph 12 of its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council called upon the 
Syrian authorities to implement the Plan of Action of the League of Arab States of 2 
November 2011 in its entirety, as well as the League&#8217;s relevant decisions, without delay.  
</p>
<p>59. In its note verbale dated 16 July 2012, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
stated that it had implemented in good faith the Plan of Action of the League of Arab 
States, and recalled that it had granted access to and facilitated the League of Arab States 
observer mission, and withdrawn its forces from the cities.  
</p>
<p>60. The Government also pointed out that it cooperated with the Joint Special Envoy, 
agreed to the six-point plan and implemented much of it,and sincerely supported and had 
facilitated the work of UNSMIS observers, and provided them with protection. These 
efforts, according to the Government, reflected its willingness to cooperate with the 
international community to reach a peaceful solution, which would be based on national 
dialogue. In this context, the Government accused &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;, and certain 
Member States that funded and armed them, of hampering UNSMIS observers from 
carrying out their mandate and the implementation of the six-point plan. 
</p>
<p>61. The Government stated that it remained supportive of political dialogue, and that 
there must be an international commitment and political will to implement fully the six-
point plan. It stated that, unless the arming and financing of &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; 
ceased, it would be difficult to implement the plan if only the Government was committed 
to it..The Governmnet added that, while it welcomed the outcome of the meeting of the 
Action Group on 30 June 2012, the &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; and the Member States that 
supported them were against that outcome. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Detainees  
</b></p>
<p>62. In paragraph 13 (<i>b</i>) of its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council demanded 
that the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic release all persons detained arbitrarily 
due to the crisis in accordance with the Plan of Action of the League of Arab States and its 
decisions of 22 January and 12 February 2012. 
</p>

<p>4,200 detainees. In its note verbale of 16 July 2012, the Government reported that more 
than 10,000 prisoners had benefited from four presidential amnesty decrees, as did a large 
number of citizens who had surrendered, handed over weapons and made a written 
commitment that they would refrain from carrying weapons or otherwise prejudicing the 
security and stability of the Syrian Arab Republic.  
</p>
<p>65. The Government reported in several notes verbales addressed to OHCHR that it had 
released 206 detainees on 10 June 2012 and 500 others on 13 June. Furthermore, it 
reportedly released 275 detainees on 10 July and 92 on 17 July. The Government did not 
share with OHCHR the list and details of the persons released. UNSMIS observed the 
release of 609 detainees countrywide in the context of three Government release exercises 
on 31 May, 14 June and 11 July 2012, as noted in my report on the implementation of 
Security Council resolution 2043 (2012) (S/2012/523).  
</p>
<p>66. In its note verbale dated 16 July 2012, the Government denied that its security forces 
had imprisoned, tortured and killed children, pointing out that, if children were mistakenly 
arrested, they would be released immediately and not brought to court provided that they 
were under the minimum age of criminal responsibility.  
</p>
<p>67. There are continuing reports of anti-Government armed groups abducting or 
kidnapping individuals. Reports were received that, in some cases, payment was made or 
ammunition was provided in exchange for the release of people in their custody.  
</p>
<p><b> J. Rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p>68. In subparagraphs 13 (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>) of its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council 
demanded that the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, in accordance with the Plan of 
Action and the decisions of the League of Arab States, guarantee the right to peaceful 
assembly and allow access for all relevant institutions of the League.  
</p>

<p><b> K. Independent international commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab 
</b></p>
<p><b>Republic  
</b></p>
<p>71. In paragraphs 14 to 17, and 20 and 21 of its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights 
Council referred to the mandate and work of the independent international commission of 
inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, which was established by the Council in its resolution 
S-17/1. The commission continued to carry out its mandate, with full secretariat support 
provided by OHCHR. Pursuant to paragraph 14 of resolution 19/22, the commission 
presented an oral update to the Council at its twentieth session (A/HRC/20/CPR.1). The 
update included the preliminary findings of a special inquiry conducted by the 
commissionin to the events of Al-Houla, pursuant to Council resolution S-19/1. The 
commission will also present a written updated report to the Council at its twenty-first 
session (A/HRC/21/50).  
</p>
<p>72.  In paragraph 17 of its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council repeated its call 
upon the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to cooperate with the commission of 
inquiry. The chairperson of the commission visited Damascus from 23 to 25 June 2012 to 
discuss with the Syrian authorities the work of the commission. The details of that visit 
were reported in the commission&#8217;s oral update. To date, however, the commission has not 
been granted access to the country to carry out in situ investigations.  
</p>
<p>73. In its oral report to the Human Rights Council, pursuant to resolution 19/22 
(A/HRC/20/CRP.1), the commission of inquiry included information up until 15 June 2012. 
In the update, the commission stated that it had reasonable grounds to believe that people 
had been killed, arbitrarily arrested, detained, tortured and subjected to sexual violence by 
Government forces and pro-Government militia, and that crimes against humanity may 
have been committed by Government forces. The commission also reported that security 
forces personnel and civilians had been killed, abducted and tortured by anti-Government 
armed groups, who had increased their use of improvised explosive devices. The 
commission had not been able to ascertain responsibility for several incidents in which 
explosives were used. 
</p>
<p>74. In paragraphs 20 and 21 of its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council decided 
to transmit the reports of the commission of inquiry to all relevant United Nations bodies 
and the Secretary-General for appropriate action, and recommended that the main bodies of 
the United Nations urgently consider the reports of the commission and take appropriate 
action to address human rights violations, as well as crimes against humanity that may have 
been committed. During the reporting period, I transmitted the oral update of the 
commission of inquiry (A/HRC/20/CRP.1) to the Security Council on 19 July 2012. It is 
recalled that I had transmitted the previous report of the commission (A/HRC/S-
17/2/Add.1) to the Security Council on 13 December 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> L. Office of the High Commissioner and special procedures mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b>holders of the Human Rights Council  
</b></p>

<p>OHCHR with documented information, including the preliminary findings of the special 
commission of inquiry on the Al-Houla incident. The Government did not address the 
question of an OHCHR field presence in its note verbale. 
</p>
<p>77. On 1 June 2012, at the nineteenth special session of the Human Rights Council, all 
special procedures mandate holders presented a joint statement in which they deplored the 
alarming deterioration of the situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic, 
emphasizing that all available information indicated that crimes against humanity, and 
possibly other crimes under international law, had been committed. The mandate holders 
called on the authorities to provide full and unhindered access to, inter alia, the special 
procedures.  
</p>
<p>78. Requests for visits to the Syrian Arab Republic by special procedures mandate 
holders of the Human Rights Council, including those by the Special Rapporteur on the 
rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association and the Special Rapporteur on 
the human rights of internally displaced persons, remained pending. On 13 July 2012, the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions addressed a request to 
visit to the country.  
</p>
<p><b> M. Efforts by the Secretary-General 
</b></p>
<p>79. In paragraph 19 of its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council invited me to 
take the measures necessary to support the efforts of the League of Arab States to achieve a 
peaceful solution to the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic.
