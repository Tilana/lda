</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 6/17. Establishment of funds for the universal periodic  
review mechanism of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> that the universal periodic review is a cooperative mechanism 
</p>
<p>with the full involvement of the country concerned and with consideration given to its 
</p>
<p>capacity-building needs in accordance with General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 
</p>
<p>March 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> the fact that the institution-building text adopted on 18 June 2007 
</p>
<p>states that a universal periodic review Voluntary Trust Fund should be established to 
</p>
<p>facilitate the participation of developing countries, particularly least developed 
</p>
<p>countries, in the universal periodic review, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that the institution-building text also requests the Council to decide 
</p>
<p>on the question whether to resort to existing financing mechanisms or to create a new 
</p>
<p>mechanism, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to establish a universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>Voluntary Trust Fund to facilitate the participation of developing countries, 
</p>
<p>particularly least developing countries, in the universal periodic review mechanism; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also requests</i> the Secretary-General to establish a new financial 
</p>
<p>mechanism called the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance to be 
</p>
<p>administered jointly with the universal periodic review Voluntary Trust Fund 
</p>
<p>mentioned in paragraph 1, in order to provide, in conjunction with multilateral 
</p>
<p>funding mechanisms, a source of financial and technical assistance to help countries 
</p>
<p>implement recommendations emanating from the universal periodic review in 
</p>
<p>consultation with, and with the consent of, the country concerned; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> all member States, observers and other stakeholders of the 
</p>
<p>Council to support the operationalization of the above funds; </p>

<p> 4. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
</p>
<p>take the necessary measures with a view to expeditiously operationalizing the 
</p>
<p>mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Decides</i> to follow up on the matter under the same agenda item at its 
</p>
<p>seventh session. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>[Adopted without a vote] 
21st meeting 
</i></p>
<p><i>28 September 2007</i>
