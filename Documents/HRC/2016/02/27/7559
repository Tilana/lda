</p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression visited Montenegro from 14 to 17 June 2013, based on the open 
invitation extended by the Government of Montenegro using al the special procedures.  The 
Government of Montenegro appreciates highly the engagement of the Special Rapporteur 
and understands his visit as an additional step forward in the efforts to look into the 
possibilities for further promotion of media freedom in Montenegro. The Government of 
Montenegro is grateful to the Special Rapporteur for his commitment and engagement and 
appreciates highly the cooperation in the preparation of this visit with the Special 
Rapporteur himself, his associates, as well as the team of the UN system in Montenegro. 
Mutual coordination and understanding represent a confirmation of excellent relations 
between Montenegro and the United Nations, contributed by the activities of Montenegro 
as a member of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>2. The Government of Montenegro extends its gratitude for the acceptance of a set of 
comments of a technical character, sent with the aim to improve the text of the Report. In 
order to contribute to additional improvement of the Report prepared by the Special 
Rapporteur and contribute to the objectiveness of its findings, the Government of 
Montenegro submits this paper, as well, which contains explanations of the activities taken 
with regard to specific parts of the Report. Namely, this document, if considered together 
with the Report, contributes to the presentation of the state of freedom of opinion and 
expression in Montenegro in an objective manner, thus contributing also to the full exercise 
of mandate of the Special Rapporteur for freedom of opinion and expression with regard to 
transparency, objectiveness and constructiveness. 
</p><p>3. Fully respecting the use of information provided by other domestic and international 
actors, the Government of Montenegro finds it necessary to draw the attention to a set of 
inaccuracies and a number of irregularities in the given data, based on which numerous 
facts are inadequately interpreted, resulting in the drawing of imprecise or wrong 
conclusions. We noted that the final text failed to include a set of concrete facts and results 
achieved with regard to the issues raised by the Rapporteur, which were presented by the 
high Montenegrin officials from over 10 institutions to the Special Rapporteur in direct 
discussions. Neglecting argumentative facts and views of the official state authorities and 
relying on non-argumentative statements from other sources, which are not supported by 
evidence, in many parts of the Report, unfortunately resulted in a one-sided look into the 
status of the freedom of opinion and expression.  
</p>
<p>4. Besides, commenting the efforts aimed at prevention and sanctioning of assaults on 
journalists in the period following his visit, the Special Rapporteur relied on the sources 
mentioned in the footnote (footnote no. 6), which present incorrect facts. Having in mind 
that the Special Rapporteur failed to ask the Government of Montenegro to provide official 
facts, underlying here &#8211; official facts, not only views, prior to drafting the final text, the 
Government of Montenegro feels the duty to present in this document clarification of the 
progress achieved that was not noted in the Report prepared by the Special Rapporteur, 
together with the supporting facts and arguments. Besides contributing to the objectiveness 
of the final assessment, the fact we are presenting here also prove the commitment of the 
state institutions to pay priority attention to the protection of journalists within the overall 
protection of human rights and liberties. 
</p>
<p>5. With an additional aim to provide an objective analysis of the status of media 
freedom in Montenegro, we are quoting part of the Analytical Report, accompanying the 
EC Opinion on Montenegro&#8217;s application for membership of the European Union, from 
2010, states as follows: &#8220;<i>Freedom of expression (including the media) is guaranteed by the 
Constitution and broadly applied in practice. The media landscape is diverse and 
pluralistic. The Law on electronic media, together with the amendments to the Law on 
electronic communications lays a good legal basis for developing and regulating the public </i></p>

</b></p>
<p><i>broadcaster and, more broadly, for independent and professional media.</i>&#8221;1 Besides, as a 
confirmation of the commitment to guaranteeing freedom of expression, in the latest EC 
Progress Report for Montenegro, in Chapter 23 (Justice and Fundamental Rights) is is 
emphasized that &#8220;<i>freedom of expression has continued to be ensured, e.g. with the recent 
start of more serious investigations into cases of violence against journalists and the 
pronouncement of verdicts in some cases&#8221;.</i>23 The assessment from the <i>2013 EC Progress 
Report for Montenegro</i>, given in the part related to chapter 10, <i>Information society and 
media</i>, which states that &#8220;<i>a good level of legal alignment has been reached</i>&#8221;, confirms the 
quality of the legislative framework.4  
</p>
<p>6. In the text that follows, please find additional facts and assessments that confirm the 
commitment of all the Government institutions to build a society based on fundamental 
values of democracy and observance of human rights and liberties, including the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p><b>  Summary 
</b>7. In the period following its independence, Montenegro achieved significant progress 
with regard to improvement of its legislative framework, enforcement and achievement of 
international standards of protection of the freedom of opinion and expression and 
protection of journalists.<b> </b> 8. Key activities of Montenegro that contributed to the promotion of the freedom of 
opinion and expression are as follows: 
</p>
<p> (a) The Commission for monitoring of actions taken by the responsible 
authorities with regard to investigations of cases of threats and violence against journalists, 
assassinations of journalists and assaults on media property was established on 26 
December 2013. This Commission has 11 members, and its chair is the Deputy Editor in 
Chief of the Dan Daily, Mr. Nikola Markovic;  
</p>
<p> (b) The accused for the assassination of the Editor in Chief of the &#8220;Dan&#8221; Daily 
was pronounced a non-repealable single sentence of 19 years in prison; 
</p>
<p> (c) In February 2014, a Working group responsible for Risk assessment 
regarding danger for the employees in the media sector was established; 
</p>
<p> (d) In 2013, there were two pride parades organized in Montenegro, with the 
support of the Government of Montenegro, and the Police Directorate and the Ministry of 
Interior received public acknowledgment for that from the organizers &#8211; non-governmental 
organizations for the protection of rights of LGBT population;  
</p>
<p> (f) Public assembly represents a constitutional category. In the period January 
2012-May 2014, there were <b>3,127</b> public gatherings held, while <b>118</b> were prohibited in the 
cases when the participants were posing direct danger to themselves or others by such 
gathering (e.g. protest walk of the persons with professional disability down the highway);

regulatory bodies was defined with the aim to promote self-regulation and encourage 
creation of basic prerequisites for work of the self-regulatory bodies; 
</p>
<p> (j) The Agency for Personal Data Protection and Free Access to Information

<p><b>  Part III of the report &#8211; Domestic legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. Part III of the Report did not include the information that the Law on amendments to 
the Criminal Code from August 2013 introduces in the criminal legislation of Montenegro a 
new basis for exempting from punishment certain criminal offenses from Chapter Fifteen - 
criminal offences against freedoms and rights of man and the citizen<b> </b>that is based on the 
principle of predominant interest. Namely, for certain criminal offenses this involves 
unauthorized encroachment into the private life of the individual that can be justified if this 
is done in order to prevent or detect serious offenses Article 176a (&#8220;Exemption from 
punishment for criminal offences under Articles 172-176 of the Code): &#8220;No punishment 
shall apply for crimes under Articles 172-176 to anyone who by committing any of these 
offences prevents or detects a crime punishable by law by a five-year prison term or a more 
severe punishment.&#8221;<b> </b></p>
<p><b>  Part IV of the report &#8211; Freedom of opinion and expression  
</b></p>
<p><b>  B 1. Violence and intimidation of journalists  
</b>10. The Report contains the following inaccuracies: The Rapporteur did not ask 
Montenegro to provide data regarding cases of assaults on journalists that he mentions in 
the Report referring to the source in footnote 6, which relates to the period following his 
visit, based on which he defined certain conclusions and comments that do not reflect the 
actual situation &#8211; <b><i>See Annex 1 &#8211; Paragraph 24.</i>  
</b></p>
<p>11. The Report also contains inaccuracies regarding legal terminology, leading to wrong 
perception of the actions taken by the authorities in the given case &#8211; <b>See <i>Annex 1 &#8211; 
Paragraph 26.</i> 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Rapporteur failed to include important facts regarding actions taken by the state 
authorities in the given cases &#8211; <b><i>See Annex 1 - Paragraphs 30 and 31 </i></b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Paragraphs 76 and 77 of the Report &#8211; Recommendations regarding 
violence and intimidation of journalists  
</b>13. The recommendations did not take into consideration achievements of the 
Government of Montenegro in the period following the visit of the Special Rapporteur, that 
is, the Report recommends measures and activities that are already well underway. Namely, 
<b>The Rapporteur recommends that: &#8220;Paragraph 76</b><i> &#8211; The identification of 
responsibilities in all cases of violence and intimidation against journalists must be 
achieved without delay, so perpetrators are brought to justice. In particular, adequate 
resources must be provided to ensure that the recently established commission for 
monitoring investigations into attacks on journalists fully succeeds in its task. Specific 
attention must be given to the clarification of the potential direct or indirect involvement of 
the authorities or public officials in all episodes of violence; <b></b></i><b>Paragraph 77</b><i> &#8211; The 
authorities should value the work of the investigative press in their statements and refrain 
from attacking it. Particular attention must be paid to ensuring accountability in episodes 
of violence against the press by members of political parties&#8221;.</i> 
14. We hereby provide the following facts, in support of the statement that 
recommendations are being implemented. The Commission for monitoring of actions taken 
by the responsible authorities with regard to investigations of cases of threats and violence 
against journalists, assasinations of journalists and assaults on media property was 
established. This Commission has 11 members, and its chair is the Deputy Editor in Chief 
of the Dan Daily, Mr. Nikola Markovic. Besides Markovic, members of this commission 
include representatives of the State Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the Police Directorate, the National 
Security Agency, the independent daily &#8220;Vijesti&#8221;, the Media self-regulation council, the 
Trade Union of the media and the civil sector. International experts, that is, international 
organizations whose portfolio includes areas related to the tasks of this Commission can 
also participate in its work, and the interest of this kind was already expressed by the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The Commission held six 
meetings so far, and the sixth meeting was attended by the co-rapporteurs of the Monitoring 
Committee of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, Mr. Kimo Sasi and Mr. 
Terry Leyden. The Commission has regular meetings, with the support provided by the 
Ministry of Interior to all of the commission members, in terms of providing insight into all 
hte acts, documents and facts that resulted in solving the cases from the aspect of the police. 
The Ministry of Interior also provides administrative support and business premises for the 
work of this commission. 
</p>
<p><b>  B 2 &#8211; Defamation  
</b></p>
<p>15. In <b><i>Paragraph 39</i></b>  the Rapporteur interpreted views from the study &#8220;Independent 
legal mission to study press freedom in Montenegro&#8221; in the manner which disputes the 
exercise of the right to legal remedy and the principles of independence and autonomy of 
judiciary in Montenegro. Contrary to that, we hereby state that the courts cannot deny the 
right to court protection to the citizens, including the right to lodge a lawsuit for 
compensation of non-material demage caused by encroachment or violation of rights, 
irrespective of who the defendant is &#8211; the media/ journalists or some other person. The 
courts have a constitutional and legal obligation to decide autonomously and independently, 
in regular court proceedings, whether petitions of this kind are grounded, including the duty 
to decide on lawsuits against journalist/ the media that were possibly frivolous or politically 
motivated<b><i>. 
</i></b></p>
<p>16. <b><i>Paragraphs 40 and 42</i></b>  of the Report contains inaccurate data regarding cases of 
compensation of damage involving journalists/ the media as the defendant. The caselaw </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>shows that out of the total number of cases received, the courts accept a very small number 
of petitions of this kind, they award compensation of non-material damage in the amounts 
that are far smaller than the ones requested in the petitions. The courts are applying the 
Principal Legal Position of the Supreme Court from 2011 related to awarding of a fair 
compensation of non-material damage in cases involving journalists/ the media as the 
defendant, while observing the caselaw of the European Court of Human Rights<b><i>.</i></b>  
</p>
<p>17. The following facts also confute the statements contained in <b><i>Paragraphs 40 and 42</i></b> . 
In 2012, no verdict was adopted involving compensation of non-material damage, and two 
petitions were rejected. In 2013, the courts processed 23 cases involving journalists/ the 
media as the defendant, and eleven cases were solved. Out of that number, in seven cases 
the court rejected the petitions. Decisions to withdraw the lawsuit were adopted in two 
cases, and they are now effective (non-repealable). In one case (Basic Court in Podgorica) 
the court decision was adopted awarding the compensation of non-material damage in the 
amount of EUR 5,000, while the amount requested in the petition was EUR 100,000. 
Appellate process is underway in this case. In one case, the petition was partially accepted, 
by which the defendants are obliged to jointly compensate the non-material damage based 
on offended honor and reputation in the amount of EUR 2,000, while the amount requested 
in the petition was EUR 15,000. Appellate process in this case is also underway<b><i>. </i></b> In 2014, 
there are ongoing litigations in 25 cases involving compensation of non-material damage 
with journalists/ the media as defendants &#8211; <i>(See ANNEX 2) &#8211; Table &#8220;Pending cases&#8221;.</i>  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 78 of the Report &#8211; Recommendation regarding defamation  
</b></p>
<p>18. This recommendation ignores the activities undertaken in Montenegro with regard to 
defamation and proposes them as introduction of new measures. Namely, the Rapporteur 
recommends as follows <b>&#8211; <i>Paragraph 78</i>:</b> &#8220;<i>The work of Montenegrin courts that are 
implementing the new national norm for defamation must be closely monitored to ensure 
that complaints of defamation are not used to intimidate the press. Courts must be 
systematically made aware of international standards relating to the imposition of penalties 
for defamation. The authorities must respect the freedom of the media to investigate their 
activities and refrain from using judicial instruments on defamation to intimidate critical 
voices in the press.&#8221; 
</i></p>
<p>19. Defamation was decriminalized and all of the ongoing criminal proceedings 
involving defamation and insults before the Montenegrin courts, in which media were 
indicted, have been finalized with effective decisions of the courts. Thus, there is no 
mention that the Government is using judicial instruments related to defamation to 
intimidate critical voices of the press, that is, this statement by the Special Rapporteur is not 
based on facts. 
</p>
<p>20. In 2011, the Supreme Court adopted the Principal Legal Position that is binding for 
all the national courts acting in cases of compensation of non-material damage involving 
journalists/ the media as defendants. If found that there are grounds for accountability of 
journalists and media, a court sets the amount of fair compensation for violation of personal 
rights (reputation, honour, etc.) taking into consideration all circumstances of the respective 
case, in particular: importance of violated right and the consequences thereof, duration of 
distress, objective of the compensation for moral damage, and taking into consideration that 
the awarded compensation should be, by default, in compliance with the case law of the 
European Court of Human Rights, and that the amount of the awarded compensation does 
not discourage journalists and media in fulfilling their role in preservation of democratic 
values of the society. In practice, the courts have been abiding by the standards of the 
ECHR and by the Legal Position of the Supreme Court in relation to the value requested in 
the petitions. Out of 23 cases processed in 2013, the claims were accepted in two cases </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>only. Defendants in both cases were media as legal persons, not journalists as individuals. 
In the 2013 Progress Report for Montenegro, the European Commission stated in its 
assessment of the &#8220;Freedom of Expression&#8221; that courts in Montenegro had been generally 
abiding by the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, and training of judges on 
ECHR standards will continue through the Judicial Training Centre.  
</p>
<p><b>  B3 &#8211; Government interference in the media 
</b></p>
<p>21. With regard to <b><i>Paragraph 48</i></b>  of the Report, were give the following explanation 
regarding ensuring independence of the public broadcaster. The Law on Public 
Broadcasting Services of Montenegro is harmonized with the recommendation No. (96) 10 
of the Council of Europe on the guarantee of the independence of public service 
broadcasting. According to the assessment of the European Commission, Montenegro has 
achieved a good level of harmonization of the legal framework in the field of information 
society and media, as well as necessary administrative capacities, which resulted in opening 
of negotiations on Chapter 10 &#8220;Information society and media&#8221; at the Intergovernmental 
conference in Brussels on 31 March 2014. 
</p>
<p>22. The role of the state in the upcoming period of European integration relates to 
creation of prerequisites for sustainable work of the public broadcaster and for 
digitalization, as the key element for future of the broadcasting sector. The process of 
transition of the broadcasting service will involve looking for an adequate financial model 
to ensure sustainability that will not have a negative impact on the operations of the 
broadcasting service in public interest. This is a challenge that awaits not only Montenegro, 
but also many other modern societies in the world. In the attempt to respond to this 
challenge, the Government of Montenegro will follow relevant international practice, 
especially the EU legislation in this field.   
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 79 &#8211; Recommendations regarding the Government 
interference in the media  
</b></p>
<p>23. Recommendation of the Special Rapporteur regarding privatization of Pobjeda and 
transparency in the allocation of public resources for advertisement does not reflect the 
efforts made in this area. The Rapporteur recommends as follows<b>: <i>Paragraph 79</i></b>  &#8211; &#8220;<i>The 
Government must urgently conclude the transfer of Pobjeda to private hands, as its 
continued ownership of his daily newspaper and the perceived political bias in its editorial 
line contributes to the politicization of the national media. The Government should also 
ensure full transparency with regard to the allocation of public resources in advertising by 
guaranteeing their fair distribution across all media. The autonomy and full independence 
of the public broadcasting services and of the Agency for Electronic Media must be ensured 
on permanent basis &#8220;. 
</i></p>
<p>24. Namely, privatization of Pobjeda was included in every decision regarding 
privatization plan in the period 2007-2014, irrespective of whether it was simply about 
launching a tender or continued implementation of a tender, which clearly indicates the 
intention and willingness of the Government of Montenegro to privatize this company, in 
compliance with the obligation under the Law on Media. The Council for Privatization and 
Capital Projects launched three public tenders for privatization of the shareholding 
company &#8220;<i>Pobjeda</i>&#8221;: on 21 November 2007, on 29 July 2008 and on 27. September 2011. 
The tenders failed only as a result of the withdrawal of bidders originally interested in 
purchasing Pobjeda, and not because the Government of Montenegro did not want it to be 
privatized. In the meantime, the company has been working continuously on reducing the 
number of employees through the Voluntary redundancy programme, creating more </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>favourable conditions for privatization. The number of employees in Pobjeda a.d. in the 
period between 2005 and 2014 has been reduced by more than twice, from 425 to 195 
employees. By signing the Agreement on settling liabilities to the State with NIG Pobjeda 
AD in February 2013, the Government resolved the issue of fiscal debts of the company 
that had existed until then and which were standing in the way of privatization in the 
previous period. Thus, all the prerequisites for privatization have been created, 
</p>
<p>25. As stated before, the Government of Montenegro is taking action aimed at ensuring 
media pluralism, while taking care at the same time of the sustainability of the media and 
self-regulatory bodies, as well as the balanced distribution of funds for their work. 
</p>
<p><b>  B4 &#8211; Polarization of the media 
</b></p>
<p>26. <b><i>Paragraphs 53 and 54</i></b>  of the Report related to polarization of the media are 
deficient with regard to information on the Government&#8217;s support to self-regulatory bodies 
presented to the Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>27. Having in mind that media self-regulation is of special importance for the 
development of democratic, political and media culture, protecting at the same time the 
freedom to expression, and it also means assuming responsibility for public discourse, the 
Montenegrin model for the state&#8217;s participation in financing of independent self-regulatory 
bodies has been designed in such a way that it does not allow for jeopardising their 
independence in relation to the Government. On the basis of the opinion of the European 
Commission - media (2011-2014), in cooperation with the EU Delegation to Montenegro, 
the Government of Montenegro adopted a model of three-year step-up financing of media 
self-regulatory bodies in order to promote self-regulation and create conditions for 
functioning of self-regulatory bodies. Self-regulatory bodies were obliged to choose 
independently a financing model, and the establishment of the model of state support 
resulted from the requests of self-regulatory bodies themselves, due to their inability to get 
funds from other sources. Self-regulatory bodies are not obliged to submit the Report on 
disbursements of allocated funds, and all of this indicates that their independence cannot be 
called in question. Based on the said model, since 2012, two self-regulatory bodies &#8211; Media 
Self-Regulation Council (18 members) and Self-Regulatory Local and Periodical Press 
Council (22 members) &#8211; have been financed regularly through the said model, which will 
be implemented ending with 2014. As per the defined model, obligations towards self-
regulatory bodies have been fully implemented for 2012 and 2013, and support for 2014 is 
being prepared.  
</p>
<p>28. In 2011, the Government of Montenegro purchased all debts of private printed and 
electronic media, who had not settled their liabilities for signal frequency, and of all printed 
media who had not settled financial obligations towards commission distributors, whereby 
the media themselves are responsible for the choice of commission distributors. 
Specifically, the Government of Montenegro has purchased debts of commercial 
broadcasters to the Agency for Electronic Communications (AEC) and the Radio 
Broadcasting Centre (RBC) in the amount of 4.447.639,61 &#8364;.5; state support to commercial 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5
  The programme was implemented in the period 2011-2013 with the following dynamics: in 2011, 
</p>
<p>2.148.174,81 &#8364; (48% of the total allocated amount); in 2012, 1.512.197,48 &#8364; (34% of the total 
allocated amount; in 2013, 787.267,34 &#8364; (18% of the total allocated amount). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>printed media in the amount of 880.802,32 &#8364; has been realized as well, without 
discrimination of any key printed media and daily newspapers6. 
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 80 &#8211; Recommendation regarding polarization of the media  
</b></p>
<p>29. In <b>Paragraph 80</b> the Rapporteur recommends as follows: &#8220;A better dialogue among 
all media outlets is essential to permit a more objective discussion on the challenges faced 
by this vital sector. All media groups must be stimulated to voluntarily take part in self 
regulatory initiatives, to pay particular attention to the elimination of discriminatory 
remarks and to improving the quality of the work currently being developed. To be 
effective, self-regulatory bodies must have their work well publicized among readers and 
viewers, so these may file complaints, if desired. The staff that supports self-regulatory 
initiatives must have their independence from media owners preserved.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>30. Having in mind that the media are free, that is, independent in designing their 
editorial and management policy, the issue of polarization of the media exceeds the role of 
the state, which, according to the European standards in the media sector, cannot act as a 
mediator in such and similar situations. The issue of reducing polarization of the media 
relates directly to the media owners, who design editorial policy. Interference of the state in 
the work of media is reduced only to the transparent and equal incentives for sustainability 
of the self-regulatory bodies, upon their request, as well as incentives for media pluralism, 
as confirmed by the aforementioned data.

<p>31. The statement by the Special Rapporteur from <b><i>Paragraph 62</i></b>  that the deadline for 
deciding on the application for free access to information has been doubled is not grounded, 
having in mind that the deadline in Montenegro is among the shortest ones in Europe. The 
deadline to decide on an appeal to the first instance decision is 15 days, and in the opinion 
of the international experts it is very short. The Agency Council, as the second instance 
body, has the duty to decide on meritum, which is also a rare example and a significant step 
forward that Montenegro made in promoting the right of the public to know. It is a fact that 
certain laws give the possibility to limit access to information, however, they were adopted 
prior to the Law on Free Access to Information, thus, the provisions contained in them 
cannot be applied, and access to information can only be limited in the manner and 
according to the procedure defined by the Law on Free Access to Information. There is 
notable progress made with regard to the percentage of decisions by the authorities with 
regard to applications for free access to information; it is significantly higher than 48% that 
it used to be. The Agency for personal data protection and free access to information has 
registered in its database a total of 3600 applications, out of which 885 were denied and 10 
were rejected. 
32. There is an obvious increase in political will, as well as public awareness that free 
access to information can provide for efficient control of work of the authorities. During the 
current year, although it is not fully equipped in terms of staff and financial resources, the 
Agency has been strengthened significantly, thus it meets, with a greater or lesser success, 
its legally prescribed obligations. Via its web site, as well as through the presence in the

<p>media, the Agency has regular contacts with the public, with the aim to raise public 
awareness about the fact that the citizens have the right to know at any point in time which 
one of the state authorities and in which way performs tasks in their interest, on behalf and 
at the expense of the citizens, and which authority is neglecting its duties. The problem that 
the Agency still faces is the inadequate IT solution that is used to register applications for 
free access to information, decisions regarding those applications and the appeals lodged 
and decisions of the second instance authority. 
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 81 &#8211; Recommendations regarding access to information  
</b></p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur recommends enhancing access to information in <b>Paragraph 
81</b> as follows: &#8220;Adequate financial and human resources must be secured for the newly 
established Agency for the Protection of Personal Data and Free Access to Information so it 
can fully implement its mandate with autonomy and independence. The Agency should be 
capable of processing all requests effectively and also systematically report on institutional 
compliance with the law. Investments must be made to make civil society aware of the 
procedures for requesting information and to enhance the capacity of all public entities to 
comply with the law through technical support and training.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>34. The Agency for personal data protection will continue to invest maximum efforts in 
order to fully implement this recommendation.  
</p>
<p><b>  B 6 &#8211; Incitement to hatred and Paragraph 82 &#8211; Recommendation 
regarding incitement to hatred  
</b></p>
<p>35. With regard to incitement to hatred, the Special Rapporteur, in <b>Paragraph 82</b> 
recommended as follows: &#8220;The state must actively promote the right to expression of 
minorities, ensuring the full independence of those benefiting from financial resources. Law 
enforcement authorities must fully implement national norms regarding the prohibition of 
discrimination on all grounds. Specific attention must be paid to the recurrently high levels 
of hostility against the LGBT community. In particular acts of aggression against this 
community must be fully investigated. The authorities must publicly express their complete 
rejection of all forms of incitement to hatred. Efforts to promote the self-regulation of the 
media should also play an important role in ensuring better protection against incitement to 
hatred through the media.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>36. In the context of promotion and protection of the rights of the LGBT population, the 
Ministry of Interior and the Police Directorate are continuously developing a special 
sensibility for addressing all issues faced by members of this minority group. In this 
segment, actions of MoI of Montenegro rely on the principles of IDAHO Declaration, 
which sets out that <i>&#8220;all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and 
that human beings of all sexual orientations and gender identities are entitled to the 
enjoyment of human rights&#8221;.</i>  
37. By securing two Pride Parades during 2013, the Police Directorate confirmed its 
capacities to respond to all tasks7. PD signed Memorandums of Cooperation with NGOs 
working towards promotion and protection of the rights of the LGBT community, primarily

<p>with the NGO Queer Montenegro, LGBT Forum Progress and Juventas. &#8220;Team of trust&#8221; 
was established in 2014, consisting of police officers who had completed training to work 
with the LGBT community, and members of the LGBT community. The team meets 
regularly and reviews issues related to LGBT rights in order to find adequate solutions in 
different situations.  
</p>
<p>38. Representatives of PD participated actively in drafting of the Strategy for improving 
quality of life of LGBT persons for the period 2013 - 2018, and in drafting of the Action 
Plan for implementation of this Strategy for 2013. The Police Directorate delivered training 
to police officers for sensible work with the LGBT community and appointed LGBT 
contact police officers in all police stations in Montenegro.  
</p>
<p>39. In December 2013, the Police Directorate, Ministry of Interior and NGO LGBT 
Forum Progress issued a joint publication &#8220;Police, Tolerance and Accepting Identities&#8221;.  
</p><p>40. The new Law on Changes and Amendments to the Anti Discrimination Law, 
adopted at the session of the Parliament of Montenegro on 26.03.2014, tightened the penal 
policy relating to committed discrimination (ranging from 500 to 20.000 EUR) and 
introduces explicitly the institute of prohibition of hate speech, for the purpose of 
enhancing mechanisms for protection and promotion of anti-discriminatory policy. The 
Law on Gender Equality obliges media to &#8220;promote gender equality through a programme 
concept&#8221;. The Ministry for Human and Minority Rights is continuously providing training8 
to protectors of human rights, police and prosecution organisations, government employees, 
representatives of judiciary authorities, representatives of local governments, inspection 
services and others competent for providing protection against discrimination, and legal and 
psychological support to victims and witnesses of violence and hate crimes. Institutions 
competent for fighting against discrimination will be, by applying improved legal 
framework, better prepared for implementation of international standards and national 
legislation and will cooperate more efficiently on protection of the rights of marginalized 
groups (Roma, LGBT, persons with disabilities, women and minorities).  
41. The Public Prosecution Office of Montenegro acted on 18 applications filed by 
NGO LGBT &#8220;Forum Progress&#8221; against 23 known persons and 3 unknown persons, and 
against 1 daily newspaper. With regard to cases of violation of the rights of LGBT persons 
from 01 January 2011 to 31 December 2013, regional misdemeanour authorities processed 
66 cases in total relating to misdemeanours involving violation of rights of LGBT persons, 
out of which 44 cases or 67% were completed on 12 February 2014. The completed cases 
were solved by fines in 30 cases, imprisonment in one case, warning in one case, corrective 
measure in one case, statute of limitations with 7 verdicts of acquittal. The Misdemeanour 
Committee of Montenegro had no cases in which filing of charges was rejected. 
</p>
<p><b>  B 7 &#8211; Restrictions of public demonstrations  
</b></p>
<p>42. The fact that a number of political public assemblies &#8211; peaceful protests, and the 
Pride Parade in the center of town, were organized in the past years demonstrates that the 
Government of Montenegro allows for exercising of the freedom of public assembly, and 
the allegations that the Special Rapporteur obtained from the sources that provide no 
arguments for their claims are incorrect that the provision of the Law relating to the need to

</p>
<p>notify the Police Directorate of organization of public assemblies is misused by being 
interpreted as a request for approval.  
</p>
<p>43. In relation to passing acts to prohibit certain public assemblies (public 
demonstrations), the actions taken were legal and professional, fully taking into account 
and considering every request &#8211; application individually. In addition to considering 
compliance with the prescribed legal provisions which define the content of an application 
for a public assembly, a competent organizational unit invites and interviews (often on 
several occasions) the applicant for the purpose of complete and objective actions. Reasons 
for prohibiting a public assembly relate in most cases to safety of persons (organizers and 
persons who intend to participate in the public assembly), safety of traffic, movement and 
work of other citizens.  
</p>
<p>44. Prior to passing an act prohibiting a certain public assembly, the police have almost 
all the relevant information relating to the public assembly and prepares security 
assessment on the basis of such information. If the organizer intends, in addition to an 
assembly in a specific place at a specific time, to endanger lives and health of participants 
of the public assembly, of other citizens or traffic safety, by certain type of movements 
<i>(walking along vital town roads, motorway, regional and local roads, etc.)</i>, if it is not 
possible to reach any kind of a &#8220;compromise&#8221; with the organizer in terms of alternation of 
the route, identifying another location for the assembly, etc., the competent organizational 
unit of the police prohibits such public assembly. Efforts are made in every specific case to 
comply with all applications for organizing public assemblies, even when minimum 
requirements for such assemblies are met. In 2010, the police secured public assemblies in 
2.283 cases and rendered 78 decisions prohibiting peaceful assemblies. In 2012, the police 
secured public assemblies in 1.809 cases and rendered 56 decisions prohibiting peaceful 
assemblies. In 2013, the police secured public assemblies in 1.643 cases and rendered 47 
decisions prohibiting peaceful assemblies. In January, February and March 2014, the police 
secured public assemblies in 395 cases and rendered 15 decisions prohibiting peaceful 
assemblies9.  </p>

<p><b>  Annex I 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Journalists 
</b>45. <b><i>Paragraph 24 &#8211;</i></b>  In the period from 2008 to February 2014 there were 34 registered 
cases, not 30 as teh Rapporteur stated in the report, where physical force or serious threats 
were used against representatives or property of the media, and out of that number 26 cases 
are finalized, in the way that 20 of them were processed, while in 6 cases of reported 
assaults the prosecutor assessed that &#8220;there are no elements of a criminal offense&#8221;. In the 
given period, there were 13 criminal and 10 misdemeanor reports filed, involving 36 
persons. Analyzing the structure of perpetrators, it is not possible to conclude that motives 
behind the attacks were of a political nature, because in most cases the processed persons 
were not employees of the state authorities or persons belonging to political parties. 
Besides, the analysis of the recorded events shows that in a number of cases there were 
personal reasons involved or on the spot conflicts. In agreement with the responsible 
prosecutors, in late 2013 working teams were established, with the aim to solve cases of 
damage cause to the independent daily &#8220;Vijesti&#8221;, attack on the journalist of the &#8220;Dan&#8221; daily, 
Lidija Nikcevic, and attack on the journalist from Berane, Tufik Softic. As a result of this 
activity, the cases of activation of an explosive in the building of the independent daily 
&#8220;Vijesti&#8221; in Podgorica were solved - on 8 March 2014, the case of a criminal offense of 
causing general danger, together with the criminal offense of unauthorized carrying of 
weapons and explosives, perpetrated on 26 December 2013 against the editorial of the 
independent daily Vijesti in Podgorica was solved and two persons were processed. The 
case involving one journalist, Ms. Milka Tadic Mijovic was solved.<b> </b>She reported that she 
received serious threats via SMS service on her mobile phone from an unknown person. In 
this respect, the person who sent these threatening messages to the journalist was identified, 
and the case was referred to the responsible prosecutor for further action. 
</p>
<p>46. <b><i>Paragraph 26 &#8211;</i></b>  The first-instance judgement of the Higher Court in Podgorica was 
reversed by the judgement of the Appellate Court of Montenegro and the accused D.M. was 
convicted to a cumulative sentence of 19 years of imprisonment, and the judgement of the 
Higher Court in Podgorica K.no.109/08 of 27.04.2009 became final and enforceable on 
4.12.2009.10 The Supreme State Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has opened a case for the purpose of 
discovering accomplices in the murder of Du&#353;ko Jovanovi&#263;. A number of witnesses are 
being interrogated. Regarding facts, D. M. is charged with being an accomplice of &#8220;for now 
unidentified persons&#8221; and with killing with intent Du&#353;ko Jovanovi&#263;, and an attempt to 
murder M. M. The description of facts presented in the judgement does not include 
descriptions of individual actions of D.M., such actions are not separated in relation to 
actions of other unidentified perpetrators respectively, and the number of unidentified 
perpetrators is not specified, but all acts committed by D.M. and unidentified accomplices 
are described as jointly committed acts. It follows from the above that the statement of the 
Rapporteur that &#8220;One person was convicted for being an accomplice&#8221; is incorrect because 
D.M. was convicted as one of perpetrators, and not as an accomplice, whereas other 
perpetrators have not been identified and processed by the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p>47. <b><i>Paragraph 30 -</i></b>  In the case of assault against Zeljko Ivanovic, following the 
measures and actions taken, the perpetrators have been identified and they confessed the 
offense. The Basic Court in Podgorica sentenced the accused P.R. and B.M. to one year in

<p>prison each; this was a final decision of the court and both of them have served the 
sentence. 
</p>
<p>48. The case of assault against Mihailo Jovovic, Editor in Chief of the &#8220;Vijesti&#8221; Daily, 
from 2009 was processed by filing criminal charges against M.M. for the criminal offense 
of inflicting serious physical injuries, and the misdemeanor charges against the Mayor, 
M.M. The accused M.M. was found guilty and was conditionally sentenced (6 months in 
prison, conditional sentence of 2 years), and the mayor, M.M. was found guilty for a 
misdemeanor offense and fined with EUR 400. 
</p>
<p>49. <b><i>Paragraph 31 -</i></b>  There were three registered cases of threats and assaults on the 
journalist Olivera Lakic. All three cases were processed, by filing the report in 2011 against 
M.S., for the criminal offense of endangering security; against G.M. in 2011, for the same 
criminal offense (later on, the prosecutor pressed charges for the criminal offense of false 
registration); and in 2012, against B.I. for the criminal offense of violent behavior. B.I. was 
sentenced to 9 months in prison. </p>
