</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fifteenth session from 
21 January to 1 February 2013. The review of France was held at the 1st meeting on 21 
January 2013. The delegation of France was headed by Mr. Fran&#231;ois Zimeray, Ambassador 
for Human Rights. At its 10th meeting, held on 25 January 2013, the Working Group 
adopted the report on France. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of France: Congo, Italy and Kuwait. 
</p><p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
France: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/15/FRA/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/FRA/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/FRA/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, 
Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 
transmitted to France through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of 
the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The French delegation recalled the role that human rights had played in building the 
country and how firmly they were rooted in the country&#8217;s institutions. There was always 
room for progress, and outside scrutiny and criticism were essential to help France be more 
demanding of itself. 
</p>
<p>6. The Universal Periodic Review was a vital tool that had lasting effects. A midterm 
report had been published in 2010. The national report for the second review was the result 
of consultations with all stakeholders, including civil society. 
</p>
<p>7. The rights of a person living in France had grown stronger since 2008. Until very 
recently, the constitutionality of a law could be examined only before it came into force, 
except in certain very specific conditions. Since the major reform of the Constitution, 
anyone who brought a case before a court in France could claim that a law already in force 
infringed on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>8. If a person living in France considered that his or her rights had been infringed by 
the work of a public administration, there was now a single institution to which he or she 
could apply, for free: the Defender of Rights, established in March 2011, which brought 
together tasks that had previously been assigned to other independent administrative bodies. </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.13-12484 
</p>
<p>9. Someone living in France now had more opportunities to denounce any 
discrimination of which he or she was victim, particularly in employment. Each 
Government procurator&#8217;s office in the French court system included an anti-discrimination 
focal point, whose jurisdiction covered all acts committed on the basis of the victim&#8217;s 
ethnic group, nation, race, religion or sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>10. A person living in France was now better protected in his or her relations with the 
law enforcement agencies. The French authorities paid particular attention to the conditions 
in which individuals were arrested, detained or subjected to any other measure of 
deprivation of liberty. Three main principles governed this: absolute respect for persons, 
regardless of their nationality or origin; use of proportionate force only as strictly 
necessary; and protection and respect for the dignity of persons detained. 
</p>
<p>11. The Government that had come to power after the spring 2012 elections was 
determined to ensure that its actions helped to establish greater protection for fundamental 
freedoms. A Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights had been set up to promote all measures intended 
to enforce and promote women&#8217;s rights in society. It was also responsible for coordinating 
the Government&#8217;s work against violence and discrimination related to sexual orientation 
and gender identity. 
</p>
<p>12. France had adopted a National Plan of Action against Racism and Anti-Semitism 
(2012&#8211;2014) (see below). It had also developed the French Government Strategy for the 
Inclusion of Roma (see below). 
</p><p>13. The Minister of Justice had announced a series of measures designed to continue the 
improvements being made to the country&#8217;s prison policy (see below). 
14. The Government that had come to power after the spring 2012 elections was also 
committed to adopting a new immigration policy, in order both to assume its 
responsibilities and to ensure humane treatment. A bill was being drafted to introduce a 
multi-year residence permit for foreigners and thus help them integrate better into life in 
France. Serious consideration was also being given to the law on naturalization. 
</p>
<p>15. The entry into and stay of foreigners in the country was monitored, and certain 
rights, such as the right to work and access to certain social benefits, were granted only to 
those foreigners in a regular situation. However, whatever their status, all foreigners in 
France could have access to emergency accommodation and benefit from State medical 
assistance, which gave them access to health care. 
</p>
<p>16. All the progress that had been made in the area of human rights since 2008 was also 
valid in the overseas territories, on the basis of the principle of equality between French 
citizens. However, each territory had its own geographical, historical and social 
circumstances. It was not always possible to address problems in the same way as in 
mainland France, and the State was trying to come up with appropriate responses, such as, 
at a time of economic crisis, the economic and social conferences that were being held in 
each of the different territories. 
</p>
<p>17. Finally, France was a &#8220;social Republic&#8221; and thus strongly believed in the 
interdependence of economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>18. During the interactive dialogue, 84 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>19. Italy commended France on its National Plan of Action against Racism and Anti-
Semitism and asked about resources allocated for its implementation. It enquired about the </p>


<p>GE.13-12484 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>measures taken to address concerns about the rights of detainees and their access to medical 
assistance and for further combating child prostitution and pornography. Italy made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>20. Japan welcomed the fact that half of the Cabinet posts were filled by women and 
hoped that the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights would contribute to ensuring respect for 
women&#8217;s rights. Japan expressed its appreciation for the stated intention to halt evictions of 
Roma, and for efforts to eradicate ethnic discrimination. Japan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>21. Jordan noted the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities (CRPD) and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance (CPED). It welcomed the strengthening of the institutional 
framework through the establishment of the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights and the Defender 
of Rights, and hoped that France would support those bodies to discharge their mandates 
effectively. Jordan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>22. Kuwait noted the significant role that France played through its commitments and 
contributions to set up the rules of the international system to protect and promote human 
rights. It commended the establishment of the Defender of Rights and efforts to eliminate 
discrimination against foreigners and persons of different beliefs. Kuwait made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>23. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic praised progress in implementing the 
previous UPR recommendations. It noted that France had taken important initiatives aimed 
at guaranteeing human rights. It encouraged France to strengthen cooperation with the 
United Nations, other international organizations and stakeholders to overcome challenges 
for ensuring the realization of the rights of its citizens. 
</p>
<p>24. Libya commended the legislative and institutional measures to protect women&#8217;s 
rights and to combat racism, including, inter alia, awareness-raising and training in 
academic institutions. Libya also commended the measures taken to enhance the diversity 
of cultures and languages, and policies to integrate migrant women into employment. Libya 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Malaysia, while noting measures taken to enforce anti-discrimination legislation, 
was concerned at the xenophobic approach utilized in election campaigns; the 
implementation of Act No. 2004/228, effectively prohibiting students wearing religious 
symbols from attending public school; and the reported rise of racist acts directed against 
persons of North-West African origin and Muslims. Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Mauritania noted the efforts of the Government to implement UPR 
recommendations. It also acknowledged the establishment of the ombudsman, with a 
constitutional status. It encouraged France to continue to fight against xenophobic public 
statements made by political or media personalities. Mauritania called on France to 
continue to improve the situation of the immigrant population. 
</p>
<p>27. Mexico acknowledged that the promotion of human rights and democracy were 
central to French foreign policy. It noted the establishment of the ombudsman and praised 
the measures taken to implement previous UPR recommendations, including the lifting of 
the declaration on article 124 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Peru noted that since its first examination under the UPR, France had established the 
Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights and an ombudsman, and had adopted a national plan against 
racism. It requested information on measures taken to reduce prison overcrowding and 
improve prison conditions. Peru made recommendations. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.13-12484 
</p>
<p>29. Namibia commended the ratification by France of international human rights 
instruments, its strengthening of anti-racism policies and its condemnation of the slave 
trade and slavery as crimes against humanity. However, it was concerned at the situation of 
ethnic minorities, including Roma. Namibia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Nepal commended such measures as the introduction of the Defender of Rights into 
the Constitution, the adoption of a national plan of action on protecting women from 
violence and the establishment of the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights, as well as the 
promotion of diversity in the civil service. Nepal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. The Netherlands regarded France as an example for the international community and 
asked what effective measures had been taken to implement the recommendation on 
improving conditions in the prison system made during the first examination of France 
under the UPR. The Netherlands made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. New Zealand commended the establishment of a Minister of Women&#8217;s Rights, and 
asked about concrete steps to coordinate action in combating violence and discrimination 
against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons. It expressed concern about the 
impact of the law banning facial coverings in public spaces. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Norway noted an apparent increase in discrimination and violence against French 
Muslims and French citizens of North African descent and the lack of adequate statistics on 
those groups. It was concerned by the use of tasers and the practice of body searches in 
prisons. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Oman commended the commitment of the Government of France to promoting and 
protecting human rights. It noted that France had taken a number of measures to give effect 
to its international obligations, locally and internationally, and to participate in international 
efforts to promote and protect human rights. Oman made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Pakistan expressed concern at the inadequate legal protection against ethnic 
profiling by the police and the influence of race and religion on employment opportunities. 
Increased public hate speech was compounded by legislation on the hijab or niqab, which 
discriminated against Muslim women. Pakistan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. The State of Palestine welcomed the efforts made to protect and promote women&#8217;s 
rights and rights concerning education and immigration. It noted the signing of the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-
ICESCR) and commended the national plan of action implementing Security Council 
resolution 1325 (2000). It made a recommendation. 
</p><p>37. Paraguay noted the signing of OP-ICESCR and the ratification of CPED, CRPD and 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT). It recognized, inter alia, the establishment 
of the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights and the national plan against racism and anti-Semitism. 
Paraguay considered that the new immigration policy was grounded on clear, fair and stable 
rules. Paraguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Morocco recalled the historical engagement of France with the promotion and 
protection of human rights. Morocco acknowledged the new immigration measures and 
stressed the delicate situation of unaccompanied migrant children. It requested information 
on the measures taken to combat racist discourse and hate speech. Morocco made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>39. The Philippines noted the great importance France attached to human rights, as 
indicated by its ratification of OP-CAT, CRPD and CPED. It welcomed the deep concern 
of France for the protection of migrant workers. The Philippines made recommendations. </p>


<p>GE.13-12484 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>40. Germany, concerned by various acts of discrimination against Roma, asked how 
France ensured that it met its obligations under international law, given the treatment of 
Roma by police. Noting the overcrowding and poor conditions in prisons, it asked what 
measures were being envisaged to improve the situation. 
</p>
<p>41. The leader of the French delegation said that France could not be satisfied with the 
state of its prisons. Criticism of detention conditions was heard from abroad as well as at 
home. Monitoring of places of detention (by the judiciary, parliamentarians and the 
administration&#8217;s internal monitoring mechanisms) had been stepped up. 
</p><p>42. Since 2007, France had established a number of additional monitoring mechanisms 
to ensure better protection of the rights of detainees; they included the Inspector-General of 
Prisons as well as the 150 deputies of the Defender of Rights who carried out prison visits. 
</p>
<p>43. France&#8217;s objective was to update and modernize its prisons by closing down 
outdated facilities and building new ones to increase capacity. Some of the places in them 
would be set aside for the social rehabilitation of prisoners. Furthermore, the Prisons Act of 
24 November 2009 established the principle of making all prison terms more flexible, with 
imprisonment becoming the exception. The use of alternative measures to detention needed 
to be further encouraged. 
</p>
<p>44. Prison staff now received more training in preventing suicide in prison. The Prisons 
Act set strict rules for the use of force by prison staff, limiting it to legitimate defence in the 
case of violent resistance and making it conditional on proportionality and strict necessity 
in preventing escapes or restoring order. 
</p>
<p>45. In application of the principles of the indivisibility of the Republic, equality before 
the law and the unity of the French people, France did not recognize the existence of groups 
or communities with specific rights. France thus did not recognize the Roma as a group and 
did not collect statistics related to ethnic origin. However, neither did it underestimate the 
problems it was facing, and it set its action against the background of what was happening 
at European level, as the whole of the continent was concerned. A national strategy for the 
inclusion of Roma had been adopted in February 2012, with priority on access to education, 
employment, health and housing. 
</p>
<p>46. Illegal camps were dismantled in response to an immediate danger or health risk, in 
particular. However, it was the task of the local Government services, in partnership with 
local authorities and associations, to ensure that they responded properly to the situation of 
the individuals and families concerned. As soon as a camp was set up, prefects should 
conduct a diagnostic survey of needs in respect of health care, employment and schooling 
for children. Before beginning to dismantle any illegal installations, they must, first and 
foremost, provide emergency accommodation. An interministerial delegate for 
accommodation and access to housing was responsible for coordination at all levels, from 
local to national, to allow a proper response to all types of situation. 
</p>
<p>47. Secularism was a principle of freedom in France, and had three aspects: the 
neutrality of public officials, consideration of religious practice and equal attention from the 
authorities to the different religions. Under French law, it was thus possible to grant leave 
of absence for religious festivals, to perform ritual slaughter, to set aside specific places in 
cemeteries for the non-Christian religions and to grant indirect assistance for the 
construction and maintenance of places of worship. 
</p>
<p>48. Implementation of the Act on wearing symbols or attire that ostensibly demonstrate 
religious affiliation in public primary and secondary schools had been unproblematic. The 
vast majority of cases had been resolved through dialogue. The Ministry of Education 
Ombudsman had not received any complaints and there were no cases pending before the 
courts. The European Court of Human Rights had confirmed that the restrictions prescribed </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.13-12484 
</p>
<p>under the Act were justified by the constitutional principle of secularism and complied with 
the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 
</p>
<p>49. Qatar commended France for its ratification of human rights treaties and protocols, 
and expressed its hope that the establishment of the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights and the 
Defender of Rights would further the protection, promotion, awareness and implementation 
of human rights. The steps taken to combat stereotypes and prevent discrimination against 
minority groups were noted. Qatar made a recommendation. 
</p><p>50. The Republic of Korea commended concrete actions to ensure gender equality, 
including the creation of the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights and the adoption of the National 
Plan of Action against Racism and Anti-Semitism. It also noted an increase in racist and 
xenophobic political speeches since 2008. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. The Republic of Moldova welcomed the creation of the ombudsman. It 
congratulated France on the adoption of measures to promote gender equality, the progress 
made in combating violence against women and the commitment of France to the 
protection of children. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Romania welcomed the setting up of a new body responsible for combating 
discrimination and asked what powers the new body would enjoy with regard to the 
sanctions for discrimination, beyond the referral of matters to the Office of the Public 
Prosecutor (minist&#232;re public). Romania made a recommendation. 
</p><p>53. The Russian Federation took note of the progress made in recent years regarding the 
fulfilment by France of its international human rights obligations. It observed, however, 
that a range of problems persisted in the field of legal protection. The Russian Federation 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Senegal remarked on the significant progress made in promoting and protecting 
women&#8217;s rights, both in legislation and through the establishment of institutions, such as 
the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights. Further efforts were required to meet existing challenges 
regarding immigration and discrimination. Senegal made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55. Slovakia welcomed the ratification of CRPD, CPED and OP-CAT. It noted in 
particular the Roma inclusion strategy, the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights and the amendment 
granting the right to apply to the Constitutional Council for a ruling on the constitutionality 
of a law. Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Slovenia noted positive developments in gender equality. Slovenia expressed 
concern on the high number of severely endangered languages while welcoming the stated 
intention of France to ratify the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. It 
asked whether steps had been taken to that effect and about the time frame for such 
ratification. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Spain welcomed the establishment of a ministry that focused specifically on 
women&#8217;s rights. It asked what measures were being developed to further promote gender 
equality and to combat gender-based violence. It expressed concern at reports of poor 
conditions in detention centres. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Sri Lanka welcomed the establishment of the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights, the 
launch of a related interministerial plan of action and the introduction of measures to 
combat unequal remuneration. It noted the national plan of action to combat racism in the 
period 2012&#8211;2014. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. The Sudan expressed concerns raised by the treaty bodies, including the Human 
Rights Committee, about Act No. 2004/228 prohibiting the wearing of overt religious 
symbols in public schools, which prevented some children who followed those religious 
customs from attending school. The Sudan made recommendations. </p>


<p>GE.13-12484 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>60. Switzerland shared the concerns of the European Committee for the Prevention of 
Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment regarding allegations of the 
excessive use of force by police during arrests. Regarding the issue of trafficking in 
persons, it emphasized the importance of clear, comprehensive and enforceable legal 
standards. Switzerland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Thailand noted the commitment of France to fighting discrimination and 
xenophobia, and welcomed plans to address racism, anti-Semitism and the exclusion of 
Roma. It remained concerned by reports of discrimination in accessing public services on 
the grounds of race, ethnic origin or religion. Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Timor-Leste recognized the ratification of several human rights treaties and 
commended the measures and plans to combat racism and xenophobia and enhance gender 
equality, and looked forward to their implementation. Timor-Leste made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>63. Togo expressed concern over discriminatory political discourse and encouraged 
France to take action against the increasing number of racially motivated incidents against 
persons of the Maghreb and Black African origin. Conditions of detention and high rates of 
prison suicide were serious concerns. Togo made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>64. Trinidad and Tobago noted France&#8217;s historic association with human rights, its 
contribution to the work of OHCHR and its ratification of key human rights instruments. 
Trinidad and Tobago made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Tunisia noted the ratification of international instruments concerning persons with 
disabilities, torture and enforced disappearance, as well as the establishment of structures, 
including the Defender of Rights, and the national plan of action to combat racism. It 
commended the commitment of France to official development assistance. Tunisia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Turkey welcomed the establishment of the Defender of Rights and the introduction 
of the &#8220;<i>question prioritaire de constitutionnalit&#233;</i>&#8221; (priority preliminary ruling on the issue 
of constitutionality). It noted that a policy contradicting the right to free expression had 
been invalidated by the Constitutional Council on 28 February 2012, and encouraged 
France to combat racist and Islamophobic attacks. Turkey made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Ukraine recognized the strong commitment of France to the protection and 
promotion of human rights, and welcomed efforts to ensure a more coherent approach to 
fighting discrimination on the grounds of origin. Ukraine made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland asked about measures to 
improve gender equality, in particular to improve recourse to justice for victims of sex 
crimes and to address the low level of domestic violence reporting. It asked about measures 
to improve anti-discrimination legislation. The United Kingdom made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. The United States of America remained concerned about the prohibition on wearing 
religious symbols in schools and wearing garments covering the face in public. It was 
concerned by overcrowding and poor hygiene in prisons, and evictions of and social 
intolerance towards Roma. The United States made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. Uruguay commended the ratification of CPED, CRPD, the Optional Protocol to 
CRPD (OP-CRPD) and OP-CAT. It welcomed the establishment of the Ministry of 
Women&#8217;s Rights, the adaptation of legislation in accordance with the Rome Statute and the 
introduction of a national plan to combat racism and anti-Semitism. Uruguay made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71. On the subject of combating racism and anti-Semitism, the head of the French 
delegation stressed that the authorities had shown increased vigilance and had made </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.13-12484 
</p>
<p>significantly more resources available for law enforcement. The rise in the number of racist 
acts was due in part to better statistical awareness of the phenomenon and an increase in the 
number of convictions for offences linked to racism. Over the past few years, however, 
there had been a growing trend in the number of racially motivated acts, and that was also 
reflected in public speeches and on the Internet. 
</p>
<p>72. France had built up a comprehensive legal framework to combat racism and anti-
Semitism. A National Action Plan against Racism and Anti-Semitism (2012&#8211;2014) had also 
been adopted. The aim of the Plan, which was coordinated by an interministerial delegate, 
was to better identify acts of a racist or anti-Semitic nature, to suppress such behaviour 
systematically, to combat discrimination, and to make combating racism and anti-Semitism 
part of the integration and equal opportunities policy. 
</p>
<p>73. Furthermore, France had introduced a Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights in 2012 and a 
High Council for Equality in 2013. In addition to the fact that there were equal numbers of 
men and women in the Government, the ministers had also each appointed a senior official 
responsible for promoting equality between men and women within the ministry concerned. 
</p>
<p>74. France had introduced several measures to ensure gender equality in the workplace 
and in leading public and private bodies (an Act on balanced representation of men and 
women on boards of directors and supervisory boards and a second Act relating to access to 
employment and combating discrimination in the civil service). 
</p><p>75. Uzbekistan noted that there were concerns about absorbing various ombudsman 
functions into the institution of the Defender of Rights. Concerns were also raised about 
discriminatory political speech and increased racism preventing the integration of 
immigrants; the treatment of Roma; and police brutality. Uzbekistan made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76. Viet Nam noted the accession by France to a number of international treaties, and 
the establishment of the Defender of Rights and the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights. It 
encouraged France to launch a comprehensive plan to combat discrimination against all 
vulnerable groups who were experiencing economic difficulties. 
</p>
<p>77. Algeria noted discrimination against minorities, attacks on religious freedom, 
violence against women and the erosion of the right to family life. It also noted that 
immigrants did not enjoy, among others, the right to employment, and suggested addressing 
discriminatory rhetoric from the police. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>78. Angola noted the ratification by France of various international conventions and the 
establishment of the Defender of Rights and the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights. It 
commented on the introduction of plans to address racism and anti-Semitism and issues 
relating to women, peace and security, and gender equality. Angola made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>79. Argentina welcomed the participation of France in the campaign for universal 
ratification of CPED. It commended the establishment of the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights 
and plans to combat racism and integrate Roma. Despite the explanation of France, 
Argentina viewed the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW) as providing additional 
protection. Argentina made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>80. Armenia welcomed the recognition of regional languages and plans to tackle racism 
and anti-Semitism and discrimination in schools. It noted the efforts made to eliminate

<p>81. Finland asked whether France intended to review its position with respect to 
children belonging to minority groups and consider withdrawing its reservation to article 30 
of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). It also asked what measures would be 
taken to address the corporal punishment of children. Finland made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>82. Austria expressed concern about the educational, employment and social rights of 
Roma. It requested information on measures to address detainee treatment and prison 
overcrowding and plans to sign the Optional Protocol to CRC on a communications 
procedure and ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating 
violence against women and domestic violence. Austria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>83. Bahrain, welcoming advances made in the area of women&#8217;s rights and gender 
equality, encouraged the Government to increase female representation in high-level and 
managerial positions and in the private sector. It was concerned by increasing numbers of 
hate crimes against Muslims and Muslim communities. Bahrain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>84. Bangladesh noted the concerns of several treaty bodies regarding persistent 
discriminatory practices, measures and stereotyping. In particular, the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child was concerned about discrimination against children residing in the 
overseas departments and territories, asylum-seeking and refugee children and children 
from minority groups. Bangladesh made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>85. Belarus noted the numerous reservations and declarations of France to international 
conventions restricting the application of their norms in legislation. The authorities did not 
cooperate sufficiently with special procedures for civil and political rights, in terms of 
visits, despite violations. It also noted the increasing practice of discrimination against 
migrants and minorities. Belarus made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>86. Belgium noted that the legal framework relating to human trafficking focused more 
on suppressing the scourge than on ensuring victims&#8217; rights. It asked whether the French 
authorities intended to take steps to develop a more specific legal framework that includes 
victims&#8217; rights. Belgium made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>87. Brazil welcomed the ratification by France of OP-CAT and the national plan to 
combat racism. Events in Mali were worrying. The use of force must lead to less violence 
and instability; the protection of civilians was paramount. Brazil associated itself with the 
High Commissioner&#8217;s statement of September 2012 concerning Roma and made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>88. Bulgaria, while appreciating the active role played by the authorities in promoting 
the condemnation and rejection of xenophobia and anti-Semitism, noted that cases had been 
reported of intolerance towards minorities, especially involving adolescents, and requested 
some examples of the good practices employed by France in countering the trend. 
</p>
<p>89. Burkina Faso welcomed progress towards ratifying international instruments relating 
to human rights and the rights of immigrant women and victims of violence. Efforts to 
protect individual and collective rights and freedoms of detainees held in anti-terrorism 
cases were also noteworthy. Burkina Faso made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>90. Burundi applauded France for the establishment of the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights 
to promote women&#8217;s rights and combat gender discrimination. It strongly encouraged 
government efforts to develop a policy to combat racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism. 
Burundi made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>91. Cambodia commended efforts to protect human rights, particularly the adoption of 
the plan guaranteeing the right to social security, and the measures favouring women&#8217;s 
rights and combating discrimination. It welcomed the ratification of CAT. Cambodia made 
recommendations. </p>

</p>
<p>92. Canada requested an update on measures taken to prevent and end racism 
perpetrated by law enforcement officers and other public officials. It was concerned about 
reports of increasing anti-Semitic and Islamophobic acts. Discrimination in employment 
against Muslims, especially veiled women, was worrying. Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>93. Chad commended France on its efforts to implement the recommendations made 
following the consideration of its report submitted under the UPR in 2008 and to put in 
place a number of structures with a view to ensuring human rights. Chad made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>94. Chile welcomed progress made by France at the regulatory and structural level in the 
protection of human rights. It commended in particular the establishment of the Ministry of 
Women&#8217;s Rights and the ratification of the CPED. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>95. China praised the efforts made by France to protect human rights, especially the 
rights of women, children and persons with disabilities. It expressed concern, however, at 
the prominence of racism, xenophobia and discrimination against minorities, particularly 
Muslim women. China made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>96. The Congo welcomed the creation of the post of Defender of Rights and the 
Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights, as well as efforts to combat discrimination and racism and 
address minority issues, although further measures were encouraged. It urged France to 
take steps to reduce prison overcrowding and improve detention conditions. 
</p>
<p>97. The head of the French delegation said that much criticism focused on identity 
checks and the negative feelings they aroused in the population, despite the fact that they 
were indispensable. The checks could not be based on any physical characteristic or 
distinctive sign unless initiated on the basis of a specific description. The practice of racial 
profiling would be counter to the republican principles of equality. Checks had to be based 
exclusively on objective criteria without any element of discrimination. Steps had been 
taken to improve the relationship between the public and the police in the context of 
identity checks, specifically by ensuring that officers involved in a check were identifiable, 
with a clearly visible badge number, and with the development of a new code of ethics. 
</p>
<p>98. Meanwhile, the 8,000 unaccompanied foreign juveniles and young adults were a 
particularly vulnerable group and must be protected. The juveniles were exempt from the 
requirement to produce a residence permit, could not be subjected to forced expulsion to 
their country of origin and had access to all general services and infrastructure, notably the 
education system. They could be held in a waiting zone at the border only for the time that 
was strictly necessary to review their situation, and they enjoyed all legal safeguards. If it 
was found that they would be exposed to risk if they were returned to their country of 
origin, they were allowed to enter the country and were placed in the care of a specialized 
child protection centre. An interministerial working group on unaccompanied foreign 
juveniles had been set up to look at the situation in France and draw up appropriate 
protective measures. 
</p>
<p>99. Immigration was still a good thing for France. To be beneficial to the migrants 
themselves, it needed to be regulated and organized. The Government was committed to 
introducing a new and responsible immigration policy, based on clear, fair and stable rules. 
It combined firmness in the fight against illegal immigration and clandestine immigration 
networks with a more secure situation for legal immigrants. Transparency and objectivity 
were keystones in the Government&#8217;s action. Fair procedures would be introduced, dialogue 
with human rights associations and institutions encouraged and coordination with local 
authorities strengthened. The Government had put particular effort into making residence 
permits more easily available to highly qualified students who wanted to stay in France, by 
repealing the circular of 31 May 2011 on foreign students. </p>

<p>100. Costa Rica commended France on adopting a national plan of action to combat 
racism and anti-Semitism (2012&#8211;2014) and on legislation enacted to address domestic 
violence, including criminalizing marital violence, and to combat the commercial 
exploitation of children. Costa Rica made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>101. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire welcomed the establishment of the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights and 
the commitment of France to preventing human rights violations worldwide. It encouraged 
France to intensify efforts to improve the situation of migrant workers and members of their 
families and to implement anti-discrimination legislation. 
</p>
<p>102. Cuba noted steps taken by France to protect human rights and prevent 
discrimination, but encouraged it to do more to eliminate discrimination against the Roma. 
It asked how the rights of Roma children and other minorities would be guaranteed, 
especially those living in illegal camps. Cuba made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>103. Cyprus welcomed the commitment of France to the worldwide dissemination of the 
right not to be subjected to enforced disappearance and to women&#8217;s rights. It asked how the 
Government dealt with cases of violence against women involving women who refused, or 
were unable, to cooperate with the authorities. 
</p>
<p>104. Djibouti thanked France for the submission of its second report and noted its efforts 
in a number of areas in the protection and promotion of human rights nationwide and the 
importance it accorded to the UPR process. Djibouti made recommendations. 
</p><p>105. Ecuador commended France on signing ICESCR. It was concerned, however, about 
the situation of the Roma, especially given the Government&#8217;s policy on forced evictions 
and expulsions. Poverty and belonging to a racial minority were no justification for 
discrimination, intolerance, xenophobia and racism. Ecuador made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>106. Egypt welcomed efforts to combat discrimination and hate crimes, but was 
concerned about the banning of religious symbols in public schools and an act prohibiting 
the wearing of the niqab in public places, which had serious ramifications on Muslim 
women&#8217;s rights. Egypt made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>107. Estonia recognized the importance of human rights in domestic and foreign policies 
and efforts to ensure gender equality and women&#8217;s rights, especially the establishment of 
the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights and the global promotion of sexual and reproductive 
health rights. It welcomed the participation by France in the Freedom Online Coalition. 
</p>
<p>108. Australia welcomed ongoing programmes to modernize and build prisons, but was 
concerned about aspects of prison management, including overcrowding and the high 
suicide rate. It noted reports about the rights of people of Roma origin concerning 
immigration camps and compulsory repatriation. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>109. Poland appreciated the continued engagement of France in the field of human rights 
and its continuous support to the OHCHR. Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>110. Greece requested more information on the Defender of Rights institution and how it 
would strengthen the human rights protection system in relation to previous mechanisms. It 
also requested more details on the broad outlines of the policy to promote gender equality. 
Greece made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>111. Guatemala asked whether France could provide statistics on the impact of measures 
adopted to prevent and suppress racist acts by law enforcement officers and whether there 
had been a decrease in the number of cases as a result of those measures. Guatemala made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>112. Hungary welcomed the adoption of the Roma inclusion strategy, but remained 
concerned about the ongoing evictions and expulsion of Roma. It hoped that France would </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.13-12484 
</p>
<p>ensure that its practices and policies in that regard would conform to international law. 
Hungary made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>113. India drew the attention of France to the Views adopted by the Human Rights 
Committee at its 106th session in November 2012 on the expulsion of an Indian student 
from a public school for wearing a <i>keski</i>, and urged France to provide an effective and 
enforceable remedy. India made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>114. Indonesia welcomed the 2008 constitutional reform, the creation of the Roma 
inclusion strategy and the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights. It encouraged France to formulate a 
comprehensive action plan to ensure the mainstreaming of gender awareness and eliminate 
gender discrimination. Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>115. Iraq commended the determination of France to protect and promote human rights 
and improve the situation with respect to fundamental freedoms. It particularly welcomed 
efforts to promote gender equality and women&#8217;s rights and provide social services. Iraq 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>116. Ireland commended France on the measures adopted to improve women&#8217;s rights. It 
also welcomed the development of a national plan of action to combat racism and anti-
Semitism, but was concerned about ongoing patterns of de facto discrimination against 
minorities. Ireland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>117. The Islamic Republic of Iran drew attention to concerns expressed by the human 
rights treaty bodies and mechanisms over human rights violations by the Government of 
France, particularly in the areas of child prostitution and child pornography, and increasing 
discrimination against Muslims and Roma. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>118. The head of the French delegation pointed out that the right of asylum was a 
fundamental right. The French Government intended to fully respect that right, which stood 
to its credit and was a benchmark for freedom. France had received more than 60,000 
applications in 2012. Those figures illustrated the importance of the right of asylum in the 
country but also explained the problems the country was facing. The forthcoming reform of 
the asylum policy would focus on three areas: increasing capacity, improving waiting times 
for cases to be considered and carrying out a procedural review. The reform would be 
conducted in a spirit of responsibility, with emphasis on humane treatment and respect for 
rights, and in full conformity with European Union law on asylum. 
</p>
<p>119. The head of the French delegation recalled, in conclusion, that the struggle for 
human rights had to focus on all fronts simultaneously and would never be over, and that 
France was aware of the difference between what it wanted and what it managed to 
achieve. Expressing the hope that the discussion during the session had clarified any 
misunderstandings about his country, he emphasized that France welcomed dialogue, 
criticism and even challenges, as a driving force of progress in the field of human rights.
