<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its sixteenth 
session from 22 April to 3 May 2013. The review of Canada was held at the 9th meeting on 
26 April 2013. The delegation of Canada was headed by H.E. Ms. Elissa Golberg, 
Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Canada to the United Nations at Geneva. At 
its 13th meeting held on 30 April 2013, the Working Group adopted the report on Canada. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Canada: Brazil, Ireland and the Philippines. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued 
for the review of Canada: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/16/CAN/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/16/CAN/2 and Corr.1); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/16/CAN/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Estonia, 
Liechtenstein, Mexico, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden and the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Canada through the 
troika. These questions are available on the UPR extranet. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of Canada&#8217;s delegation, Ms. Elissa Golberg, provided a general overview 
of human rights in Canada, and more detail on five significant areas: relationship with 
Aboriginal peoples; violence against women and children; Canada&#8217;s social protection 
framework; immigration and refugee protection; and national security and public safety. 
</p>
<p>6. Human rights are protected by constitutional and legislative measures, and advanced 
through policies and programmes. All levels of government cooperate to ensure protections 
are in place across the country. Where Canadians consider themselves to be subject to a 
rights violation, avenues for redress are well established and openly accessible. 
</p>
<p>7. She outlined some developments since the last universal periodic review, reporting 
that Canada ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 
</p><p>2010. 
</p>
<p>8. Efforts to strengthen the relationship between Aboriginal peoples and other 
Canadians are fundamental to reconciliation and to paving the way for the full participation 
of Aboriginal people in the social, economic and cultural prosperity of Canada. 
</p>
<p>9. Equality between men and women is central to Canada&#8217;s foreign and domestic 
policies. The rights of women and girls are firmly entrenched in Canada&#8217;s Constitution and </p>


<p>Canada is committed to improving their lives, particularly ending all forms of violence 
against women. 
</p>
<p>10. Canada&#8217;s approach includes a combination of responses to prevent and reduce 
violence against women and children; provide health and social assistance to those affected 
by it; and hold the perpetrators accountable. Addressing violence against Aboriginal 
women and girls is an important priority and Canada continues to take concrete steps to 
address this complex issue. 
</p>
<p>11. Canada continues to strengthen its comprehensive social protection framework and 
advance social innovation so that all individuals and communities can reach their full 
potential. Addressing disparity focuses on providing individuals with the opportunity to 
achieve independence and find long-term solutions through appropriate employment, 
income, housing, education and health supports. 
</p>
<p>12. Canada`s generous system provides asylum to persons in need of international 
protection. Persons that obtain the status of refugees can become permanent residents and 
apply for Canadian citizenship. A network of assistance and religious organizations assists 
their integration. 
</p>
<p>13. Canada&#8217;s police, correctional services and institutions responsible for national 
security and public safety are firmly committed to ensuring safety with due respect for 
human rights. Oversight is available to ensure that public security activities are in line with 
national and international obligations, and redress is available for upheld complaints. 
Canada believes that public outreach awareness and the active participation of all its 
citizens on national security issues, are important. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>14. During the interactive dialogue, 82 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>15. Chad noted that the national report followed up on the recommendations accepted 
during the first universal periodic review and that it was concerted at the federal and 
provincial level as well as with civil society and indigenous peoples. Chad made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>16. Chile congratulated the Canadian efforts to eliminate violence against women and 
the ratification of CRPD. Chile asked whether Canada would accept a visit requested by the 
Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>17. China was concerned about prevailing racial discrimination and severe poverty 
among minorities. It noted the poor conditions of indigenous people in health, education 
and employment, violence against indigenous women and children, and the violations to 
land rights. China made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>18. The United States of America praised the National Action Plan to Combat Human 
Trafficking. It remained concerned about the levels of poverty, violence and discrimination 
that Aboriginal women and children face. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>19. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire recognized the efforts undertaken to address recommendations related 
to indigenous peoples, though there was still space for improvement. It noted Canada&#8217;s 
positive role in combating violence against women. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>20. Cuba highlighted the measures taken in the areas of education, gender equality, 
persons with disabilities and the elderly. It noted that indigenous peoples continued to 
suffer disadvantages. It also mentioned the persistence of racism. Cuba made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>21. Spain commended Canada&#8217;s efforts since the last universal periodic review to 
improve the situation of indigenous peoples, including in the area of access to water and 
sanitation, though some needs still required to be covered. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>22. The Czech Republic encouraged Canada to widely publish the outcome of this 
universal periodic review and to regularly consult with civil society on its outcomes. It 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>23. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea expressed concerns regarding 
violations of the rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, torture, racial 
discrimination and xenophobia. It noted the overincarceration of Aborigines, Afro-
Canadians and ethnic minorities. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. Djibouti noted the enhancement of the Canadian legal and institutional human rights 
framework since the first universal periodic review through the domestication of 
international instruments, and the implementation of international commitments through the 
ratification of treaties. Djibouti made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Ecuador thanked the delegation for the presentation of the second national report of 
Canada. Ecuador made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Egypt expressed concern about racial profiling by law-enforcement officials and 
racial discrimination in employment. It urged Canada to recommit to a national anti-racism 
strategy and to participate in events addressing implementation of the Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action. Egypt made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Estonia noted progress in several human rights areas. It encouraged full 
implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
(UNDRIP). Estonia believed that more could be done to eliminate all forms of violence 
against Aboriginal women and children. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Finland asked how Canada was addressing the multiple discrimination faced by 
Aboriginal women and girls in all sectors of society, including education, employment and 
health services. Finland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. Canada indicated that it was now seeking to arrange a visit by the Special 
Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>30. Canada recognized that historic wrongs have strained the relationship with 
Aboriginal peoples. Canada is committed to reconciliation and a renewed relationship. 
Progress is being made in settling land claims and supporting self-government. Canada 
believes that increased participation by Aboriginal people in the labour market can improve 
their socioeconomic conditions, particularly young people. A large number of economic 
development projects are being implemented in or near Aboriginal communities. 
</p>
<p>31. To tackle poverty, Canada has an income assistance programme to help meet the 
basic needs of over 160,000 First Nations recipients, primarily living on reserves. 
Economic development is key to improving the lives and self-sufficiency of Aboriginal 
people and communities. 
</p>
<p>32. Canada noted several legislative measures to better protect the most vulnerable 
Aboriginal people and to ensure that they do not face discrimination, including: the Gender 
Equity in Indian Registration Act; an amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act to 
extend real human rights protection to all members of First Nations communities; and the 
proposed Family Homes on Reserves and Matrimonial Interests or Rights Act, which seeks 
to provide basic rights and protection to individuals on reserves regarding the family home 
and other matrimonial interests or rights. </p>


<p>33. Canada also referred to a proposed bill to ensure access to safe drinking water for 
First Nations, effective treatment of waste water and the protection of sources of water on 
First Nations lands. 
</p>
<p>34. Canada noted that improving outcomes for Aboriginal students is a shared 
responsibility of governments, communities, educators, families and children. The 
Government has worked on a number of tripartite agreements to support First Nations 
education reform. 
</p>
<p>35. Since Canada&#8217;s first universal periodic review, there have been a number of actions 
to protect communities and ensure the safety of women and girls. These include: the 
strengthening of criminal law responses and penalties for violent crimes; providing police, 
prosecutors and the courts with enhanced measures to more effectively manage the threat 
posed by individuals who are at very high risk of reoffending; legislative measures to raise 
the age of sexual consent from 14 to 16 years to protect all young people, and particularly 
girls, from sexual exploitation by adult predators. A further measure is acting to prevent 
and address trafficking in persons and related forms of exploitation. 
</p>
<p>36. Deeply concerned about the number of missing and murdered Aboriginal women 
and girls, Canada is taking concrete actions to achieve real and lasting change. Among 
other actions, in 2010 the Government announced measures and funding for a seven-point 
strategy, aimed at improving the response of the law enforcement and justice systems. 
</p>
<p>37. France recognized the international commitment of Canada in the area of human 
rights. France asked whether Canada contemplated undertaking measures in favour of its 
citizens condemned to death, regardless of where they had been convicted. France made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Gabon encouraged Canada to continue reinforcing relations with Aboriginal peoples 
and to pursue initiatives to fight racial discrimination. Gabon made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>39. Germany appreciated ratification of CRPD and the endorsement of UNDRIP and 
encouraged its implementation. Germany was concerned about reports of violence against 
indigenous women and encouraged the State party to strengthen its efforts. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Guatemala saluted the 2012 action plan against trafficking in persons, including the 
establishment of the first integrated team of agents against trafficking. It also noted the 
police&#8217;s bias-free policy that bans racial profiling. Guatemala made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>41. The Holy See congratulated Canada for its human rights trajectory. It welcomed the 
2009 change in the immigration system to favour the integration of immigrants and 
facilitate their participation in economic and social life. The Holy See made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Honduras noted efforts to improve the conditions of indigenous peoples. The official 
apology for the suffering caused by the transfer of Inuit families in the 1950s was an 
example. However, there were still issues to be resolved. Honduras made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Hungary commended the ratification of CRPD. It referred to criticism by civil 
society of the implementation of the 2002 Anti-terrorism Act and Public Safety Act and the 
impending implementation of the Balanced Refugee Reform Act and asked about this 
legislation. Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Iceland asked about Canada&#8217;s plans to develop a strategy to end violence against 
Aboriginal women and girls. It commended measures to strengthen legislation and 
programmes regarding prohibition of commercial sexual exploitation of children including 
law reform initiatives. Iceland made recommendations. </p>


<p>45. India referred to the Committee on the Rights of the Child&#8217;s concerns on disparities 
in access to services by all children and the lack of prevention of child sexual exploitation. 
It noted concerns about violence affecting indigenous women. It asked if, in relation to the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination&#8217;s concerns about Bill-C4, the 
provisions of mandatory detention have been repealed or modified. India made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Indonesia appreciated the various measures to strengthen the relationship with the 
Aboriginal people. It however, indicated that it shared the concern about the high rates of 
incarceration of and violence to Aboriginal people, in particular women and girls, as well as 
the alleged inadequate response of the authorities. Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. The Islamic Republic of Iran referred to child sexual exploitation and trafficking, the 
right to food, discriminatory laws against indigenous peoples and minority groups, 
including Muslim Arab and African communities. It expressed concern at the refusal of 
Canada to criminalize and punish acts of racist violence. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Ireland urged the implementation of Canada&#8217;s 2012 National Action Plan to Combat 
Human Trafficking and to pay attention to all human rights issues of Aboriginal peoples. It 
noted that educational, economic and social development issues represent a continuing 
challenge. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Italy applauded Canada&#8217;s outstanding commitment to the promotion and protection 
of human rights and welcomed progress in the implementation of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and International Labour 
Organization (ILO) Convention No. 29. It asked if Canada upholds its opinion that a 
specific criminal offence of domestic violence does not have any added value; and whether 
Canada intends to ratify ILO Conventions Nos. 98 and 138. Italy made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>50. Japan inquired about Canada&#8217;s assessment of violence against Aboriginal women, 
the realization of the right to health among Aboriginal peoples, measures meant to improve 
the situation, and challenges identified/steps taken to meet CRPD obligations. Japan made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>51. Jordan commended Canada for advancing the agenda of human rights at national 
and international level and for its ongoing efforts to combat racial discrimination through a 
combination of legislative, policy and education awareness. Jordan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Malaysia noted challenges with regard to the national homelessness programme and 
the prevention of racially motivated acts against Muslim, indigenous and minority 
communities. Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. Canada is committed to eliminating racism and addressing discrimination facing 
Canada&#8217;s diverse racial, ethnic, cultural and religious communities. Canada&#8217;s multicultural 
society is based on intercultural understanding, shared citizenship, engagement and 
inclusion. Canada has a strong legal and policy framework to combat racism and 
discrimination and it condemns racially and religiously motivated crimes and violence. 
</p>
<p>54. Racial profiling is not used or condoned in Canada. Public safety organizations are 
guided by very clear policies that speak out against discrimination or profiling. Training for 
officials is provided. They also perform community outreach and are committed to 
investigating and responding to any concerns or complaints that deal with racial profiling. 
</p>
<p>55. On poverty, homelessness and access to social services, Canada has adopted a 
collaborative approach to social protection. The provinces and territories have primary 
responsibility for delivering services. Canada, however, recognizes that certain vulnerable 
groups face barriers to employment. The Government, in cooperation with provinces and </p>


<p>territories, has a broad range of supports in education, employment, health, housing and 
income support, to address these barriers. 
</p>
<p>56. In 2002, Quebec adopted a law to address poverty and social exclusion. 
Implementation is guided by multi-year action plans and advised by a standing Advisory 
Committee including representatives of civil society which works with the populations 
concerned. Twenty-five per cent of poverty-related funding has been directed to children. 
Achievements in Quebec include a decreasing rate of the overall population dependent on 
social welfare from 8.4 per cent in 2002 to 6.9 per cent in 2012, the increase in the 
minimum wage by 41 per cent since 2002 and the full indexation of social benefits. 
</p>
<p>57. Mexico praised the Canadian endorsement of UNDRIP. It considered that it was 
necessary to strengthen efforts to combat violence against indigenous women and domestic 
violence. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Montenegro praised ratification of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and CRPD. It asked about plans to 
advance the inclusion of children with disabilities into general educational institutions and 
regulations addressing racist violence. Montenegro made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Morocco encouraged Canada to adopt further measures to protect the linguistic 
rights of minority groups and to combat discrimination in education. It welcomed 
programmes targeting indigenous peoples and noted measures taken to prevent the 
exploitation of migrant workers. Morocco made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Namibia praised Canada&#8217;s social security policies, promotion of multiculturalism, 
integration of immigrants and social cohesion, but expressed concern for quality of life of 
Aboriginal peoples, First Nations, Metis and Inuit. Namibia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. The Netherlands praised Canada&#8217;s detailed explanations of the human rights 
situation in Canada, its national legislation and foreign policy. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. New Zealand welcomed confirmation that addressing violence against Aboriginal 
women remains a priority. It asked about steps taken since the last universal periodic 
review to further the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture 
(OPCAT). New Zealand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Nicaragua commended the 2011 joint action plan between the Government and First 
Nations. It encouraged Canada to pursue participation of indigenous peoples in the social 
and economic life of the country. Nicaragua made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>64. Norway acknowledged Canada&#8217;s efforts towards human rights since its last UPR. It 
noted high levels of violence against Aboriginal women and commended the appointment 
of a parliamentary committee to investigate the issue. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Pakistan raised the issues of racial discrimination in earnings, lack of legislation 
criminalizing racist violence, need for criminal procedures for terrorism suspects, and the 
targeting of Muslim and Arab communities for harassment and profiling. Pakistan made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Paraguay noted the progress achieved in the follow-up to the UPR first cycle&#8217;s 
recommendations, in particular in combating discrimination against indigenous peoples, 
violence against women and children, and measures in favour of the elderly and persons 
with disabilities. Paraguay made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>67. Peru acknowledged the ratification of CRPD, the endorsement of UNDRIP and the 
adoption in 2012 of a plan to combat trafficking in persons. Peru made recommendations. </p>


<p>68. Portugal commended Canada for its commitment to human rights, values of freedom 
and democracy. It noted that some United Nations treaty bodies remained concerned that 
their recommendations were not being implemented. Portugal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. Qatar commended Canada for improving the quality of education and health services 
and for its policies and legislation to protect human rights particularly the rights of persons 
with disabilities. It commended Canada&#8217;s establishment of a working group to provide job 
</p>
<p>opportunities to persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>70. The Republic of Korea welcomed efforts to promote freedom of religion, including 
the creation of the Office of Religious Freedom, measures to fight human trafficking and 
measures to resolve questions related to Aboriginals. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>71. The Republic of Moldova noted the efforts to combat trafficking in persons and 
sexual exploitation of children, including the adoption in 2012 of a national plan against 
trafficking and the Manitoba Strategy Responding to Children and Youth at Risk of, or 
Survivors of, Sexual Exploitation. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>72. Romania commended Canada for its consultations with civil society and expressed 
appreciation for the presentation of the national report. Romania made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Canada is still considering OPCAT adherence, providing information on oversight 
of conditions in places of detention, allowing for access to recourse by independent panels 
and through the courts. 
</p>
<p>74. On peaceful assembly and policing, Canada noted that it respects the freedom to 
protest, with an expectation that participants will do so peacefully and with respect. The 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police routinely reaches out to organizers before an event. When 
de-escalation is not successful, the force used to manage a situation is always the lowest 
possible. When balance is not attained in this regard, Canada has independent review 
processes. 
</p>
<p>75. On incarceration, Canada acknowledged that Aboriginal Canadians continue to be 
overrepresented as victims, offenders and inmates. Courts consider alternatives to 
imprisonment of Aboriginal offenders, consistent with considerations of public safety. 
Examples include community-based approaches to justice, sentencing alternatives, and 
family and civil mediation services. 
</p>
<p>76. Correctional services and institutions across the country have specific policies and 
programmes to address the specific needs of ethno-cultural minority offenders. 
</p>
<p>77. On torture, Canada underscored that its obligations under article 3 are incorporated 
into Canadian law. Non-Canadians facing risks can also be seen as persons in need of 
protection and can apply to stay in Canada, and can stay their return to their country of 
origin if they are deemed to face serious risks following their removal. 
</p>
<p>78. Canada has a generous refugee system that provides a safe haven for those in need 
of protection, and a network of services to facilitate their integration. Some new 
developments have increased Canada&#8217;s ability to provide protection quickly to those in 
</p>
<p>need: (a) accelerating timelines for determining an asylum claim to provide protection 
faster to those in need; and (b) designating countries of origin for priority processing. 
Canada reported that it had established a new refugee appeal division for eligible claims. 
</p>
<p>79. In conformity with the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, all asylum claimants receive a fair hearing to 
assess their claim on the basis of its merits before an independent semi-judicial tribunal 
(Immigration and Refugee Board), regardless of how or from where they arrived, exceeding 
the requirement of the Convention. Under this system, asylum claimants can have a </p>


<p>representative with them throughout the process. Canada has recently announced funding to 
renew its support for legal aid. 
</p>
<p>80. Canada has not ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families but fully supports its aims. Canada 
takes the promotion and protection of the human and labour rights of migrants seriously. 
Temporary foreign workers receive legal protection, including with respect to labour laws, 
in accordance with provincial, territorial and federal regimes. 
</p>
<p>81. The Russian Federation raised concerns about arbitrary detention and police ill-
treatment, funding cuts to women&#8217;s rights organizations and lack of a homelessness and 
</p>
<p>poverty strategy. It asked Canada to clarify the situation of a detained woman. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>82. Senegal commended the positive developments occurred since the first universal 
periodic review, notably those in favour of indigenous peoples, the elderly and persons with 
disabilities. It also praised the actions to combat violence against women and children. 
Senegal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>83. Sierra Leone noted that Canada had widely disseminated the outcome of the first 
universal periodic review. It also addressed issues raised then, such as the rights of 
indigenous peoples and the protection of women and children from trafficking. Sierra 
Leone made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>84. Slovakia welcomed, inter alia, the ratification of CRPD in 2010. It appreciated the 
regular contributions made by Canada to the OHCHR budget, including to the United 
Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>85. Slovenia welcomed efforts to address violence against women, but noted special 
rapporteur and treaty body reports of continuing widespread violence against indigenous 
women. Slovenia made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>86. Cyprus praised Canada&#8217;s commitment to human rights and encouraged Canada to 
continue working with civil society, Aboriginal peoples and the private sector. It was 
encouraged by Canada&#8217;s pledge to combat all forms of violence against women. Cyprus 
</p>
<p>made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>87. Sri Lanka welcomed efforts to promote social inclusion, intercultural understanding 
and equality. It remained concerned over unequal treatment of people of colour, including 
Asian-Canadian and African-Canadian communities. It noted problems faced by immigrant 
skilled workers in finding suitable employment on par with their qualifications. Sri Lanka 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>88. The Sudan referred to Canada&#8217;s treatment of special procedures mandate holders. It 
noted that some officials had stated that United Nations experts and UPR should not 
examine the human rights record of Canada and should focus on other countries which face 
more serious and flagrant problems. The Sudan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>89. Sweden appreciated efforts to fight violence against women but noted reports on 
violence against indigenous women. It referred to criticisms of Canada&#8217;s refugee legislation 
and asked about measures being taken to ensure that the Convention relating to the Status 
of Refugees is respected. Sweden made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>90. Switzerland recalled that Canada had not yet ratified OPCAT even though it had 
accepted all recommendations regarding this during the first universal periodic review. It 
asked about the perspectives of a prompt ratification. Switzerland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>91. Thailand welcomed efforts to combat human trafficking. It remained concerned 
about reports of lack of prevention of child sexual exploitation, violence and disparities in </p>


<p>access to services and quality of education for all children, especially to minority and 
marginalized groups. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>92. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia asked about measures undertaken to 
implement the recommendations of the Independent Expert on minority issues concerning 
the representation of minorities in political structures and institutions. It made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>93. Togo noted that Canada had accepted 54 recommendations and had undertaken nine 
voluntary commitments. It highlighted the polyvalent approach followed by Canada in 
favour of indigenous peoples. However, discrimination and violence against women and 
children persisted. Togo made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>94. Trinidad and Tobago referred to the human rights framework supported by the 
independent courts system and complementary laws, policies and programmes. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>95. Tunisia encouraged Canada to continue strengthening its legal framework through 
ratification of other international instruments and the implementation of treaty body 
recommendations. Tunisia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>96. Turkey referred to Canada&#8217;s support system, not only for refugees and the 
oppressed, but also for professionals, innovators and investors. It noted however, negative 
reports in the implementation of the rights of migrants, refugees, persons with disabilities, 
women and Aboriginal peoples. Turkey made recommendations. 
</p>

</p>
<p>98. Costa Rica was concerned about the possibility that minors victims of sexual 
exploitation could be brought to trial for offences regarding child prostitution. It asked why 
Canada had not ratified OPCAT, if it has independent national mechanisms for visits to 
detention facilities and given the active participation of Canada during the elaboration of 
this instrument. Costa Rica made a recommendation.

</p>
<p>103. Algeria recalled that UPR demonstrated that no country was exempted from human 
rights problems. For instance, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of </p>

<p>111. Brazil praised Canada&#8217;s implementation of UPR recommendations. It encouraged 
legislation to fully apply the principle of non-refoulement. It was concerned by inadequate

network, including a tribunal dealing with claims by Aboriginal peoples. Cape Verde made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>117. Canada noted that First Nations enjoy universal and comprehensive health care, like 
all Canadians. Despite progress, Canada recognizes that there are still gaps in the health 
status of First Nations and Inuit. Canada&#8217;s Government is committed to high-quality health 
services for Aboriginal communities, and offers First Nations and Inuit primary health care 
in more than 600 communities, including many complementary services, as well as support 
for health services capacity at the community level. 
</p>
<p>118. Food security is not a challenge for most Canadian families, but there are vulnerable 
families for whom it is, and Canada takes the issue very seriously. The Nutrition North 
Canada Program was noted as one example of programmes that enhance food security of 
Aboriginal communities. 
</p>
<p>119. Addressing suicide has been a priority for Aboriginal communities and Canada has 
worked in partnership with these communities to reduce it. 
</p>
<p>120. Canada&#8217;s view is that irregular arrivals can present a legitimate security risk and 
referred to three safeguards that were in place: only the Minister of Public Safety can 
designate that an arrival is irregular; children under 16 are exempt from detention; and 
those who are determined to be refugees are released from detention on designation as a 
refugee. 
</p>
<p>121. Bias-free policing commitment and independent review commissions speak to the 
importance of the independent review process of Canada&#8217;s policing system. 
</p>
<p>122. On sexual exploitation of children, Canada uses a collaborative, multifaceted 
approach, involving criminal law reforms, to address support to victims and prevention 
measures. Canada&#8217;s Criminal Code provides comprehensive prohibitions, including against 
commercial sexual exploitation, all forms of child pornography, child trafficking and child 
sex tourism. Recent legislative changes strengthen these protections. 
</p>
<p>123. The head of the delegation thanked delegates for their participation, reiterating that 
Canada had sought to provide an honest assessment of progress since its first universal 
periodic review. 
</p>
<p>124. She noted that the Government of Canada has an enduring relationship with 
Aboriginal peoples, shaped over centuries, rooted in a complex history, and currently 
propelled forward by progressive partnerships and meaningful investments that target real 
results and empower Aboriginal people and their communities to generate positive and 
lasting change. It is in this spirit of renewing Crown-Aboriginal relationships that the 
Government has taken action over the last five years, prioritizing areas such as education 
and economic development that are critical to a young and rapidly growing Aboriginal 
population. 
</p>
<p>125. She underscored that Canada remained deeply committed to preventing and 
reducing all forms of violence against women and girls, working across jurisdictions to 
protect communities and ensure the safety of women and girls. Canada acknowledged the 
seriousness of the issue of missing and murdered Aboriginal women and was actively 
working to reduce violence and improve safety for Aboriginal women and girls in Canada. 
</p>
<p>126. She emphasized that multiculturalism and diversity are core Canadian values. No 
society is free from discrimination but all levels of government in Canada, working in 
partnership with civil society including minority communities, are seized of fostering social 
inclusion for all Canadians. </p>


<p>127. She noted that Canada would carefully consider all recommendations, focusing on 
those based on an objective assessment of the human rights situation in Canada and that 
were specific, concrete, achievable and measurable.
