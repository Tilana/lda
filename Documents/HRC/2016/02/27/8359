<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eleventh 
session from 2 to 13 May 2011.  The review of Denmark was held at the 2nd meeting on 2 
May 2011. The delegation of Denmark was headed by Claus Grube, Permanent Secretary 
of State for Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At its 6th meeting held on 4 May 
2011, the Working Group adopted the report of Denmark. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Denmark: Chile, Ghana, Republic of Korea. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Denmark: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/DNK/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/DNK/2);  
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/DNK/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, 
Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Denmark through the troika. These 
questions are available on the extranet of the UPR.  
</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation considered the UPR a positive, innovative mechanism with a true 
potential to improve human rights on the ground. The preparation of the UPR of Denmark 
was a matter of priority for the Danish Government whose ambition was to present a 
national report that was reflective of society as a whole. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation stated that public hearings had been arranged in Copenhagen, &#197;rhus, 
Greenland and the Faroe Islands. A draft report was made publicly available on the UPR 
website of the Ministry of Foreign Affair. The delegation welcomed the written 
submissions to the OHCHR by 15 stakeholders ahead of the UPR of Denmark. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation of Denmark stressed that the report addresses a broad list of human 
rights issues; however, those issues are by no means exhaustive. 
</p>
<p>8. The national report includes separate sections on the human rights situation in 
Greenland and the Faroe Islands. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation stated that it would have liked to invite the Danish Institute for 
Human Rights to address the UPR Working Group. The Institute would have represented 
Denmark in the plenary of the Human Rights Council in its independent capacity as A-
status national human rights institution, from the NHRI seat. The Danish Government 
deeply regretted that, as informed by the secretariat, this request could not be 
accommodated, and sincerely hoped that it would be a possibility at future reviews. </p>


<p>10. The delegation drew attention to the fact that human rights form a key element of the 
value basis of the Danish Government and for decades has been at the centre of its foreign 
and development policy. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation acknowledged that human rights challenges do exist in Denmark, 
and that Denmark is committed to addressing them. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation highlighted that some of these challenges relate to the demographic 
changes that Denmark is undergoing. Denmark is evolving into a more ethnically diverse 
society. However, rapid societal changes also bring about challenges related to maintaining 
and strengthening the cohesiveness in Danish society, and allowing every individual to 
contribute to the greater whole without discrimination. 
</p>
<p>13. The delegation reported that some people today experience a sense of exclusion 
from mainstream society and feel subject to different forms of discrimination. Such 
concerns must be addressed with commitment. Denmark must work to strengthen mutual 
understanding and dialogue among people of different backgrounds, religions and cultures 
in order to break down the fear and prejudice that can easily come to dominate the way 
people view each other. 
</p>
<p>14. The delegation reported that the Government is dedicated to combating 
discrimination in all its forms and, among other things, has taken a number of steps to 
combat discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin. In July 2010, the 
Government published the Action Plan on ethnic equal treatment and respect for the 
individual.  
</p>
<p>15. The delegation stated that another key priority of the Government is the prevention 
of social exclusion and poverty. The Government regularly adjusts the social and labour 
market policies in order to improve the living conditions for people at risk of social 
exclusion and poverty. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation thanked the countries who had submitted written advance questions. 
</p>
<p>17. The representative of the Government of Greenland stated that the indigenous 
people of Greenland, the Inuit, constitute a large majority of 88 per cent. On 21 June 2009, 
Greenland celebrated the inauguration of Greenland Self-Government. The Act on 
Greenland Self-Government introduces new arrangements regarding mineral resource 
activities in Greenland and economic relations between Greenland and Denmark. It 
describes the cooperation between Greenland and Denmark regarding foreign policy, 
recognizes Greenlandic as the official language in Greenland and describes the country&#8217;s  
access to independence &#8211; a decision to be taken by the people of Greenland. 
</p>
<p>18. The representative reported that the full mineral resources area has been taken over 
by the Government of Greenland, while the administration of justice and family law 
remain, for the time being, the responsibility of Denmark. 
</p>
<p>19. Greenland is working diligently to ensure that fundamental human rights principles 
form the basis of any legislative initiative and that the civil society is duly included in the 
preparatory process. It is the policy of the Government of Greenland that international 
human rights instruments be extended to Greenland. However, in accordance with the Act 
on Greenland Self-Government, the lifting of reservations to conventions ratified by 
Denmark and relating to Greenland will require prior presentation to the Parliament of 
Greenland. 
</p>
<p>20. It is the responsibility of the Government of Greenland to ensure the implementation 
of international conventions in areas taken over by Greenland. As a result, the Government 
of Greenland also participates actively in the reporting by Denmark to the treaty bodies of 
the United Nations. </p>


<p>21. In 2008, the Parliament of Greenland requested the Government to consider options 
regarding the establishment of a human rights capacity in Greenland, taking into account 
the relatively small size of the Greenland population. 
</p>
<p>22. It is important to point out that the Government of Greenland is a public government 
rather than an indigenous self-government. However, with the majority of the population 
being of Inuit descent, the Government and Parliament of Greenland place great emphasis 
on the rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>23. One of the first actions of the Government of Greenland was to introduce new 
legislation on language policy and integration aimed at strengthening the role and use of 
Greenlandic. 
</p>
<p>24. The principle of collective ownership to land also applies to natural resources. As 
such, the Government of Greenland recognizes the importance of civil society involvement 
in decision making, not least concerning oil and minerals extraction and major development 
projects.  
</p>
<p>25. The representative stated that the Government is putting strong emphasis on 
improving the lives of children and youth in Greenland. Within the framework of the 
programme &#8220;A Safe Childhood 2010,&#8221; several initiatives are in progress. The Government 
of Greenland has substantially increased the grants for shelters for women and children, and 
family centres. 
</p>
<p>26. The Government of Greenland is preparing a strategy on children and youth, which 
will be presented to the Parliament of Greenland later this year. The strategy addresses 
issues such as failure of care for the child, violence and addiction. 
</p>
<p>27. Within the framework of the public health programme, &#8220;Inuuneritta,&#8221; one of the 
focus areas is violence and sexual health. A wide range of initiatives has already been 
implemented under this programme. 
</p>
<p>28. The representative of Faroe Islands stated that human rights and democracy are 
fundamental values in Faroese society. The democratic system of government and 
legislative framework continue to provide the basis for the protection of all rights. The 
general welfare system has contributed to an overall high standard of living in the Faroe 
Islands. The Government is responsible for all, or most of the costs, related to education, 
health care, child care, elderly care and pensions. 
</p>
<p>29. The Faroe Islands have adopted seven United Nations treaties and since 2004, have 
produced substantial reports documenting the efforts of the Government to ensure human 
rights. NGOs and civil society have been actively involved in the preparation of the 
national report. The Faroese Government appreciates the efforts of the NGOs to produce 
their own submissions. 
</p>
<p>30. The representative stated that the Government appreciates the opportunity to have a 
separate section dedicated to the Faroe Islands in Denmark&#180;s report. But with only three 
pages at their disposal, it was necessary to limit the scope of the contribution and focus on 
the most critical human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>31. The representative stated that Faroese society still faces challenges in the area of 
gender equality. Although the participation of women in politics has increased, women are 
still not as well represented as men in politics. Resources have been directed at ensuring 
rights through legal measures by passing the law governing gender equality in 1994. Also, 
the Government has provided support for public information initiatives by appointing the 
independent committee Demokratia in 2005. 
</p>
<p>32. The representative said that on 8 March this year, the Government announced an 
action plan against violence in the home specifically towards women and children. </p>


<p>33. The Government of the Faroe Islands intends to maintain a high level of ambition 
regarding systematic work on human rights. The Government intends to collaborate closely 
with all relevant stakeholders on any recommendations resulting from this review and in the 
follow-up to this report. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>34. During the interactive dialogue, 47 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations commended Denmark for the initiatives to promote and protect human rights, 
as well as for the broad national consultations with civil society in preparation for the 
universal periodic review. Recommendations made during the dialogue can to be found in 
section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>35.<b> </b>India asked about progress in promoting people from other ethnic backgrounds to 
achieve a racially balanced police service, and measures to combat violence against women 
and to develop a domestic violence action plan. It further sought clarification on the powers 
of the Danish Institute for Human Rights to investigate, suo motu or otherwise, human 
rights complaints. India made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>36. Algeria observed that Denmark is party to most core human rights instruments, but 
noted that it had only incorporated the European Convention for the Protection of Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms into domestic law and sought explanations. Algeria 
referred to concerns at shelving cases of racial or religious hatred, and the possible abolition 
of article 266 (b) of the Criminal Code. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Canada welcomed the inclusion of Greenland in 2005 in the act establishing the 
Danish Institute for Human Rights, yet noted resource constraints limiting its presence in 
Greenland, and noted that its mandate does not cover the Faroe Islands. It asked about 
measures to address these issues. Canada noted that the Criminal Code considered the act of 
torture an aggravating circumstance rather than a specific offence. Canada made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. The Republic of Moldova<b> </b>acknowledged Denmark&#8217;s active role in developing 
reporting and complaint procedures to conform with relevant human rights treaties. It noted 
efforts to eliminate violence against women, and to increase the participation of women in 
decision-making, including in Greenland and the Faroe Islands. It enquired about additional 
measures for full and equal participation of women in political life. It made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>39. The Russian Federation<b> </b>thanked Denmark for the comprehensive national report and 
for the presentation by the head of the delegation. The Russian Federation considered 
Denmark one of the countries with a sufficiently high level of protection of human rights 
and freedoms. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Hungary commended Denmark for its consistent submission of periodic reports to 
United Nations treaty bodies and the standing invitations to special mechanisms. Hungary 
encouraged Denmark to share best practices on implementing the National Strategy to 
combat all forms of violence in intimate relations in the UPR midterm report. Hungary 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Austria noted that Denmark has developed several national action plans to fight 
human trafficking and enquired about other measures to tackle the problem. Austria asked 
about the impact of its initiatives for the disabled, particularly children, and the challenges 
faced in implementing the national strategy to combat violence in intimate relations. 
Austria made recommendations. </p>


<p>42. France enquired about the status of the procedure to ratify the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. It noted that 
the High Commissioner for Refugees and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination recommended that Denmark remove restrictions to the right to marriage 
with foreigners, or between foreigners, and modify the right to family reunification. France 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Finland noted that the Danish Ministry for Integration did not act in compliance with 
the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness to which Denmark is a party, and over 
several years denied citizenship to at least 22 stateless Palestinians. The application 
instructions of the Ministry of Refugee, Immigration and Integration Affairs do not mention 
that stateless persons are exempted from the regular citizenship tests and requirements. 
Finland asked about measures to ensure compliance of its citizenship policies with 
international obligations. Finland made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>44. Greece commended Denmark for its commitment to human rights promotion and 
requested that it share best practices in this regard. Greece asked about action taken 
regarding the status of the Thule tribe in Greenland since the 2003 Supreme Court decision. 
Greece expressed concern at child sex tourism and raised issues regarding immigration, 
including hate speech cases and racist statements by public officials. Greece made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Regarding forcible returns, Switzerland, noted difficulties in tracing individuals after 
their return. It also noted that when returning alleged terrorists, States often rely on 
diplomatic assurances, and that in the fight against terrorism, European States also 
participated, directly or indirectly, in numerous human rights violations. Switzerland stated 
that rape is a crime that must be punished regardless of the type of relationship of those 
concerned. Switzerland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Poland commended Denmark for its active cooperation with United Nations special 
procedures and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. It appreciated the 
developed institutional and legislative system of human rights protection, including the A-
status national human rights institution. Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. Slovenia welcomed the legislative and policy measures to eliminate violence against 
women and noted the lack of legislation protecting women victims of domestic violence in 
Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Slovenia inquired about plans to adopt a national action 
plan for human rights. It commended the adoption of the Act on Equal Treatment and the 
launch of the Action Plan for ethnic equal treatment and respect for the individual, but 
noted the lack of data on Roma and inquired about remedial measures. Slovenia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Egypt noted the establishment in 2007 of the Centre against human trafficking and 
requested information on Denmark&#8217;s experience in this field, particularly child trafficking 
and on efforts addressing sexual exploitation of children. Egypt was concerned at racist 
statements by members of parliament, negative profiling of migrants and recurrent cases 
and manifestations of intolerance, lack of respect for the religion of others and hate speech 
as well as incitement to hatred and defamation of Islamic religious symbols and 
personalities. Egypt made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Azerbaijan asked whether Denmark considers acceding to the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families. It noted gaps regarding discrimination of women, sexual-based violence and 
sexual abuse and enquired about the adoption of legislation on violence against women, 
including domestic violence. Azerbaijan made recommendations. </p>


<p>50. Afghanistan noted that Denmark is party to most human rights treaties, and has 
established the Danish Institute for Human Rights and the Action Plan on ethnic equal 
treatment and respect for the individual in July 2010. While welcoming Denmark&#8217;s 
cooperation with OHCHR, treaty bodies and special procedures, Afghanistan reiterated 
treaty body recommendations to incorporate the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women and the Convention against Torture into national legislation to ensure direct 
application before courts. Afghanistan made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>51. Indonesia commended Denmark for making respect for human rights a core value of 
Danish foreign policy. Indonesia referred to an incident of clear manifestation of 
defamation of Islam and noted cases of violence against women, particularly domestic 
violence and rape. Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Germany enquired about plans to improve the situation of children requesting 
asylum and about social welfare policy for refugees. Germany requested information on 
follow-up plans to recommendations by the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women to pursue efforts regarding violence against women, to 
adopt a coordination policy and specific legislation, including on domestic violence. It 
inquired about plans to improve access to citizenship by women, who are currently required 
to prove that they lived at least seven years with their husband. Germany commended 
Denmark for launching the Action Plan on ethnic equal treatment and sought more details. 
Germany made no recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. Palestine commended Denmark for the importance given to human rights as 
universal values and noted that it has ratified many human rights treaties. Palestine noted 
Denmark&#8217;s concern about children&#8217;s rights, as reflected by the law on social services, 
ensuring that they are consulted on decisions which concern them. Palestine made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Uzbekistan noted the recent measures by Denmark to combat racial discrimination 
and eliminate violence against women, and the inclusion in the Criminal Code of a special 
section on torture. Uzbekistan emphasized treaty body concerns about human rights 
violations, including the fact that offence of torture was not included in the Criminal Code 
and was subject to the statute of limitations. Uzbekistan noted negative and hostile attitudes 
towards growing numbers of immigrants. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. The delegation responded to written questions and questions from delegations 
during the interactive dialogue and clustered them into thematic issues. There were several 
considerations for not incorporating United Nations human rights instruments into national 
law: The Government assesses whether national law is in conformity with international 
conventions, and the conventions are relevant sources of law regardless of the method of 
implementation and can be invoked by national courts and other authorities. 
</p>
<p>56. Denmark does not consider a national action plan on human rights necessary, as 
various human rights issues are addressed on a concrete basis and initiatives are developed 
and implemented by experts responsible for the area of society concerned. Furthermore, 
new legislation is carried out within the framework of human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>57. The Government considered it inexpedient to sign the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities since the obligations are difficult to 
define and subject to gradual implementation within resources available. 
</p>
<p>58. Danish case law is available on private websites which often require a subscription. 
Some case law from the Supreme Court and the Maritime and Commercial Court is </p>


<p>available to the public at no expense. The Danish Court Administration initiated 
preparations for a public database on case law in 2010. 
</p>
<p>59. Between 1992 and 2010, 757 applications from persons born stateless in Denmark 
were examined. 36 of these had been mistakenly rejected. Most of these 36 have already 
been granted citizenship, while the rest are listed in the naturalization bill that was 
introduced to Parliament on 15 April 2011. It is now possible for certain stateless persons to 
submit applications before 1 March 2012 as they may have received incorrect information 
on their rights. A commission of inquiry is carrying out an independent inquiry of the case. 
</p>
<p>60. With regard to family reunification, the rules regarding spousal reunification in the 
Danish Aliens Act do not regulate the right to marry. Obtaining spousal reunification 
normally requires that the spouses&#8217; combined attachment to Denmark is stronger than to 
any other country to ensure the best possible starting point for a successful integration. In 
some cases, exemptions from the requirements are made. A bill has been submitted to 
Parliament, that if adopted will reform the legislation on spousal reunification and 
modernize the 24-year requirement. 
</p>
<p>61. Denmark has experienced a strong increase in the number of unaccompanied minors 
entering the country and faces certain challenges with regard to these minors. In the future, 
the special residence permit for unaccompanied minors will expire when the foreigner turns 
</p><p>18. Return of an unaccompanied minor will not take place unless the asylum claim has been 
rejected. 
</p>
<p>62. Regarding the expulsion of refugees, the safeguard against refoulement is absolute. 
Those who cannot be expelled are either granted asylum status or stay in Denmark without 
a residence permit (exceptional leave to remain). 
</p>
<p>63. With regard to expelled EU citizens, Denmark cannot verify if they belong to the 
Roma ethnicity, as people are not registered on the basis of their ethnicity. The Supreme 
Court did not find substantial grounds for expulsion in two cases. After these rulings, 14 
other decisions were reviewed and overturned. The authorities are investigating how to 
handle this type of cases in the future. 
</p>
<p>64. Regarding the forced return of Iraqi refugees, the Refugee Appeals Board has 
indicated that the recommendations by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees on the treatment of asylum-seekers from Iraq are an essential 
element when a concrete and individual assessment of each case is made &#8211; although the 
recommendations are not legally binding and of a general character. The Ombudsman 
monitors forced returns. 
</p>
<p>65. Concerning health care of asylum-seekers, the Government makes no distinction 
between children of asylum-seekers and other children residing in Denmark. Adult asylum-
seekers are entitled to health care provided that it is necessary, urgent and alleviating. 
</p>
<p>66. The Government clearly stated that it does not support abolition of section 266(b) of 
the Criminal Code, as it will be contrary to obligations under International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and international law. 
</p>
<p>67. Various measures have been put in place to prevent hate crimes against ethnic 
minorities. The &#8220;Stop Hate Crimes&#8221; campaign was launched to raise awareness and urge 
victims and witnesses to report the crimes to the police. In 2009, the Government presented 
an action plan to prevent extremist views and radicalization among young people. The 
Danish Security and Intelligence Service gathered information from the police on crimes 
motivated by extremist opinions in order to detect any signs of an organized or systematic 
rise in crime with a possible extremist background. </p>


<p>68. Danish legislation ensures comprehensive protection against discrimination on the 
grounds of race and ethnic origin. However, legislation cannot stand alone. Denmark 
therefore supports several initiatives carried out by authorities and civil society. 
</p>
<p>69. The delegation of the Government of Greenland responded to questions on the 
ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, which has been approved by the 
Parliament of Greenland, but awaited the necessary adaptation of Greenland legislation. 
</p>
<p>70. The Government of Greenland actively promotes equal representation of men and 
women in public office. The issue of domestic violence is dealt with in a holistic manner 
and linked with many of the Government&#8217;s initiatives. The Government of Greenland is 
preparing a strategy on children and youth which will be presented to Parliament in 2011. 
</p>
<p>71. The Parliament of Greenland has passed broad-based legislation concerning gender 
equality, which is regularly reviewed. Equal representation of men and women on boards 
and committees is strongly emphasized with respect to publicly owned companies and 
institutions. Fair and equal wages are ensured through collective agreements in the public 
and private sector. 
</p>
<p>72. Mexico<b> </b>recognized Denmark&#8217;s efforts to advance human rights promotion and 
protection, including prevention of ethnic discrimination and violence against women. It 
noted Denmark&#8217;s efforts at the international level, including on torture, and highlighted its 
cooperation with special procedures. It also noted remaining challenges, particularly on 
non-discrimination and the inclusion of ethnic minorities. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Pakistan noted the legislative and institutional measures promoting and protecting 
human rights. Pakistan remarked on efforts to integrate foreigners and migrants into society 
and acknowledged that social integration is a complicated process. Regarding the 2005 
newspaper publication of cartoons about the Prophet Muhammad, it noted that this shocked 
Muslims worldwide, prompted forceful reactions, stirred a pointless debate and violated 
Articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 4 
of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
Pakistan requested information on measures to avoid the recurrence of such incidents. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>74. The United States of America commended Denmark for its commitment to 
upholding human rights and its increased efforts to place human rights at the forefront of its 
national agenda. It shared concerns over religious and ethnic discrimination, domestic 
violence against women, residency and citizenship requirements for migrants and asylum-
seekers, and human trafficking. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75. The Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concern at possible inadequacies in the 
Danish legal system to combat age discrimination outside employment; the possible 
abolishment of article 266(b) of the Criminal Code; Islamophobia; discrimination against 
women in the Faroe Islands; lack of ratification by Greenland and the Faroe Islands of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography, as well as the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children; gender-based violence and the 
narrow definition of rape; and the broad definition of terrorism in the Criminal Code. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76. Belgium welcomed Denmark&#8217;s efforts to ensure gender equality and combat 
discrimination against women. Noting the low number of reported rapes leading to 
convictions, it asked about envisaged measures, including the adoption of a national action 
plan. Belgium made recommendations. </p>


<p>77. Australia acknowledged Denmark&#8217;s long-standing commitment to human rights and 
commended it for ratifying most human rights treaties, while noting that it is not party to 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It 
commended the work of non-governmental organizations in Denmark in promoting human 
rights, and the establishment of the centre against human trafficking and noted that 
Denmark is part of regional and European networks to combat child trafficking. Australia 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>78. Argentina recognized Denmark&#8217;s national and international initiatives, through the 
work of the Danish Human Rights Institute. It asked about measures to ensure equal 
remuneration for men and women and to combat sex tourism which affects children. 
Argentina made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>79. The Netherlands noted Denmark&#8217;s increased police powers, since 2011, to 
investigate and prevent terrorism. It also noted that none of the United Nations core human 
rights conventions ratified by Denmark has been incorporated in Danish law. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>80. Italy praised Denmark's innovative approach facilitating the consultation process in 
view of the universal periodic review, including through a dedicated website, identifying 
this as best practice. It acknowledged the importance given to human rights promotion and 
protection and Denmark&#8217;s leadership in anti-torture efforts worldwide, as recognized by 
treaty bodies and special procedures. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>81. Norway<b> </b>commended Denmark for its consistent efforts against torture. It referred to 
focus areas for enhanced efforts on gender equality and noted the importance of access by 
children to an independent body monitoring their rights and advocating on their behalf.

Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>82. Spain commended Denmark&#8217;s efforts to promote and protect human rights,

persons, as well as the mechanism established in 2004 to receive individual complaints on 
racial discrimination cases. Spain commended the 2008 judicial system reform and

</p>
<p>84. The Republic of Korea commended Denmark&#8217;s efforts in promoting respect for 
human rights, its accession to most core human rights treaties and closer cooperation with 
United Nations human rights bodies. Noting the number of victims of violence in intimate 
relations, it welcomed the launch of a National Strategy to combat such violence. It 
expressed concern over forcible return of asylum-seekers to third countries where they may 
face the danger of persecution or serious harm, and reiterated the principle of non-
refoulement. It stated that Denmark should embrace minorities and indigenous peoples in 
society. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>85. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, noting the positive 
developments in Denmark for employment of non-Western immigrants and descendants, 
was concerned about the 24-year rule potentially preventing immigrants from securing </p>


<p>desired family life, and enquired about remedial measures. It noted encouraging targeted 
efforts for trafficking victims and asked about initiatives to prevent commercial sexual 
exploitation of children. While noting decreasing pretrial solitary confinement, statistics 
indicate long periods of pretrial custody. The United Kingdom commended initiatives to 
improve accessibility for the disabled, including amending building regulations. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>86. Brazil noted Denmark&#8217;s standing invitation to special procedures and its A-status 
national human rights institution. It commended efforts in raising awareness on human 
trafficking and urged Denmark to resist calls to repeal section 266(b) of the Criminal Code 
on racism on grounds of freedom of expression. Brazil noted the lowering of the age of 
criminal responsibility and recalled that the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child should prevail over domestic law. Brazil made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>87. Sweden noted concerns raised over the family reunification conditions for spouses 
and enquired about their human rights impact. Regarding the administrative detention of

associations and meet for religious purposes, and the prohibition of religion-based 
discrimination. Morocco acknowledged Danish cooperation on development and human 
rights and commended efforts to improve living conditions in Greenland. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>89. Honduras commended Denmark&#8217;s commitment to respect human rights, but 
expressed concern about the situation of foreign women losing their residency permit on

</p>
<p>91. Slovakia noted Denmark&#8217;s outstanding human rights record. It commended the

recommendations. 
</p>
<p>92. Turkey noted that Denmark has not ratified or incorporated into domestic law the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and

Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It sought Denmark&#8217;s views on 
reported difficulties with human rights monitoring in the State party due to non-existent 
human rights data. Referring to the case of Ekrem &#350;ahin, Turkey enquired how Denmark 
would secure an effective investigation and sought Denmark&#8217;s views on mother-tongue </p>


<p>teaching, given the 65,000 Turkish people living in the State party. Turkey made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>93. South Africa, referring to the recommendations by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination to monitor the incidence and combating of racism and

information on their implementation and on the degree to which the elimination and 
prevention of racist and xenophobic acts is addressed in the platform &#8220;Denmark 2020, 
Knowledge, Growth, Prosperity, Welfare&#8221;. While Denmark is party to several human rights 
instruments, South Africa noted that it maintains certain reservations and declarations. It 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>94. Burkina Faso welcomed Denmark&#8217;s dedication to human rights promotion and 
protection nationally and abroad, including in Burkina Faso. It welcomed Denmark&#8217;s 
efforts to combat poverty, protect the rights of the disabled and eliminate discrimination 
against women. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>95. Malaysia expressed concern about commercial sexual exploitation of children and 
child sex tourism in Denmark, enquired about measures to address this and about 
Denmark&#8217;s intentions to prohibit the commercialization of sexual services. Malaysia noted 
reports on the increase of discrimination, intolerance and absence of respect of the religious 
sensitivities of minority groups, particularly Islam. Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>96. Bangladesh appreciated Denmark&#8217;s contribution to human rights promotion and 
protection endeavours in developing countries, especially empowering women in 
development activities, and commended it for exceeding the Official Development 
Assistance target set by the United Nations. It appreciated actions to ensure protection of 
ethnic groups, curbing trafficking, and the high standards of reception centres for 
unaccompanied children seeking asylum. Persisting racial discrimination, prejudices, 
stereotyping and profiling of migrants as well as instances of racist statements and 
expressions, including with negative religious overtones by high public figures and the 
media remained of concern. Bangladesh made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>97. Guatemala sought information on policies to ensure an adequate standard of living, 
health and work for migrants. It inquired about the reasons why Denmark has not ratified 
the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families and asked if it intended to do so in the near future. Guatemala 
further enquired about the status of the recommendations by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination on eliminating labour market obstacles for migrants. 
Guatemala made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>98. Kyrgyzstan welcomed the steps taken by Denmark to safeguard human rights, the 
standing invitation to special procedures, the establishment of a national preventive 
mechanism in accordance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and 
the rules regarding the construction of buildings to facilitate access for the disabled. Despite 
significant progress, deficiencies remained in achieving effective equality of men and 
women, with regard to the situation of unaccompanied refugee minors and of asylum-
seekers. It noted that, to date, Denmark has only incorporated the European Convention on 
Human Rights into its national legislation. Kyrgyzstan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>99. The delegation of Denmark stressed that efforts are being made to combat violence 
in intimate relations. The numbers of abused women dropped from 42,000 in 2002 to 
28,000 in 2007. 
</p>
<p>100. With regard to the incrimination of rape, the Government has asked an expert 
committee on criminal law to thoroughly review chapter 24 of the Criminal Code on sexual 
offences. </p>


<p>101. Regarding the minimum age of criminal responsibility, the delegation reported that 
statistics show that the number of juvenile crimes has decreased since 2001. It has not been 
possible to establish a connection between the decrease and changing the age of criminal 
responsibility. 
</p>
<p>102. Freedom of expression is enshrined in the Danish Constitution, which prohibits 
censorship. Denmark condemns any action that attempts to demonize people on the basis of 
their religion or ethnic background, and expect all religions to respect each other. Denmark 
respects Islam as one of the world&#8217;s major religions as well as their religious symbols, as 
Denmark respects all religious creeds and communities. The Director of Public Prosecution 
did not find grounds to institute criminal proceedings in the case of the drawings depicting 
the Prophet Muhammad. 
</p>
<p>103. The representative of the Faroe Islands addressed concerns related to gender 
discrimination as various legislations do not distinguish between women and men and 
ensure that all citizens enjoy the same rights equally. Concerning violence against women, 
the delegation referred to the action plan against violence and the funding provided to the 
crisis centre for women. 
</p>
<p>104. Women participation in political life has also increased. As a result of the elections 
in January 2008 the proportion of women in Parliament increased from 9.4 per cent to 21.2 
per cent. 
</p>
<p>105. The head of delegation concluded by thanking Danish civil society for its active 
participation in the process preceding the review and hoped for continued fruitful dialogue 
in the follow-up phase. Denmark appreciated the review as an opportunity to take stock of 
the human rights situation and considers it a very useful tool in identifying areas where 
extra effort is needed. It intends to make good use of the valuable input received during the 
review in future efforts to further improve the human rights of its citizens.
