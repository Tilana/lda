<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief gives 
</p>
<p>an account of the main findings of his visit to Kazakhstan undertaken from 25 March to 
</p>
<p>4 April 2014. While acknowledging a general appreciation of religious diversity in the 
</p>
<p>country, he noticed adverse attitudes towards some non-traditional religious communities. 
</p>
<p>The State monitors religious activities strictly, with a view to preventing extremism and to 
</p>
<p>combating &#8220;sects&#8221; deemed destructive to people&#8217;s well-being. Many of the measures 
</p>
<p>adopted for this purpose are not in line with international standards of freedom of religion 
</p>
<p>or belief. Moreover, the mandatory registration of religious communities, in conjunction 
</p>
<p>with tightly knit stipulations, largely hampers free religious practice, which takes place in 
</p>
<p>an atmosphere of legal insecurity.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 25 March to 4 April 2014 the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
</p>
<p>belief, Heiner Bielefeldt, undertook a visit to Kazakhstan. First of all, he would like to 
</p>
<p>express his gratitude to the Government of Kazakhstan for having invited him, as part of a 
</p>
<p>standing invitation to all Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. He is 
</p>
<p>particularly grateful to the numerous interlocutors from different government agencies, a 
</p>
<p>broad range of civil society organizations, a number of academics and various religious 
</p>
<p>communities. Discussions took place in Astana, Almaty and Karaganda. The exchange of 
</p>
<p>views, experiences and assessments, which he had with different interlocutors, took place in 
</p>
<p>a constructive atmosphere. The United Nations country team in Astana played a crucial role 
</p>
<p>in facilitating the visit and establishing important contacts to different government 
</p>
<p>institutions, civil society organizations and religious communities. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>would like to take this opportunity to again extend his thanks to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Resident Coordinator and his team, in particular the Human Rights Programme Officer.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General observations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. A society characterized by religious pluralism 
</b></p>
<p>2. Interlocutors from the Government and civil society repeatedly pointed out that 
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan, in spite of its rich and long history, is still a young nation. Since its 
</p>
<p>independence in 1991, it has seen rapid and far-reaching transformations, including an 
</p>
<p>unprecedented pace of economic growth, the establishment of new State agencies, the 
</p>
<p>development of numerous civil society organizations, the further unfolding of ethnic, 
</p>
<p>cultural and religious pluralism and a revival of religious life, epitomized inter alia in a 
</p>
<p>number of impressive new religious buildings.  
</p>
<p>3. Religious pluralism is a hallmark of Kazakh society traceable to far back in history 
</p>
<p>and perhaps even to pre-history. Many people with whom the Special Rapporteur discussed 
</p>
<p>this issue praised the culture of religious tolerance that has existed in the country since time 
</p>
<p>immemorial. Some also mentioned specifically the country&#8217;s &#8220;nomadic&#8221; traditions of 
</p>
<p>hospitality and openness towards others. Today, two big confessions &#8212; Sunni Islam (of the 
</p>
<p>Hanafi school) and Russian Orthodox Christianity &#8212; shape the religious landscape, 
</p>
<p>together with a number of smaller communities. While Muslims constitute a majority of 
</p>
<p>approximately 70 per cent of the population, Russian Orthodox Christians are estimated to 
</p>
<p>amount to almost 25 per cent. Smaller communities include Catholics, Lutherans, Baptists, 
</p>
<p>Methodists, Seventh Day Adventists, New Apostolic Church, Pentecostals, Jehovah&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Witnesses, Mormons, Shias, members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Baha&#8217;is, 
</p>
<p>Buddhists, Scientologists and Hare Krishna adherents. One should not forget that there are 
</p>
<p>possibly also a high number of atheists and agnostics or people who do not care much about 
</p>
<p>religious beliefs and identities. While some of the above-mentioned communities have 
</p>
<p>existed in Kazakhstan for centuries, others arrived in more recent times. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur noticed broad agreement that the relationship between the various religious 
</p>
<p>communities is generally a positive one. Incidents of interreligious clashes seem to be very 
</p>
<p>rare, and people mostly appreciate religious diversity as something quite natural to 
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan.  
</p>
<p>4. However, this generally positive attitude does not equally include members of non-
</p>
<p>traditional communities. According to a survey conducted by the Agency for Religious 
</p>
<p>Affairs, the population generally displays different degrees of acceptance towards 
</p>
<p>traditional and non-traditional religious communities. Members of communities perceived </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>as &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; reported that they sometimes faced societal scepticism, suspicion and 
</p>
<p>discrimination. For instance, they might encounter difficulties when trying to rent a 
</p>
<p>building or room to gather the community or to hold services. Although government 
</p>
<p>representatives mostly avoided the terms &#8220;traditional&#8221; and &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; when 
</p>
<p>discussing this theme &#8212; except in the context of summits of religious leaders regularly 
</p>
<p>convened in Kazakhstan &#8212; no one denied that adverse attitudes existed towards religious 
</p>
<p>groups perceived as standing outside of the country&#8217;s traditional mosaic. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>widespread fear of religious extremism, often associated with certain currents of Islam, and 
</p>
<p>worries about the influence of &#8220;sects&#8221; generally associated with small non-traditional 
</p>
<p>groups pose challenges to the climate of religious tolerance that largely prevails in the 
</p>
<p>society.  
</p>
<p>5. Religious and ethnic pluralism is almost inextricably intertwined in Kazakhstan. 
</p>
<p>While ethnic Kazakhs, who constitute the largest ethnic group, usually understand 
</p>
<p>themselves as Muslims, ethnic Russians (constituting the second biggest group) are 
</p>
<p>generally perceived as Orthodox Christians. However, such perceptions and self-
</p>
<p>identification do not always reflect an active religious commitment and practice. It seems 
</p>
<p>that religion often serves as a proxy for ethnicity and vice versa. This complex ethno-
</p>
<p>religious pluralism is widely appreciated as a positive asset on which to build Kazakhstan&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>future. The &#8220;Assembly of Peoples of Kazakhstan&#8221;, headed by the President of the country 
</p>
<p>and convened at least once a year at national level, reflects this ethno-religious pluralism by 
</p>
<p>bringing together people from all parts of society.  
</p>
<p>6. Conversion from one religion to another, or to atheism, is possible without any State 
</p>
<p>interference. While missionary activities aimed at converting others are strictly monitored 
</p>
<p>by the State, changing one&#8217;s religion does not incur any State-imposed sanctions. However, 
</p>
<p>given the wide overlaps between religion and ethnicity, a change of one&#8217;s inherited religion 
</p>
<p>may also be perceived as a rupture from one&#8217;s own ethnic and family background, thus 
</p>
<p>possibly leading to social ostracism.  
</p>
<p><b> B. The self-understanding of the State in managing religious pluralism 
</b></p>
<p>7. In the international arena, Kazakhstan aspires to serving as a bridge between 
</p>
<p>different global and regional organizations as well as between different world religions. 
</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2013 Kazakhstan has been a member of the United Nations Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council. The country also belongs to the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations. 
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan plays an active role in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in 
</p>
<p>Europe and takes pride in its 2010 chairmanship of that organization. Although Kazakhstan 
</p>
<p>does not formally belong to the Council of Europe, it participates in the European 
</p>
<p>Commission for Democracy through Law (&#8220;Venice Commission&#8221;), which is tasked with 
</p>
<p>promoting the principles of rule of law in the broader European and Eurasian region. 
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan is also a member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the 
</p>
<p>Government has shown a commitment towards strengthening that organization&#8217;s human 
</p>
<p>rights component. Finally, the Government takes particular pride in its role as convener of 
</p>
<p>regular meetings of the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions.  
</p>
<p>8. The promotion of amicable relations between different religions thus characterizes 
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan&#8217;s political aspirations in the international arena as well as in the domestic 
</p>
<p>sphere. This commitment to interreligious dialogue has much to do with the existing and 
</p>
<p>further emerging religious pluralism in the country and the Government&#8217;s experience in 
</p>
<p>managing such pluralism. The Agency for Religious Affairs, established in 2011, plays an 
</p>
<p>important facilitating role in convening interreligious council meetings both regionally and 
</p>
<p>nationally. Such meetings take place at least four times a year. Besides the closed meetings 
</p>
<p>reserved for formal members, some meetings are open for broader participation by non-</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>members as well. Some representatives of religious minorities explicitly appreciated the 
</p>
<p>efforts undertaken by the Government in this field, assuming that without the active role of 
</p>
<p>the State the religious communities would probably meet less regularly. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Constitutional standards  
</b></p>
<p>9. Kazakhstan sees itself as a secular State that does not promote any particular religion 
</p>
<p>or belief. Indeed, secularism belongs to the defining characteristics of the State, as laid 
</p>
<p>down in the 1995 Constitution. According to article 1, paragraph 1, of the Constitution, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Republic of Kazakhstan proclaims itself a democratic, secular, legal and social State 
</p>
<p>whose highest values are an individual, his life, rights and freedoms&#8221;. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>article 5, paragraph 4, of the Constitution bans religious political parties. 
</p>
<p>10. The secular nature of the State was an issue mentioned in numerous discussions with 
</p>
<p>government representatives and civil society organizations. In this context, the Agency for 
</p>
<p>Religious Affairs referred to opinion polls that indicate that secularism enjoys broad 
</p>
<p>approval among the population. Ideas of establishing a religious State, for instance an 
</p>
<p>Islamic State, as exist in some of the neighbouring countries, seem to be very unpopular.  
</p>
<p>11. Moreover, the secular nature of the State is widely seen as the sine qua non for the 
</p>
<p>Government to take an authoritative role in managing religious diversity. During 
</p>
<p>discussions, Government officials underlined that secularism in Kazakhstan does not 
</p>
<p>indicate an anti-religious attitude, as was the case during Soviet rule, but rather serves as a 
</p>
<p>guarantee of State neutrality vis-&#224;-vis the various religions that exist in the country. 
</p>
<p>However, while clearly emphasizing the need to prevent religions from unduly influencing 
</p>
<p>secular State institutions, the government representatives usually paid markedly less 
</p>
<p>attention to the need to protect religious communities from undue State control. This 
</p>
<p>peculiar understanding of secularism is also reflected in political practice. The Government 
</p>
<p>pursues a restrictive policy of keeping religion largely out of State institutions such as 
</p>
<p>public schools, the administration and the military. For instance, the military has no 
</p>
<p>religious chaplains. At the same time, the State goes quite far in monitoring religious 
</p>
<p>organizations, in particular non-traditional communities. In discussions on secularism, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur argued for a less restrictive understanding and a more accommodating 
</p>
<p>practice whereby State institutions would provide an open, inclusive space for the unfolding 
</p>
<p>of diversity of religion and belief also in the public sphere.   
</p>
<p>12. The Constitution contains a number of human rights provisions, some of which are 
</p>
<p>especially pertinent to the practice of freedom of religion or belief. Article 14 enshrines the 
</p>
<p>principles of equality and non-discrimination. Among the explicitly prohibited grounds of 
</p>
<p>discrimination, the article lists &#8220;attitude towards religion&#8221; and &#8220;convictions&#8221;. Article 19 
</p>
<p>guarantees everyone the right to determine and indicate or not to indicate religious 
</p>
<p>affiliation. The most pertinent constitutional provision concerning freedom of religion or 
</p>
<p>belief is article 22, which reads as follows: &#8220;1. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>conscience. 2. The right to freedom of conscience must not specify or limit universal 
</p>
<p>human and civil rights and responsibilities before the State&#8221;. In addition, article 39 of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution prohibits limitations on the right to freedom of conscience under all 
</p>
<p>circumstances. 
</p>
<p>13. The formulation used in article 22 of the Constitution is clearly narrower than the 
</p>
<p>wording found in article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p>which Kazakhstan ratified in 2006. While article 18 of the Covenant broadly covers 
</p>
<p>freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief in its various private and public 
</p>
<p>dimensions for everyone, individually and together with others, article 22 of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution merely refers to freedom of conscience of individuals. Furthermore, in 
</p>
<p>comparison with article 22, paragraph 2, of the Constitution, which leaves the issue of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>possible limitations rather open, the criteria for limitations on manifestations of freedom of 
</p>
<p>religion or belief enshrined in article 18, paragraph 3, of the Covenant are more precisely 
</p>
<p>and more carefully defined. 
</p>
<p>14. According to the Constitution, international human rights treaties have priority over 
</p>
<p>conflicting domestic law &#8212; except for the Constitution, which remains the supreme law of 
</p>
<p>the country. While article 4, paragraph 2, anchors the supreme legal authority of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution &#8220;as the highest judicial force&#8221; in Kazakhstan, article 4, paragraph 3, provides 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;international treaties ratified by Kazakhstan are to be directly implemented except in 
</p>
<p>cases when the application of an international treaty shall require the promulgation of a 
</p>
<p>law&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>15. A number of State institutions, including the Human Rights Commission under the 
</p>
<p>President and the Ombudsman, have a mandate to monitor the domestic human rights 
</p>
<p>situation, based on constitutional and international standards. The Ombudsman so far has 
</p>
<p>an office only in the capital, but the establishment of regional offices is currently under 
</p>
<p>discussion.  
</p>
<p><b> III. The prevalence of security and public-order concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Fear of religious extremism 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Government&#8217;s active role in managing religious pluralism seems to be strongly 
</p>
<p>motivated by the fear of religious extremism. Apart from State representatives, such fear 
</p>
<p>was also voiced by members of civil society organizations and representatives of religious 
</p>
<p>communities. In the face of religious militancy, violent religious clashes and even terrorism 
</p>
<p>in some of Kazakhstan&#8217;s neighbouring countries, the existing anxiety is certainly 
</p>
<p>understandable.  
</p>
<p>17. Some academic experts were of the opinion that, owing to the Soviet legacy, most 
</p>
<p>believers lacked an in-depth understanding of their own religious traditions &#8212; a situation 
</p>
<p>which, they said, might render people vulnerable to the simplistic slogans of religious 
</p>
<p>radicalism. The fact that religious and ethnic pluralism are nearly inextricably interwoven 
</p>
<p>in Kazakhstan may add yet another dimension to security concerns.  
</p>
<p>18. Stability, tranquillity and harmony figured as keywords in many discussions, in 
</p>
<p>particular with government representatives. The Special Rapporteur concurs that the 
</p>
<p>political stability that Kazakhstan has by and large enjoyed since its independence is an 
</p>
<p>accomplishment that deserves to be appreciated and further developed. However, the strong 
</p>
<p>emphasis on stability can, and does, lead to subordinating human rights norms, including 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief, to broadly defined security and public-order concerns. This 
</p>
<p>even obscures the elevated normative rank of human rights, including freedom of religion 
</p>
<p>of belief, as inalienable rights.  
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that freedom of religion or belief is 
</p>
<p>not a mere dividend of efficient diversity management by the State, but rather has the status 
</p>
<p>of a universal right belonging to all human beings. Everyone must be able to practise their 
</p>
<p>religion or belief, individually and in community with others, in private or in public. To 
</p>
<p>have this freedom is everyone&#8217;s right &#8212; prior to, and ultimately independent of, any acts of 
</p>
<p>administrative approval. Moreover, the ways in which people wish to express their freedom 
</p>
<p>of religion or belief are manifold. They include traditional and less traditional forms of 
</p>
<p>worship, communicative outreach within and beyond their own religious community, 
</p>
<p>educational efforts in families and communities, organized charity work, importation and 
</p>
<p>distribution of religious literature, and establishment of an appropriate religious </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>infrastructure. Reportedly, the enjoyment of these freedoms is hampered by the law and in 
</p>
<p>practice, in particular for members of so-called &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; communities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. The issue of limitation to freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>20. In discussions with government representatives, general agreement could be found 
</p>
<p>that freedom of religion or belief &#8212; apart from its absolutely protected <i>forum internum</i> 
</p>
<p>dimension &#8212; is not without possible limitations. However, disagreements repeatedly 
</p>
<p>occurred concerning the question of where to draw the line. Fortunately, international 
</p>
<p>human rights law gives clear guidance in this respect. The decisive point is that the onus of 
</p>
<p>proof always falls on those who argue on behalf of limitations, not on those who defend or 
</p>
<p>practise a human right to freedom. In other words, the relationship between a human right 
</p>
<p>to freedom and its limitations must remain a relationship between rule and exception. In 
</p>
<p>case of doubt, the rule prevails; with exceptions always requiring an extra burden of 
</p>
<p>argumentation, both at the level of empirical evidence and of normative reasoning.  
</p>
<p>21. Limitations to freedom of religion or belief cannot be legitimate unless they 
</p>
<p>cumulatively meet the criteria set out in article 18, paragraph 3, of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>Accordingly, they must be legally prescribed; they must be clearly necessary &#8212; i.e. as an 
</p>
<p>ultimate resort &#8212; to pursue a legitimate aim; and they must remain within the realm of 
</p>
<p>proportionality, which inter alia means they must be confined to the minimum degree of 
</p>
<p>interference needed to reach one of the legitimate aims. In addition, limitations must not 
</p>
<p>have any discriminatory intentions or effects.  
</p>
<p>22. In discussions with government representatives, the Special Rapporteur often sensed 
</p>
<p>a different starting point concerning the relationship between a right to freedom and its 
</p>
<p>possible limitations. Rather than measuring the legitimacy of State-imposed limitations on 
</p>
<p>the prevailing status of universal human rights, the idea seemed to be that the exercise of 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief &#8212; even of core elements of this human right &#8212; would require 
</p>
<p>specific permission from the State, largely comparable to a &#8220;driver&#8217;s licence&#8221;, as one 
</p>
<p>government representative put it. Instead of confining State-imposed limitations to 
</p>
<p>minimum interference employed as a last resort, some government representatives pleaded 
</p>
<p>for broad State intervention and control measures. Such restrictive tendencies are also 
</p>
<p>reflected in Kazakh legislation, including in the Law on Religious Activity and Religious 
</p>
<p>Associations, which entered into force on 11 October 2011. Adverse effects on the full 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief for everyone are evident from various reports 
</p>
<p>received.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur is convinced that no inherent antagonism exists between the 
</p>
<p>human right to freedom and the State&#8217;s responsibility to provide domestic peace or stability, 
</p>
<p>which obviously constitutes a big challenge in the broader Central Asian region. By 
</p>
<p>demonstrating full respect for human rights, including freedom of religion or belief, the 
</p>
<p>State can actually enhance its credibility as a guarantor of peace based on the &#8220;recognition 
</p>
<p>of the inherent dignity [&#8230;] of all members of the human family&#8221;, to quote from the 
</p>
<p>preamble of the first-ever international human rights document, the Universal Declaration 
</p>
<p>of Human Rights (1948). Moreover, full respect for human rights provides the best 
</p>
<p>preconditions for developing trust within society and also between State institutions and the 
</p>
<p>population at large. Also when countering the scourges of religious hatred and religious 
</p>
<p>extremism, the State must always fully respect human rights, including freedom of thought, 
</p>
<p>conscience, religion or belief, which, after all, have the status of inalienable rights. 
</p>
<p>Limitations, whenever deemed necessary, must be justified in the light of the specific </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>normative rank of this human right, and must be in compliance with all the related criteria 
</p>
<p>set out in article 18 of the Covenant and in other relevant standards.1 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Required administrative permissions for religious activities  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Mandatory registration as religious association  
</b></p>
<p>24. A major issue in many discussions concerned the Law on Religious Activity and 
</p>
<p>Religious Associations. This new law, which replaces an older law of 1992, recognizes the 
</p>
<p>historic role of the Hanafi school of Islam and of Orthodox Christianity in the development 
</p>
<p>of the culture and spiritual life of Kazakhstan, while also acknowledging other religions. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, the 2011 Law established the Agency for Religious Affairs, which &#8212; as already 
</p>
<p>mentioned above &#8212; functions as the governmental body responsible for carrying out State 
</p>
<p>regulations in the area of religious activities.  
</p>
<p>25. A main feature of the Law on Religious Activity and Religious Associations is the 
</p>
<p>requirement imposed on all religious communities to re-register within a specified time 
</p>
<p>frame (i.e. one year) in order to keep or obtain the status of a registered religious 
</p>
<p>association at the national, regional or local level. While government representatives 
</p>
<p>pointed to the fact that many States practise the registration of religious organizations, 
</p>
<p>members of some religious communities or civil society organizations criticized the 2011 
</p>
<p>Law as a major source of legal insecurity and administrative repression.   
</p>
<p>26. Before entering a discussion of this issue, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
</p>
<p>reiterate that registration procedures should be based on the clear understanding that the 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of religion or belief, owing to its nature as a human right, inheres in all 
</p>
<p>human beings and can never be rendered dependent on any specific acts of State approval 
</p>
<p>or administrative registration. In other words, freedom of religion or belief cannot be 
</p>
<p>&#8220;created&#8221; by any administrative procedures. Rather, it is the other way round in that 
</p>
<p>registration should be in the service of this human right, which precedes any registration. 
</p>
<p>Following from this general understanding, registration should be an offer by the State, not 
</p>
<p>a mandatory legal requirement. In this context, the situation of non-registered religious 
</p>
<p>communities assumes the quality of an important test question about the understanding of 
</p>
<p>the normative status freedom of religion or belief in general.  
</p>
<p>27. While most religious communities in Kazakhstan have successfully &#8212; or at least 
</p>
<p>with partial success &#8212; re-registered after the enactment of the 2011 Law, some applications 
</p>
<p>have so far remained unsuccessful. Some communities lost the legal status that they had 
</p>
<p>previously possessed, whereas others had never been registered at all. There are also 
</p>
<p>examples of a few small groups (e.g. some Evangelical communities) that, as a matter of 
</p>
<p>conviction, generally refuse to register officially with the State. Other religious 
</p>
<p>communities only managed to register at local levels, while failing to obtain registration 
</p>
<p>status at regional and national levels. The predominant reason is the rather high threshold 
</p>
<p>required for registration at the national level.  
</p>
<p>28. A main problem concerning the administration of religious registration is that non-
</p>
<p>registered religious groups can hardly exercise any collective religious functions in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 The limitations must comply with article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Racial Discrimination  and article 18, paragraph 3; and article 19, paragraph 3; and article 
</p>
<p>20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Security Council resolution 1624, 
</p>
<p>as well as various related Human Rights Council and General Assembly resolutions,  and the 
</p>
<p>jurisprudence of the treaty bodies.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Kazakhstan. Any of their activities, even the common performance of prayers and rituals in 
</p>
<p>private homes, are deemed illegal and can incur serious administrative sanctions. Such 
</p>
<p>punitive actions are actually carried out in practice, sometimes leading to substantial fines, 
</p>
<p>imposed under articles 374-1 and 375 of the Administrative Code and disproportionately 
</p>
<p>affecting non-traditional communities. The Special Rapporteur also heard credible stories 
</p>
<p>about police raids of the premises of some non-registered groups, leading to confiscation of 
</p>
<p>literature, computers, mobile phones and other property. It should be noted that registration 
</p>
<p>under the Law of Public Associations does not present a viable alternative for those 
</p>
<p>communities which failed re-registration under the Law on Religious Activity and 
</p>
<p>Religious Associations, because the status of a (secular) public association, which is much 
</p>
<p>easier to obtain than registration as a religious association, does not allow associations to 
</p>
<p>carry out religious functions. Thus, non-registered religious communities and their 
</p>
<p>members suffer from serious infringements of their freedom of religion or belief. They live 
</p>
<p>in a situation of increased vulnerability to intimidation by law-enforcement agencies and in 
</p>
<p>permanent fear of sanctions.  
</p>
<p>29. The Law on Religious Activity and Religious Associations also hampers religious 
</p>
<p>activities of communities whose registration status is legally confined to a certain territory. 
</p>
<p>Given the high threshold for national registration, only Sunni Islam, the Russian Orthodox 
</p>
<p>Church and the Catholic Church to date possess the status of religious associations for the 
</p>
<p>whole country, while other re-registered communities have merely met the thresholds for 
</p>
<p>local and/or regional registration. This means that their community practice is legally 
</p>
<p>confined to certain territorial boundaries within the country. When practising their religion 
</p>
<p>outside of those territorial boundaries, they might confront legal problems, including 
</p>
<p>administrative sanctions. The likelihood of incurring punitive sanctions in practice seems to 
</p>
<p>differ according to the general reputation that a religious community has in society. Here 
</p>
<p>again, the difference between traditional and non-traditional religions comes into play. 
</p>
<p>While traditional religious communities can by and large function without any problems, 
</p>
<p>non-traditional and small communities bear a considerably higher risk of being sanctioned 
</p>
<p>when stepping outside their defined territorial boundaries. The Special Rapporteur would 
</p>
<p>like to underline that even members of minorities who described their general relationships 
</p>
<p>with State agencies as &#8220;constructive&#8221; complained about the lack of legal clarity and 
</p>
<p>concomitant chilling effects on their religious community life.  
</p>
<p>30. One purpose of the Law on Religious Activity and Religious Associations 
</p>
<p>apparently was to have clear oversight over the religious landscape in Kazakhstan. Indeed, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur was told that the country currently accommodated 18 religions or 
</p>
<p>denominations. However, it seems doubtful that it is actually possible to measure the extent 
</p>
<p>of religious pluralism in the country. From the perspective of freedom of religion or belief, 
</p>
<p>what is required above all is an inclusive framework that accommodates the broad self-
</p>
<p>understanding of human beings, as individuals and in communities with others. Indeed, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur had the clear impression that religious diversity in Kazakhstan goes 
</p>
<p>beyond the 18 confessions that constitute the official religious landscape.  
</p>
<p>31. Communities belonging to the majority religion, Islam, are generally represented by 
</p>
<p>the Spiritual Administration of Muslims of Kazakhstan (SAMK). Most Muslims with 
</p>
<p>whom the Special Rapporteur had a chance to discuss the issue gave a positive assessment 
</p>
<p>of the role played by the SAMK. However, there are also some intra-Islamic minorities 
</p>
<p>who, for various reasons, insist on an independent status. For instance, the members of the 
</p>
<p>Din-Muhammad Tatar-Bashkir Mosque in Petropavl in the North Kazakhstan region would 
</p>
<p>see their specific linguistic and spiritual heritage best preserved by remaining an 
</p>
<p>independent organization outside of the SAMK. The Mosque community lodged an 
</p>
<p>application for re-registration within the time frame specified by the 2011 Law. As a result, 
</p>
<p>the community and their imam faced heavy pressure by the State to join the SAMK. 
</p>
<p>Following their refusal to do so, they were denied re-registration. On 12 September 2013, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>an Appeal Court confirmed compulsory liquidation. Although reportedly the Mosque is still 
</p>
<p>open for prayers, the community has been legally dissolved and a new imam is to be 
</p>
<p>appointed by the SAMK.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Theological criteria in registration reviews 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur was told by the Government that the reviews of applications 
</p>
<p>for registration or re-registration as religious associations are always carried out in a spirit 
</p>
<p>of scientific neutrality, without resorting to theological criteria. This would also be in line 
</p>
<p>with the self-understanding of the State as a secular State, as defined in article 1 of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution. However, the Special Rapporteur came across at least one case that clearly 
</p>
<p>deviated from this principle and that may be indicative of a broader problem. The 
</p>
<p>application filed by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community for re-registration was denied on 
</p>
<p>the basis of a review unequivocally written from the theological standpoint of Sunni Islam. 
</p>
<p>While the whole document displays religious language, the text makes reference to the 
</p>
<p>decision of the Muslim World League &#8212; which is a religious authority of Sunni Islam &#8212; to 
</p>
<p>deny Ahmadis their self-understanding as Muslims.  
</p>
<p>33. What defines the core elements of a particular religion usually remains controversial 
</p>
<p>within the various religions. Freedom of religion or belief gives space to such controversies, 
</p>
<p>as long as they do not lead to acts of discrimination, hostility or violence. Thus, religious 
</p>
<p>communities are free to peacefully distance themselves from other branches or schools of 
</p>
<p>thought deemed as deviating from the defining principles of their own faith. But it cannot 
</p>
<p>be the business of the State to enforce particular theological interpretations by measures of 
</p>
<p>administrative law. In recognition of everyone&#8217;s freedom of religion or belief, the starting 
</p>
<p>point must be the self-understanding of human beings and how they see their own beliefs.  
</p>
<p>34. Having lost their status as a religious association in the wake of the Law on 
</p>
<p>Religious Activity and Religious Associations, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, a 
</p>
<p>small group composed of a few hundred members, has factually ceased to carry out any 
</p>
<p>community functions in Kazakhstan. Meetings, if convened at all, can only take place in a 
</p>
<p>clandestine atmosphere. Members of the community live in permanent fear of possible 
</p>
<p>police raids and legal sanctions. Apart from obvious flaws in the review of their 
</p>
<p>application, the situation of this small community is also indicative of the adverse 
</p>
<p>consequence of mandatory registration in general, thus pointing to a clear need for  
</p>
<p>overhaul.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Registration of missionary activities   
</b></p>
<p>35. Individuals &#8212; including citizens of Kazakhstan &#8212; who carry out religious functions 
</p>
<p>with some degree of public visibility are requested under the Law on Religious Activity and 
</p>
<p>Religious Associations to register as &#8220;missionaries&#8221;. Failure to do so is an offence 
</p>
<p>punishable by law. As registration of missionary activities is only valid for one year, it 
</p>
<p>needs to be renewed annually. Moreover, the precise meaning of &#8220;missionary activities&#8221; 
</p>
<p>does not seem to be clearly defined, and the administrative practice appears to lack 
</p>
<p>consistency. While representatives of traditional religious communities in practice can 
</p>
<p>largely carry out religious functions without specific missionary permits, members of 
</p>
<p>smaller groups have actually been sanctioned for merely talking about their faith or 
</p>
<p>answering questions in public. At times, the term &#8220;missionary activities&#8221; is reportedly used 
</p>
<p>in such a broad way as to cover almost all forms of bearing witness and communicating 
</p>
<p>about issues of faith. Lack of legal clarity in this important field apparently creates a sense  
</p>
<p>of insecurity and of being held &#8220;in limbo&#8221;, as one interlocutor from a religious minority 
</p>
<p>community expressed it. These provisions inter alia affect the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses who, as </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>part of their faith, feel obliged to share their beliefs with others. Again the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur would like to emphasize that concerns about the restrictive implications of 
</p>
<p>registration requirements were voiced by members of different communities, including 
</p>
<p>communities who said that they entertained constructive relationships with local, regional 
</p>
<p>or national Government institutions and participated in interreligious council meetings 
</p>
<p>convened under the auspices of the Agency for Religious Affairs.  
</p>
<p>36. According to international standards, freedom of religion or belief unequivocally 
</p>
<p>includes the right to bear witness to one&#8217;s conviction, to communicate within and across 
</p>
<p>religious and denominational boundaries and to try to persuade others non-coercively. This 
</p>
<p>also covers missionary activities in the broadest sense. Leaving aside the more specific visa 
</p>
<p>questions concerning non-citizens wishing to enter a country from abroad, such activities 
</p>
<p>generally do not presuppose a formal State approval, in particular when carried out by 
</p>
<p>citizens or permanent residents of a country.  
</p>
<p>37. The legal and practical problems in connection with mandatory registration are 
</p>
<p>further exacerbated by the fact that all sorts of manifestations of one&#8217;s belief are often 
</p>
<p>subsumed under the heading of &#8220;missionary activities&#8221;. Legal insecurity thus seriously 
</p>
<p>hampers a very broad area of religious practices, in particular for members of &#8220;non-
</p>
<p>traditional&#8221; religious minorities. Moreover, even those individuals who possess a permit as 
</p>
<p>missionaries may encounter problems when moving beyond the territorial boundaries 
</p>
<p>within which their community has obtained registration status. As mentioned previously, 
</p>
<p>only Sunni Muslims, the Russian Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church have national 
</p>
<p>registration, while all other communities are officially recognized only in particular local or 
</p>
<p>regional territories, outside of which any visible and community activities may be treated as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;illegal&#8221; under the Law on Religious Activity and Religious Associations. Another problem 
</p>
<p>occurs when the renewal of a permit takes time, adding yet another factor of legal 
</p>
<p>insecurity during the waiting period. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Importation and distribution of religious literature  
</b></p>
<p>38. A related issue concerns the import of religious literature, for which, again, State 
</p>
<p>approval is required as soon as the imported material exceeds the threshold for mere 
</p>
<p>personal use (i.e. three copies of a book). According to the Agency for Religious Affairs, in 
</p>
<p>the vast majority of cases such approval is given without any problem. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was told by the Government that the main reason for State interference in this 
</p>
<p>field is the prevention of religious hatred and religious extremism. Although he shares the 
</p>
<p>view that religious hatred and religious extremism are serious problems that require State 
</p>
<p>action, the question remains as to whether the measures taken satisfy the criteria set out in 
</p>
<p>article 18, paragraph 3, of the Covenant and other relevant international standards. Having 
</p>
<p>heard a number of examples from different religious communities who had encountered 
</p>
<p>problems in importing and distributing religious literatures, the Special Rapporteur is 
</p>
<p>convinced that the restrictions imposed on the importation of such literature in Kazakhstan 
</p>
<p>are disproportionate. For example, in 2012 and 2013, Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses submitted an 
</p>
<p>application for importing several religious publications, including some monthly magazines 
</p>
<p>produced by their community. Reportedly, the Agency for Religious Affairs banned the 
</p>
<p>importation of some of those publications. In its decision of 31 January 2013, the Agency 
</p>
<p>claimed that the banned publications discouraged secular education, encouraged family 
</p>
<p>break-ups and contained positions that might outrage members of traditional Christian 
</p>
<p>denominations (e.g. the position that the Holy Trinity is not mentioned in the Bible). The 
</p>
<p>Agency directed Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses to modify the content of the publications and submit 
</p>
<p>the modified editions for approval.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>39. Shops that sell religious literature also need a special licence. According to 
</p>
<p>information provided by the Agency for Religious Affairs, the number of shops permitted 
</p>
<p>to distribute religious literature is above 250 nationwide, and applications for a licence are 
</p>
<p>generally given without any problem. Whereas government representatives argued that in 
</p>
<p>practice religious communities do not encounter serious problems in receiving the literature 
</p>
<p>they need, the very requirement of a special licence nonetheless reflects an understanding in 
</p>
<p>which the relationship between a fundamental right to freedom and its limitations is turned 
</p>
<p>upside down. Instead of starting from the understanding that freedom of religion or belief 
</p>
<p>has the status of a human right against which limitations need to be concretely justified in 
</p>
<p>line with the criteria defined in article 18, paragraph 3, of the Covenant, in Kazakhstan 
</p>
<p>those wishing to exercise their freedom to use, import or distribute religious literature are 
</p>
<p>requested to apply for special permission from the State. This is not in line with 
</p>
<p>international standards of freedom of religion or belief. The restrictive provisions 
</p>
<p>furthermore violate freedom of expression, as enshrined in article 19 of the Covenant.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Obstacles to religious charity work  
</b></p>
<p>40. Representatives of religious communities also mentioned problems that they 
</p>
<p>encounter when trying to organize charity work. This may be based on a restrictive 
</p>
<p>understanding of religion or belief being chiefly associated with religious worship and 
</p>
<p>ceremonies in a narrow sense. However, many believers and religious organizations see 
</p>
<p>themselves called upon to offer charity services for their own communities and outside 
</p>
<p>them. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that the right to manifest one&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>religion or belief, according to article 18, paragraph 3, of the Covenant, relates to &#8220;practice&#8221; 
</p>
<p>in a wide sense, therefore also covering charity work. Moreover, article 6 (b) of the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on 
</p>
<p>Religion or Belief (1981) clarifies that freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief 
</p>
<p>inter alia includes the right &#8220;to establish and maintain appropriate charitable or 
</p>
<p>humanitarian institutions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Combating religious hatred and religious extremism  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Combating religious hatred that constitutes incitement 
</b></p>
<p><b>to discrimination, hostility or violence  
</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the Government&#8217;s efforts to counter religious 
</p>
<p>hatred, intolerance and extremism. Indeed, the stability of Kazakhstan, in particular when 
</p>
<p>compared with volatile situations in some neighbouring countries that are torn by violent 
</p>
<p>religious conflicts, is a precious asset that deserves to be preserved and further developed. 
</p>
<p>In talks with different stakeholders, including civil society organizations, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur sensed that there was broad agreement on the need to remain on the alert and 
</p>
<p>take appropriate political action in this area.  
</p>
<p>42. During some of the discussions held with government representatives, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur exchanged views on the Rabat Plan of Action on the prohibition of advocacy of 
</p>
<p>national, racial and religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or 
</p>
<p>violence, enacted in October 2012 under the auspices of the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights.2 The Rabat Plan of Action has received broad public 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 A/HRC/22/17/Add.4, appendix. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>approval in the international community, including by Kazakhstan. As the document&#8217;s title 
</p>
<p>indicates, it deals with measures to be taken by governments and other stakeholders against 
</p>
<p>hateful acts of incitement. While requesting States to take a wide range of activities in this 
</p>
<p>area, the Rabat Plan of Action at the same time defines a high threshold for restrictive legal 
</p>
<p>measures, with a view to fully ensuring freedom of expression and other communicative 
</p>
<p>rights. A key message contained in the Rabat Plan of Action is the call to make creative use 
</p>
<p>of freedom of expression in order to counter &#8220;hate speech&#8221; by &#8220;positive speech&#8221; and to 
</p>
<p>challenge entrepreneurs of hatred by means of communicative outreach. Those responsible 
</p>
<p>in governments, religious communities, civil society organizations, media and other 
</p>
<p>organizations should jointly and clearly speak out against incitement to hatred and publicly 
</p>
<p>show solidarity with targeted groups.  
</p>
<p>43. Kazakhstan&#8217;s commitment to interreligious dialogue coincides with some key 
</p>
<p>recommendations contained in the Rabat Plan of Action. As mentioned earlier, the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s engagement in this area comprises both domestic efforts to bring religious 
</p>
<p>communities together and to hold gatherings of religious leaders, which Kazakhstan has 
</p>
<p>already convened four times. The Fifth Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional 
</p>
<p>Religions is scheduled to take place in 2015 in Astana.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Lack of clear definition of criminal offences  
</b></p>
<p>44. When combating religious hatred, Kazakhstan also resorts to criminal sanctions. In 
</p>
<p>this regard, human rights problems arise from the overly broad terminology used in some 
</p>
<p>articles of the Law on Countering Extremism, the Criminal Code and the Code of 
</p>
<p>Administrative Offences. As the Special Rapporteur learned after the visit, the currently 
</p>
<p>still valid Criminal Code, as well as the currently still valid Code on Administrative 
</p>
<p>Offences, will soon be replaced by a new Criminal Code and a new Code on Administrative 
</p>
<p>Offences, respectively, which were both adopted in July 2014 and will enter into force on 
</p>
<p>1 January 2015. During the visit, upcoming reforms, which were discussed with a number 
</p>
<p>of government representatives, seemed to offer an opportunity to create substantial 
</p>
<p>improvements and aim for more clarity. Having seen the new Criminal Code and the new 
</p>
<p>Code on Administrative Offences, however, the Special Rapporteur feels that this particular 
</p>
<p>opportunity has been missed, which came as a disappointment. He hopes that amendments 
</p>
<p>needed to bring legislation more into line with international standards can still be made.  
</p>
<p>45. The Criminal Code (both its currently valid version and the new Code) imposes 
</p>
<p>sanctions on individuals &#8212; with penalties ranging from substantial fines to imprisonment 
</p>
<p>of up to seven years &#8212; for crimes of extremism, including incitement to religious enmity or 
</p>
<p>strife, insulting the religious feelings of citizens, making propaganda of the superiority or 
</p>
<p>inferiority of individuals based on their religion;3 for establishing, participating in or 
</p>
<p>leading an illegal religious organization who engage in violence against citizens or cause 
</p>
<p>harm to their health, or in encouraging citizens to refuse to fulfil their civic duties; for 
</p>
<p>establishing, participating in or leading a religious party or civic organization that 
</p>
<p>propagates or practises religious intolerance or superiority;4 and for organizing and 
</p>
<p>participating in activities of an organization that was banned or liquidated by the decision 
</p>
<p>of the court in connection with extremism.5  
</p>
<p>46. Many of these provisions remain merely vaguely circumscribed rather than being 
</p>
<p>clearly defined. Perhaps the most obvious example is article 164 of the current Criminal 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 Article 164 of the 1997 Criminal Code and article 174 of the 2014 Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p> 4 Article 337 of the 1997 Criminal Code and article 404 of the 2014 Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p> 5 Article 337-1 of the 1997 Criminal Code and article 404 of the 2014 Criminal Code. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>Code (article 174 of the new Criminal Code). This article combines the offence &#8220;incitement 
</p>
<p>to religious enmity&#8221; with a number of other phenomena such as &#8220;insult to religious 
</p>
<p>feelings&#8221;. Given the broad formulation, even exclusivity or superiority claims made on 
</p>
<p>behalf of certain religions might arguably fall within the remit of this article. As a result of 
</p>
<p>broadly circumscribed offences, however, any sort of unwelcome religious claims deemed 
</p>
<p>offensive to parts of the society or to government agencies could be penalized by sanctions, 
</p>
<p>including imprisonment. This leads to legal insecurity with concomitant adverse 
</p>
<p>repercussions on freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief.  
</p>
<p>47. The risk of being sanctioned is not merely hypothetical. Article 164 of the Criminal 
</p>
<p>Code has been used in practice, and a number of individuals sentenced under this provision 
</p>
<p>are currently serving prison terms. In discussions with civil society organizations working 
</p>
<p>in this area, the Special Rapporteur heard worrisome stories about allegations raised against 
</p>
<p>members of different religious communities, sometimes leading to interrogation, 
</p>
<p>administrative detention and very long pre-trial detention. Without being able to assess all 
</p>
<p>individual cases brought to his attention, the Special Rapporteur is convinced that article 
</p>
<p>164 of the current Criminal Code, owing to an overly broad circumscription of offences, is 
</p>
<p>a source for concern. From the specific angle of his mandate, he would therefore concur 
</p>
<p>with the March 2014 recommendation on this issue by the United Nations Committee on 
</p>
<p>the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in its concluding observations on Kazakhstan&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>State report. The Committee recommends &#8220;that the State party clearly define criminal 
</p>
<p>offences, in particular those in article 164 of the Criminal Code, so as to ensure that they do 
</p>
<p>not result in unnecessary or disproportionate interference with freedom of expression, 
</p>
<p>including that of minority communities&#8221;.6 This recommendation would still be valid for the 
</p>
<p>new Criminal Code, and for article 174 in particular.   
</p>
<p>48. Article 337-1 of the current Criminal Code (article 404 of the new Criminal Code), 
</p>
<p>which deals with associations accused of inciting extremism, including religious 
</p>
<p>extremism, poses a similar problem to article 164. There is again no doubt that the 
</p>
<p>Government has to take an active role in fighting religious extremism, in particular 
</p>
<p>organized religious extremism, and that the Criminal Code can be one of the various 
</p>
<p>instruments used for that purpose. However, what is missing above all in article 337-1 of 
</p>
<p>the Criminal Code (and its new equivalent) is a clear definition of the term &#8220;religious 
</p>
<p>extremism&#8221;. Without such a definition, the provision can open the floodgates for punitive 
</p>
<p>measures against individuals or groups deemed suspicious by some government 
</p>
<p>institutions, including law-enforcement agencies. Again, this danger is not merely 
</p>
<p>hypothetical. 
</p>
<p>49. On 18 February 2005, Kazakhstan passed the Law on Countering Extremism, which 
</p>
<p>sets forth inter alia the definition of religious extremism and measures to prevent it. The 
</p>
<p>law defines religious extremism as incitement to religious enmity or strife, including in 
</p>
<p>connection with violence or encouragement to violence, as well as the use of any religious 
</p>
<p>practice threatening the safety, life, health, morals, or rights and freedoms of citizens.7 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, it defines extremist propaganda [religious] as intentional actions aimed at 
</p>
<p>inciting religious strife or at insulting the religious feelings of citizens. The law authorizes 
</p>
<p>and instructs the Agency for Religious Affairs and local and district executive bodies to 
</p>
<p>monitor and take preventive measures against activities of missionaries and religious 
</p>
<p>associations that violate the Law on Countering Extremism.8 The Special Rapporteur is 
</p>
<p>concerned that the definitions of &#8220;religious extremism&#8221; in Kazakhstan&#8217;s Law on Countering 
</p>
<p>Extremism is overly broad and vague, allowing for arbitrariness in its application. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 CERD/C/KAZ/CO/6-7, para. 13. 
</p>
<p> 7 Article 1 of the Low on Countering Extremism.  
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>50. Similarly, the old and new Codes of Administrative Offences sanction individuals 
</p>
<p>with penalties ranging from substantial fines to imprisonment for publication, possession, 
</p>
<p>importation, transportation and distribution of materials aiming to incite religious strife;9 for 
</p>
<p>leading, financing and participating in activities of non-registered, suspended or banned 
</p>
<p>religious organizations;10 for violating the legislation on religious activities and religious 
</p>
<p>organizations, including failing to comply with the requirements for conducting religious 
</p>
<p>rites, ceremonies and meetings, importing, publishing and/or disseminating religious 
</p>
<p>literature, as well as constructing religious buildings; carrying out missionary activities 
</p>
<p>without registration (permission); for the leadership of a religious organization by a 
</p>
<p>foreigner, without consent from the administration; and for the participation of juveniles in 
</p>
<p>the activities of a religious organization without the consent of both parents.11 The Codes of 
</p>
<p>Administrative Offences also sanction the religious organizations with a range of penalties 
</p>
<p>including fines, suspension of activities and complete ban on the organization for violating 
</p>
<p>the legislation on religious activities and religious organizations, including failing to 
</p>
<p>comply with the financial or safety regulations.12 
</p>
<p>51. When discussing the issue of criminal and/or administrative trials, a number of civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations complained about a lack a transparency and fairness in procedures. 
</p>
<p>They reported that it was not easy for defendants and their lawyers to obtain the important 
</p>
<p>documents on which the allegations were based. The Special Rapporteur also heard about 
</p>
<p>cases of long administrative detention or pretrial detention and unacceptable conditions of 
</p>
<p>imprisonment. Concerns were also raised that psychiatric treatment was being used to 
</p>
<p>discipline, control and punish people suspected of holding and propagating what were 
</p>
<p>deemed to be dangerous religious beliefs. This state of affairs further exacerbates the 
</p>
<p>chilling effects that unclear penal law provisions have on freedom of expression and 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Educational efforts inside and outside of schools 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Differentiation between religious instruction and information 
</b></p>
<p><b>about religion 
</b></p>
<p>52. In discussions on educational matters, mention was made of the Toledo Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles on Teaching about Religions and Beliefs in Public Schools, elaborated by the 
</p>
<p>Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.13 The Toledo Guiding Principles 
</p>
<p>clearly differentiate between education to acquaint students with their own religious 
</p>
<p>traditions and education to broaden students&#8217; general knowledge about religions. While the 
</p>
<p>first type can be termed &#8220;religious instruction&#8221;, the second can be called &#8220;information about 
</p>
<p>religion&#8221;. And whereas &#8220;religious instruction&#8221; is based on the tenets of a particular faith, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;information about religions&#8221; should be given in the spirit of neutrality and impartiality. 
</p>
<p>Mixing or conflating both forms of education can lead to serious infringements of freedom 
</p>
<p>of religion or belief, particularly in the context of mandatory school education.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 Articles 343 and 344 of the 2001 Code on Administrative Offences and article 453 of the 2014 Code 
</p>
<p>on Administrative Offences.  
</p>
<p> 10 Article 374-1 of the 2001 Code on Administrative Offences and article 489 of the 2014 Code on 
</p>
<p>Administrative Offences. 
</p>
<p> 11 Ibid.  
</p>
<p> 12 Ibid. 
</p>
<p> 13 The Toledo Guiding Principles, published in 2007, were drawn up by the Organization for Security 
</p>
<p>and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights Advisory 
</p>
<p>Council of Experts on Freedom of Religion or Belief.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>53. Owing to the secular nature of public schools in Kazakhstan, the curriculum merely 
</p>
<p>provides for information about religions, not for religious instructions on the tenets of a 
</p>
<p>particular faith. Familiarizing the younger generation with their specific religious traditions 
</p>
<p>is thus left entirely to the religious communities themselves.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Religious information as part of the school curriculum 
</b></p>
<p>54. As previously mentioned, Kazakhstan subscribes to a strict understanding of 
</p>
<p>secularism, which is also reflected in the school curriculum. The Ministry of Education 
</p>
<p>introduced religious studies &#8212; in terms of information about religions &#8212; only a few years 
</p>
<p>ago. At present, this particular subject is taught for one year only, in grade 9. The Ministry 
</p>
<p>currently does not intend to extend this tuition period. When discussing the situation in 
</p>
<p>schools with teachers of this subject, the Special Rapporteur learned that the subject 
</p>
<p>appears to meet with great interest from students who are curious to learn more about 
</p>
<p>religions. The class generally takes place within the premises of schools and, according to 
</p>
<p>information received, does not include visits of places of worship or religious sites located 
</p>
<p>in the vicinity of the schools.  
</p>
<p>55. The textbook used for informing grade 9 students by and large covers the different 
</p>
<p>world religions in a spirit of neutrality. However, the chapter on &#8220;new religious 
</p>
<p>movements&#8221; assumes a warning tone, with the obvious purpose of alerting students to the 
</p>
<p>dangers of seduction or manipulation associated with this particular type of religious 
</p>
<p>movements. The chapter does not refer to any individual groups.  
</p>
<p>56. While the dangers discussed in the textbooks certainly exist, they should not be 
</p>
<p>associated with one particular type of religions, for instance &#8220;new religious movements&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>The history of religions unfortunately includes countless examples of force, coercion and 
</p>
<p>manipulation perpetrated by traditional or new religions, by big or small communities, by 
</p>
<p>organized groups, as well as by less organized movements. Associating &#8220;destructive&#8221; 
</p>
<p>tendencies merely with one type of religions may reinforce prejudices against small groups 
</p>
<p>often branded as &#8220;sects&#8221;. On a closer look, this type of small groups and new religious 
</p>
<p>movements comprises a broad variety of different religions and beliefs that deserve to be 
</p>
<p>addressed according to their distinctive features. 
</p>
<p>57. When visiting Karaganda, the Special Rapporteur discussed programmes of learning 
</p>
<p>about history, including the history of repression under totalitarian rule. He learned that 
</p>
<p>during the Soviet era numerous political critics and dissenters had been exiled in Karaganda 
</p>
<p>and many of them had been held in concentration camps. He held in-depth discussions on 
</p>
<p>the significance of learning about history in broader programmes of human rights education 
</p>
<p>within and outside schools. Such human rights education should cover the full range of 
</p>
<p>human rights, including freedom of religion or belief.  
</p>
<p><b> C. The p</b>roblem of &#8220;anti<b>-</b>sect&#8221; campaigns<b> 
</b></p>
<p>58. Members of small religious communities repeatedly raised concerns about &#8220;anti-
</p>
<p>sect&#8221; campaigns organized by municipal &#8220;anti-sect centres&#8221;. There seems to be a 
</p>
<p>widespread fear in society that certain religious communities, in particular small and less 
</p>
<p>traditional communities, pose a threat to people&#8217;s health and well-being. In many cases, 
</p>
<p>such fears are not based on any clear empirical evidence. The Special Rapporteur saw a few 
</p>
<p>examples of leaflets targeting certain communities, which did not contain any reliable facts.  
</p>
<p>59. Under freedom of religion or belief, Governments have a responsibility to eliminate 
</p>
<p>negative stereotypes and create a climate of mutual respect between different religious 
</p>
<p>groups. Issuing public warnings against certain communities amounts to infringing the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief of members of the targeted groups. Such measures can only be 
</p>
<p>permissible when meeting all the criteria for limiting the right to manifesting one&#8217;s religion 
</p>
<p>or belief as set out in article 18, paragraph 3, of the Covenant, including the principle of 
</p>
<p>proportionality. Moreover, a high degree of empirical diligence is required in order to do 
</p>
<p>justice to the affected religious communities. The Special Rapporteur is convinced that the 
</p>
<p>examples of anti-sect material that he obtained do not meet these criteria.  
</p>
<p><b> D. </b>Promoting &#8220;religious literacy&#8221; in society<b> 
</b></p>
<p>60. Given the importance of solid religious knowledge and understanding for 
</p>
<p>overcoming negative stereotypes and for living together peacefully in a religiously 
</p>
<p>pluralistic society, programmes of religious information should go beyond school education 
</p>
<p>and also cater to the general population.   
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur met with some organizations dedicated to the promotion of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;religious literacy&#8221; in society. Some of these organizations collaborate closely with the 
</p>
<p>Agency for Religious Affairs. Their agendas vary: familiarizing people with the wealth of 
</p>
<p>religious traditions, promoting a better understanding of religious diversity, encouraging 
</p>
<p>interreligious dialogue and building resilience against religious hatred and extremism. 
</p>
<p>These purposes obviously overlap. One basic assumption explained by experts in this field 
</p>
<p>was that religious extremists, while typically claiming to present a &#8220;pure&#8221; version of their 
</p>
<p>faith, often show a very narrow-minded interpretation of religious messages. Spreading 
</p>
<p>knowledge and a deeper understanding could thus help people build resilience against 
</p>
<p>simplistic slogans. The need for promoting &#8220;religious literacy&#8221; was associated by some with 
</p>
<p>the Soviet past, which had led to a sharp decline of religious practice and knowledge in 
</p>
<p>society.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges initiatives to promote &#8220;religious literacy&#8221; in 
</p>
<p>society. It seems to him that such a positive approach is much more promising than 
</p>
<p>campaigns undertaken by anti-sect-centres, which he finds very problematic. The Toledo 
</p>
<p>Guidelines include criteria that could be used also when designing programmes of 
</p>
<p>enhancing religious literacy also beyond public schools.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Religious socialization of young people  
</b></p>
<p>63. In the absence of religious instruction, as defined in section VI.A above, the task of 
</p>
<p>familiarizing the younger generation in Kazakhstan with their own religion is left entirely to 
</p>
<p>the religious communities. Representatives of various communities explained how they 
</p>
<p>operated in this regard. Some raised concerns that the general lack of legal clarity in the 
</p>
<p>broad area of religious manifestations in the wake of the Law on Religious Activity and 
</p>
<p>Religious Associations also affected their educational efforts. The Special Rapporteur heard 
</p>
<p>about instances in which facilities for private religious education had been closed down by 
</p>
<p>the administration on charges of illegality. Apparently, one of the reasons given was that 
</p>
<p>religious communities should not use the term &#8220;school&#8221; when educating the younger 
</p>
<p>generation. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate in this context that free religious 
</p>
<p>education belongs to the core elements of freedom of religion or belief as set out in article 
</p>
<p>18 of the Covenant as well as in article 6 (e) of the Declaration on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. 
</p>
<p>64. Reportedly, under-age persons attending a religious service are legally required to 
</p>
<p>present written permission from both parents. In practice, it seems difficult for those 
</p>
<p>offering religious services to ask young people for such permissions without thereby 
</p>
<p>alienating them. This is yet another example of the legal insecurity that hampers the full </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>functioning of religious communities, in particular small and non-traditional minorities. 
</p>
<p>Representatives of religious communities, including traditional communities with generally 
</p>
<p>good relations to government agencies, expressed the wish for more legal clarity based on 
</p>
<p>the understanding that teaching and education belong to core elements of the human right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>Representatives of the Government repeatedly emphasized that Kazakhstan 
</b></p>
<p><b>had embarked on a process of rapid and far-reaching transformation. The country 
</b></p>
<p><b>aspires to fully using its </b>potential as a &#8220;bridge&#8221; between different ge<b>ographical and 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural areas and between international and regional organizations. Domestically, 
</b></p>
<p><b>reforms are under way, including in the law. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>heard encouraging expressions of commitment to further developing the culture of 
</b></p>
<p><b>peaceful inter-ethnic and interreligious coexistence that has largely shaped the history 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the country. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan has seen a 
</b></p>
<p><b>revitalization of religious life, inter alia embodied in the construction of impressive 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious buildings.  
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The Agency for Religious Affairs, which was established in 2011 as a central 
</b></p>
<p><b>governmental body responsible for carrying out State regulation of religious affairs in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the country, plays an active role in managing religious diversity both  nationally and 
</b></p>
<p><b>regionally. Much of its activity, such as the facilitation of interreligious gatherings, 
</b></p>
<p><b>meets with the approval of many representatives of religious communities, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>minority communities. At the same time, the 2011 Law on Religious Activity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Religious Associations shows restrictive features that are not in line with international 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards of freedom of religion or belief. The most obvious problem concerns the 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandatory status of official registration. Failure to obtain this status means that a 
</b></p>
<p>religious community is deemed &#8220;illegal&#8221;, which has far<b>-reaching negative 
</b></p>
<p><b>repercussions on the enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief. Moreover, even those 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities which are registered suffer to some extent from legal insecurity, inter 
</b></p>
<p><b>alia due to the official confinement of permitted religious activities to certain 
</b></p>
<p><b>predefined issues and territorial boundaries. In general, the 2011 Law is based on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>assumption that the exercise of core aspects of freedom of religion depends on specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>acts of Government approval </b>&#8212;<b> thereby turning the relationship between freedom 
</b></p>
<p><b>and limitations, as generally understood in the framework of human rights, upside 
</b></p>
<p><b>down.  
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>While Kazakhstan has broadly embraced religious pluralism, members of non-
</b></p>
<p><b>tra</b>ditional small religious communities, frequently branded as &#8220;sects&#8221;, continue to 
</p>
<p><b>experience suspicion, mistrust and discrimination in society. Moreover, some 
</b></p>
<p><b>provisions of the Criminal Code and of the Code on Administrative Offences </b>&#8212;<b> both 
</b></p>
<p><b>the existing and the new Codes </b>&#8212;<b> which are aimed at combating religious hatred or 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious extremism </b>&#8212;<b> are defined only vaguely, thus creating a climate of legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>insecurity, which is further exacerbated by shortcomings in the handling of criminal 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures, long pretrial detention and related problems. Similar problems are 
</b></p>
<p><b>associated with the 2005 Law on Countering Extremism.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>So far, information about religion plays a limited role in public school 
</b></p>
<p><b>education. The textbooks used for that purpose contain problematic language and  
</b></p>
<p><b>generally a warning tone with regard to non-traditional religious movements. Some 
</b></p>
<p>initiatives taken towards broadening &#8220;religious literacy&#8221; in society may positively 
</p>
<p><b>empower people to make up their own minds in the area of religion or belief.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>Against this background, the Special Rapporteur would like to make the 
</b></p>
<p><b>following recommendations:   
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) A public debate on the meaning of secularism in Kazakhstan should 
</b></p>
<p><b>help to overcome the currently predominant restrictive interpretation 
</b></p>
<p><b>according to which secularism serves as a tool for confining 
</b></p>
<p><b>manifestations of freedom of religion or belief to predefined strictly 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitored territorial boundaries. Based on freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p><b>for everyone, a secular constitution should provide space for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>unfolding of the existing and emerging religious pluralism in society, free 
</b></p>
<p><b>from fear and free from discrimination. The Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that the Government consider amending the relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>provisions of the Constitution to bring them into line with article 18 of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In this context, 
</b></p>
<p><b>an open discussion on an inclusive understanding of secularism might 
</b></p>
<p><b>also help to overcome restrictive attitudes within the administration and 
</b></p>
<p><b>within law-enforcement agencies.   
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The Government should bring its constitutional provisions pertinent to 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of religion or belief fully into line with article 18 of the Covenant 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other relevant international human rights standards.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The Government is currently preparing the Fifth Congress of Leaders 
</b></p>
<p><b>of World and Traditional Religions. The Special Rapporteur would 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourage those in charge of organizing the event to move beyond the 
</b></p>
<p><b>confines of traditional religions and also invite representatives of other 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities. Besides the usually male leaders, women should play an 
</b></p>
<p><b>active role in the dialogue, including feminist theologians of different 
</b></p>
<p><b>denominations. This could serve as a signal to further broaden the 
</b></p>
<p><b>understanding and acceptance of diversity within society.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Above all, the Special Rapporteur would like to recommend far-
</b></p>
<p><b>reaching reforms of the 2011 Law on Religious Activity and Religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>Associations based on an understanding that registration should be in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>service of freedom of religion or belief which, due to its status as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>universal human right, inheres in all human beings, prior to </b>&#8212;<b> and 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent of </b>&#8212;<b> any specific acts of administrative approval. The most 
</b></p>
<p><b>important consequence would be that registration should be an offer, not 
</b></p>
<p><b>a mandatory requirement, for religious community practice. Non-
</b></p>
<p><b>registered communities must be able to operate free from discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>and free from fear of intimidation.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Registration of those religious communities who wish to obtain the 
</b></p>
<p><b>respective status position should be undertaken in a spirit of servicing 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of religion or belief. Procedures should be quick, transparent, 
</b></p>
<p><b>fair und without undue bureaucratic complications. Decisions on issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>regarding the status of  registrations must never reflect the standpoint of 
</b></p>
<p><b>a competing religious group.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Thresholds for registration at different levels (local, regional and 
</b></p>
<p><b>national) should be defined in such a way that minorities can fully 
</b></p>
<p><b>operate throughout the country. The requirement of registering 
</b></p>
<p><b>missionary activities, as well as the practice of licensing the importation 
</b></p>
<p><b>and distribution of religious literature, should also be generally 
</b></p>
<p><b>overhauled. Representatives of religious communities and civil society </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>organizations working in this field should be consulted throughout this 
</b></p>
<p><b>process.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) When amending the 2011 Law on Religious Activity and Religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>Associations, particular attention should also be given to the need of 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious communities to socialize the younger generation, which requires 
</b></p>
<p><b>an adequate infrastructure of educational institutions. Private religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>schools and similar institutions must be able to function freely and 
</b></p>
<p><b>without undue administrative stipulations.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Religious communities should be able to offer humanitarian or 
</b></p>
<p><b>charitable services for their followers and/or for the larger society.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Those religious or belief communities which, for whatever reasons, do 
</b></p>
<p><b>not have the status of a recognized religious community, or do not wish to 
</b></p>
<p><b>obtain this status, should have viable options to obtain an alternative 
</b></p>
<p><b>form of legal personality status that would allow them to carry out 
</b></p>
<p><b>important community functions in a suitable manner.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Overly broad definitions of offences concerning religious discord and 
</b></p>
<p><b>extremism, which may negatively impact on freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p><b>in conjunction with freedom of expression, should be replaced by clear 
</b></p>
<p><b>and narrow definitions. This concerns both the Criminal Code and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Code on Administrative Offences, as well as the 2005 Law on Countering 
</b></p>
<p><b>Extremism. After the adoption (in July 2014) of a new Criminal Code and 
</b></p>
<p><b>a new Code on Administrative Offences, reforms aimed at more clarity 
</b></p>
<p><b>are still needed. The Rabat Plan of Action (put into effect by the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in 2012) can 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide practical guidance in this regard.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) The Special Rapporteur would like to encourage the Ministry of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Education to further develop the programmes on religious information 
</b></p>
<p><b>for students, also beyond grade 9. School education plays a pivotal role in 
</b></p>
<p><b>promoting a climate of religious tolerance. The Special Rapporteur also 
</b></p>
<p><b>commends initiatives which recently have been taken for the promotion 
</b></p>
<p>of &#8220;religious literacy&#8221; in the population at large. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) The Government should discontinue anti-sect campaigns that stoke 
</b></p>
<p><b>negative stereotypes against new religious movements. Information 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided on religious beliefs and communities, in particular in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>context of school education, must be fair and precise. In this context, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur commends the Toledo Guiding Principles on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Teaching about Religions or Beliefs in Public Schools, which were drawn 
</b></p>
<p><b>up by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.   
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) The Government should further strengthen the national and regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>infrastructure of human rights protection; for instance, by establishing 
</b></p>
<p>regional offices of the Ombudsman&#8217;s institution. <b>  
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) The Special Rapporteur shares the view expressed by many 
</b></p>
<p><b>interlocutors that abiding strictly by the principles of rule of law creates 
</b></p>
<p><b>the best conditions for combating the scourges of religious hatred and 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious extremism, since a clear reliance on rule of law helps to build 
</b></p>
<p><b>trust within society and between State agencies and the population at 
</b></p>
<p><b>large.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(o) Trust-building measures are also contained in the Rabat Plan of Action. 
</b></p>
<p><b>It would be useful for the Government to broadly consult with civil </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>society organizations, media, religious communities and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders on how best to apply the Rabat Plan of Action to the specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation of Kazakhstan.  
</b></p>
