<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The 14th Annual Workshop on Regional Cooperation for the Promotion and Protection 
of Human Rights in the Asia-Pacific Region (the Workshop) was held in Bali, Republic of 
Indonesia, from 10 to 12 July 2007. It was attended by a total of 94 participants, including 
25 member States from the region, as well as representatives of subregional organizations, 
national human rights institutions, United Nations agencies and programmes, and 
non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>2. The theme selected by member States for the Workshop was Human Rights and Extreme 
Poverty. In preparation for the Workshop, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (&#8220;the Office&#8221;) invited two resource persons with expertise in human rights and 
extreme poverty, Mr. Siddiq Osmani and Mr. Rajeev Malhotra, to facilitate the thematic sessions 
and make presentations on the topic. 
</p>
<p>3. The Workshop was addressed at its opening by His Excellency the Director-General 
for Multilateral Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, 
Mr. Rezlan Ishar Jenie, and by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
Ms. Louise Arbour. Mr. Jenie reflected on the centrality of human rights to Indonesia&#8217;s national 
experience of political reform and economic development, and the evolving discussion on a 
regional human rights mechanism. The High Commissioner reviewed some of the achievements 
of the Asia-Pacific Regional Framework, commending member States for progress made in 
implementing several aspects of the four pillars of the Tehran Framework. The High 
Commissioner noted the linkage between the four pillars of regional cooperation and the 
thematic challenge of addressing extreme poverty. She highlighted the draft guidelines on human 
rights and poverty reduction strategies developed by the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights as an important tool for member States, regional bodies such as the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and civil society actors. Lastly, she encouraged efforts within 
regional organizations to develop human rights charters or mechanisms. The High Commissioner 
hailed developments such as increased networking and collaboration among national human 
rights institutions in the region, as well as progress made at subregional levels towards 
developing appropriate mechanisms for the enhanced protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  REVIEW OF THE FOUR PILLARS OF THE TEHRAN FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>4. The first session of the Workshop was dedicated to the review of progress achieved in the 
four areas identified in the Tehran Framework, namely, national human rights action plans, 
national human rights institutions, human rights education, and right to development and 
economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>5. Member States had the opportunity to make statements on their achievements, experiences 
and lessons learned under each of the four pillars. National institutions and civil society 
representatives also provided input under each topic. 
</p>
<p>6. With regard to National Action Plans (NAPs), a number of member States highlighted their 
experience with the preparation or implementation of such plans. Lessons learned included the 
importance of an inclusive and participatory process that created broad-based ownership among  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>all the relevant stakeholders, including the private sector; the importance of institutionalizing the 
plan by designating a lead agency and establishing appropriate coordination mechanisms; the 
value of decentralized approaches such as regional or State-level committees; the leadership role 
that could be played by national institutions in both formulation and implementation; the link to 
treaty reporting processes; and the importance of budget processes that could adequately ensure 
sustainability in the implementation of the NAPs. 
</p>
<p>7. Several member States made presentations on their human rights education strategies or 
action plans, as well as the institutions and laws established for such programmes. Emphasis was 
placed not only on human rights education in schools but also on target groups such as 
parliamentarians, judges, lawyers and law enforcement personnel. Linkages were drawn with 
broader empowerment strategies, such as legal awareness programmes, which can contribute 
to broader poverty reduction and social mobilization efforts. Emphasis was placed on the 
rights-based approach to education that calls for greater participation, for instance of indigenous 
communities, in the design of education programmes, as well as the importance of applied 
training that goes beyond principles and encourages behavioural change. 
</p>
<p>8. Participants reflected on their experiences with national human rights institutions and the 
wide range of activities being undertaken by such mechanisms in the region. Experiences 
covered a variety of issues such as the organization of national inquiries, dialogues, round tables 
and summits to highlight priority issues. Examples were given of strong collaboration between 
groups of national human rights institutions on common challenges, as well as capacity-building 
activities being undertaken by some institutions. It was noted by national institutions that 
effective working relations with other departments of government were of great importance. 
</p>
<p>9. In the discussion on the right to development and economic, social and cultural rights, 
themes emphasized were the importance of linking national human rights action plans with 
poverty reduction and national development strategies, and the value added of rights-based 
approaches in framing development assistance programmes. Participants noted the importance of 
addressing issues of equity in their national development strategies to acknowledge disparity 
between different areas and groups, emphasizing gender equality, anti-discrimination measures 
and the importance of empowerment of women active in economic and political life. The 
protection of cultural rights, the environment, and the rights of non-citizens, migrant workers and 
refugees and internally displaced persons were highlighted by some participants, in addition to 
the importance of combating corruption. 
</p>
<p><b>II. THEMATIC DISCUSSIONS ON HUMAN  
RIGHTS AND EXTREME POVERTY 
</b></p>
<p>10. Presentations and discussion on the second day of the meeting focused on the theme of 
Human Rights and Extreme Poverty, a topic identified through consultation with member States 
as a common priority for the region. The two expert resource persons selected to speak on the 
topic, Mr. Siddiq Osmani and Mr. Rajeev Malhotra, gave comprehensive and enlightening 
presentations as a starting point for discussion. The first presentation covered the human 
rights-based approach to poverty reduction and how it could be integrated into poverty reduction 
strategies and policymaking. The premise of the presentation was that poverty constitutes a </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>denial of human rights, and that in order to reduce poverty, the poor must be empowered, 
through strategies which focus on participation and accountability. It also covered the State&#8217;s 
obligations to respect, fulfil (which includes promote and provide) and protect human rights, as 
well as issues of progressive realization and accountability mechanisms, such as formal, 
informal, judicial and non-judicial mechanisms. 
</p><p>11. The second presentation focused on United Nations initiatives on poverty reduction 
through a human rights lens. It highlighted the document &#8220;Draft guiding principles &#8216;Extreme 
poverty and human rights: the rights of the poor&#8217;&#8221;, which is under circulation for comments with 
a view to submission to the Human Rights Council. The guiding principles underscore that 
poverty and extreme poverty are violations of human rights, promote the participation of the 
poor in all initiatives to eliminate poverty, and emphasize the indivisibility and interdependence 
of human rights, as well as the State&#8217;s obligations in combating poverty. The presentation also 
explained how United Nations human rights mechanisms, including the treaty body system, the 
special procedures and independent experts, have focused on the elimination of poverty in their 
work. 
</p>
<p>12. The presentations were followed by an active discussion on the theme of human rights and 
extreme poverty. It was acknowledged that growth strategies were not sufficient in and of 
themselves but needed to be accompanied by social and legal development. The importance of a 
global economic environment which facilitated advances in the right to development and human 
rights more broadly was also underscored. The meeting reviewed progress in debates by the task 
force on the implementation of the right to development and the Working Group on the Right to 
Development. The <i>Principles and Guidelines for a Human Rights Approach to Poverty 
Reduction Strategies</i> published by the Office, which outline guidelines for integrating specific 
human rights standards, strategies, key targets and indicators for monitoring and implementation 
of specific human rights with a direct bearing on poverty eradication, were discussed as a useful 
tool for policymakers. 
</p>
<p><b>III. THE FUTURE OF THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL FRAMEWORK:  
NEXT STEPS, ADOPTION OF THE ACTION POINTS, AND  
CLOSING OF THE WORKSHOP 
</b></p>
<p>13. Mr. Vitit Muntarbhorn gave a presentation entitled &#8220;Exploring the Window of 
Opportunities: Evolving a Framework for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 
the Asia-Pacific Region&#8221;. It emphasized the future challenges for the Asia-Pacific Regional 
Framework, taking into consideration recent initiatives by regional organizations, such as 
ASEAN, to develop subregional arrangements, reforms to the United Nations human rights 
system and human rights mainstreaming within United Nations country programming, as well as 
the expansion of the Office&#8217;s field presence in the region. This was followed by an interactive 
discussion in which many participants endorsed the concept of &#8220;workshop plus&#8221;, which would 
provide for more experimentation in the format of meetings and greater intersessional 
preparation, dialogue and follow-up. Discussions also indicated general support for greater 
contact and inclusion of regional organizations in the process. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Bali Action Points were drafted through informal consultations between member 
States in order to reflect agreed conclusions and recommendations on the way forward. The 
Action Points acknowledged the value added of thematic discussions as part of the workshops 
and recognized the important linkages between human rights and initiatives and policies for the 
elimination of extreme poverty. After discussion and some revisions, they were adopted by 
consensus on 12 July 2007. 
</p>
<p>15. It was noted that 2008 will mark the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, the fifteenth anniversary of the process of regional cooperation for the promotion 
and protection of human rights in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as the tenth anniversary of the 
Tehran Framework on Regional Technical Cooperation. It was also agreed to hold regular 
consultations of member States among Permanent Missions to the United Nations in Geneva in 
order to review progress in implementation of these action points and broader activities under the 
Regional Framework. 
</p>
<p>16. The Office was requested to produce a summary of recommendations made since the first 
annual workshop and progress made in their implementation; to prepare a directory of resource 
materials and resource persons available to assist the implementation of activities under the 
Regional Framework; and to prepare a compilation of the outcome documents of the four 
subregional workshops for judges and lawyers on the justiciability of economic, social and 
cultural rights in order to ensure effective dissemination. </p>
