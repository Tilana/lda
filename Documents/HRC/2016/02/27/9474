<p><b>IMPLEMENTATION OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 60/251  
OF 15 MARCH 2006 ENTITLED &#8220;HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL&#8221;  
</b></p>
<p><b>Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on  
the follow-up to the report of the Commission of Inquiry on Lebanon</b>&#8727;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report has been prepared pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 3/3 
of 8 December 2006 requesting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
continue to &#8220;consult with the Government of Lebanon on the report and its findings and on the 
relevant recommendations contained therein and to report to the Council at its fourth session&#8221; 
(para. 2). 
</p>
<p>2. Resolution 3/3 was adopted following the presentation by the Commission of Inquiry on 
Lebanon of its report (A/HRC/2/3) to the Human Rights Council on 1 December 2006.  The 
Commission of Inquiry on Lebanon was established by Human Rights Council resolution S-2/1 
of 11 August 2006.  
</p>
<p>3. This report describes the steps taken by the High Commissioner and her Office to 
implement resolution 3/3 of the Human Rights Council and the recommendations of the 
Commission of Inquiry as contained in its report. 
</p>
<p>4. In accordance with resolution 3/3, the High Commissioner met with the Permanent 
Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations at Geneva, on 2 February 2007, in order to 
consult on the report, its findings and recommendations.  During the meeting, the Permanent 
Representative recalled the original mandate of the Commission of Inquiry, as contained in 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>&#8727;  The present report was submitted after the deadline in order to reflect the most recent 
information available. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council resolution S-2/1, and stated that the recommendations should be 
interpreted in that light.  It was agreed that OHCHR in Geneva and the OHCHR Regional Office 
for the Middle East in Beirut would continue their course of action, as described in the 
paragraphs below.  It was also agreed that further working-level meetings would take place in 
Geneva between the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Permanent 
Mission of Lebanon.  
</p>
<p>5. Within the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva, an 
inter-branch task force was set up, in order to ensure a comprehensive and holistic approach to 
follow-up on the Commission&#8217;s recommendations.  The task force, in consultation with the 
Government of Lebanon, is examining the possibility of designing activities and projects in order 
to ensure the follow-up of specific recommendations. 
</p>
<p>6. A number of recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry pertain directly to the 
mandate of United Nations agencies or bodies other than the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights and other intergovernmental and regional bodies.  Some recommendations are 
directly addressed to specific institutions.  Consequently, letters have been sent to these 
United Nations agencies and bodies and to other intergovernmental and regional bodies by the 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, drawing their attention to the report of the 
Commission of Inquiry.  In view of the fact that a number of the recipients have ongoing 
programmes and activities closely linked to the recommendations, information on these 
programmes and their achievements is also being requested.  It is expected that, by the next 
session of the Human Rights Council, enough information will be available for the Office of the 
High Commissioner to be able to report on the activities relevant to the recommendations of the 
Commission of Inquiry that are being implemented by other agencies and bodies. 
</p>
<p>7. In Lebanon, the OHCHR Regional Office for the Middle East is initiating collaboration 
with the United Nations Resident Coordinator, the United Nations Country Team and the 
Lebanon Recovery Fund, to ensure that reconstruction and recovery efforts are conducted with 
due regard to human rights and without discrimination.  To systematize this effort, a Protection 
Working Group is being set up, with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and 
the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees as co-chairs.  It will also include members of 
civil society as well as government officials from relevant ministries.  The Protection Working 
Group will look into human rights aspects of economic and social recovery programmes, 
emphasizing a rights-based approach to health, education, housing and other rights.  It will also 
call attention to the special protection needs of vulnerable groups.  The Protection Working 
Group will discuss the report of the Commission of Inquiry and will give due consideration to its 
recommendations in developing its programmes.  It will also provide information to the High 
Commissioner on programmes and activities implemented in Lebanon.  In addition, the OHCHR 
Regional Office&#8217;s ongoing collaboration with the Lebanese Parliamentary Committee on Human 
Rights is being strengthened.  A capacity-building programme in the area of human rights law 
and international humanitarian law has been conducted, and more such trainings are being 
considered.
