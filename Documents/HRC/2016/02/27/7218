<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 28/28, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare a study, in consultation with States, 
</p>
<p>United Nations agencies and other relevant stakeholders, to be presented to the Council at 
</p>
<p>its thirtieth session, on the impact of the world drug problem on the enjoyment of human 
</p>
<p>rights, and recommendations on respect for and the protection and promotion of human 
</p>
<p>rights in the context of the world drug problem, with particular consideration for the needs 
</p>
<p>of persons affected and persons in vulnerable situations.  
</p>
<p>2. Requests for information were sent to States and other stakeholders. Submissions 
</p>
<p>were received from 24 States, 4 United Nations agencies and other international 
</p>
<p>organizations, 4 national human rights institutions and 35 non-governmental organizations.1  
</p>
<p>3. Three treaties form the core legal framework of the United Nations international 
</p>
<p>drug control regime: (a) the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 as amended by 
</p>
<p>the 1972 Protocol, which brought plants such as cannabis, the coca bush and the opium 
</p>
<p>poppy under international control; (b) the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, 
</p>
<p>which did the same for synthetic substances and precursor chemicals used in manufacturing 
</p>
<p>drugs; and (c) the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and 
</p>
<p>Psychotropic Substances of 1988, which increased the scope of international policing of the 
</p>
<p>drug trade and highlighted the connection between the drug trade and organized crime (see 
</p>
<p>art. 3 (5)). These treaties bring hundreds of illicit substances under international control, 
</p>
<p>criminalizing virtually every aspect of the unauthorized production and distribution of those 
</p>
<p>substances, although production, distribution and possession for medical and/or scientific 
</p>
<p>purposes is permitted.2 While human rights are not specifically addressed in these treaties, 
</p>
<p>the primary goal of the international drug control regime, as stated in the preamble of the 
</p>
<p>1961 Convention, is the protection of the health and welfare of humankind. 
</p>
<p>4. The International Narcotics Control Board oversees implementation of all three drug 
</p>
<p>conventions. It monitors illicit drug production and trade, as well as access to controlled 
</p>
<p>substances for scientific and medicinal purposes, and investigates States that do not comply 
</p>
<p>with treaty requirements. The Commission on Narcotic Drugs classifies narcotic and 
</p>
<p>psychotropic drugs under different levels of restriction; it also serves as a governing body 
</p>
<p>of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and approves the budget of the 
</p>
<p>Fund of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme. 
</p>
<p>5. In its resolution 69/201, the General Assembly reaffirmed that the world drug 
</p>
<p>problem must be countered in full conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and 
</p>
<p>with full respect for all human rights. By its resolution 51/12, the Commission on Narcotic 
</p>
<p>Drugs called for the promotion of human rights in implementing international drug control 
</p>
<p>treaties, and the International Narcotics Control Board has stated that human rights must be 
</p>
<p>taken into account when interpreting international drug control treaties. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
</p>
<p>physical and mental health has argued that when the international drug control regime and 
</p>
<p>international human rights law conflict, human rights obligations should prevail (see 
</p>
<p>A/65/255, para. 10).

<p><b> II. Right to health 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Access to treatment 
</b></p>
<p>6. The right to health is provided for in article 12 of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic Social and Cultural Rights. Under articles 2 (2) and 3 of the Covenant, States are 
</p>
<p>required to implement the right to health on a non-discriminatory basis, which includes 
</p>
<p>extending that right to drug users.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur on the right to health has underlined the distinction between 
</p>
<p>drug use and drug dependence. Drug dependence is a chronic, relapsing disorder that 
</p>
<p>should be medically treated using a biopsychosocial approach. Drug use is neither a 
</p>
<p>medical condition nor does it necessarily lead to drug dependence. People who use drugs 
</p>
<p>and people who are dependent on drugs possess the same right to health as everyone else, 
</p>
<p>and those rights cannot be curtailed if the use of drugs constitutes a criminal offence (see 
</p>
<p>A/65/255, para. 7). The Special Rapporteur has noted that the same standards of ethical 
</p>
<p>treatment apply to the treatment of drug dependence as to other health-related conditions, 
</p>
<p>including with regard to the right of a patient to make decisions about treatment and to 
</p>
<p>refuse treatment.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur has emphasized that health-care personnel have an 
</p>
<p>obligation to provide treatment on a non-discriminatory basis and not to stigmatize or 
</p>
<p>violate a patient&#8217;s human rights. Nevertheless, people who use drugs may be subject to 
</p>
<p>discrimination in health-care settings. People who inject drugs, for example, may have 
</p>
<p>poorer access to health care in some countries, including for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>This may be due to unjustified restrictions by health-care providers on the provision of 
</p>
<p>heath care for people who inject drugs.3 The Special Rapporteur noted that care providers 
</p>
<p>may not have adequate information or training concerning harm reduction measures (see 
</p>
<p>A/65/255, para. 46). The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended training 
</p>
<p>health workers on issues of stigma and non-discrimination, to achieve better health 
</p>
<p>outcomes.4 
</p>
<p>9. Individuals have sometimes been denied access to medical treatment on the grounds 
</p>
<p>of their prior or current drug use, where evidence does not justify denial of treatment. Such 
</p>
<p>denial has occurred on the rationale that a person&#8217;s drug use would make him or her unable 
</p>
<p>to adhere to treatment. The Special Rapporteur notes that adherence to medical treatment is 
</p>
<p>not necessarily lower among persons who use drugs, and should be assessed on an 
</p>
<p>individual basis (see A/65/255, paras 23-24).  
</p>
<p>10. Outreach programmes are useful in providing information and referral health 
</p>
<p>services to drug users in the community. Information and education programmes can 
</p>
<p>minimize harm to individuals who use drugs and encourage drug dependent persons to seek 
</p>
<p>treatment.5

<p><b> B. Harm reduction 
</b></p>
<p>11. Harm reduction interventions aim to reduce the harms associated with the use of 
</p>
<p>psychoactive drugs, without necessarily discouraging use. They include needle and syringe 
</p>
<p>programmes, prescription of substitute medications, drug-consumption rooms, promotion 
</p>
<p>of non-injecting routes for the administration of drugs, overdose prevention practices, and 
</p>
<p>outreach and education programmes (see A/65/255, para. 50). Persons who inject drugs are 
</p>
<p>at a heightened risk of contracting HIV, hepatitis B and C,6 and tuberculosis.7 
</p>
<p>12. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,8 the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child9 and the Special Rapporteur on the right to health have all determined 
</p>
<p>that a harm reduction approach is essential for persons who use drugs. WHO, UNODC and 
</p>
<p>the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) promote harm reduction for 
</p>
<p>injecting drug users.10 The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights has supported harm reduction and the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 12/27, 
</p>
<p>recognized the need for harm reduction programmes.  
</p>
<p>13. Needle and syringe programmes involve the provision of sterile injection equipment 
</p>
<p>to injecting drug users. WHO has endorsed the use of such programmes, noting that they 
</p>
<p>reduce HIV infections substantially, in a cost-effective manner, without any major negative 
</p>
<p>consequences.11 Needle and syringe programmes eliminate contaminated needles, which 
</p>
<p>reduces the risk of transmitting HIV and other blood-borne diseases such as viral hepatitis, 
</p>
<p>in particular hepatitis B and hepatitis C (see A/65/255, para. 51).12  
</p>
<p>14. Opioid substitution therapy
 13 is an evidence-based approach involving the 
</p>
<p>prescription of medications such as methadone or buprenorphine to treat opioid 
</p>
<p>dependence. Opioid substitution therapy decreases the prevalence of injecting drug use and 
</p>
<p>of sharing injecting equipment, thereby reducing the risk of contracting HIV and other 
</p>
<p>blood-borne viruses, and is effective in managing withdrawal from opioids and preventing a 
</p>
<p>relapse into drug use (see A/65/255, para. 52). WHO has recommended that all people from 
</p>
<p>key populations who are dependent on opioids be offered and be given access to opioid 
</p>
<p>substitution therapy.14 
</p>
<p>15. Drug overdoses, most of which involve opioids, are the main cause of drug-related 
</p>
<p>deaths. Opioid substitution therapy reduces the use of drugs by injection and thus of 
</p>
<p>overdosing by almost 90 per cent.
 15 The Special Rapporteur on the right to health and 
</p>
<p>WHO have highlighted that first aid training for the administration of naloxone, which

<p>counters the effects of opioid overdose, can prevent overdose-related deaths and minimize 
</p>
<p>the harm associated with drug overdose (see A/65/255, para. 54).16  
</p>
<p>16. Providing drug users with access to drug-consumption rooms can contribute to 
</p>
<p>preventing the transmission of diseases and to reducing damage to the veins, as well as 
</p>
<p>encourage users to make use of treatment and other services. Drug-consumption rooms 
</p>
<p>have contributed to reducing overdose rates and increased access to medical and social 
</p>
<p>services (see A/65/255, para. 54). 
</p>
<p>17. As of 2014, needle and syringe programmes had been implemented in 90 countries 
</p>
<p>and opioid substitution therapy was available in 80 countries.
 
However, needle and syringe 
</p>
<p>programmes have been confirmed to be absent in 68 countries where drugs are injected.
 
In 
</p>
<p>2014, it was reported that there were 88 drug-consumption rooms worldwide, of which only 
</p>
<p>two were outside of Europe, Australia and Canada.17  
</p>
<p>18. The lack of needle and syringe programmes, in particular, has a direct impact on the 
</p>
<p>spread of HIV. People who inject drugs account for approximately 10 per cent of all new 
</p>
<p>HIV infections and for up to 30 per cent of new HIV infections outside sub-Saharan Africa. 
</p>
<p>Worldwide, an estimated 12.19 million people inject drugs, of whom 1.65 million are living 
</p>
<p>with HIV.18 WHO has estimated, on the basis of data from 49 countries, that the average 
</p>
<p>risk of HIV infection is 22 times greater among people who inject drugs than among people 
</p>
<p>in the general population; in 11 of those countries, the risk is at least 50 times higher.19  
</p>
<p>19. Among the benefits associated with harm reduction programmes is the increased 
</p>
<p>entry into HIV/AIDS treatment programmes (see A/65/255, para. 57). UNODC, WHO and 
</p>
<p>UNAIDS have recommended that a comprehensive package of harm reduction services be 
</p>
<p>integrated into national AIDS programmes, both as an HIV prevention measure and to 
</p>
<p>support adherence to antiretroviral therapy services and medical follow-up for people who 
</p>
<p>use drugs.20  
</p>
<p>20. One study compared countries that comprehensively and consistently adopted 
</p>
<p>approaches based on harm reduction without punitive approaches with countries that 
</p>
<p>steadfastly resisted the harm reduction programmes and focused instead on punitive 
</p>
<p>approaches. It found that the prevalence of HIV among people who injected drugs in 
</p>
<p>Australia, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
</p>
<p>Ireland was less than 5 per cent, whereas in the Russian Federation and Thailand HIV 
</p>
<p>prevalence among people who injected drugs was over 35 per cent.21 
</p>
<p><b> C. Heath care in prison 
</b></p>
<p>21. Drug use, including by injection, has been consistently documented to occur in 
</p>
<p>prisons throughout the world. High rates of sharing injecting equipment leads to an elevated 
</p>
<p>risk of transmitting HIV in prisons. Persons in custodial settings are entitled, without 
</p>
<p>discrimination, to the same standard of health care found on the outside, including with 
</p>
<p>regard to prevention, harm reduction and antiretroviral therapy. Continuity of care is critical

<p>for those entering places of detention and who have been receiving treatment such as opioid 
</p>
<p>substitution and antiretroviral therapy or treatment for tuberculosis, as interrupting such 
</p>
<p>treatment has serious health consequences.22  
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur on the right to health has stated that if harm reduction 
</p>
<p>programmes and evidence-based treatments are made available to the general public, but 
</p>
<p>not to persons in detention, this contravenes the right to health. However, in 2014, while 
</p>
<p>opioid substitution therapy was available in 80 countries, only 43 countries provided such 
</p>
<p>therapy.He has also argued that, given the substantially higher health risks associated with 
</p>
<p>incarceration, harm reduction programmes should be implemented and drug dependent 
</p>
<p>persons should be treated so as to meet public health objectives, even if these services are 
</p>
<p>not yet available in the community (see A/65/255, para. 60). 
</p>
<p>23. Health protection measures, including harm reduction measures, are effective in 
</p>
<p>prisons and treatment programmes for people who use drugs, and are urgently needed in all 
</p>
<p>prison settings.23 Drug dependence treatment has also been noted to be highly effective in 
</p>
<p>reducing crime, as treatment and care within prisons, or as alternatives to imprisonment, 
</p>
<p>reduce rates of relapse, HIV transmission and recidivism.24  
</p>
<p><b> D. Obstacles to achieving the right to health 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur on the right to health has noted that drug users in States that 
</p>
<p>criminalize drug use may avoid seeking health care for fear that information regarding their 
</p>
<p>drug use will be shared with authorities, which could result in arrest and imprisonment, or 
</p>
<p>in treatment against their will. The use of drug registries (lists of people who use drugs) 
</p>
<p>may deter individuals from seeking treatment, especially given that violations of patient 
</p>
<p>confidentiality have been frequently documented in States that maintain such registries (see 
</p>
<p>A/65/255, para. 20, and A/64/272, para 23). 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur has observed that criminalizing drug use and possession has 
</p>
<p>led to risky forms of drug use designed to evade criminal prohibitions, which has in turn 
</p>
<p>resulted in increased health risks for drug users. Risky forms of drug use may include the 
</p>
<p>sharing of syringes and injection supplies, hurried or risky injecting and the use of drugs in 
</p>
<p>unsafe places. The preparation of drugs in a hurry, to avoid detection by law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officers, may increase the risk of overdose, vascular accidents and infections. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur has noted that criminalizing drug use and possession may lead to an increased 
</p>
<p>risk of illness, including from HIV infection, among people who use drugs (see A/65/255, 
</p>
<p>paras. 25-26). 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur has stated that these risks may be compounded by the drug 
</p>
<p>user&#8217;s reluctance, for fear of arrest, to seek health assistance in preparing and injecting 
</p>
<p>drugs. He noted that criminalizing drug use increases the risk of drugs becoming 
</p>
<p>contaminated with harmful or even deadly substances (see A/65/255, paras. 25-26). He 
</p>
<p>added that criminalizing the dissemination of information, including on safe practices 
</p>
<p>pertaining to drug use and harm reduction, is not compatible with the right to health 
</p>
<p>because it hinders individuals&#8217; ability to make informed choices about their health.25

<p>27. The Special Rapporteur has observed that some States opposed to harm reduction 
</p>
<p>measures have criminalized the carrying of needles, syringes and other drug 
</p>
<p>paraphernalia,26 in contravention of the <i>International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human 
</i></p>
<p><i>Rights</i>.27 Fear of arrest and criminal sanctions may deter individuals from participating in 
</p>
<p>needle and syringe programmes and from carrying sterile equipment, which increases the 
</p>
<p>likelihood of using unsterile equipment and transmitting diseases. Legislation penalizing 
</p>
<p>the carrying of such equipment, including by outreach workers, is a barrier to HIV 
</p>
<p>control.28 Promoting the use and supply of methadone, which is used in opioid substitution 
</p>
<p>therapy, is a criminal offence in some countries.29  
</p>
<p>28. WHO has recommended decriminalizing drug use, including injecting drug use, as 
</p>
<p>doing so could play a critical role in the implementation of its recommendations on health 
</p>
<p>sector interventions, including harm reduction and the treatment and care of people who use 
</p>
<p>drugs.30 UNAIDS too has recommended decriminalizing drug use as a means to reduce the 
</p>
<p>number of HIV infections and to treat AIDS.31 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur has identified many ways in which criminalizing drug use 
</p>
<p>and possession impedes the achievement of the right to health. He has called for the 
</p>
<p>decriminalization of drug use and possession as an important step towards fulfilling the 
</p>
<p>right to health. He has noted that decriminalizing drug use cannot be equated with 
</p>
<p>legalizing it. Decriminalization means that drug use and possession remain legally 
</p>
<p>prohibited but that criminal penalties, if they are applied at all, are minor and of a non-
</p>
<p>custodial nature. Legalization, by contrast, involves no prohibition of the relevant conduct 
</p>
<p>(see A/65/255, para. 62). 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur has noted as positive the decriminalization experience in 
</p>
<p>Portugal (see A/65/255, para. 64). In 2001, all drugs for personal use were decriminalized 
</p>
<p>and drug use was characterized as an administrative offence. This was combined with an 
</p>
<p>increased public health and social response to assist drug users. Portugal has not witnessed 
</p>
<p>a material increase in drug use; in fact, indicators for certain groups show a decrease. 
</p>
<p>Positive effects have included the destigmatization of drug users and the unburdening of the 
</p>
<p>criminal justice system.32 The International Narcotics Control Board has indicated that the 
</p>
<p>move to decriminalize drug use in Portugal was consistent with the 1988 Convention.33 In 
</p>
<p>total, 22 States have adopted decriminalization measures of one kind or another, although 
</p>
<p>not always on the grounds of promoting public health.34 The Special Rapporteur has 
</p>
<p>indicated that decriminalization should be accompanied by an expansion in drug treatment

<p>health, prevention, treatment and care, as well as on economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>strategies. Decriminalization has been called for by a number of civil society organizations 
</p>
<p>on the grounds that criminalization poses a major obstacle to public health responses to 
</p>
<p>drug users and their right to health.35 
</p>
<p><b> E. Access to essential medicines 
</b></p>
<p>31. In the preamble to the 1961 Convention, it is recognized that the medical use of 
</p>
<p>narcotic drugs is indispensable for the relief of pain and suffering. Nevertheless, millions of 
</p>
<p>people worldwide who require essential medicines for pain, drug dependency and other 
</p>
<p>health conditions find that availability is often limited or absent. The Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>the right to health noted that access to these medications is often excessively restricted for 
</p>
<p>fear that they will be diverted from legitimate medical uses to illicit purposes (see 
</p>
<p>A/65/255, para. 41).  
</p>
<p>32. Restricting access to opioids affects not only the availability of opioid substitution 
</p>
<p>therapy but also three unrelated areas where access to controlled medicines is essential: (a) 
</p>
<p>management of moderate to severe pain, including as part of palliative care for people with 
</p>
<p>life-limiting illnesses; (b) certain emergency obstetric situations; and (c) management of 
</p>
<p>epilepsy (see A/65/255, para. 42). 
</p>
<p>33. In its general comment No. 14 (2000) on the right to the highest attainable standard 
</p>
<p>of health, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights stated that ensuring 
</p>
<p>access to essential drugs, including opioids, is an essential element of the right to health and 
</p>
<p>that States must comply with this obligation regardless of resource constraints. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur has noted that access to controlled drugs is a critical part of the right to health 
</p>
<p>and recommended that States increase access to controlled essential medicines (see 
</p>
<p>A/65/255, paras. 40-47 and 76). 
</p>
<p>34. The International Narcotics Control Board has consistently found that availability of 
</p>
<p>essential controlled medicines is too limited in many countries. In its 2014 annual report, 
</p>
<p>the Board noted that approximately 5.5 billion people, or three quarters of the world&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>population, live in countries where access to medicines containing narcotic drugs is low or 
</p>
<p>non-existent and have inadequate access to treatment for moderate to severe pain. The 
</p>
<p>Board also noted that 92 per cent of the world&#8217;s morphine (an opioid) is consumed by 17 
</p>
<p>per cent of the world&#8217;s population, primarily in North America, Oceania and Western 
</p>
<p>Europe. The Board and WHO have both recognized that unnecessarily restrictive drug 
</p>
<p>control regulations and practices are a significant barrier to accessing essential controlled 
</p>
<p>medicines.36

<p><b> III. Rights related to criminal justice  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Prohibition of arbitrary arrest and detention  
</b></p>
<p>35. It has been alleged that police have sometimes targeted areas at or near drug 
</p>
<p>treatment centres to make arrests.37 These practices may be linked to how law enforcement 
</p>
<p>success is measured in efforts to counter drug use, especially where the number of arrests 
</p>
<p>for drug use has been used as an indicator of successful law enforcement activity. It has 
</p>
<p>been reported that in some countries the police obtain the health information of people who 
</p>
<p>are registered with drug dependence treatment clinics and use that information for law 
</p>
<p>enforcement purposes (see A/65/255, para. 20).38 In some countries, the police is reported 
</p>
<p>to have targeted drug users to meet arrest quotas or to have harassed users for money or, in 
</p>
<p>the case of women, sex.39  
</p>
<p>36. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has found that people who use drugs are 
</p>
<p>particularly at risk of arbitrary detention (see E/CN.4/1998/44/Add.2, paras. 81 and 97-99, 
</p>
<p>and A/HRC/27/48/Add.3, paras. 111-119). Some States reportedly provide for automatic 
</p>
<p>pretrial detention for persons arrested for drug use without examining the circumstances of 
</p>
<p>each individual case, although the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has 
</p>
<p>declared this practice to be incompatible with human rights.40
 
According to article 9 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, anyone arrested or detained on a 
</p>
<p>criminal charge shall be promptly brought before a judge, which the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee has interpreted, in paragraph 33 of its general comment No. 35 (2014) on liberty 
</p>
<p>and security of person, to mean a few days from the time of arrest, with 48 hours being 
</p>
<p>ordinarily sufficient. There have been reports of persons detained for drug-related offences 
</p>
<p>not being registered or promptly brought before a judge. In some States, an arrested person 
</p>
<p>suspected of a drug-related offence can be kept in custody without being charged for a 
</p>
<p>substantially longer time than a person detained for other offences can be.41  
</p>
<p><b> B. Prohibition of torture and other forms of ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>37. In some States, it has been reported that people who use drugs are subjected to 
</p>
<p>violence during detention, often as a means of extracting confessions or obtaining 
</p>
<p>information about other drug users or traffickers.42
 
The Special Rapporteur on torture and 
</p>
<p>other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee have noted that some law enforcement agencies have intentionally withheld 
</p>
<p>opioid substitution  therapy from drug dependent suspects in custody to extract confessions 
</p>
<p>or obtain information, a practice that they have found to constitute torture (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/22/53, para. 73, A/HRC/13/39/Add.2, para. 85, and A/68/295, para. 68). The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on torture has also found such a practice to be torture or ill treatment, in

<p>certain circumstances, even when it is carried out without the intention of obtaining 
</p>
<p>information (see A/HRC/22/53, para. 74). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to life 
</b></p>
<p>38. Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that, in 
</p>
<p>those States which have not abolished the death penalty, the sentence of death can only be 
</p>
<p>applied for the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;. The Human Rights Committee has determined that 
</p>
<p>drug-related offences do not meet the threshold of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; (see 
</p>
<p>CCPR/C/IDN/CO/1, para. 10, CCPR/CO/84/THA, para. 14, and CCPR/C/SDN/CO/3, para. 
</p>
<p>19). The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>torture, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the 
</p>
<p>Economic and Social Council, the General Assembly and the Secretary-General support 
</p>
<p>this interpretation (see A/HRC/10/44 and Corr.1, para. 66, A/HRC/4/20, paras. 51-53, and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/24/18, para. 24).43 The International Narcotics Control Board has encouraged States 
</p>
<p>that impose the death penalty to abolish it for drug-related offences (see A/HRC/27/23, 
</p>
<p>para. 31). 
</p>
<p>39. Nevertheless, it has been estimated that 33 countries or territories continue to impose 
</p>
<p>the death penalty for drug-related offences, resulting in approximately 1,000 executions 
</p>
<p>annually.44 Drug-related offences account for the majority of executions carried out in some 
</p>
<p>countries and are mandatorily punished by death in a number of States (see E/2015/49 and 
</p>
<p>Corr.1, para. 72).45  
</p>
<p>40. Human rights organizations have expressed concern about international funding and 
</p>
<p>technical assistance for drug control programmes in States that retain the death penalty for 
</p>
<p>drug-related offences.46 UNODC, which opposes the death penalty, has stated that if &#8220;a 
</p>
<p>country actively continues to apply the death penalty for drug offences, UNODC places 
</p>
<p>itself in a very vulnerable position vis-&#224;-vis its responsibility to respect human rights if it 
</p>
<p>maintains support to law enforcement units, prosecutors or courts within the criminal 
</p>
<p>justice system&#8221;. It noted that &#8220;at the very least, continued support in such circumstances can 
</p>
<p>be perceived as legitimizing government actions. If, following requests for guarantees and 
</p>
<p>high-level political intervention, executions for drug-related offences continue, UNODC 
</p>
<p>may have no choice but to employ a temporary freeze or withdrawal of support&#8221;.47 The 
</p>
<p>European Union has emphasized that actions such as legal, financial or other technical 
</p>
<p>assistance to third countries should not contribute to the use of the death penalty, and 
</p>
<p>specifically indicated that the death penalty should not be imposed for drug-related 
</p>
<p>crimes.48  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has 
</p>
<p>expressed concern about extrajudicial executions against people in the war on drugs (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/26/36/Add.1, para. 8), a concern voiced also by States and non-governmental 
</p>

<p>organizations.49 Impunity for extrajudicial killings is also a source of concern in operations 
</p>
<p>aimed at the drug trade. The Special Rapporteur on torture has criticized ineffective 
</p>
<p>investigations and relative impunity for actors alleged to have committed such human rights 
</p>
<p>violations, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has stressed the 
</p>
<p>need for accountability for gross violations of human rights (see A/HRC/11/2/Add.2, paras. 
</p>
<p>33 and 53, and A/HRC/26/36/Add.1, paras. 81, 111 and 117).50 
</p>
<p><b> D. Right to a fair trial  
</b></p>
<p>42. In some States, law enforcement responsibility for drug-related offences has been 
</p>
<p>reportedly shared with or transferred to the military, often resulting in an excessive use of 
</p>
<p>violence.51 It has been reported that people accused of drug-related offenses have been tried 
</p>
<p>before military courts or special courts that may fall short of fair trial standards.52 
</p>
<p>Concerning the trial of persons in military or special courts, the Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>has said that civilians should be tried in the ordinary courts, subject to narrowly defined 
</p>
<p>exceptional circumstances, and that the protections of the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights cannot be limited or modified because of the military or special 
</p>
<p>character of the court.53  
</p>
<p>43. In some States, it has been reported that accused persons may be given a choice 
</p>
<p>between serving a sentence after conviction or submitting to drug treatment. Bearing in 
</p>
<p>mind the right of a person to refuse treatment, this practice may be a cause for concern, in 
</p>
<p>particular given the level of coercion involved.54 Some States subject individuals to 
</p>
<p>additional penal measures unless the treatment is successful, ignoring the particular 
</p>
<p>circumstances of each individual&#8217;s condition and that treatment for drug dependence has 
</p>
<p>been characterized by medical professionals as often involving relapse on one or more 
</p>
<p>occasions or requiring several types of treatment.55 The Working Group on Arbitrary 
</p>
<p>Detention has determined that when treatment is undertaken as an alternative to 
</p>
<p>incarceration, under no circumstances may it extend beyond the period of the criminal 
</p>
<p>sentence (see A/HRC/4/40/Add.2, para. 74). 
</p>
<p>44. Some States do not allow persons convicted for drug-related offences to be 
</p>
<p>considered for suspended sentence, parole, pardon or amnesty that are available to those 
</p>
<p>convicted of different crimes.56 The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has 
</p>
<p>recommended that States amend their laws if they include provisions to that effect (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC//4/40/Add.3, para. 102 (c)).

<p>45. The focus on arresting and imprisoning drug users for possession or use small 
</p>
<p>amounts has often resulted in prolonged pretrial detention, and persons convicted of drug-
</p>
<p>related offences frequently constitute a very high percentage of total prisoners in many 
</p>
<p>countries. Mandatory sentencing and disproportionately long sentences for drug possession 
</p>
<p>or use have often resulted in sentences longer than those for serious crimes such as murder, 
</p>
<p>rape, kidnapping or bank robbery, and have contributed to overincarceration and prison 
</p>
<p>overcrowding.57 The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has called for reform to ensure 
</p>
<p>that sentences for drug-related offences are proportionate to the nature of the crime (see 
</p>
<p>E/CN.4/2003/8/Add.3, paras. 44 and 72 (a), A/HRC/4/40/Add.4, paras. 47 and 87, and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/22/44/Add.2, para. 125). The Working Group has found that overincarceration for 
</p>
<p>drug-related offences contributes significantly to prison overcrowding and that 
</p>
<p>overcrowding can call into question compliance with article 10 of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees that everyone in detention shall 
</p>
<p>be treated with humanity and respect for their dignity (see E//CN.4//2003/8/Add.3, para. 44, 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.3, para. 64, and A/HRC/4/40, paras. 59-80).  
</p>
<p><b> E. Human rights violations in compulsory detention centres 
</b></p>
<p>46. Persons who use drugs or who are suspected of using drugs may be confined in 
</p>
<p>compulsory drug detention and rehabilitation centres without trial or an evaluation of their 
</p>
<p>drug dependency, often for months or years, and frequently outside the supervision of the 
</p>
<p>criminal justice.58  
</p>
<p>47. Compulsory drug detention and rehabilitation centres, sometimes referred to as re-
</p>
<p>education through labour centres, typically subject detainees to long hours of physically 
</p>
<p>strenuous exercise, physical and verbal abuse, beatings, solitary confinement and enforced 
</p>
<p>labour, according to the Special Rapporteur on torture (see A/HRC/22/53, paras. 40-42). 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the right to health noted that these practices are not evidence-
</p>
<p>based and medical professionals who are trained to manage drug dependence are often 
</p>
<p>inaccessible. Moreover, treatment is often conducted en masse and disregarding the need 
</p>
<p>for informed consent to be given on an individual basis (see A/65/255, paras. 31-33).  
</p>
<p>48. Non-consensual experimental treatment, torture, ill-treatment and sexual violence 
</p>
<p>have also been reported at compulsory detention centres (see A/HRC/22/53, paras. 40-42). 
</p>
<p>Imposition of compulsory treatment, at the expense of not having access to opioid 
</p>
<p>substitution therapy and other harm reduction interventions, also increases the risk of 
</p>
<p>disease, particularly through HIV infection (see A/65/255, para. 36).  
</p>
<p>49. These practices have been condemned by 12 United Nations entities in a joint 
</p>
<p>statement in which they call for the closure of compulsory detention centres.59 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, compulsory drug detention centres, many of which are located in East and 
</p>
<p>South-East Asia, continue to detain approximately 235,000 people.60

<p><b> IV. Prohibition of discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>50. Different forms of discrimination may result once an individual has a criminal 
</p>
<p>record resulting from a conviction for a drug-related offence. These may include obstacles 
</p>
<p>to obtaining employment, adverse effects on the custody of children or visitation rights, 
</p>
<p>losing government benefits such as access to public housing, food assistance or student 
</p>
<p>financial aid, or difficulties concerning travel abroad.61
 
This has been a factor in the 
</p>
<p>decision by some States to decriminalize the personal use and possession of drugs.62 As 
</p>
<p>former Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on 19 May 2015 at a side event on the theme 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Strengthening a public health approach when addressing the world drug problem&#8221;: &#8220;A 
</p>
<p>criminal record for a young person for a minor drug offence can be a far greater threat to 
</p>
<p>their well-being than occasional drug use&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Ethnic minorities 
</b></p>
<p>51. It has been reported that members of ethnic minorities, in particular those who are 
</p>
<p>poor and live in marginalized communities, may be particularly subject to discrimination in 
</p>
<p>the context of drug enforcement efforts. In the United States of America, for example, 
</p>
<p>African Americans make up 13 per cent of the population, yet account for 33.7 per cent of 
</p>
<p>drug-related arrests and 37 per cent of people sent to state prisons on drug charges. African 
</p>
<p>Americans are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for possessing or using marijuana than 
</p>
<p>whites are, despite comparable usage rates. Similar disparities have been observed in 
</p>
<p>countries such as Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.63 One law enforcement 
</p>
<p>official observed that it was harder to intercept the sale and purchase of drugs in offices or 
</p>
<p>affluent neighbourhoods than it was in poor and marginalized neighbourhoods, where such 
</p>
<p>activity was often conducted in the street or other public areas and where police controls 
</p>
<p>were more frequent.64  
</p>
<p><b> B. Women 
</b></p>
<p>52. Globally, women are imprisoned for drug-related offences more than for any other 
</p>
<p>crime. In several Latin American countries, 60-80 per cent of women in prison are 
</p>
<p>incarcerated for drug-related offences.65 In some States, women convicted of drug-related 
</p>
<p>offences constitute the fastest growing part of the prison population. One in four women in 
</p>
<p>prison in Europe and Central Asia is incarcerated for drug-related offences, with levels as 
</p>
<p>high as 70 per cent in some countries. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women has expressed concern at the number of women imprisoned for drug-related 
</p>
<p>offences, observing that this may be indicative of women&#8217;s poverty (see CEDAW/C/UK/3 
</p>
<p>and 4). Women are typically involved in selling small quantities of drugs and are used as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;mules&#8221; to carry small amounts of drugs from one country to another. Many of them are

</p>
<p>53. It has been reported that women who use drugs may, depending on the laws and 
</p>
<p>policies in force, face losing custody of their children, forced or coerced sterilization, 
</p>
<p>abortion or criminal penalties for using drugs during pregnancy. In certain States, women 
</p>
<p>who use drugs may be subject to detention during their pregnancy. Women who use drugs 
</p>
<p>may not receive the appropriate care when they are pregnant.67 WHO has published 
</p>
<p>guidelines for the identification and management of substance use and related disorders 
</p>
<p>during pregnancy.  
</p>
<p>54. Discrimination may exist in women&#8217;s prisons where harm reduction, including 
</p>
<p>opium substitution therapy, may not be available.68 The Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women has recommended that States provide gender-sensitive and 
</p>
<p>evidence-based drug treatment services, including harm reduction programmes for women 
</p>
<p>in detention, to reduce the harmful effects of drug use (see CEDAW/C/GEO/CO/4-5, para. 
</p>
<p>31 (e)).It has been reported that women who use drugs are often the targets of violence, 
</p>
<p>including sexual violence, perpetrated by their partners and law enforcement officers. 
</p>
<p>Women may be forced to have sex to avoid arrest or punishment by law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officers.69 Women who use drugs and who are also sex workers are reported to be even 
</p>
<p>more vulnerable.70 
</p>
<p><b> V. Rights of the child 
</b></p>
<p>55. Article 33 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that States parties 
</p>
<p>shall take all appropriate measures to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs 
</p>
<p>and psychotropic substances as defined in the relevant international treaties, and to prevent 
</p>
<p>the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances.  
</p>
<p>56. In its general comment No. 3 (2003) on HIV/AIDS and the rights of the child, the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Rights of the Child noted that, in most countries, children have not 
</p>
<p>benefited from HIV prevention programmes related to substance use and that, where HIV 
</p>
<p>prevention programmes exist, they have largely targeted adults. It observed that injecting 
</p>
<p>practices using unsterilized instruments increase the risk of HIV transmission and that 
</p>
<p>programmes and policies aimed at reducing substance use and HIV transmission must 
</p>
<p>recognize the particular sensitivities and lifestyles of children. In its general comment No. 
</p>
<p>15 (2013) on the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
</p>
<p>health, the Committee endorsed harm reduction as an important approach to minimizing the 
</p>
<p>negative health impacts of substance abuse. It called for children to benefit from harm 
</p>
<p>reduction programmes in its concluding observations (see CRC/C/UKR/CO/4, para. 59, 
</p>
<p>CRC/C/AUT/CO/3-4, para. 51, and CRC/C/ALB/CO/2-4, para. 63 (b)). 
</p>
<p>57. The Committee has recommended that children receive accurate and objective 
</p>
<p>information on drugs. It has called for children who use drugs not to be subjected to

</p>
<p>CRC/C/OPAC/MEX/CO/1, para. 29, and CRC/C/UKR/CO/4, paras. 59-60). However, the 
</p>
<p>Committee found that, in practice, in most States children who use drugs are subject to 
</p>
<p>criminal prosecution and often have no access to harm reduction and drug treatment 
</p>
<p>services. The Committee criticized the aerial fumigation of drug crops because of its effects 
</p>
<p>on children (see CRC/C/COL/CO/3, para. 72). It also condemned the practice of placing 
</p>
<p>children in compulsory drug detention and rehabilitation centres (see CRC/C/KHM/CO/2, 
</p>
<p>paras. 55-56). 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Rights of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>58. The 1961 Convention imposes restrictions on the cultivation of coca bush, opium 
</p>
<p>poppy and cannabis plant for indigenous, traditional and religious uses, and requires that 
</p>
<p>opium smoking be abolished within 15 years, that coca leaf chewing be abolished within 25 
</p>
<p>years and that cannabis use be abolished within 25 years at the latest (art. 49 (2)). The 1988 
</p>
<p>Convention requires States to criminalize the possession, purchase and cultivation of coca 
</p>
<p>for personal consumption and to take measures to prevent the cultivation of and to eradicate 
</p>
<p>illicit crops. In doing so, States must &#8220;take due account of traditional licit uses, where there 
</p>
<p>is historic evidence of such use&#8221; (art. 14 (2)).  
</p>
<p>59. In 2009, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues called for the amendment or 
</p>
<p>repeal of those portions of the 1961 Convention regarding coca leaf chewing that are 
</p>
<p>inconsistent with the rights of indigenous peoples to maintain their traditional health and 
</p>
<p>cultural practices, as recognized in articles 11, 24 and 31 of the United Nations Declaration 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (see E/2009/43-E/C.19/2009/14, para. 89).71 In 2011, 
</p>
<p>the Plurinational State of Bolivia withdrew from the 1961 Convention, subsequently re-
</p>
<p>acceding to it with a reservation concerning the traditional practices associated with the 
</p>
<p>coca leaf.72  
</p>
<p>60. Some States have recognized exceptions to the application of the drug control 
</p>
<p>treaties, including on grounds of religious belief. In the United States, the Native American 
</p>
<p>Church is exempted from the prohibition on consuming peyote, a controlled substance, in 
</p>
<p>religious ceremonies.73 In Italy, a drug conviction was reversed on appeal because a lower 
</p>
<p>court had not considered the arguments made by the Rastafarian defendant based on his 
</p>
<p>religious convictions.74 In Jamaica, the Government in 2015 changed its legislation to allow 
</p>
<p>Rastafarians the right to use cannabis in their religious ceremonies.75 Previous 
</p>
<p>jurisprudence has tended not to permit the use of controlled drugs in religious ceremonies 
</p>
<p>as a manifestation of religious beliefs, although sometimes with sharply divided views.76  
</p>

<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>The right to health should be protected by ensuring that persons who use drugs 
</b></p>
<p><b>have access to health-related information and treatment on a non-discriminatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>basis. Harm reduction programmes, in particular opioid substitution therapy should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be available and offered to persons who are drug dependent, especially those in 
</b></p>
<p><b>prisons and other custodial settings. Consideration should be given to removing 
</b></p>
<p><b>obstacles to the right to health, including by decriminalizing the personal use and 
</b></p>
<p><b>possession of drugs; moreover, public health programmes should be increased. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to health requires better access to controlled essential medicines, especially in 
</b></p>
<p><b>developing countries.</b> 
</p>
<p>62. <b>The prohibition of arbitrary arrest and detention, torture and other forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>ill-treatment and the right to a fair trial should be protected in accordance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international norms, including in respect of persons who are arrested, detained or 
</b></p>
<p><b>charged for drug-related offences. Drug dependent persons in custodial settings 
</b></p>
<p><b>should not be denied opioid substitution therapy as a means of eliciting confessions or 
</b></p>
<p><b>other information, and opioid substitution therapy should be provided as part of a 
</b></p>
<p>detainee&#8217;s right to health in all circums<b>tances. Compulsory detention centres should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be closed. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The right to life of persons convicted of drug-related offences should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>protected and, in accordance with article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Political Rights and the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee, such persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>should not be subject to the death penalty. The right to life should be protected by law 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforcement agencies in their efforts to address drug-related crime, and only 
</b></p>
<p><b>proportional force should be used, when necessary. Extrajudicial killings should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>subject to prompt, independent and effective investigations to bring the alleged 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrators to justice. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>Ethnic minorities and women who possess or use drugs, or who are 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;<b>microdistributors</b>&#8221;<b>, should be protected against discrimination. Consideration 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be given to reforming laws and policies to address the disparate impact of drug 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies on ethnic minorities and women. Providing training to law enforcement, 
</b></p>
<p><b>health personnel and social service workers who come into contact with drug users 
</b></p>
<p><b>should also be considered, to eliminate discrimination.  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>Taking into account the severe impact that a conviction for a drug-related 
</b></p>
<p><b>offence </b>can have on a person&#8217;s life, consideration should be given to alte<b>rnatives to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecution and imprisonment of persons for minor, non-violent drug-related 
</b></p>
<p><b>offences. Reforms aimed at reducing overincarceration should take into account such 
</b></p>
<p><b>alternatives. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The rights of the child should be protected by focusing on prevention and 
</b></p>
<p><b>communicating in a child-friendly and age-appropriate manner, including on the risks 
</b></p>
<p><b>of transmitting HIV and other blood-borne viruses through injecting drug use. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Children should not be subjected to criminal prosecution, but responses should focus 
</b></p>
<p><b>on health education, treatment, including harm reduction programmes, and social re-
</b></p>
<p><b>integration.  
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>Indigenous peoples have a right to follow their traditional, cultural and 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious practices. Where drug use is part of these practices, the right of use for such 
</b></p>
<p><b>narrowly defined purposes should in principle be protected, subject to limitations 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided for in human rights law. 
</b></p>
