Update on pending 2015 Annual Results and financial restructuring update
Graphene NanoChem (AIM:GRPH), the international provider of nanotechnology performance
enhancing solutions for global industries, today provides shareholders with an update on the
delay of publishing its annual audited accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015. The
Company now anticipates publishing its annual results in September 2016.
The Group has now achieved its 2nd milestone in its restructuring programme and is in receipt of
the final draft agreement approving the restructuring from its primary financier, Malaysian Debt
Ventures Berhad ("MDV"), for the restructuring of Graphene NanoChem's short term debt of
£14.5 million ("MDV Restructuring Approval") that constitutes c.58% of the Group's total debt to
financial institutions.
The salient terms of the MDV restructuring approval include:
·     A two (2) year payment moratorium up to 31 December 2017;
·     An extended maturity date from November 2015 to December 2021; and
·     A pay down in the aggregate amount of £315,000 only in 2016 and 2017 respectively.
Execution of the agreement is anticipated in the very near term, thereby enabling completion and
finalization of the audit shortly thereafter.
The Group's 1st milestone of its debt restructuring plan with its remaining secured financiers,
Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Behad ("BPMB") and Bank Rakyat, constitutes c.48% of the total
debt to financial institutions. The planned realisation and disposal of its non-core assets namely
the fuel additive assets and the palm oil refinery, are at an advanced stage.
BPMB has appointed KPMG as receivers in the process for the disposal of the fuel additive
assets and the Group is in advanced discussions with Bank Rakyat for a common undertaking for
the sale of the palm oil refinery via a tender process.
As stated in the announcement dated July 2016, the Group had expected to publish its annual
audited accounts and the annual report during August 2016. However, this is now expected to be
published in September 2016.
