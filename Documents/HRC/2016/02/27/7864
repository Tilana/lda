<p><b> I. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 7/29 on the rights of the child, the Human Rights Council decided to 
dedicate, at a minimum, an annual full-day meeting to a discussion on different specific 
themes on the rights of the child, including the identification of challenges in the realization 
of the rights of the child. In its resolution 19/37, the Council decided to focus its next 
annual full-day meeting on the right of the child to the highest attainable standard of health. 
In the same resolution, the Council also invited the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare a report on that issue (A/HRC/22/31) and to 
present it to the Council at its twenty-second session, to inform the annual day of discussion 
on children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>2. Since the adoption of resolution 7/29, the Human Rights Council has held a number 
of thematic discussions on the rights of the child:  
</p>
<p>&#61623; &#8220;20 years of the Convention on the Rights of the Child: achievements and challenges 
for its full realization&#8221; (tenth session)  
</p>
<p>&#61623; &#8220;The fight against sexual violence against children&#8221; (thirteenth session)  
</p>
<p>&#61623; &#8220;Protection and promotion of the rights of children working and or living on the 
street&#8221; (sixteenth session)  
</p>
<p>&#61623; &#8220;Children and the administration of justice&#8221; (nineteenth session) 
</p>
<p>&#61623; &#8220;The right of the child to the highest attainable standard of health&#8221; (twenty-second 
session) 
</p>
<p>3. The annual full-day meeting on the right of the child to the highest attainable 
standard of health, held on 7 March 2013, provided a significant opportunity to discuss the 
challenges to achieving the full realization of the universal right to health. Discussions 
focused on strengthening the implementation of the right of the child to health and on 
accountability mechanisms that needed to be in place to ensure compliance of State with 
their relevant obligations. Emphasis was also placed on the social determinants of health 
and the interdependence between the right to health and other rights enshrined in the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. The full-day meeting consisted of two panels: one 
focusing on challenges to achieving the full realization of the right of the child to health; 
another on the implementation of the right of the child to health and accountability 
mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>4. The full-day meeting discussion was chaired by the President of the Human Rights 
Council. The discussions of the panel were moderated by the Editor in Chief of <i>The Lancet</i>, 
Richard Horton. Child representatives from Bolivia (Plurinational State of) and Haiti also 
participated in the annual full-day meeting. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Challenges in achieving the full realization of the right of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>child to health  
</b></p>
<p>5. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights opened the annual 
meeting. A video produced by World Vision and Save the Children, entitled &#8220;Our health, 
our rights, our voices&#8221;, was then shown. Panellists in the morning session included the 
Assistant Director-General for Family, Women and Children&#8217;s Health at the World Health 
Organization (WHO), Flavia Bustreo; the Director of the Programme on Children&#8217;s Health 
at the Ministry of Public Health of Uruguay, Gustavo Giachetto; the Secretary-General of 
Terre des Hommes International Federation, Ignacio Packer; Tama, a child representative </p>


<p>from Haiti; Jonas, a child representative from Bolivia (Plurinational State of); the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, Najat Maalla 
M&#8217;jid; and Selina Amin of Plan International Bangladesh. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Opening remarks by the High Commissioner  
</b></p>
<p>6. In her opening statement, the High Commissioner stated that the right to health was 
a universal human right recognized in international human rights instruments, including 
article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which stipulates that States must 
take measures to diminish infant and child mortality, as well as to combat disease and 
malnutrition. They must, in addition, take all appropriate measures to abolish practices that 
are harmful to children&#8217;s health. She stressed that the right of the child to health had to be 
interpreted broadly, paying attention to all other rights that might affect its realization. The 
High Commissioner stated that, in addition to the 6.9 million children around the world that 
die each year from preventable causes before they turn 5, every hour, 300 children die 
because of malnutrition, which also stunted the development of an estimated 170 million 
children worldwide. She emphasized that other areas requiring sustained and immediate 
attention included obesity, violence, injuries and accidents, substance use, and sexual and 
reproductive health. She stated that the sharp increase in mental health problems among 
adolescents was also alarming.  
</p>
<p>7. The High Commissioner stressed that a child rights-based approach to health 
emphasized the need to eliminate exclusion and reduce social disparities in health between 
different groups of children. Therefore, in order to achieve the full realization of the right of 
every child to health, States had an obligation to ensure that children&#8217;s health was not 
undermined by discrimination. Certain groups of children were disproportionately 
vulnerable, including children with disabilities and chronic illness; migrant children; 
children in street situations; children in institutions or without parental support; children 
who were victims of violence and sexual exploitation; and children living in remote or 
disadvantaged areas, or in situations of extreme poverty. The High Commissioner also 
stressed that children needed access to the tools and instruments necessary to remedy any 
violations they suffered to their rights, including their right to health. In this context, she 
welcomed the ratification by Gabon, Germany and Thailand of the third Optional Protocol 
to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure, and hoped 
that more countries would join them soon to achieve its earliest possible entry into force. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Issues addressed by panellists 
</b></p>
<p>8. The moderator pointed out that the annual day of discussion was being held after the 
High-level Dialogue on Health in the Post-2015 Development Agenda, which was held in 
Botswana from 4 to 6 March 2013. The High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-
2015 Development Agenda had agreed on key principles to guide global health in the post-
2015 era, including the urgent need to accelerate progress achieved within the framework 
of the Millennium Development Goals. The annual day of discussion on the rights of the 
child offered an opportunity to influence the post-2015 agenda with regard to the right of 
the child to health.  
</p>
<p>9. With regard to achieving further progress in reducing child mortality, Ms. Bustreo 
stated that, despite the fact that 6.9 million children died every year from preventable 
causes, there had been a significant reduction in childhood deaths, from 12 million in 1990 
to less than 7 million in 2011. This progress was testimony to the commitment made by 
States to saving the lives of young children. She however recalled that 10 per cent of all 
pregnancies in the world happened in girls under the age of 18, and 30 per cent of all </p>


<p>maternal deaths happened in this group; this was an aspect of children&#8217;s health where 
</p>
<p>success had not been achieved. Similarly, more progress needed to be made, given that the 
majority of deaths continued to be among the most disadvantaged children and young girls. 
The legally binding obligations of States arising from the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and other international instruments were still not being enacted into national 
legislation. WHO was committed to the elimination of the preventable deaths of millions of 
children, but this required action and resources. Applying a human rights-based approach 
could lead to an improvement in children&#8217;s health. 
</p>
<p>10. With regard to measures taken by Uruguay to combat non-communicable diseases 
and their impact on the realization of the right to health, Dr. Giachetto stated that Uruguay 
had taken a crosscutting approach in its health policies and had set up special programmes 
devoted to pregnant women, and to children&#8217;s and adolescents&#8217; health. It had also given 
consideration to the issue of infant mortality. Measures had been taken to promote training 
in good nutrition, and legislation had been introduced to help reduce cancer and substance 
abuse, including through a successful anti-tobacco policy and vaccination programmes for 
hepatitis B and human papilloma virus<b>.</b> Dr. Giachetto added that Uruguay addressed the 
right to health with an inclusive approach, and therefore also considered the impact of other 
social indicators on health. In particular, he emphasized the importance of the link between 
health and education. 
</p>
<p>11. Mr. Packer referred to the challenges faced by children in their access to high-
quality care. The principle of universal access to health required establishing how many 
people it would reach, how much would it cost and where to start to make it a reality. 
Achieving universal health coverage in low- and middle-income countries was possible, but 
required bold steps by Governments and the international community. The focus should be 
placed on the mother, the child and reproductive health. An essential first step was to 
remove financial barriers to health services and to abolish fees. The second step was to 
ensure robust and sustained public funding for health by both national revenues and official 
development assistance. Third, States had to invest in quality of care, therefore investing in 
each element of the health system, from information to health workers, through to primary 
and secondary health care. Evidence was against levying fees for primary health care. With 
regard to the cost of universal health coverage, there was evidence from some countries that 
a 10-per-cent increase in national health budgets resulted in increased use of services and 
improvements in child health.  
</p>
<p>12. Tama, a child representative from Haiti, stated that the right of the child to health 
was the least prioritized because more emphasis was given to other rights, such as the right 
to education. Changes in government led to changes in programmes that could have an 
impact on a child&#8217;s access to health services. She added that, in fragile States or after 
emergencies, there were never enough health centres and doctors, and the quality of health 
care was poor. She asked the Human Rights Council to pay attention to those issues in their 
discussions. 
</p>
<p>13. Jonas, a child representative from Bolivia (Plurinational State of), stated that being 
healthy allowed children to study, play and be with one&#8217;s family. The right to health was 
important, because being a human was not possible without being healthy. Many deaths 
could be prevented by timely care and reasonable costs. Health care had to be affordable 
and also provided to all, including indigenous women, the poor and uneducated and young 
people. National legislation needed to be in place to allow significant changes to be made, 
and should be developed with the participation of children, who were not only the future, 
but also the present.  
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography addressed the question of the impact of sexual exploitation on children and the 
links between the health and justice sectors. She stated that violence and sexual exploitation </p>


<p>were violations of the rights of the child that had a devastating impact on the child&#8217;s 
physical and psychological health and development. Physical consequences included 
HIV/AIDS, unwanted pregnancies, abortions and other severe complications that could 
even lead to death. Psychologically, it could lead to the loss of self-esteem, self-mutilation, 
additive behaviours and suicide. Detecting the different forms of violence and sexual 
exploitation was a challenge, as children were too ashamed to discuss such matters, and 
sometimes the aggressor was a person known to the child and the family. All medical staff 
should be trained in detecting the signs of physical and sexual abuse in children. The skills 
of medical staff should be bolstered by legislation, especially by procedures for reporting 
such incidents. The protection of child victims of violence and sexual exploitation should 
be multidisciplinary, addressing legal, psychological, social and medical aspects. Health-
care staff were essential not only in detection of sexual violence but also in reporting it to 
the authorities and in follow-up services. Perpetrators should be punished and the victims 
should be protected and provided with appropriate compensation.  
</p>
<p>15. On the question of the links between child marriage and the non-fulfilment of an 
adolescent&#8217;s right to sexual and reproductive health, Ms. Amin stated that the statistics on 
child marriage were daunting. She pointed out that, in developing countries, more than 30 
per cent of girls were married before the age of 18, and noted that, ironically, parents 
viewed marriage as an effective way of protecting their daughters from abuse. Girl 
marriage, which was a violation of the rights of the child, was often accompanied by early 
pregnancy, with major risks for both the mother and the child. The devastating 
consequences of child marriage continued to be ignored and all necessary action should be 
taken to stop this harmful practice. Health education in school was essential for the 
development of children, especially because it provided the tools necessary for children to 
make the right decisions in life. She added that children and adolescents had the right to 
age-appropriate and comprehensive information on sexuality and reproduction as part of 
health education. Comprehensive sexual education, which extended beyond information on 
biological reproduction and disease transmission, should be provided to children and 
adolescents as part of the school curriculum. 
</p>
<p>16. In summing up, the moderator emphasized four key themes that had emerged in the 
discussion: evidence; society; voice; and opportunity. He noted that gathering reliable 
evidence was critical to resolving problems. Children were at the heart of society, and the 
health of children was a barometer that measured the present and future moral and political 
commitment to a more just world. The voices of children were critical to a participatory 
process, and it was necessary to seize all opportunities to realize the right of the child to 
health.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Plenary discussion 
</b></p>
<p>17. During the interactive discussion, the delegations of Armenia, Bahrain (on behalf of 
the Group of Arab States), the Congo, the Council of Europe, Estonia, the European Union, 
Gabon (on behalf of the African Group), Germany, Haiti, Iran (Islamic Republic of) Jordan, 
Nepal, Norway, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Paraguay, Qatar, Slovenia, Sri 
Lanka, the Sudan, Sweden (on behalf of a cross-regional group), Switzerland, the Syrian 
Arab Republic, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States of 
America and Uruguay took the floor. The national human rights institutions and non-
governmental organizations that took the floor were the National Human Rights Council of 
Morocco, Human Rights Watch, Caritas International, Defence for Children International 
and World Vision International. 
</p>
<p>18. During the discussion, many delegations referred to efforts they were making at the 
national level to ensure the implementation of the right of the child to the highest attainable </p>


<p>standard of health. Member States reiterated that the realization of the right of the child to 
health was indispensable for the enjoyment of all other rights enshrined in the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, and the need for a holistic approach to the promotion of the right 
of the child to health. Reference was also made to the importance of ensuring that all 
children had equal access to quality health care without discrimination, and that inequalities 
in access to health care were often linked to more structural issues, such as inadequate 
health systems, insufficient health financing and lack of qualified human resources. 
Conflict, poverty and the lack of clean water in certain areas prevented children from 
enjoying their right to health. Child mortality, epidemics and HIV/AIDS continued to pose 
serious challenges for some countries. Several delegates raised the situation and 
vulnerability of children under foreign occupation.  
</p>
<p>19. Several speakers stated that more attention should be paid to technical assistance and 
cooperation in enhancing children&#8217;s human rights, including the right to health. Some 
delegations also expressed support for the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants 
of Health adopted at the World Conference on Social Determinants of Health on 21 
October 2011, as well as for the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on a new communications procedure. Birth registration was mentioned as an essential 
step to strengthen the rights of the child, including the right to health. The importance of 
treating children with care, sensitivity, fairness and respect throughout any health-care 
intervention was also raised. Several delegations referred to the best interests of the child as 
a primary consideration. In this context, the promotion of breastfeeding was raised. The 
essential role of the family in ensuring the well-being and protection of children was also 
emphasized.  
</p>
<p>20. Health education, and in particular sexual and reproductive health education and 
information for children and adolescents, was stressed. Reference was made to how sexual 
and reproductive rights were being neglected and breached by harmful practices, including 
female genital mutilation and child marriage. Other issues raised included technology 
advances and prenatal sex selection, the importance of awareness-raising initiatives on the 
right of the child to health, and the need for States to take appropriate measures to reduce 
child mortality. 
</p>
<p>21. Non-governmental organizations expressed concern at children&#8217;s environmental 
health, and called upon Governments to take action to prevent the exposure of children to 
toxic chemicals and to treat its impact on health. They also expressed concern with regard 
to migrant children and requested that States ensure that the best interests of the child were 
always prioritized, regardless of the migration status of the child or of his or her parents. 
Attention was also drawn to the vulnerability and special needs of children in detention and 
of children in conflict with the law. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p><b>22. The moderator summarized the key points raised and invited panellists to 
</b></p>
<p><b>respond to a number of issues, including whether universal health coverage was a 
</b></p>
<p><b>panacea; the challenges to multi-sectoral policies in dealing with access of children to 
</b></p>
<p><b>health; the role of the family and how to address opposing views expressed on issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerning sexual education; the role that national human rights institutions could 
</b></p>
<p><b>have in promoting and protecting the right of the child to health; and how the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international community could do more to support and strengthen institutions in child 
</b></p>
<p><b>health. 
</b></p>
<p><b>23. With regard to universal health coverage, Ms. Bustreo stated that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>universality of access to health services was the concept that underpinned the work of </b></p>


<p><b>WHO. The key question was how to measure universality; she emphasized that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>first step for countries was to measure when and where children were born, where 
</b></p>
<p><b>they lived and the services to which they had access. She noted that international 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations had a responsibility to share examples of good practices with States, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>referred to a concrete example from Brazil. She also stressed the importance of 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishing and facilitating knowledge networks among countries and in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>South-to-South sharing. Lastly, international organizations also had an important role 
</b></p>
<p><b>to play in capacity-building.  
</b></p>
<p><b>24. Dr. Giachetto stated that a comprehensive multi-sectoral policy was being put 
</b></p>
<p><b>in place in Uruguay in order to ensure a comprehensive, holistic approach to health, 
</b></p>
<p><b>which needed to include social determinants for the population. Health issues could 
</b></p>
<p><b>not be tackled from within the Ministry of Public Health alone, and many different 
</b></p>
<p><b>players had to be brought in. This approach included not only health but also 
</b></p>
<p><b>education, housing, social security and other sectors. He emphasized the importance 
</b></p>
<p>of the role of families in supporting every phase of a child&#8217;s development. He <b>pointed 
</b></p>
<p><b>out that the ultimate aim of multi-sectoral approaches was to ensure that there was 
</b></p>
<p><b>complete access to quality health services targeted at the special needs of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>population, governed by the principle of equality. This involved identifying vulnerable 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups and designing specific programmes to meet their needs. This also involved the 
</b></p>
<p><b>identification of a set of basic needs for all children, regardless of their nationality, 
</b></p>
<p><b>race or place of origin.  
</b></p>
<p><b>25. Mr. Packer stated that national human rights institutions, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>ombudsmen, had a key role to play in obtaining the views of children and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>community in the area of child health. He also addressed the question on the practical 
</b></p>
<p><b>steps States that could take to ensure a human rights-based approach to child health. 
</b></p>
<p><b>He stressed that States had to work on social responsibility and on how individuals act 
</b></p>
<p><b>in communities, such as in the area of discrimination. Concrete steps included 
</b></p>
<p><b>providing information at the community level and involving leaders who work on 
</b></p>
<p><b>integration issues in communities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>26. The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
</b></p>
<p><b>pornography addressed the issue of female genital mutilation and other forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>sexual violence, stating that solutions had to be found at both the domestic and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international levels. At the national level, awareness-raising initiatives for changing 
</b></p>
<p><b>public perceptions were vital. She emphasized the importance of ensuring access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>prompt appeals and compensation systems and the need for an effective legislative 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework. At the international level, proper cooperation, coordinated action and 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective accountability and monitoring systems were needed. She also highlighted the 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenge of addressing concerns about global norms and rights, and the sovereignty 
</b></p>
<p><b>and cultural integrity of States. C</b>hildren&#8217;s rights were human rights<b>, but the way in 
</b></p>
<p><b>which they were translated in practice was a complex matter. In the Catholic and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Islamic cultures, some saw sex education as potentially encouraging early sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>behaviour when, in fact, its aim was to provide information and the necessary tools for 
</b></p>
<p><b>young persons to understand sexual matters. Child exploitation and sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>could not be tolerated in any culture. It was important to provide scientifically proven 
</b></p>
<p><b>information on sexual behaviour and education to change attitudes.  
</b></p>
<p><b>27. Ms. Amin stated that parents and other stakeholders, including local elites, 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be informed on child rights. She emphasized that education had an impact on 
</b></p>
<p><b>child and maternal mortality, and various other aspects of health. In Bangladesh, life 
</b></p>
<p><b>skills were taught as part of the school curriculum. National media were mobilized 
</b></p>
<p><b>and community radio was used to disseminate information to entire communities. </b></p>


<p><b>28. Jonas pointed out that children could help each other on issues relating to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to health. The majority of parents believed that issues relating to sex and sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>relations were taboo and there was discrimination against children with HIV/AIDS or 
</b></p>
<p><b>adolescents who were pregnant. All children should be respected and should respect 
</b></p>
<p><b>each other. Jonas and Tama thanked all present for the opportunity to participate in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the annual day discussion. 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Implementation of the right of the child to health and 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>29. The afternoon panel discussion started with a message read out by the Special 
Rapporteur on sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography on behalf of the 
Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of health, Anand Grover, followed by the video &#8220;Our health, our right and our 
action&#8221; produced by Save the Children and World Vision. Panellists in the afternoon 
session were Professor of Law at the University of Essex, Paul Hunt; a member of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child, Maria Herczog; the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on Violence against Children, Marta Santos Pais; the Principal Adviser 
with Special Interest in Public Health of the Directorate-General Health and Consumers, 
European Commission, Isabel de la Mata; the Chief Executive Officer of Save the Children, 
India, Thomas Chandy; and Senior Staff Attorney of the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights, Oscar Parra. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Remarks by the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of health stated that the rights of the child to health did not merely entail 
access to health care; that right also contained such freedoms as the right to control one&#8217;s 
health and body, and entitlements, including the right to a system of health protection that 
provides equality of opportunity for every child to enjoy the highest attainable level of 
health. This imposed three levels of obligations on States, including not to interfere with the 
enjoyment of the right; the obligation to ensure that third parties would not interfere; and 
the obligation to fulfil. The obligation to fulfil required States to take whatever measures 
necessary &#8211; legislative, administrative, budgetary and judicial &#8211; to achieve the full 
realization of the right of the child to health. This right should be interpreted in the light of 
the general principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur stressed the crucial role of national laws and policies. 
National legislation should be in line with the State&#8217;s obligation to respect, protect and fulfil 
</p>
<p>the right of the child to health. Too often, however, laws, regulations and policies were 
barriers to the full realization of that right; for example, criminal laws and other legal 
restrictions could prevent adolescents from having access to certain sexual and reproductive 
health-care goods (such as contraceptive methods), directly outlaw a particular service 
(such as safe abortion) or ban the provision of sexual and reproductive information through 
school-based education programmes. Such criminal laws and other legal restrictions 
affecting the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents could amount to violations of 
the right to health and should be revoked. The right to sexual and reproductive health was a 
fundamental part of the right of the child to health, and States should ensure its full 
realization by providing comprehensive sexuality education and full and affordable access 
to quality and confidential, age-friendly and evidence-based reproductive and sexual health 
services. The Special Rapporteur stressed that accountability was central to ensuring that </p>


<p>duty-bearers were meeting their human rights obligations. National accountability 
mechanisms included complaint systems, judicial remedies and independent monitoring 
bodies, which should be accessible, effective and transparent. Any child victim of a 
violation of the right to health should have access to effective judicial or other remedies at 
both the national and international levels. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Issues addressed by panellists 
</b></p>
<p>32. With regard to what accountability meant and the relevance of human rights to it, 
Mr. Hunt stated that health and human rights issues could not be addressed by lawyers or 
health experts independently, and that both needed to cooperate. In the context of the right 
of the child to health, accountability first meant monitoring what was happening (including 
using indicators and benchmarks, and gathering other information, such as &#8220;shadow 
reports&#8221; prepared by non-governmental organizations); second, reviewing the indicators, 
benchmarks, shadow reports and other information, and carefully assessing whether human 
rights commitments were being kept; and third, taking remedial action. Judicial 
accountability was extremely important, but it was accountability of last resort. 
Accountability for the right of the child to health was critical, and it required collaboration 
across law, human rights, health and other professionals. Accountability was, however, just 
one stage in the policy cycle. There were also the stages of situational analysis, policy 
formulation, budgeting and implementation. The right of the child to health had to be 
integrated into each stage of this policy cycle. Mr. Hunt reiterated that this could not be 
done without close, sustained and respectful collaboration between the human rights and 
health communities. 
</p>
<p>33. With regard to ensuring greater impact of the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
at the national level, Maria Herzog stated that the Committee&#8217;s weakest point was the lack 
of a follow-up mechanism and the difficulty in monitoring the national implementation of 
its concluding observations. It was up to States to translate recommendations made by the 
Committee into concrete plans, policies and programmes, and to ensure that adequate 
financing was made available. She emphasized the importance for all personnel working in 
the health sector to be versed in the human rights dimension of children&#8217;s health. Other key 
actors, including businesses and the media, should also be involved and informed, as they 
were crucial in preventing illnesses and ensuring the greatest degree of access to 
health. Recent examples of actions by the Committee to strengthen the right of the child to 
health included four new general comments on the right of the child to health, the right to 
play, the best interests of the child and the responsibilities of businesses with regard to 
children&#8217;s rights. She emphasized the responsibilities of businesses with respect to the right 
of the child to health, including businesses that caused environmental degradation or 
engaged in the employment of children, as well as the various gaps that the pharmaceutical 
industry needed to address with regard to children&#8217;s access to the right to health.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children 
addressed the impact of violence against children and the accountability mechanisms that 
were needed to ensure its prevention and elimination. She stated that violence against 
children compromised all human rights, including the right to health, and referred to the 
importance of health professionals in detecting violence. Hospitals were usually the first 
point of contact for children who had been victims of sexual violence; it was therefore 
important that they be prepared to offer immediate and even urgent assistance to children 
who had endured sexual abuse. In a growing number of countries, health-care centres were 
a sound platform for hosting one-stop shops for child victims of violence, where health and 
social services, police and justice departments joined hands to provide the necessary 
technical advice and support, protect child victims and secure their rehabilitation, guided by </p>


<p>the child&#8217;s best interests. She explained that violence against children could lead to 
depression and low self-esteem, and was associated with eating and sleeping disorders, 
aggressive and risky behaviours such as drug abuse, involvement in sex work and early 
pregnancies. Every three seconds a girl under the age of 18 got married, usually in a forced 
marriage to a much older man, and these early marriages exacerbated the problem of early 
pregnancies. The Special Representative pointed out that the risk of maternal mortality for 
girls who became pregnant before the age of 15 was five times higher than among women 
married in their twenties. She noted that accountability had several aspects, and that 
legislation was a key component. A ban on all forms of violence against children was 
required in legislation, accompanied by the removal of any justification that might 
legitimize practices that propagated violence against children. More data and evidence were 
also needed, and funds should be invested in medical staff and ethical 
standards. Cooperating with and empowering young persons were an important part of the 
fight against child abuse. 
</p>
<p>35. According to Ms. de la Mata, it was important to concentrate on deprived 
populations by implementing comprehensive policies covering education, health and 
nutrition issues in order to provide vulnerable groups with assistance. The European 
Commission was also addressing issues such as unhealthy lifestyles and the situation of 
children with disabilities and mental health problems. The European Union had several 
financial instruments, including the European Social Fund and the Fund for European Aid 
for the Most Deprived. A set of specific indicators on health issues, such as infant mortality 
and child mortality, had been designed to monitor progress, and Member States were given 
specific targets to reach and measures to implement. During the economic crisis, the value 
of health had to be demonstrated even further and a case had to be made for investing in 
young people, including their health. The European Union had strategies in place to 
promote specific health programmes and activities, and to address social inequalities. 
</p>
<p>36. With regard to the role of civil society and that of community accountability 
mechanisms, Mr. Chandy stated that the State was not solely responsible for accountability; 
working together with civil society and the community was necessary in order to be 
effective. The framework for accountability should be based on filling the gaps in 
information and equality. With regard to inequalities, he noted the close correlation of 
poverty and discrimination. To address the issue of the gap in information, awareness-
raising at the ground level was needed on entitlements and rights. In addition, it was 
essential that the voices of the community and their leaders be heard. Children should also 
be given a voice in the discussion and be given the opportunity to participate, as they were 
the most effective advocates for their needs. He reiterated that partnerships with the 
Government, civil society and the community were needed to achieve accountability, and 
noted the importance of working as a coalition, not as competitors. 
</p>
<p>37. Mr. Parra referred to relevant judicial decisions in Latin America related to the right 
of the child to health. The Constitutional Court of Colombia had addressed a case brought 
by parents whose children had been denied access to vaccination against meningitis, as they 
were not eligible to benefit from plans for these families. The Constitutional Court had 
noted that, since the children lacked the ability to participate in the legislative process and 
there was a lack of protection from the executive, it was the judiciary&#8217;s role to protect their 
</p>
<p>rights. He also referred to a case in Argentina in which a child had been refused medication 
owing to budget restrictions. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the State could not 
interrupt ongoing treatment on the grounds of lack of resources. Mr. Parra also referred to a 
case with the Inter-American Court of Human Rights involving Argentina, where a child 
with a mental impairment had sought appropriate compensation for rehabilitation, and the 
judicial trial at the domestic level had taken too long. The Court ruled that the delay in the 
case had had a deleterious impact on the rights of the child, including the right of the child 
to health, and that an interdisciplinary team should be set up to address the child&#8217;s situation.  </p>


<p><b> C. Plenary discussion 
</b></p>
<p>38. During the interactive dialogue, delegations from the African Union, Algeria, 
Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Cuba, Egypt, the Holy See, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Peru, Romania, the Russian Federation, Sierra Leone, South 
Africa and Spain took the floor. The International Labour Organization, the Joint United 
Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, also took the 
floor. Interventions were also made by the South African Human Rights Commission, the 
Al Zubair Charity Foundation, the Maarij Foundation for Peace and Development, Human 
Rights Advocates and the Consortium for Street Children. 
</p>
<p>39. During the discussion, States noted that the universal right of the child to enjoy the 
highest attainable standard of health was an urgent global priority, and stressed the 
importance that child health be part of the post-2015 development agenda. Participants 
raised the situation of children affected by HIV/TB co-infection, stressing that paediatric 
drug formulations were not available and calling for further investment and collaboration 
with pharmaceutical companies and research institutes in order to preserve the life and 
dignity of children living with HIV or HIV/TB co-infection. Some referred to the progress 
made over recent decades on children&#8217;s health. Examples of strategies to develop primary 
health-care systems capable of bringing medical advances to the population at large, 
together with improved access to clean water, improved sanitation, better child nutrition 
and comprehensive child immunization programmes were also mentioned. 
</p>
<p>40. Concern was reiterated during the dialogue about the 6.9 million children who die 
every year from preventable causes, and reference was made to the importance of adopting 
a human rights-based approach to access to health services for children. Some speakers 
pointed out the social stigma of adolescent pregnancies and indicated that educational 
programmes and media campaigns should play a greater role in raising awareness. The 
importance of health education, campaigns and promotional materials in order to prevent 
and tackle problems relating to obesity and substance use was also raised, as was the 
importance of international cooperation in supporting health systems and national health 
plans. Reference was also made to the 150 million children involved in hazardous work and 
worst forms of child labour, and the challenges that they faced in realizing their right to 
health. 
</p>
<p>41. Some speakers referred to the OHCHR report on the right of the child to the highest 
attainable standard of health (A/HRC/22/31), and emphasized that cultural and historical 
backgrounds should have been further considered. In particular, Egypt expressed its deepest 
disappointment at the report and indicated that, instead of providing a contribution to global 
and national efforts, the report presented a high-risk and culturally insensitive approach that 
disregarded the priorities of developing countries. Egypt stated that the occurrence of risk 
behaviours among children, such as sexual activity among minors and drug use, should not 
be a justification to accept these practices, and that such practices should be eradicated 
through means of parental guidance, awareness and the promotion of abstinence. They 
requested that their position and its definitive rejection to the approach and content of the 
report be clearly registered in the summary report.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>42. Reference was made to the lack of accountability as the biggest obstacle in the 
implementation of the right of the child to health. The important role played by national 
human rights institutions, the judiciary and the media as part of the accountability 
framework was also raised.  
</p>
<p>43. Non-governmental organizations referred to the situation of children in refugee 
camps, who were potentially at risk of being recruited as child soldiers, and to the 
importance of prevention and health education and awareness-raising campaigns. Attention </p>


<p>was drawn to the millions of children living or working in the street and the challenges they 
faced in the realization of their right to health, including access to health services. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>44.  <b>The moderator invited panellists to address a number of issues, including the 
implementation of effective accountability mechanisms; reflecting on the family and 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural value systems; ensuring that disadvantaged groups, including children in 
</b></p>
<p><b>street situations, had access to health services; and ensuring that mental health was 
</b></p>
<p><b>integrated in health policies.</b>  
</p>
<p>45. <b>Mr. Hunt stated that, in order to implement effective accountability 
mechanisms, a combination of devices was needed, including parliaments, national 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights institutions and child rights commissioners, local health authorities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>hospital boards and patient committees. In addition, all accountability measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be underpinned by transparency and participation. In addressing how 
</b></p>
<p><b>dialogue between United Nations agencies could be improved to ensure that the right 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the child to health was implemented, the agencies should work together on specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>projects in a collaborative spirit, at the request of intergovernmental bodies, such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Human Rights Council. He added that governing boards of agencies should 
</b></p>
<p><b>consider the right to health systematically, and give the political space to officials in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the agencies to engage in inter-agency collaboration on human rights. He invited 
</b></p>
<p><b>States in the Human Rights Council to take their views on the right to health to these 
</b></p>
<p><b>bodies.</b>  
</p>
<p>46. <b>Ms. Herczog emphasized the importance of a right-based approach and, in 
particular, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child as a universal tool and 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework that should be part of the post-2015 development agenda. The family was 
</b></p>
<p><b>paramount and efforts should be made to support the role of the family and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>parents. Parents should be supported in the development of non-violent and rights-
</b></p>
<p><b>based methods. She stressed that developing good indicators was a complex issue, 
</b></p>
<p><b>while noting the excellent set of indicators for child rights in early childhood that was 
</b></p>
<p><b>already in use.</b>  
</p>
<p>47. <b>The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against 
Children stated that issues such as pregnancies of adolescent mothers created stigma 
</b></p>
<p><b>and needed to be addressed in a culturally sensitive way. Children should be given the 
</b></p>
<p><b>opportunity to receive information and participate as partners in all processes. With 
</b></p>
<p><b>regard to the question of the links between the right of the child to health and 
</b></p>
<p>women&#8217;s <b>right to health, the Special Representative referred to the Commission on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Status of Women, which was also addressing the issue of violence against women and 
</b></p>
<p><b>girls and noted the coincidence of the topic. She highlighted the need to increase 
</b></p>
<p>cooperation between women&#8217;s right<b>s organizations and child</b>ren&#8217;s<b> rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations.</b> 
</p>
<p>48. <b>Ms. de la Mata pointed out that specific policies were needed to ensure the 
inclusion of marginalized communities, in addition to broader declarations on access 
</b></p>
<p><b>to health. She stated that, at the European level, specific programmes had been 
</b></p>
<p><b>developed to address specific groups of children, such as Roma children, and that 
</b></p>
<p>mental health was a central theme with regard to children&#8217;s health.  
</p>
<p>49. <b>Mr. Chandy reiterated that the family was the basic unit for the protection of 
the child. He also stressed that rapid urbanization in Asia and Africa had led to a 
</b></p>
<p><b>growing number of children living on the street. It was essential to ensure that care 
</b></p>
<p><b>structures were built for children in street situations and addressed health and </b></p>


<p><b>protection issues related to children in the streets. As many of the children living and 
</b></p>
<p><b>working on the street could come into conflict with the law, adequate attention should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be paid to juvenile justice systems as well. </b> 
</p>
<p>50. <b>Mr. Parra explained that, when Governments did not make progress in the 
implementation of the right to health, judicial intervention could fill the gap. With 
</b></p>
<p><b>regard to the issue of child labour, he stated that, in the Inter-American system, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission had referred to the specific problem of child labour, linking it to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerability of children in situations of poverty. The elimination of child labour was a 
</b></p>
<p><b>priority objective for States in the region.</b>
