<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twelfth session from 3 
to 14 October 2011. The review of the United Republic of Tanzania was held at the 2nd 
meeting on 3 October 2011. The delegation of Tanzania was headed by Mathias Meinrad 
Chikawe, Minister of State (Good Governance), President&#8217;s Office. At its 6th meeting held 
on 5 October 2011, the Working Group adopted the report on the United Republic of 
Tanzania. 
</p>
<p>2. On 20 June 2011, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the United Republic of Tanzania: Benin, 
Malaysia and the Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of the United Republic of Tanzania: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted and a written presentation made in accordance

</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TZA/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Canada, Denmark, Ireland, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to the United Republic of Tanzania through the troika. 
These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Head of the delegation of the United Republic of Tanzania stated that his 
delegation was diverse by design and that such diversity had characterized the preparatory 
process of the national report, which was a product of a wide spectrum of consultations in 
both Tanzania Mainland and Tanzania Zanzibar. 
</p>
<p>6. Tanzania briefly mentioned the main subjects of the national report. Both the 
Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania of 1977 and that of Zanzibar of 1984 
contained the Bill of Rights. A number of laws incorporated human rights standards derived 
from various treaties ratified by the United Republic of Tanzania. 
</p>
<p>7. The thematic areas included in the national report had been agreed upon by 
stakeholders: the right to life; the right to equality and non-discrimination; rights of persons 
with disabilities; rights of the child; health; torture; freedom of expression; the right to 
participate in public affairs; human trafficking; forced labour; access to justice; education; 
minorities and indigenous people&#8217;s rights; refugee; and asylum-seekers. 
</p>
<p>8. Voluntary commitments made by Tanzania for the purposes of the promotion and 
protection of human rights included: submission of periodic human rights reports to various 
human rights treaty bodies on time; implementation of the Millennium Development Goals </p>


<p>and Government development strategies; promotion of democracy, good governance and 
rule of law; and consideration of ratification of human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>9. The report also contained achievements, best practices, challenges and constraints in 
the promotion and protection of human rights. Government achievements included the 
establishment of the Government of National Unity of Zanzibar, a United Nations award 
for meeting the Millennium Development Goal on universal primary education nearly five 
years ahead of the 2015 deadline, and the granting of citizenship to 162,156 refugees from 
Burundi and 1,423 refugees from Somalia in June 2010. In August 2011, Tanzania became 
the first country in Africa to document and make public a report on violence against 
children. 
</p>
<p>10. The empowerment funds established by President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete of the 
United Republic of Tanzania and Dr. Aman Abeid Karume, former President of Zanzibar, 
had a very significant role in promoting small and medium entrepreneurs through the 
provision of soft loans. 
</p>
<p>11. Tanzania found itself constrained by several factors, relating to traditions, resources 
and calamities, both natural and manmade. Challenges included the killing of persons with 
albinism, female genital mutilation (FGM), maternal and child mortality and the quality of 
education. Key national priorities and initiatives included the finalization of the draft 
national action plan on human rights,<b> </b>constitutional reforms, prison reforms, improvement 
of the quality of education and provision of human rights education, particularly in the rural 
areas, and the recently introduced Green Revolution initiative, aimed at modernizing and 
commercializing the agricultural sector. 
</p>
<p>12. The Government had taken legal and administrative measures to mitigate violence 
and discrimination against women. Tanzanian laws stipulated that women and men in 
Tanzania had equal property rights, including the right to acquire, inherit, maintain and 
dispose of properties. The Penal Code criminalized various forms of gender-based violence, 
including rape, sexual assault and harassment and FGM, while the national and local 
policies provided important opportunities to address gender-based violence. The National 
Plan of Action for the Prevention and Eradication of Violence against Women, including 
FGM, was in place. Furthermore, the Government was working on a comprehensive legal 
aid legislation for the provision of legal aid. 
</p>
<p>13. With regard to<b> </b>violence and discrimination against persons with albinism, recently 
Tanzania had faced a spate of horrific attacks against persons with albinism perpetrated by 
groups of criminals purporting to profit from sinister beliefs in witchcraft. Tanzania took 
deliberate measures to reverse the trend through education, advocacy campaigns, and 
prosecutions attracting severe punishments. Tanzania would continue to sustain those 
efforts and appealed to its development partners to continue with their support. 
</p>
<p>14. Apart from the establishment of a national task force to deal with the problem,<b> </b>the 
Government had fast-tracked investigations and prosecutions of cases concerning the 
killings of persons with albinism. Consequently, out of 57 incidents that had been reported 
between 2007 and January 2011, a total of 14 suspects had been apprehended and charged 
with murder. Investigations were ongoing with respect to the remaining suspects. From 
January 2011 to date, there had not been any reported incident of violence against persons 
with albinism. 
</p>
<p>15. The National Disability Policy required the Government and stakeholders to provide 
a conducive environment for inclusive education that addressed the special needs of 
children with disabilities. In addition, the Government provided such children with medical 
services and continued to encourage stakeholders to support disadvantaged people, 
including those with albinism. Two persons with albinism were elected Members of 
Parliament during the 2010 general elections. </p>


<p>16. As to children&#8217;s rights and quality of education, despite the achievements that had 
been recorded in attaining universal primary education, the quality of education remained a 
national concern. 
</p>
<p>17. With regard to refugees, Tanzania had maintained a track record as a host country to 
many refugees. Recently, the Government had facilitated voluntary repatriation of refugees 
as a result of the normalization of the political situation in their countries of origin. 
Tanzania was working out the modalities for the relocation of naturalized refugees, which 
was intended to relocate them away from designated areas with a view to integrating them 
into the Tanzanian community. The Government appealed to the international community 
for assistance in that endeavour. 
</p>
<p>18. As for the freedom of the press,<b> </b>the Government was determined to review laws 
governing freedom of the press in Tanzania.<b> </b>However, Tanzania was a country where 
freedom of the press is highly respected. This was evidenced by a large number of privately 
owned print and electronic media houses.  
</p>
<p>19. With regard to the issue of receiving complaints and treatment by police, the 
Commission for Human Rights and Good Governance (CHRAGG) continued to play the 
role of an oversight body with the mandate to receive and investigate<b> </b>complaints on human 
rights violations in the country. 
</p>
<p>20. Tanzania had established a department within the Ministry for Home Affairs which 
dealt with complaints from the public against the police. In addition, the Inquiries Act 
permitted the President of Tanzania to establish a committee to conduct investigations into 
serious complaints. The Parliament also had a mandate to raise an alarm to establish a 
committee to investigate matters related to human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>21. Regarding access to justice and prison conditions, Tanzania had increased the 
number of courts, judges, magistrates and State attorneys. Furthermore, it had implemented 
the civilianization of the criminal prosecutions programme with a view to separating 
prosecutions, which previously had been carried out by the police, from investigations. 
Currently, the police conducted investigations while the prosecution was conducted by 
State attorneys from the Office of the Attorney General. At the same time, alternative 
sentencing, such as the imposition of fines and community services, as well as the building 
of new prisons and renovations of old ones, had been major priorities, intended to reduce 
crowding in prisons. 
</p>
<p>22. Regarding<b> </b>ratification of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), Tanzania had neither ratified the 
Convention nor its Optional Protocol, but was considering ratification bearing in mind the 
fact that the death penalty was still applicable in the country. Torture was prohibited under 
article 13(6) of the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, 1977. 
</p>
<p>23. Public opinion was still divided on the death penalty. For that reason, Tanzania had 
not acceded to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>24. Concerning the issue of indigenous people, there was no consensus definition of 
indigenous peoples in Tanzania. Generally, all ethnic Tanzanians were regarded as 
indigenous. The<b> </b>position of the Government was that<b> </b>there were special groups that needed 
special protection within the country. Those included the Maasai, Hadzabe and Barbaig. 
The Government had taken various measures to provide political, social and cultural 
amenities to such groups in the fields of health, politics, employment and education. 
</p>
<p>25. Regarding forced evictions and toxic spillage into drinking water, the Constitution 
guaranteed the right to property, and land laws prevented forced evictions and provided for 
compensation where land was used for public interest. As for water control, the National </p>


<p>Water Policy of 2002 was in place. The Water Supply and Sanitation Act of 2009 provided 
for the punishment of persons responsible for water pollution, and the Environmental 
Management Act established the Environmental Management Council, the duties of which 
included, inter alia, evaluating projects, potential environmental risks and impacts in that 
area. 
</p>
<p>26. With respect to the Constitutional review<b>,</b> the Government had already tabled a bill 
before the Parliament intended to guide the constitutional review. The bill would establish a 
Commission and a secretariat which would collect and coordinate public opinions and 
views. The bill would also provide for the establishment of the people&#8217;s forums to discuss a 
draft new Constitution. The Constituent Assembly would deliberate on the provisions of the 
draft and the provisions for referendum where the Tanzania citizenry would have the right 
to vote. 
</p>
<p>27. Regarding<b> </b>financial support to CHRAGG, the Government operated on cash budget 
and allocated funds according to what it collected. Inadequacy of funds was not specific to 
CHRAGG but also to all Government institutions, including the judiciary and the 
parliament. Allocations depended on the national income. 
</p>
<p>28. During the consideration of the fourth periodic report of the United Republic of 
Tanzania on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) submitted to 
the Human Rights Committee in July 2009, Tanzania addressed the status of issues such as 
laws for marriage, inheritance and succession, citizenship rights, access to education for 
women, marital rape, FGM, the death penalty, corporal punishment, refugees, and treatment 
of prisoners. Positions on those issues remained the same. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review
