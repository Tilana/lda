<p><b>I. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. In three recent seminal resolutions,1 the Human Rights Council expressed its 
</p>
<p>concern about the situation of the human rights of persons with albinism. In the first 
</p>
<p>resolution, adopted in June 2013, it condemned attacks against persons with albinism and 
</p>
<p>requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>(OHCHR) to submit, at its twenty-fourth session in September 2013, a preliminary report 
</p>
<p>on the ongoing attacks and discrimination against persons with albinism.2 
</p>
<p>2. In the second resolution, adopted in September 2013, the Council requested the 
</p>
<p>Advisory Committee to prepare a study on the situation of human rights of persons with 
</p>
<p>albinism and submit a report thereon to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-eighth 
</p>
<p>session.3 
</p>
<p>3. In its third resolution, adopted in June 2014, the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>recommended that the General Assembly proclaim 13 June International Albinism 
</p>
<p>Awareness Day. On 18 November 2014, the General Assembly took note of the Council&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>recommendation and decided to proclaim 13 June as International Albinism Awareness 
</p>
<p>Day, with effect from 2015.4 
</p>
<p>4. In accordance with its mandate pursuant to Council resolution 24/33, the Advisory 
</p>
<p>Committee, at its twelfth session in February 2014, established a drafting group tasked with 
</p>
<p>the drafting of the report and designated the following experts as members of the drafting 
</p>
<p>group: Mohamed Al Faihani, Laurence Boisson de Chazournes (Rapporteur), Mario 
</p>
<p>Luis Coriolano, Latif H&#252;seynov, Kaoru Obata and Obiora Chinedu Okafor (Chairperson). 
</p>
<p>5. The Committee also decided to seek views and input from States and other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders and, to that end, prepared a questionnaire requesting information on the status 
</p>
<p>and treatment of persons with albinism around the world, which was disseminated in April 
</p>
<p>2014 to States, relevant special procedures, OHCHR field presences, national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions and non-governmental organizations. A total of 41 responses were received, 
</p>
<p>including 15 from States: Azerbaijan, Burundi, Chile, Denmark, Georgia, Germany, 
</p>
<p>Luxemburg, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Senegal, Slovenia, Spain, Swaziland and 
</p>
<p>Tunisia; 9 from national human rights institutions in the following countries: Bosnia and 
</p>
<p>Herzegovina, Denmark, Malawi, Namibia, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Romania, Rwanda 
</p>
<p>and South Africa; 10 from the following non-governmental organizations: Amis des 
</p>

<p>Degrading Treatment or Punishment; and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
</p>
<p>or arbitrary executions. 
</p>
<p>6. Building on the facts and findings contained in the OHCHR report, the present study 
</p>
<p>first provides an overview of the various obstacles faced by persons with albinism to the 
</p>
<p>full enjoyment of their human rights, and includes the type and severity of the human rights 
</p>
<p>violations involved. Second, it summarizes actions taken at the international level and by 
</p>
<p>OHCHR in response to the issue. The third and final part recommends further initiatives for 
</p>
<p>addressing some of the key problems identified in the first part. 
</p>
<p>7. On 24 September 2014, the Rapporteur of the Advisory Committee&#8217;s drafting group 
</p>
<p>participated in an expert meeting on albinism organized by OHCHR in collaboration with 
</p>
<p>the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie. The meeting brought together experts 
</p>
<p>from international and regional human rights mechanisms and participants from civil 
</p>
<p>society. It was an opportunity to hear the testimonies of persons with albinism and to listen 
</p>
<p>to their proposals on the way forward at the domestic, regional and international levels. The 
</p>
<p>present study has benefited greatly from the expert meeting. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Albinism, special needs and human rights challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Albinism and special needs 
</b></p>
<p>8. Albinism is a rare, non-contagious, genetically inherited difference present at birth. 
</p>
<p>In almost all types of albinism, both parents must carry the gene for it to be passed on, even 
</p>
<p>if they do not have albinism themselves. The condition is found in both sexes regardless of 
</p>
<p>ethnicity and in all countries of the world. Albinism results in a lack of pigmentation 
</p>
<p>(melanin) in the hair, skin and eyes, causing vulnerability to the sun and bright light. As a 
</p>
<p>result, almost all people with albinism are visually impaired and are prone to developing 
</p>
<p>skin cancer. There is no cure for the absence of melanin that is central to albinism.5 
</p>
<p>9. While numbers vary, it is estimated that in North America and Europe 1 in every 
</p>
<p>17,000 to 20,000 people have some form of albinism. The condition is much more 
</p>
<p>prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, with estimates of 1 in 1,400 people being affected in 
</p>
<p>Tanzania6 and prevalence as high as 1 in 1,000 reported for select populations in Zimbabwe 
</p>
<p>and for other specific ethnic groups in Southern Africa.7 
</p>
<p>10. Persons with albinism have special needs. An advocacy report of the International 
</p>
<p>Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) identified those needs as 
</p>
<p>follows: 
</p>
<p>(a) Security; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 The definition of albinism comes from A/HRC/24/57, para. 10.

<p>(g) Vocational training to maximize the chance of indoor work out of the sun.8 
</p>
<p>11. While the IFRC report focused on the Great Lakes region of east Africa, those 
</p>
<p>needs, or at least some of them, may be considered to reflect the collective experience of 
</p>
<p>persons with albinism. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Rights to life and security of person 
</b></p>
<p>12. With respect to security<b>,</b> grave concern has been expressed by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council about &#8220;attacks against persons with albinism, including against women and 
</p>
<p>children, which are often committed with impunity.&#8221;9 Such attacks involve the violation of 
</p>
<p>fundamental human rights. 
</p>
<p>13. As mentioned by six special procedure mandate-holders, persons with albinism face 
</p>
<p>dehumanization because they &#8220;are regarded as ghosts and not human beings who can be 
</p>
<p>wiped off the global map &#8230; [they are] the target of many false and harmful myths in 
</p>
<p>several countries, especially in the African region.&#8221;10 
</p>
<p>14. The OHCHR report states that &#8220;in some communities, erroneous beliefs and myths, 
</p>
<p>heavily influenced by superstition, put the security and lives of persons with albinism at 
</p>
<p>constant risk. These beliefs and myths are centuries old and are present in cultural attitudes 
</p>
<p>and practices around the world.&#8221;11 The belief that the body parts of persons with albinism 
</p>
<p>possess magical powers that can be used to gain wealth and prosperity and/or to gain power 
</p>
<p>via winning elections are some of the reasons for the killing of, and attacks against, persons 
</p>
<p>with albinism. 
</p>
<p>15. Violence against this vulnerable group takes various forms, including the killing of, 
</p>
<p>and attacks against, persons with albinism with a view to using their body parts for ritual 
</p>
<p>purposes. Arising from the attacks and the use of body parts is the trade of organs linked to 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons and the sale of children, infanticide and abandonment of children.12 
</p>
<p>16. It is reported that, as of October 2014, over 340 attacks against persons with 
</p>
<p>albinism, including 134 killings, have been recorded in 25 countries.13 Non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations working in the field note that the number of ongoing attacks is higher than

</p>
<p> 10 Press release by several special procedure mandate-holders , &#8220;Not ghosts, but human beings &#8230; 
</p>
<p>persons with albinism&#8221; (4 May 2013), available from

<p>that reported, but that data-gathering is difficult owing to the secretive nature of witchcraft, 
</p>
<p>which serves as the context of most ritual attacks against persons with albinism. 
</p>
<p>17. On 15 May 2014, the former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>issued a press statement in which she called for increased protection for people with 
</p>
<p>albinism after the murder of a 40-year-old woman with albinism in north-western Tanzania 
</p>
<p>three days earlier. On 27 May 2014, the Working Group on the Rights of Older Persons and 
</p>
<p>People with Disabilities in Africa also issued a press statement condemning that specific 
</p>
<p>killing. 
</p>
<p>18. Since then, seven further attacks have been documented in Tanzania, between 
</p>
<p>August 2014 and January 2015, including one murder, two cases of survivors with severe 
</p>
<p>limb mutilation and the disappearance of a 4-year-old girl. The killing of a 25-year-old 
</p>
<p>woman was reported in Malawi in November 2014 and another killing, of a 27-year old 
</p>
<p>man, was reported in Burundi in December 2014. The circumstances in which the attacks 
</p>
<p>took place reveal the severity of attacks against the group. The following are some 
</p>
<p>examples: 
</p>
<p>(a) On 5 August 2014, Pendo Sengerema, a 15-year-old girl, was brutally 
</p>
<p>attacked at her home in Kaliua District, in the Tabora Region of Tanzania. Three assailants 
</p>
<p>with machetes hacked off her right arm just below the elbow. According to reports, her 
</p>
<p>family could not scream for help as they were threatened with death by the attackers, who 
</p>
<p>later disappeared with Pendo&#8217;s arm; 
</p>
<p>(b) On 16 August 2014, two unidentified men entered the home of Munghu 
</p>
<p>Masaga, a 35-year-old woman with albinism and the mother of seven children, in Buhekela 
</p>
<p>village, in Igunga District, also in Tabora region of Tanzania. Before chopping off her left 
</p>
<p>arm and escaping, attackers killed Munghu&#8217;s husband as he tried to protect his wife. Two of 
</p>
<p>their children sustained minor injuries; 
</p>
<p>(c) On 12 November 2014, a 25-year old woman with albinism by the name of 
</p>
<p>Violet Kanyama was found dead in the garden of a school near her home in Gawani village, 
</p>
<p>Mulanje district, Malawi. Her body was recovered with both arms and legs missing. 
</p>
<p>19. These latest attacks underscore the urgent need for States to adopt specific measures 
</p>
<p>to protect and preserve the rights to life and security of person, and the right not to be 
</p>
<p>subjected to torture or ill-treatment. Persons with albinism must be provided with safe and 
</p>
<p>secure spaces where they are able to live dignified lives, free from the fear of being 
</p>
<p>attacked.14 
</p>
<p>20. The Tanzanian police response to the attacks in August 2014 has been reported as 
</p>
<p>adequate, with several arrests made, and a special task force has been set up by the Office 
</p>
<p>of the Attorney General to investigate and prosecute the cases. Those welcome responses 
</p>
<p>are ongoing and it is therefore premature to comment on their impact. Meanwhile, civil 
</p>
<p>society groups have made a clarion call to the Tanzanian Government to enlarge the scope 
</p>
<p>of investigation to unearth the black market in organs associated with the attacks and 
</p>
<p>prosecute clients of the trade. Civil society actors also urged the relevant authorities to 
</p>
<p>introduce effective regulation of the activities of traditional health practitioners. The 
</p>
<p>practitioners, who reportedly practise witchcraft and are revered by many for their 
</p>
<p>perceived supernatural powers and ability to carry out magic, have been mentioned as key 
</p>
<p>players.15

<p><b> C. Right to an adequate standard of living and other fundamental rights 
</b></p>
<p>21. The situation of persons with albinism who have gone into, or have remained in, 
</p>
<p>hiding in the wake of attacks against them, is worrisome. For instance, according to 
</p>
<p>information received by OHCHR, hundreds of children with albinism have been living in 
</p>
<p>appalling conditions in 13 centres for displaced children and adults with albinism in 
</p>
<p>Tanzania, after being abandoned by their families or fleeing their homes further to a spate 
</p>
<p>of killings and attacks against them. Some of the centres are administered by the 
</p>
<p>Government while others are owned by faith-based organizations. 
</p>
<p>22. Further, according to information received, the centres are overcrowded and the 
</p>
<p>health and hygiene conditions are very poor . In addition, owing to very limited human and 
</p>
<p>financial resources, teaching and learning materials are almost non-existent. Health-wise, 
</p>
<p>there have been worrisome reports of skin cancer at various stages, which is visible on 
</p>
<p>many of the children with albinism living in the centres, partly owing to the lack of 
</p>
<p>awareness amongst staff as well as a lack of basic health information on self-care for the 
</p>
<p>persons with albinism themselves. Sexual abuse has been reported in some of the centres. 
</p>
<p>23. In a press release of 15 May 2014, the former High Commissioner also expressed 
</p>
<p>concern about the situation of children with albinism living in the centres. She called on the 
</p>
<p>Tanzanian authorities to take urgent measures to assess and address the situation in the 
</p>
<p>centres, including allegations of sexual harassment and abuse, and the poor living 
</p>
<p>conditions. She added that staff working with people with albinism should be trained on 
</p>
<p>their special needs, in particular with regard to basic preventive measures to avoid skin 
</p>
<p>cancer. In August 2014, a United Nations mission visited two of the centres and expressed 
</p>
<p>concern that the centres reinforce segregation of persons with albinism and separate 
</p>
<p>children from their families.16 There is therefore an urgent need to look into long-term 
</p>
<p>solutions to reintegrate the children into their communities, avoiding over-reliance on 
</p>
<p>institutions as safe places for children17. 
</p>
<p>24. Another example is Burundi, where, after a spate of killings and attacks registered 
</p>
<p>from 2008 to 2012, persons with albinism were accommodated in police stations and 
</p>
<p>houses nearby to guarantee their safety. An assessment of displaced persons with albinism 
</p>
<p>in the Northern Province of Kayanza, in Musongati and in Gitega, recently conducted by 
</p>
<p>the OHCHR field presence, shows the precarious security situation of some of them and the 
</p>
<p>negative impact of the measure on the right to an adequate standard of living. 
</p>
<p>25. Those concerns were reiterated by the Human Rights Committee in its 2014 
</p>
<p>concluding observations, requesting Burundi to continue its efforts to protect persons with 
</p>
<p>albinism and to find lasting solutions to their situation.18

<p>Rights, outcome report of the Expert Meeting on Persons with Albinism; Violence, Discrimination 
</p>
<p>and Way Forward, 24 September 2014 (see footnote 15), para. 21. 
16The joint mission from OHCHR and the Resident Coordinator&#8217;s Office in Tanzania visited Buhangiya 
</p>
<p>Primary School in Shynyanga District, which houses 174 children with albinism and Mitindo Primary 
</p>
<p>School in Misungwi District, which houses 45 children with albinism. 
17  The Committee on the Rights of the Child included a reference to those centres in the list of issues on 
</p>
<p>Tanzania adopted on 27 June 2014 (CRC/C/TZA/Q/3&#8211;5), also mentioned in para. 53 of the present 
</p>
<p>report. This is also a recommendation from the Expert Meeting: see outcome report of the Expert

<p><b> D. Discrimination against persons with albinism 
</b></p>
<p>26. Security concerns and associated displacement of persons with albinism are linked 
</p>
<p>to the overall issue of discrimination. The OHCHR report expressed &#8220;its grave concern at 
</p>
<p>the severity of the human rights violations committed against persons with albinism in 
</p>
<p>many countries, including the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination they, 
</p>
<p>particularly children and women, face.&#8221;19 
</p>
<p>27. Those various forms of discrimination are evident from the &#8220;nasty, brutish and 
</p>
<p>short&#8221; lives of persons with albinism: if they survive infanticide at birth, they face a 
</p>
<p>constant threat of physical attacks. Should they survive those physical threats, they are 
</p>
<p>unlikely to be educated, owing to the absence of reasonable accommodation for their poor 
</p>
<p>eyesight. A lack of education leads to unemployment or employment outdoors in the sun, 
</p>
<p>where they are vulnerable to developing skin cancer. Skin cancer remains a life-threatening 
</p>
<p>condition for most persons with albinism under the age of 40.20 
</p>
<p>28. All forms of discrimination affecting persons with albinism are interrelated, and 
</p>
<p>there is an inextricable link between discrimination and poverty. &#8220;The right to education of 
</p>
<p>persons with albinism, for instance, is adversely affected by the vision impairment they 
</p>
<p>suffer from. A poor education, in turn, affects their right to an adequate standard of living, 
</p>
<p>consigning many persons with albinism to poverty.&#8221;21 As a result, the economic and social 
</p>
<p>rights of persons with albinism are disproportionately affected by various types of poverty. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>29. Discrimination encountered by persons with albinism also negatively impacts access 
</p>
<p>to justice. 
</p>
<p>30. There are little data available on the legal treatment of cases of violence against 
</p>
<p>persons with albinism.22 Where there is information, it is reported that persons with 
</p>
<p>albinism are discriminated against throughout the whole judicial process. It is reported that 
</p>
<p>law enforcement authorities and some members of the judiciary tend to share the same 
</p>
<p>superstitious beliefs entrenched in the communities, including and not limited to, 
</p>
<p>considering persons with albinism as subhuman beings. Procedural fairness including 
</p>
<p>informing the victim of attack about the trial process, preparing him or her for trial and 
</p>
<p>providing him or her with legal representation or access to the prosecutor are all reportedly 
</p>
<p>impaired by subsisting prejudices against the victim as a person with albinism. In addition, 
</p>
<p>erroneous beliefs about albinism, including inadequate knowledge about their condition, for 
</p>
<p>instance knowledge of the visual levels of persons with albinism, has also been reported to 
</p>
<p>negatively impact the weight ascribed to the testimony of victims of attack. Further, 
</p>
<p>corruption and shortcomings in the resources of the justice system fail to translate initial 
</p>
<p>police action into concrete results in the fight against impunity. Such factors effectively 
</p>
<p>create significant obstacles in access to justice for persons with albinism. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 19 A/HRC/24/57, para. 84. 
</p>
<p> 20 For example, one epidemiological study estimated that fewer than 10 per cent of persons with 
</p>
<p>albinism in Tanzania survive to age 30, and only 2 per cent were expected to reach age 40. See 
</p>

</p>
<p> 22 Ibid., para. 50. </p>


<p>31. The challenges persons with albinism face in having their cases brought to justice 
</p>
<p>are grounded in the vulnerability of the population. They include  
</p>
<p>the fear of further attacks, reprisals or further stigmatization; difficulties in finding 
</p>
<p>witnesses owing to the ostracism they face within their community and, frequently, 
</p>
<p>the involvement of family and community members in the attacks; the lack of 
</p>
<p>awareness of legal rights; the lack of financial resources; the inadequate capacity of 
</p>
<p>the judicial system to address such cases; the lack of legal aid and adequate legal 
</p>
<p>representation; the lack of knowledge of or confidence in the law enforcement and 
</p>
<p>justice systems.23 
</p>
<p>32. Without effective and affordable access to justice, persons with albinism are unable 
</p>
<p>to adequately claim their rights and contest the human rights violations which they are 
</p>
<p>subjected to.24 As a result, no type of redress is available to victims, even in the form of 
</p>
<p>medical and psychological support.25 To date, it is reported that most assistance to victims 
</p>
<p>in the form of medical and psychological support has been provided exclusively by non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>33. The link between poverty and witchcraft is also a matter of concern and has been 
</p>
<p>explained in the following terms:  
</p>
<p>As is the case with witchcraft accusations against women, the elderly and children, 
</p>
<p>muti26 murders of persons with albinism appear to follow patterns of poverty, 
</p>
<p>misfortune, tension and conflict in societies. Attacks may originate from tense social 
</p>
<p>relations, where no effective or social alternative exists to release or explain such 
</p>
<p>tension. Lack of access to basic resources, education and basic health services 
</p>
<p>correlate with such human rights abuses. These spiritual explanations act as a way of 
</p>
<p>justifying life&#8217;s misfortunes, hence, maintaining social order. It is, predominantly, 
</p>
<p>the most vulnerable and marginalized groups in society who are accused of 
</p>
<p>witchcraft, because they are either least able to defend themselves from attack and 
</p>
<p>are, therefore, easy targets. Furthermore, as they are considered of little value to 
</p>
<p>society, they consequently become a burden [sic] in times of hardship.27 
</p>
<p>34. States have an obligation to criminalize, investigate and prosecute perpetrators of 
</p>
<p>crimes affecting persons with albinism. That is even more critical given the heightened 
</p>
<p>vulnerability of persons with albinism. The strengthening of the legal response to killings 
</p>
<p>of, and attacks against, persons with albinism will also serve as a deterrent. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Women and children 
</b></p>
<p>35. The OHCHR report mentions that &#8220;women and children with albinism are 
</p>
<p>particularly vulnerable as they are exposed to intersecting and multiple forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination. In addition, children are particularly targeted for ritual killings and women 
</p>
<p>with albinism are sometimes victims of sexual violence.&#8221;28 That is because there is the

<p>belief in some communities that having sex with a person with albinism can cure 
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS.29 
</p>
<p>36. Women who give birth to children with albinism are particularly exposed. They are 
</p>
<p>often rejected by their husbands, accused of adultery and blamed for giving birth to children 
</p>
<p>who are perceived as a curse, misfortune or a cause of shame for the family.30 
</p>
<p>37. In her opening remarks at a press conference during her mission to Nigeria in March 
</p>
<p>2014, the former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights alluded to the 
</p>
<p>specific discrimination faced by persons with albinism and the extra vulnerability faced by 
</p>
<p>children with the condition. She stated &#8220;One group at particular risk are the some 800,000 
</p>
<p>children among the 2 million people living with albinism in Nigeria. Many of them are not 
</p>
<p>in school because of visual impairment, discrimination from other children, and social 
</p>
<p>exclusion as a result of their skin colour.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>38. The 2014 annual report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
</p>
<p>Violence against Children identified children with albinism as particularly vulnerable. The 
</p>
<p>report explains that children with albinism are  
</p>
<p>at high risk of abandonment, stigmatization, and marginalization as a result of their 
</p>
<p>appearance, and due to disability factors associated with their condition, such as 
</p>
<p>impaired eyesight and sensitive skin (&#8230;). Social and structural discrimination 
</p>
<p>condemns these children to a position of extreme vulnerability. Children with 
</p>
<p>albinism are exposed to severe incidents of violence, mutilation and murder. At 
</p>
<p>times they become the target of witchcraft accusations, leading to the use of their 
</p>
<p>body parts for ritual purposes. Children who survive such attacks are left with 
</p>
<p>serious and long-lasting health and psychological consequences, and the 
</p>
<p>development of their full potential is compromised for life. Driven by fear and 
</p>
<p>superstition, incidences of violence are largely met with silence and indifference. 
</p>
<p>They are rarely reported or followed by investigation or prosecution. Overall, there 
</p>
<p>is a pervasive culture of impunity.31 
</p>
<p><b> G. Violence and discrimination against persons with albinism: a global 
</b></p>
<p><b>phenomenon? 
</b></p>
<p>39. While it has been reported that persons with albinism globally face discrimination 
</p>
<p>and stigma,32 information on cases of physical attacks against persons with albinism is 
</p>
<p>mainly available from countries in Africa. It is important to reiterate the point made in the 
</p>
<p>OHCHR report that any real or apparent focus on Africa&#8212;whether in the present report or 
</p>
<p>the issue generally&#8212; is explained by the fact that, to date, all reported cases of ritual attacks 
</p>
<p>have come from that region. 
</p>
<p>40. The manner in which discrimination faced by persons with albinism manifests itself, 
</p>
<p>and its severity, vary from region to region. In the western world, including North America, 
</p>
<p>Europe and Australia, discrimination often consists of name-calling, persistent teasing and 
</p>
<p>bullying of children with albinism.33 In those regions, the substance of discrimination is 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 29 This phenomenon has been exposed by various NGOs working in Burundi, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Kenya, 
</p>
<p>Namibia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.

<p>entrenched misconceptions and misunderstanding about albinism, notably perpetuated by 
</p>
<p>the media and popular culture, which consistently portray persons with albinism in a 
</p>
<p>negative light.34 Given the rarity of albinism in those regions (an estimated 1 in 17,000 to 
</p>
<p>20,000) the media and popular culture are major sources of information on the condition for 
</p>
<p>the majority. Therefore, unless specific albinism awareness-raising is conducted by support 
</p>
<p>groups and civil society, such discrimination is unlikely to be brought to light. 
</p>
<p>41. Persons with albinism face more severe forms of discrimination and violence in 
</p>
<p>those regions where the majority of the general population are relatively dark-skinned. The 
</p>
<p>degree of contrast in pigmentation between the majority and the person with albinism in a 
</p>
<p>community tends to correlate positively with the severity and intensity of discrimination 
</p>
<p>faced by persons with albinism. In other words, a greater degree of contrast in pigmentation 
</p>
<p>often gives rise to a greater degree of discrimination. That appears to be the case in some 
</p>
<p>sub-Saharan African countries where albinism is shrouded in myth and dangerous and 
</p>
<p>erroneous beliefs. 
</p>
<p>42. Little information is available from other regions such as Asia, South America and 
</p>
<p>the Pacific etc. However, some reports indicate that in China and other Asian countries, 
</p>
<p>children with albinism face abandonment and rejection by their families. A recent 
</p>
<p>epidemiological study of persons with albinism from a specific tribe in Pakistan explains 
</p>
<p>the multi-layered human rights problems faced by persons with albinism, including lack of 
</p>
<p>understanding of albinism, social rejection, medical and psychological problems, as well as 
</p>
<p>confinement to poverty.35 Reliable testimonies received from Mumbai, India, also indicate 
</p>
<p>that persons with albinism tend to be viewed as cursed on account of their appearance. That 
</p>
<p>perceived curse is considered contagious by some, such that persons with albinism are 
</p>
<p>effectively ostracized and isolated from and by mainstream society. Such isolation has been 
</p>
<p>reported to occur even when persons with albinism are moved into special schools such as 
</p>
<p>schools for the blind owing to their visual impairment. Such treatment even within the 
</p>
<p>community of persons with disabilities shows the pervasiveness of discrimination against 
</p>
<p>persons with albinism. 
</p>
<p>43. Given the fact that evidence such as the above has only come to the fore in the last 
</p>
<p>year, the absence of information on other regions should not be interpreted to mean that 
</p>
<p>there is no problem of discrimination, stigmatization and violence in those regions. Rather, 
</p>
<p>there should be a general presumption that there are human rights issues facing persons 
</p>
<p>with albinism in each region. That presumption can be rebutted by targeted studies in the 
</p>
<p>near future. Lack of sufficient knowledge remains a significant barrier to tackling 
</p>
<p>discrimination, stigma and violence. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Responses: successes and subsisting challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Advocacy 
</b></p>
<p>44. The documented reports of ritual killings of, and attacks against, persons with 
</p>
<p>albinism, and the many more undocumented acts of violence and discrimination they face, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>Personas con Albinismo (ALBA), Spain, see www.albinismo.es. 
</p>
<p> 34 In popular culture, particularly in literature and in film, persons with albinism are portrayed as 
</p>
<p>villains, demons, ghosts, freaks of nature, mystical anomalies or village idiots. 
</p>
<p> 35 See Azam Jah Samdani and Bahram Khan Khoso, &#8220;A unique albino village of Bhatti Tribe in rural 
</p>
<p>Sindh, Pakistan, with oculocutaneous albinism manifestations: an epidemiological study, <i>Iranian 
</i></p>
<p><i>Journal of Dermatology</i>, (Iranian Society of Dermatology, 2009), pp. 42&#8211;46. See also &#8220;Feature: 
</p>
<p>Nepal&#8217;s albinos caught between reality and myth&#8221;, (Shanghai Daily.com, 9 October 2014). </p>


<p>undoubtedly call for a more active promotion of, and advocacy for, the rights of persons 
</p>
<p>with albinism. Without strong advocacy it will be difficult to achieve concrete results at the 
</p>
<p>international and regional levels. 
</p>
<p>45. One example of such advocacy is the initiatives recently taken by OHCHR to raise 
</p>
<p>awareness and promote the protection of the rights of persons with albinism, thus 
</p>
<p>increasing the visibility of violations against the group, which until then had received little 
</p>
<p>attention from the international community. The High Commissioner&#8217;s voice, through press 
</p>
<p>statements; side-events on the margins of Human Rights Council sessions; expert meetings 
</p>
<p>such as that mentioned in paragraph 7 of the present report; and online public information 
</p>
<p>campaigns; are all tools that can be used to increase understanding and raise awareness of 
</p>
<p>albinism, all of which OHCHR has been successfully using with the aim of achieving a 
</p>
<p>consensus among States on the importance of promoting and protecting the rights of 
</p>
<p>persons with albinism and combating impunity for attacks against them. 
</p>
<p>46. Another advocacy tool that can be used to raise awareness of the human rights 
</p>
<p>situation of persons with albinism is through engaging artists in the endeavour, as they can 
</p>
<p>reach out to a greater number of people through their voices and work. In that regard, it is 
</p>
<p>noteworthy that, on 5 December 2013, Salif Keita, musician and advocate for the rights of 
</p>
<p>persons with albinism, performed at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>47. In addition to advocacy at the international level, it is equally important to engage in 
</p>
<p>advocacy at the regional level. Here the role of civil society organizations becomes very 
</p>
<p>important and their engagement with human rights mechanisms at regional level needs to 
</p>
<p>be enhanced with a view to stimulating regional responses to key human rights concerns. 
</p>
<p>Representatives of civil society organizations conducting advocacy on behalf of persons 
</p>
<p>with albinism in African countries for instance, can be supported to participate in platforms 
</p>
<p>such as the Non-govermental organization (NGO) Forum in Banjul or in discussions on 
</p>
<p>cooperation with the African Union organs, as was done by OHCHR in 2013. 
</p>
<p>48. At the national level, there are only very few instances of such advocacy that can be 
</p>
<p>referred to. For instance, the Human Rights Component of the United Nations Operation in 
</p>
<p>C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (ONUCI) has strengthened the operational and institutional capacities of one 
</p>
<p>of the albinism groups in the country, Bien-Etre des Albinos de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (BEDACI), 
</p>
<p>through a quick impact project, and has conducted training on documentation techniques of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations.36 The Human Rights Component of the United Nations Office in 
</p>
<p>Burundi (BNUB) has for its part been monitoring the situation of people with albinism in 
</p>
<p>the country. Human rights advisers can also be another good option for advocacy as they 
</p>
<p>can be instrumental in promoting a more active role of key stakeholders in the protection of 
</p>
<p>persons with albinism, including the United Nations Country Team, the national human 
</p>
<p>rights institution and the relevant authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Assistance to victims 
</b></p>
<p>49. The United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, managed by OHCHR, is 
</p>
<p>a concrete way to care for the survivors of attacks and their family members. It provides 
</p>
<p>direct assistance to victims of torture and their family members through grants awarded to 
</p>
<p>non-governmental channels of assistance, including NGOs, rehabilitation centres, 
</p>
<p>associations of victims and family members. In 2014, the Fund awarded a grant, through its 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 36 See ONUCI replies to the Advisory Committee questionnaire, available from 
</p>
<p>www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/AdvisoryCommittee/Pages/AttacksAgainstPersonsWithAlbinis
</p>
<p>m.aspx. </p>


<p>intersessional emergency procedure, to the non-governmental organization Under The 
</p>
<p>Same Sun in Tanzania, for the provision of medical rehabilitation (prosthetic work) and 
</p>
<p>psychological assistance to several identified victims, both men and women, mutilated 
</p>
<p>during attacks. The financial support to that victim-focused project has been renewed by the 
</p>
<p>Fund for 2015 so as to extend the specialized assistance provided by the project to an 
</p>
<p>additional number of victims and their families. 
</p>
<p><b> C. International human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>50. Various human rights mechanisms, notably the Human Rights Council, including 
</p>
<p>the universal periodic review and treaty monitoring bodies have addressed the situation of 
</p>
<p>persons with albinism. Some examples of the recommendations made in 2014 are listed 
</p>
<p>below. 
</p>
<p>51. In April 2014, during the review of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire under the universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review (UPR), Spain expressed concern regarding discrimination against persons with 
</p>
<p>albinism and made the following recommendation which enjoyed the support of the 
</p>
<p>country: &#8220;To take concrete measures to protect the rights of people with albinism, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the recommendations made by the Office of the High Commissioner, and 
</p>
<p>raise awareness among society about their situation.&#8221;37 
</p>
<p>52. Also in April 2014, during the UPR of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
</p>
<p>Guatemala shared the concern of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights38 
</p>
<p>about the killing of persons with albinism and the use of their organs for witchcraft 
</p>
<p>ceremonies. The following recommendation, which enjoyed the support of the country, was 
</p>
<p>made: &#8220;To combat all forms of discrimination against persons with albinism&#8221;.39 
</p>
<p>53. In June 2014, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in its list of issues for 
</p>
<p>Tanzania, requested the State Party to:  
</p>
<p>indicate whether a comprehensive strategy has been put in place to stop the gross 
</p>
<p>violations of the right to life, survival and development of children with albinism in 
</p>
<p>the State party. In particular, please provide precise and detailed information on: (a) 
</p>
<p>The educational and awareness&#8211;raising measures undertaken and currently being 
</p>
<p>conducted by the State party to overcome traditional beliefs causing stigma and 
</p>
<p>discrimination against children with albinism leading to killings and a wide range of 
</p>
<p>violence against them; (b) The measures adopted to prevent, investigate and punish 
</p>
<p>crimes against children with albinism, including the use of their body parts for 
</p>
<p>witchcraft and to provide redress to victims; (c) The measures taken to improve the 
</p>
<p>living and safety conditions in the centres where these children are placed, to ensure 
</p>
<p>that they are not subject to degrading treatment or abuse in these centres, to 
</p>
<p>adequately train staff and hold them accountable for any professional misconduct, 
</p>
<p>and to ensure regular supervision and control of these centres; (d) Any pilot 
</p>
<p>initiative aimed at preventing the placement of these children and/ or to encourage 
</p>
<p>the reunification of children with albinism with their families, when possible.40 
</p>
<p>54. In its concluding observations on the periodic report of Swaziland of July 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women expressed concern  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 37 A/HRC/27/6, recommendation 127.103. 
</p>
<p> 38 E/C.12/COD/CO/4. 
</p>
<p> 39 A/HRC/27/5, recommendation 134.47. 
</p>
<p> 40 CRC/C/TZA/Q/3-5, para. 8. </p>


<p>at the gruesome murders of women and girls with albinism, whose body parts are 
</p>
<p>harvested for rituals. The Committee is particularly concerned at reports that, in the 
</p>
<p>past, perpetrators of such murders were prosecuted for less-serious crimes, such as 
</p>
<p>causing grievous bodily harm, and therefore received lenient sentences upon 
</p>
<p>conviction. The Committee recommends that the State party urgently establish a 
</p>
<p>national register of persons with albinism and provide protection to women and girls 
</p>
<p>with albinism. The State party should ensure that all complaints relating to violence 
</p>
<p>against women and girls with albinism are effectively investigated and perpetrators 
</p>
<p>prosecuted and punished with appropriate sanctions upon conviction.41 
</p>
<p>55. In October 2014, in its concluding observations on the periodic report of Burundi, 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Committee requested the State Party to continue its efforts to protect 
</p>
<p>persons with albinism against any form of discrimination, including physical attacks, and to 
</p>
<p>find sustainable solutions guaranteeing their access to health care, social services, 
</p>
<p>employment and education.42 
</p>
<p>56. The Human Rights Council, in June 2014, adopted resolution 26/10 without a vote, 
</p>
<p>recommending that the General Assembly proclaim 13 June as International Albinism 
</p>
<p>Awareness Day. The date is symbolic, as the first global resolution on attacks and 
</p>
<p>discrimination against persons with albinism was adopted by the Human Rights Council on 
</p>
<p>that date in 2013. The initiative provides a platform through which stakeholders can raise 
</p>
<p>public awareness on this pressing human rights issue. The resolution recognizes the 
</p>
<p>importance of increasing awareness and understanding of albinism in the fight against 
</p>
<p>global discrimination against, and stigmatization of, persons with albinism. The day was 
</p>
<p>called for by some NGOs serving persons with albinism, particularly those based in 
</p>
<p>countries were there have been records of attacks. It has also been welcomed by an 
</p>
<p>overwhelming majority of a cross-regional listing of NGOs serving persons with albinism 
</p>
<p>worldwide. Following the recommendation made by the Council, on 18 November 2014, 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly proclaimed 13 June as International Albinism Awareness Day. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Regional human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>57. As a very significant step at the African regional level, on 5 November 2013, the 
</p>
<p>African Commission of Human and People&#8217;s Rights adopted resolution 263 on the 
</p>
<p>prevention of attacks and discrimination against persons with albinism. Among other 
</p>
<p>things, the resolution requires member States to include in their reports to the African 
</p>
<p>Commission information on the situation of persons with albinism, including good 
</p>
<p>practices in protecting and promoting their rights. 
</p>
<p>58. Also in November 2013, at its twenty-second ordinary session held in Addis Ababa, 
</p>
<p>the African Committee on the Rights and Welfare of the Child considered the issue of 
</p>
<p>albinism and adopted a Declaration on Ending Discrimination and Violence against Girls in 
</p>
<p>Africa, in which the situation of children with albinism was addressed. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Challenges 
</b></p>
<p>59. Despite the above strides, there remain a number of challenges to a more active 
</p>
<p>engagement with human rights mechanisms. They are detailed below, amongst other 
</p>
<p>challenges to ensuring an adequate response to the issue: 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 41 CEDAW/C/SWZ/CO/1-2, paras. 22&#8211;23. 
</p>
<p> 42 CCPR/C/BDI/CO/2. </p>


<p>(a) Limited knowledge of the issue and its impact on the enjoyment of human 
</p>
<p>rights by persons with albinism; 
</p>
<p>(b) Limited knowledge and capacity of associations of persons with albinism 
</p>
<p>around the world to engage with human rights mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>(c) Little information, scarce data and incomplete reports on cases of 
</p>
<p>discrimination on specific grounds; 
</p>
<p>(d) Scarcity of reliable data on cases of killings of and attacks43 against persons 
</p>
<p>with albinism in countries other than Burundi, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire or Tanzania, where there is a 
</p>
<p>higher prevalence of albinism, but also a more active and better skilled civil society. The 
</p>
<p>lack of information makes it difficult for potentially relevant special procedures mandate-
</p>
<p>holders to give attention to the issue within their respective mandates, including the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteurs on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, on 
</p>
<p>racism and related intolerance, education, disability, health, violence against women and 
</p>
<p>violence against children. Similarly, the secrecy surrounding witchcraft and the 
</p>
<p>underground nature of the market associated with the trafficking of persons and organs 
</p>
<p>make it difficult to find evidence relevant to the mandates of the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>sale of children and the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons; 
</p>
<p>(e) Further, the scope of certain special procedures mandates prevents the 
</p>
<p>mandate-holders from addressing the issue. For example, persons with albinism do not fall 
</p>
<p>under the internationally accepted definition of minorities, which is limited to national, 
</p>
<p>ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities,44 and do not fall therefore within the scope of the 
</p>
<p>mandate of the Special Rapporteur on minority issues. While the definition of &#8220;minority&#8221; is 
</p>
<p>currently under review, it is unclear at this point whether the new definition will 
</p>
<p>accommodate persons with albinism; 
</p>
<p>(f) Human rights challenges associated with albinism are multi-layered and are 
</p>
<p>not currently being addressed in a comprehensive and sustainable manner by any human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanism. In addition to the fact that they do not fall within the scope of the current 
</p>
<p>definition of minorities, persons with albinism often suffer from poor eyesight and are 
</p>
<p>prone to developing skin cancer, but cannot or would not want to be classified as persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities, as that would mean adding another layer of labelling and discrimination to 
</p>
<p>which they may be subjected. They are attacked and tortured, and their body parts and 
</p>
<p>organs are trafficked and sold owing to the myths and misconceptions surrounding 
</p>
<p>albinism. Yet the protection afforded to persons with albinism by international human 
</p>
<p>rights treaties does not cater for their special needs or the complexities they face, while 
</p>
<p>existing special procedures can only partly address the situation of persons with albinism 
</p>
<p>from a particular and limited angle to the extent that the scope of their mandates allows. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Findings and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>60. Persons with albinism have special needs. In addition to issues pertaining to the 
</p>
<p>rights to life and security of person, it is necessary to address their special needs in terms of 
</p>
<p>education due to their poor eyesight as well as their special health needs, particularly in the 
</p>
<p>area of skin cancer prevention. The situation of human rights of persons with albinism 
</p>
<p>should therefore be addressed in a holistic manner. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 43 It should be noted that ritual killings and attacks remain undocumented and unreported, owing to the 
</p>
<p>code of silence surrounding such crimes and the vulnerability of the targeted population. 
</p>
<p> 44 See United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious 
</p>
<p>and Linguistic Minorities, adopted by General Assembly resolution 47/135 of 18 December 1992. </p>


<p>The severity of the violations of the human rights of persons with albinism and the 
</p>
<p>particular vulnerability of that segment of the population requires States not only to take a 
</p>
<p>more active role to protect them, but also to take effective measures to eradicate poverty 
</p>
<p>and improve enjoyment by persons with albinism of all their rights. 
</p>
<p>61. There is increased engagement of international and regional mechanisms with the 
</p>
<p>issue of persons with albinism. Efforts however continue to be fragmented and only 
</p>
<p>partially address the complexity of the human rights challenges that persons with albinism 
</p>
<p>face. A more sustainable response, to bridge protection gaps and to ensure accountability 
</p>
<p>for human rights violations committed against persons with albinism, is required. 
</p>
<p><b> A. States 
</b></p>
<p>62. States are the prime guardians of the human rights of all persons within their 
</p>
<p>jurisdictions. States should have protection measures against practices such as attacks 
</p>
<p>against persons with albinism and should comply with their international obligations 
</p>
<p>concerning human rights, which are enshrined in both local laws and international human 
</p>
<p>rights legal instruments. With regard to the latter, special mention should be made of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child (see in particular articles 19 to 23), the Convention 
</p>
<p>against Torture, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The existing body of international human rights law 
</p>
<p>in terms of general human rights, standards on non-discrimination, equality and human 
</p>
<p>dignity require effective implementation so as to protect and preserve the rights to life and 
</p>
<p>to security of persons with albinism, as well as their right not to be subjected to 
</p>
<p>discrimination, torture and ill-treatment.45 
</p>
<p>63. Clear laws criminalizing and punishing acts of violence against persons with 
</p>
<p>albinism should be enacted. States need to clarify ambiguities where they exist in laws 
</p>
<p>relating to witchcraft and traditional health practice, including through the effective 
</p>
<p>regulation of the licenses of traditional healers and witchdoctor and a clear ban on the use 
</p>
<p>of harmful practices. Attacks against persons with albinism should also be considered as an 
</p>
<p>aggravated form of the crime, incurring a more severe punishment so that additional 
</p>
<p>deterrence may be achieved.46 
</p>
<p>64. It should be stressed that simply promulgating laws is not enough to prevent 
</p>
<p>violence. They should be implemented. Current laws against assault and murder tend to 
</p>
<p>provide persons with albinism with minimum protection of their rights to life and security 
</p>
<p>of person. Without effective implementation of those laws, States may become complicit in 
</p>
<p>such attacks by enabling a reign of impunity and perpetuating fear of attack in the lives of 
</p>
<p>persons with albinism. Hence, laws should be accompanied by concrete measures that 
</p>
<p>would facilitate their implementation, such as advocacy and the training of law enforcement 
</p>
<p>personnel and judicial authorities. 
</p>
<p>65. In order to respond to violence and discrimination against persons with albinism and 
</p>
<p>address their root causes, a multipronged and holistic approach is necessary, involving 
</p>
<p>protection and accountability measures in addition to broad public education campaigns.47 
</p>

</p>
<p>Forward, 24 September 2014 (see footnote 15), para. 52. </p>


<p>Accountability measures should include successful prosecution and the guarantee of redress 
</p>
<p>in the form of compensation and rehabilitation. 
</p>
<p>66. States should fight impunity and ensure that cases of violence and attacks are 
</p>
<p>prosecuted successfully. Publicizing the verdicts of prosecutions will serve as deterrence 
</p>
<p>and, in effect, protect persons with albinism while granting them legal redress and justice 
</p>
<p>for the attacks. Ensuring registration of birth is also an important measure in the fight 
</p>
<p>against impunity, as it will remove the invisibility of children with albinism. It is equally 
</p>
<p>indispensable to evaluate the needs of persons with albinism and plan for the basic social 
</p>
<p>services to which they are entitled.48 
</p>
<p>67. The protective role of the family should be supported. Parents and caregivers, as 
</p>
<p>well as members of the extended family, play a central role in the protection of children 
</p>
<p>with albinism. They need to be sensitized and engaged. There is also a need to empower 
</p>
<p>children to prevent and address incidents of violence against them.49 
</p>
<p>68. Active public education and awareness-raising campaigns must be launched and 
</p>
<p>sustained. Given the powerful potential of such campaigns for dispelling superstition and 
</p>
<p>misinformation about albinism, they remain indispensable tools for curbing violations of 
</p>
<p>the human rights of persons with albinism. They should aim at combating prejudice, 
</p>
<p>superstition, misconception and stigma, with a view to diminishing the multiple and 
</p>
<p>intersecting forms of discrimination affecting persons with albinism. States bear the 
</p>
<p>ultimate responsibility for such attitudes and practices. A gradual approach may be adopted, 
</p>
<p>by which States would first target specific key groups such as law enforcement officers, 
</p>
<p>members of the judiciary, educators, social workers, medical service providers, and the 
</p>
<p>families and communities of persons with albinism. Further, it is important that States 
</p>
<p>include in their educational curricula, in a standardized manner, courses to instruct people 
</p>
<p>on the rights of persons with albinism.50 
</p>
<p>69. In raising awareness of the problems through the mass media, both traditional and 
</p>
<p>social media will be crucial in highlighting the issues faced by persons with albinism, 
</p>
<p>including marginalization, stigmatization and discrimination, and could also contribute 
</p>
<p>positively to protecting their rights by directing public opinion to the core of the problem, 
</p>
<p>sensitizing the population and collectively searching for a solution to help protect persons 
</p>
<p>with albinism. Television campaigns to demystify perceptions about persons with albinism 
</p>
<p>and promote positive stories about them are one of the tools that could be used. 
</p>
<p>70. Greater attention will need to be given to supporting community level public 
</p>
<p>campaigns through a wider use of community radio. When planning and implementing 
</p>
<p>community level responses, there is a need to take into consideration the prominent 
</p>
<p>community role played by traditional health practitioners involved in witchcraft.51 
</p>
<p>71. Resources, both financial and otherwise, are important for the success of any effort 
</p>
<p>to improve the lives of persons with albinism. Taking into consideration that persons with 
</p>
<p>albinism are disproportionately affected by poverty, owing to the discrimination and 
</p>
<p>marginalization they face, there is a need for resources to develop activities designed to 
</p>
<p>decrease and eliminate prejudice and create an environment conducive to respect for their 
</p>
<p>rights and dignity. 
</p>
<p>72. There is a need for a comprehensive strategy to guarantee the protection of persons 
</p>
<p>with albinism, notably in those countries where attacks have been reported. Such a strategy 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 48 Ibid., para. 63. 
</p>
<p> 49 Ibid., paras. 66&#8211;67. 
</p>
<p> 50 Ibid., para. 57. 
</p>
<p> 51 Ibid., para. 60. </p>


<p>should be developed and implemented in coordination with, and with the support of, State 
</p>
<p>authorities, various sectors of society, key stakeholders and civil society, as well as persons 
</p>
<p>with albinism. Key non-governmental organizations such as Under The Same Sun and the 
</p>
<p>World Albinism Alliance are important actors in that endeavour. 
</p>
<p>73. The commitment of all stakeholders to combat violence and discrimination against 
</p>
<p>persons with albinism is critical. It is important to involve religious leaders who are well 
</p>
<p>respected and influential in their communities and are in a position to provide followers 
</p>
<p>with guidance on the issue of respect for the human rights and dignity of persons with 
</p>
<p>albinism.52 
</p>
<p><b> B. International community 
</b></p>
<p>74. International and regional mechanisms should continue to give the necessary 
</p>
<p>attention to the issue. Some of its facets can be integrated across existing human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, but credible data on cases of attacks and discrimination in several countries 
</p>
<p>are few and far between or not entirely reliable.53 Action should be taken to gather such 
</p>
<p>information in order to put in place effective preventive and remedial action. Gathering 
</p>
<p>information should be an independent process and ought not to be expected of existing 
</p>
<p>special procedures mandate holders, as it is beyond their current scope and capacity. 
</p>
<p>75. Therefore it is necessary to consider setting up a specific dedicated mechanism to 
</p>
<p>work on ending violence against persons with albinism and the structural and multi-layered 
</p>
<p>discrimination they face. A large number of the answers to the questionnaire of the 
</p>
<p>Advisory Committee called for the establishment of such a mechanism. A call for a specific 
</p>
<p>and dedicated special procedure was also made by the participants at the expert meeting. 
</p>
<p>76. The special procedure would initiate and foster a holistic approach to the issue. 
</p>
<p>Further, the mandate-holder would have better access to information, improved 
</p>
<p>understanding of albinism both regionally and globally, and could initiate as well as follow 
</p>
<p>up on concrete measures taken on the ground, through regular field visits and cooperation 
</p>
<p>with authorities, civil society and other key stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>77. In conclusion, a dedicated special procedure mandate would be a first step towards 
</p>
<p>ensuring an effective, comprehensive and more sustainable response to the human rights 
</p>
<p>violations faced by persons with albinism.
