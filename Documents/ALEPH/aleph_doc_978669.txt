Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Newmont” or the “Company") are unaudited. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation of these interim statements have
been included. The Company has evaluated all subsequent events through October 28, 2009. The results reported in
these interim statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be reported for the entire year. These
interim statements should be read in conjunction with Newmont’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year
ended December 31, 2008 included in its Form 8-K, filed September 15, 2009. The year»end balance sheet data was
derived from the audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by US. generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).

References to “ASS” refer to Australian currency, “039" to Canadian currency, “IDFI” to Indonesian currency, “NZ$"
to New Zealand currency and “$" to United States currency.
NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

The Accounting Standards Codification

In June 2009, the FinanCial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) established the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) as the single source of authoritative GAAP to be applied by nongovernmental entities. The ASC
is a new structure which took existing accounting pronouncements and organized them by accounting topic. Relevant
authoritative literature issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and select SEC staff
interpretations and administrative literature was also included in the ASC. All other accounting guidance not included
in the ASC is non»authoritative. The ASC was effective for the Company’s interim quarterly period beginning July 1,
2009. The adoption of the ASC did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Subsequent Events

In May 2009, the ASC guidance for subsequent events was updated to establish accounting and reporting
standards for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are
available to be issued. The update sets forth: (i) the period after the balance sheet date during which management of
a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the
financial statements, (ii) the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring
after the balance sheet in its financial statements, and (iii) the disclosures that an entity should make about events or
transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements. The Company adopted the updated
guidance for the interim period ended June 30, 2009. The adoption had no impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

In December 2008, the ASC guidance for retirement benefits was updated to expand the requirements of
employers’ disclosures about post»retirement benefit plan assets in a defined benefit pension or other post-retirement
plan. The objective is to require more detailed disclosures about employers' plan assets, including employers’
investment strategies, major categories of plan assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets, and valuation
techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets. The Company adopted the updated guidance on
January 1, 2009. These disclosures are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes.

Equity Method Investments

In November 2008, the ASC guidance for equity method and joint venture investments was updated to clarify
the accounting for certain transactions and impairment considerations involving equity method investments. The
intent is to provide guidance on: (i) determining the initial measurement of an equity method investment,
(ii) recogniZing other-than» temporary impairments of an equity method investment and (iii) accounting for an equity
method investee’s issuance of shares. The updated guidance was eﬂective for the Company's fiscal year beginning
January 1, 2009 and was applied prospectively. The adoption had no impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

Equity-Linked Financial Instruments

In June 2008, the ASC guidance for derivatives and hedging when accounting lor contracts in an entity's own
equity was updated to clarify the determination of whether an instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to an
entity’s own stock which would qualify as a scope exception from hedge accounting. The updated guidance was
eﬂective lor the Company's liscal year beginning January 1, 2009. The adoption had no impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial poSition or results of operations.

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments

In May 2008, the ASC guidance was updated for convertible debt instruments that, by their stated terms, may be
settled in cash (or other assets) upon conversion, including partial cash settlement, unless the embedded conversion
option is required to be separately accounted for as a derivative. The update requires that the liability and equity
components of convertible debt instruments within the scope be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects
the entity's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. This requires an allocation of convertible debt proceeds between the
liability component and the embedded conversion option (i.e., the equity component). The difference between the
principal amount ol the debt and the amount of the proceeds allocated to the liability component is reported as a debt
discount and subsequently amortized to earnings over the instruments expected life using the effective interest
method. The updated guidance required retrospective application to all periods presented.

During July 2007, the Company completed an olfering of $1,150 convertible senior notes due 2014 and 2017,
each in the amount of $575. The 2014 notes, maturing on July 15,2014, pay interest semi-annually at a rate 01
1.25% per annum, and the 2017 notes, maturing on July 15, 2017, pay interest semi»annually at a rate of 1.625% per
annum. The notes are convertible, at the holders option, equivalent to a conversion price of $46.21 per share of
common stock (24,887,956 shares of common stock). In connection with the convertible senior notes olfering, the
Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions (“Call Spread Transactions").
The Call Spread Transactions included the purchase of call options and the sale 01 warrants. As a result of the Call
Spread Transactions, the conversion price of $46.21 was elfectively increased to $60.27. At September 30, 2009, the
if-converted value did not exceed the principal amounts.

During February 2009, the Company completed an offering of $518 convertible senior notes due on
February 15, 2012. The notes will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.00% per annum. The notes are
convertible, at the holder's option, equivalent to a conversion price of $46.25 per share 01 common stock (11,189,189
shares of common stock). At September 30, 2009, the if-converted value did not exceed the principal amount.

The Company recorded the following in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the convertible
senior notes:

At September 30, 2009 At December 31, 2008

2012 2014 2017 2012 2014 2017

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

As a result of adopting the updated guidance, the effective interest rates increased by approximately
5 percentage points to 8.5%, 6.0% and 6.25% for the 2012,2014 and 2017 notes, respectively, for the non»cash
amortization of the debt discount over the lives of the notes. Interest expense was increased by $9 which decreased
the Company’s Income from continuing operations and Net Income by $5 ($0.01 per share) lor the three months
ended September 30, 2008. Interest expense was increased by $25 which decreased the Company's Income from
continuing operations and Net income by $16 ($0.03 per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2008. Had
the update been effective in 2008, the Company would have charged its lourth quarter 2008 dividends to Additional
paid-in capital rather than Retained earnings ; therefore the Company made the reclassification in 2009. Cash flows
from operations were not impacted by the adoption of the updated guidance. The impact on the Company’s 2009
opening balance in Retained earnings was as lollows:

At December 31,

2008
Balance belore application of updated guidance $ 7
Impact of adoption of updated guidance (31)
Reclassification of dividends to Additional paid-in capital 28
Balance after application of updated guidance 39 4

For the three months ended September 30, 2009, the Company recorded $8 and $15 of interest expense tor the
contractual interest coupon and amortization ol the debt discount, respectively, related to the convertible senior
notes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, the Company recorded $22 and $41 of interest expense for
the contractual interest coupon and amortization of the debt discount, respectively, related to the convertible senior
notes. The remaining unamortized debt discount is amortized over the remaining 3, 5 and 8 year periods of the 2012,
2014 and 2017 convertible senior notes, respectively.

Accounting for the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

In April 2008, the ASC guidance for Goodwill and Other Intangibles was updated to amend the factors that
should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the uselul Iile 01 a
recognized intangible asset. The intent 01 this update is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a
recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under
guidance for business combinations. The updated guidance was effective for the Company's liscal year beginning
January 1, 2009 and was applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date. The adoption
had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Derivative Instruments

In March 2008, the ASC guidance for derivatives and hedging was updated for enhanced disclosures about how
and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and the related hedged items are
accounted for, and how derivative instruments and the related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
financial perlormance and cash Ilows. The Company adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2009. The
adoption had no impact on the Company's consolidated finanCiaI position, results ol operations or cash flows. See
Note 16 for the Company’s derivative instruments disclosure.

Business Combinations

In December 2007, the ASC guidance for business combinations was updated to provide new guidance Ior
recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree. The updated guidance also provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the Iinancial
statements to evaluate the nature and financial ellects of the business combination. The Company adopted the
updated guidance on January 1, 2009 and applied it to the acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in the
Boddington project completed on June 25, 2009 (see Note 14).

In April 2009, the guidance was updated to address application issues on initial recognition and measurement,
subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure ol assets and liabilities arising lrom contingencies in a
business combination. This update is effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The adoption of the updated guidance did
not have any impact on the Company's acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in the Boddington project
completed on June 25, 2009 (see Note 14).

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Noncontrolling Interests

In December 2007, the ASC guidance for Noncontrolling Interests was updated to establish accounting and
reporting standards pertaining to: (i) ownership interests in subSidiaries held by parties other than the parent
(“noncontrolling interest"), (ii) the amount of net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest,
(iii) changes in a parent’s ownership interest, and (iv) the valuation of any retained noncontrolling equity investment
when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. If a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment
in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value and a gain or loss is recognized in net income based on such fair
value. For presentation and disclosure purposes, the guidance requires noncontrolling interests to be classified as a
separate component 01 equity. The Company adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2009. Except for
presentation changes, the adoption had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Fair Value Accounting

In September 2006, the ASC guidance for fair value measurements and disclosure was updated to deline fair
value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, and expand disclosures about fair value measurements. The
Company adopted the updated guidance tor assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on
January 1, 2008. In February 2008, the FASB staff issued an update to the guidance which delayed the elfective
date tor nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a nonrecurring basis. The Company adopted the updated guidance for the Company's nonfinancial
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on January 1, 2009.

In April 2009, the guidance was further updated to prOVide additional guidance on determining lair value when
the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying circumstances
that indicate when a transaction is not orderly. In April 2009, the guidance tor investments in debt and equity
securities was updated to: (i) clarify the interaction 01 the factors that should be considered when determining
whether a debt security is other than temporarily impaired, (ii) pI'OVlde guidance on the amount of an other»than-
temporary impairment recognized tor a debt security in earnings and other comprehensive income and (iii) expand
the disclosures required tor other»than-temporary impairments for debt and equity securities. Also in April 2009, the
guidance tor linancial instruments was updated to require disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments for
interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual finanCial statements. Adoption 01 this
updated guidance was required for the Company’s interim reporting period beginning April 1, 2009 With early
adoption permitted. The Company adopted the updated guidance lor the interim period ended March 31, 2009. Refer
to Note 15 for further details regarding the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Fair Value Accounting

In August 2009, the ASC guidance for fair value measurements and disclosure was updated to further deline fair
value of liabilities. This update provides clarification lor circumstances in which: (i) a quoted price in an active market
for the identical liability is not available, (ii) the liability has a restriction that prevents its transfer, and (iii) the identical
liability is traded as an asset in an active market in which no adjustments to the quoted price of an asset are required.
The updated guidance is eﬂective tor the Company's interim reporting period beginning October 1, 2009. The
Company is evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on the Company's consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

Variable Interest Entities

In June 2009, the ASC guidance for consolidation accounting was updated to require an entity to perform a
qualitative analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest gives it a controlling linancial interest in a
variable interest entity (“VIE”). This analysis identifies a primary beneficiary of a VIE as the entity that has both Of the
lolloWing characteristics: (i) the power to direct the activities 01 a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's

NOTE 8 INCOME TAXES

The Company operates in numerous countries around the world and accordingly it is subject to, and pays
annual income taxes under, the various income tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. Some of these tax
regimes are defined by contractual agreements With the local government, and others are defined by the general
corporate income tax laws of the country. The Company has historically filed, and continues to file, all required
income tax returns and paid the taxes reasonably determined to be due. The tax rules and regulations in many
countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation. From time to time, the Company is subject to a review of
its historic income tax filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over
the interpretation or application of certain rules to the Company’s business conducted within the country involved. At
September 30, 2009, the Company's total unrecognized tax benefit was $120 for uncertain tax positions taken or
expected to be taken on tax returns. Of this, $93 represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if
recognized, would aﬂect the Company’s effective income tax rate. Also included in the balance at September 30,
2009 is $12 of tax positions that, due to the impact of deferred tax accounting, the potential disallowance of which
would not aﬂect the annual effective tax rate.

In April 2009, the United States Tax Court issued an opinion for Santa Fe Pacific Gold Company and
Subsidiaries (“Santa Fe"), by and through its successor in interest, Newmont USA Limited, a member of the
Newmont Mining Corporation (“Newmont”) affiliated group. The Tax Court ruled in favor of Santa Fe regarding the
deductibility of a termination fee that had been paid in 1997 as part of a merger agreement. At September 30, 2009,
Newmont had not been notified by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (“Commissioner”) regarding a
deCision to appeal the Tax Court Ruling. If the Commissioner does not file an appeal, the Company Will be
decreasing its liability and accrued interest for uncertain income tax positions in the fourth quarter of 2009.

As a result of (i) statute of limitations that expire in the next 12 months in various jurisdictions, (ii) the eﬂects of
the aforementioned closure with respect to the Santa Fe matters described above and (iii) possible settlements of
audit»related issues With taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, the Company believes that it is reasonably
possible that the total amount of its net unrecognized income tax benefits will decrease by approximately $55 to $87
in the next 12 months.

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

In July 2007 and February 2009, Newmont issued $1,150 and $518, respectively, of convertible notes that, if
converted in the future, would have a potentially dilutive elfect on the Company's stock. Under the indenture lor the
convertible notes, upon conversion Newmont is required to settle the principal amount of the convertible notes in
cash and may elect to settle the remaining conversion obligation (stock price in excess 01 the conversion price) in
cash, shares or a combination thereof. The eﬂect ol contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per
share is calculated under the net share settlement method in accordance With accounting guidance lor earnings per
share. Under the net share settlement method, the Company includes the amount 01 shares it would take to satisfy
the conversion obligation, assuming that all of the convertible notes are surrendered. The average closing price ol
the Company’s common stock for each of the periods presented is used as the basis for determining dilution. The
average price of the Company's common stock lor all periods presented did not exceed the conversion price of
$46.25 and $46.21 for the notes issued in 2009 and 2007, respectively, and therefore, did not have a dilutive effect
on earnings per share.

In connection with the 2007 convertible senior notes offering, the Company entered into Call Spread
Transactions. These transactions included the purchase of call options and the sale of warrants. As a result 01 the
Call Spread Transactions, the conversion price 01 $46.21 was effectively increased to $60.27. Should the warrant
transactions become dilutive to the Company’s earnings per share (i.e. Newmont’s share price exceeds $60.27) the
underlying shares will be included in the computation ol diluted income per common share.

The following table summarizes the consideration to acquire the remaining interest in Boddington:

Cash $ 742
Cash and/or common shares 24o
Contingent consideration (fair value) 62

$ 1,044

The Company estimates that the fair value of the contingent consideration is approximately $62, and recognized
this as part ol the purchase price at the acquisition date. Amounts are payable under the contingent royalty beginning
in the second quarter of 2010. The range of undiscounted amounts the Company could pay is between $0 and $100.
The fair value of the contingent royalty recognized was estimated by applying the income approach. See Note 15 for
a description of the key inputs used in deriVing fair value.

In connection with the acquisition, Newmont incurred transaction costs ol $67 (shown in Note 4, Other expense,
net) , including Australian stamp duties. $14 of these costs were paid at September 30, 2009. Additionally, in
June 2009, Newmont paid $182 to reimburse AngloGold for its share of capital and other project expenditures from
January 1, 2009 to June 25, 2009. The reimbursement of capital expenditures is included in Properly, plan! and mine
development, net, and as Additions to property, plant and mine development on the cash flow statement.

The purchase price allocation based on the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as
follows:

Assets:

Cash $ 1
Property, plant and mine development, net 1,073
Inventories and stockpiles 7
Deferred income tax asset 23
Other assets —11
$ 1,120

Liabilities:
Accrued liabilities $ 33
Reclamation liabilities 15
Deferred income tax liability 28
76
Net assets acquired $ 1,044

In the first quarter of 2009, La Herradura (of which Newmont owns 44%) purchased a mining property near its
Mexico operation for cash consideration of $11 (Newmont’s 44% share).

The pro forma impact of all 2009 acquisitions on Net Income was not material.

In December 2007, the Company purchased approximately 70% of the common shares of Miramar Mining
Corporation (“Miramar”), which, in addition to the shares previously owned, brought the Company's interest in
Miramar to approximately 78%. During the lirst quarter of 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of
Miramar.

NOTE 15 FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING

Fair value accounting establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to
measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobsen/able inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for
identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;

Level 2 Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are obsen/able, either directly or
indirectly, lor substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and

Level 3 Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value


measuremeni and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).

The following table sets forth the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at
least annually) by level Within the lair value hierarchy. As required by accounting guidance, assets and liabilities are
classified in their entirety based on the lowest level ol input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The Company’s cash equivalent instruments are classilied within Level 1 ol the lair value hierarchy because
they are valued using quoted market prices. The cash equivalent instruments that are valued based on quoted
market prices in active markets are primarily money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities.

The Company's marketable equity securities are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and as
such are classified Within Level 1 of the lair value hierarchy. The fair value of the marketable equity securities is
calculated as the quoted market price of the marketable equity security multiplied by the quantity of shares held by
the Company.

The Company's corporate marketable debt securities are valued using quoted market prices in active markets
and as such are classilied Within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company's other marketable debt securities
include investments in asset backed commercial paper and auction rate securities. In January 2009, the investments
in the Company's asset backed commercial paper were restructured under court order. The restructuring allowed a
return of a portion of the investment and interest distribution to be made to investors. The Company estimated the
lair value of the asset backed commerCial paper using a probability of return to each class ol notes rellective ol
inlormation reviewed regarding the separate classes of securities. The auction rate securities are traded in markets
that are not active, trade infrequently and have little price transparency. The Company estimated the fair value of the
auction rate securities based on weighted average risk calculations. The asset backed commercial paper and auction

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)
NOTE 27 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
General

The Company follows loss contingency accounting guidance in determining its accruals and disclosures With
respect to loss contingencies other than tax contingencies provided for in accordance with income tax accounting
guidance (see Note 8). Accordingly, estimated losses from loss contingencies are accrued by a charge to income
when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable (greater than a
75% probability) that a liability could be incurred and the amount 01 the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal
expenses associated with the contingency are expensed as incurred. If a loss contingency is not probable or
reasonably estimable, disclosure of the loss contingency is made in the linancial statements when it is at least
reasonably possible that a material loss could be incurred.

Operating Segments

The Company’s operating segments are identified in Note 25. Except as noted in this paragraph, all of the
Company's commitments and contingencies specilically described in this Note 27 relate to the Corporate and Other
reportable segment. The Nevada Operations matters under Newmont USA Limited relate to the North America
reportable segment. The PT Newmont Minahasa Raya matters relate to the Asia Pacific reportable segment. The
Yanacocha matters relate to the South America reportable segment. The Newmont Yandal Operations Pty Limited
matter relates to the Asia Pacific reportable segment. The PTNNT matters relate to the Asia Pacific reportable
segment.

Environmental Matters

The Company's mining and exploration actiVities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the
protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming
more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment and
believes its operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The Company
has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot
predict the lull amount of such future expenditures.

Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. At September 30,
2008 and December 31, 2008, $624 and $594, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to mineral
properties in accordance with asset retirement obligation accounting guidance. The current portions of $53 and $58
at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, are included in Other current liabilities.

In addition, the Company is involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with
former mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the
various sites involved. The Company believes that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites
are similar in nature with respect to the development 01 remediation plans, their risk profile and the compliance
required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon the Company's best estimate of its liability lor these
matters, $153 and $163 were accrued for such obligations at September 30,2009 and December 31, 2008,
respectively. These amounts are included in Other current liabilities and Reclamation and remediation liabilities.
Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the
liability lor these matters could be as much as 135% greater or 7% lower than the amount accrued at September 30,
2009. The amounts accrued lor these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances
available at the time. Changes in estimates are recorded in Other expense, nelin the period estimates are revised.

Details about certain of the more significant matters involved are discussed below.

Dawn Mining Company LLC (“Dawn”) — 51% Newman! Owned

Midnite Mine Site. Dawn previously leased an open pit uranium mine, currently inactive, on the Spokane Indian
Reservation in the State of Washington. The mine site is subject to regulation by agenCies of the U.S. Department 01
Interior (the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Land Management), as well as the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”).

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

In 1991, Dawn's mining lease at the mine was terminated. As a result, Dawn was required to tile a formal mine
closure and reclamation plan. The Department of Interior commenced an analysis of Dawn’s proposed plan and
alternate closure and reclamation plans for the mine. Work on this analysis has been suspended indelinitely. In mid-
2000, the mine was included on the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). In March 2003, the EPA notilied Dawn and Newmont that it had thus far
expended $12 on the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (“RI/FS") under CERCLA. In October 2005, the EPA
issued the Rl/FS on this property in which it indicated a prelerred remedy that it estimated to cost approximately
$150. Newmont and Dawn liled comments on the RI/FS with the EPA in January 2006. On October 3, 2006, the EPA
issued a Iinal Record of Decision in which it formally selected the preferred remedy identified in the RI/FS.

On January 28, 2005, the EPA filed a lawsuit against Dawn and Newmont under CERCLA in the US. District
Court for the Eastern District of Washington. The EPA has asserted that Dawn and Newmont are liable for
reclamation or remediation work and costs at the mine. Dawn does not have suﬂicient funds to pay for the
reclamation plan it proposed or for any alternate plan, or for any additional remediation work or costs at the mine.

On July 14, 2008, after a bench trial, the Court held Newmont liable under CERCLA as an “operator” of the
Midnite Mine. The Court preViously ruled on summary judgment that both the US. Government and Dawn were liable
under CERCLA. On October 17, 2008 the Court issued its written decision in the bench trial. The Court lound Dawn
and Newmont jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for past and future response costs, and ruled that each 01
Dawn and Newmont are responsible to pay one»third of such costs. The Court also found the US. Government liable
on Dawn's and Newmont’s contribution claim, and ruled that the U.S. Government is responsible to pay one-third of
all past and luture response costs. In November 2008, all parties appealed the Court's ruling. Also in
November 2008, the EPA issued an Administrative Order pursuant to Section 106 01 CERCLA ordering Dawn and
Newmont to conduct water treatment, testing and other preliminary remedial actions. Newmont has initiated those
preliminary remedial actions. However, the issue of whether the EPA's current prelerred remedy is consistent with
the National Contingency Plan has not yet come before the Court.

Newmont intends to continue to vigorously defend this matter and cannot reasonably predict the outcome of this
lawsuit or the likelihood of any other action against Dawn or Newmont arising from this matter.

Dawn Mill Site. Dawn also owns a uranium mill site facility, located on private land near Ford, Washington,
which is subject to state and lederal regulation. In late 1999, Dawn sought and later received approval from the State
of Washington for a revised closure plan that expedites the reclamation process at the site. The currently approved
plan for the site is guaranteed by Newmont.

Newmont Canada Limited (“Newmont Canada") — 100% Newman! Owned

On November 11, 2008, St. Andrew Goldfields Ltd. (“St Andrew") filed an Application in the Superior Court of
Justice in Ontario, Canada, seeking a declaration to clarify St. Andrew's royalty obligations regarding certain mineral
rights and property formerly owned by Newmont Canada and now owned by St. Andrew.

Newmont Canada purchased the property, called the Holt»McDermott property (“Holt Property"), from Barrick
Gold Corporation (“Barrick”) in October 2004. At that time, Newmont Canada entered into a royalty agreement with
Barrick (the “Barrick Royalty"), allowing Barrick to retain a royalty on the Holt Property. In August 2006, Newmont
Canada sold all oi its interests in the Holt Property to Holloway Mining Company (“Holloway”) in exchange for
common stock issued by Holloway. In September 2006, Newmont Canada entered into a purchase and sale
agreement With St. Andrew (the “2006 Agreement"), under which St. Andrew acquired all the common stock of
Holloway. In 2008, Barrick sold its Barrick Royalty to Royal Gold, Inc. (“Royal Gold").

In the court proceedings, St. Andrew alleged that in the 2006 Agreement it only agreed to assume royalty
obligations equal to 0.013% of net smelter returns from operations on the Holt Property. Such an interpretation of the
2006 Agreement would make Newmont responsible lor any royalties exceeding that amount payable to Royal Gold
pursuant to the Barrick Royalty. On July 23, 2009, the Court issued a decision finding in favor of St. Andrews’
interpretation. On August 21, 2009, Newmont Canada appealed the decision. Newmont Canada intends to continue
to vigorously defend this matter but cannot reasonably predict the outcome.

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Newmont Capital Limited (“Newmont Capital") — 100% Newmont Owned

In February 1999, the EPA placed the Lava Cap mine site in Nevada County, California on the National
Priorities List under CERCLA. The EPA then initiated a RI/FS under CERCLA to determine environmental conditions
and remediation options at the Site.

Newmont Capital, formerly known as Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation, Inc., owned the property for
approXimately three years from 1984 to 1986 but never mined or conducted exploration at the site. The EPA asserts
that Newmont Capital is responsible for clean up costs incurred at the site. Newmont Capital and the EPA entered
into a consent decree to settle all aspects of this matter except future potential Natural Resource Damage claims. In
February 2009, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California approved the consent decree and the
settlement was completed.

Newmont USA Limited — 100% Newmont Owned

Pinal Creek. Newmont is a defendant in a lawsuit brought on November 5, 1991 in US. District Court in Arizona
by the Final Creek Group, alleging that Newmont and others are responsible for some portion of costs incurred to
address groundwater contamination emanating from copper mining operations located in the area of Globe and
Miami, Arizona. Two former subsidiaries of Newmont, Pinto Valley Copper Corporation and Magma Copper
Company (now known as BHP Copper Inc.) owned some of the mines in the area between 1983 and 1987. The court
has dismissed plaintiffs' claims seeking to hold Newmont liable for the acts or omissions of its former subsidiaries.
Newmont believes it has strong defenses to plaintiffs' remaining claims, including, without limitation that Newmont’s
agents did not partiCipate in any pollution causing activities; that Newmont’s liabilities, if any, were contractually
transferred to one of the plaintiﬂs; that portions of plaintiffs' claimed damages are not recoverable; and that
Newmont’s equitable share of liability, if any, would be immaterial. While Newmont has denied liability and is
vigorously defending these claims, it cannot reasonably predict the final outcome of this lawsuit.

Grass Valley. On February 3, 2004, the City of Grass Valley, California brought suit against Newmont under
CERCLA in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. This matter involves an abandoned mine adit
on property preViously owned by a predecessor of Newmont and currently owned by the City of Grass Valley. The
complaint alleges that the adit is discharging metals»bearing water into a stream on the property, in concentrations in
excess of current EPA drinking water standards. On February 4, 2009, this matter was fully resolved by settlement.
Pursuant to the settlement, Newmont has agreed to manage the water discharge on an ongoing basis.

Gray Eagle Mine Site. By letter dated September 3, 2002, the EPA notified Newmont that the EPA had
expended $3 in response costs to address environmental conditions associated with a historic tailings pile located at
the Grey Eagle Mine site near Happy Camp, California, and requested that Newmont pay those costs. The EPA has
identified four potentially responsible parties, including Newmont. Newmont does not believe it has any liability for
enVironmental conditions at the Grey Eagle Mine Site, and intends to vigorously defend any formal claims by the
EPA. Newmont cannot reasonably predict the likelihood or outcome of any future action against it arising from this
matter.

Fr‘oss»Adams Mine Site. By letter dated June 5, 2007, the U.S. Forest Sen/ice notified Newmont that it had
expended approximately $0.3 in response costs to address environmental conditions at the Ross»Adams mine in
Prince of Wales, Alaska, and requested Newmont USA Limited pay those costs and perform an Engineering
Evaluation/Cost Analysis (“EE/CA“) to assess what future response activities might need to be completed at the site.
Newmont does not believe it has any liability for environmental conditions at the site, and intends to vigorously
defend any formal claims by the EPA. Newmont has agreed to perform the EE/CA. Newmont cannot reasonably
predict the likelihood or outcome of any future action against it arismg from this matter.

PT Newman! Minahasa Raye (“PTNMR”) — 80% Newmont Owned

In July 2004, a criminal complaint was filed against PTNMR, the Newmont subsidiary that operated the
Minahasa mine in Indonesia, alleging environmental pollution relating to submarine tailings placement into nearby
Buyat Bay. The Indonesian police detained five PTNMR employees during September and October of 2004. The
police investigation and the detention of PTNMR's employees was declared illegal by the South Jakarta District Court
in December 2004, but in March 2005, the Indonesian Supreme Court upheld the legality of the police investigation,
and the police turned their evidence over to the local prosecutor. In July 2005, the prosecutor filed an indictment
against PTNMFI and its President Director, alleging environmental pollution at Buyat Bay. After the court rejected
motions to dismiss the proceeding, the trial proceeded and all evidence, including that of the defense, was presented
in court by September 2006. In November 2006 the prosecution filed its charge, seeking a three-year jail sentence
for PTNMR's President Director plus a nominal fine. In addition, the prosecution recommended a nominal fine
against PTNMR. The defense filed responses in January 2007, and final briefing was completed in March 2007. On
April 24, 2007, the court entered its verdict acquitting PTNMFI and its President Director of all charges. In May 2007,
the prosecution appealed the decision of the court to the Indonesian Supreme Court, despite IndoneSian laws that
prohibit the appeal of a verdict of acquittal. In October 2008, a panel of Supreme Court justices was asSigned to
consider the appeal. In April 2009, the Indonesian Supreme Court summarily dismissed the appeal of the prosecutor
related to PTNMR and its President Director.

In addition, on March 22, 2007, an Indonesian non»governmental organization named Wahana Lingkungan
Hidup Indonesia (“WALHI”) filed a civil suit against PTNMFI and Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Resources and Ministry for the EnVironment, alleging pollution from the disposal of mine tailings into Buyat Bay, and
seeking a court order requiring PTNMFI to fund a 25»year monitoring program in relation to Buyat Bay. In
December 2007, the court ruled in PTNMR’s favor and found that WALHI’s allegations of pollution in Buyat Bay were
without merit. In March 2008, WALHI appealed this deCision to the Indonesian Supreme Court.

Independent sampling and testing of Buyat Bay water and fish, as well as area residents, conducted by the
World Health Organization and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization,
confirm that PTNMR has not polluted the Buyat Bay enVironment, and, therefore, has not adversely affected the fish
in Buyat Bay or the health of nearby residents. The Company remains steadfast that it has not caused pollution or
health problems.

Other Legal Matters

Minera Yanacocha S.FI.L. ("Yanacocha") — 51.35% Newman! Owned

Choropampa. In June 2000, a transport contractor of Yanacocha spilled approximately 151 kilograms of
elemental mercury near the town of Choropampa, Peru, which is located 53 miles (85 kilometers) southwest of the
Yanacocha mine. Elemental mercury is not used in Yanacocha's operations but is a byproduct of gold mining and
was sold to a Lima firm for use in medical instruments and industrial applications. A comprehensive health and
enVironmental remediation program was undertaken by Yanacocha in response to the inCident. In August 2000,
Yanacocha paid under protest a fine of 1,740,000 PerUVian soles (approximately $0.5) to the Peruvian government.
Yanacocha has entered into settlement agreements with a number of indiViduals impacted by the incident. As
compensation for the disruption and inconvenience caused by the incident, Yanacocha entered into agreements with
and provided a variety of public works in the three communities impacted by this incident. Yanacocha cannot predict
the likelihood of additional expenditures related to this matter.

Yanacocha, various wholly»owned subsidiaries of Newmont, and other defendants have been named in lawsuits
filed by approXimately 1,100 PeruVian citizens in Denver District Court for the State of Colorado. These actions seek
compensatory damages based on claims associated with the elemental mercury spill incident. The parties in these
cases agreed to submit these matters to binding arbitration. In October 2007, the parties to the arbitration entered a
court-approved settlement agreement, resolving most of these cases. In April 2009, all remaining matters were
settled.

Additional lawsuits relating to the Choropampa incident were filed against Yanacocha in the local courts of
Cajamarca, Peru, in May 2002 by over 900 Peruvian citizens. A significant number of the plaintiffs in these lawsuits
entered into settlement agreements With Yanacocha prior to filing such claims. In April 2008, the Peruvian Supreme
Court upheld the validity of these settlement agreements, which should result in the dismissal of all claims brought by
preViously settled plaintiffs. Yanacocha has also entered into settlement agreements with approximately 350
additional plaintiffs. The claims asserted by approximately 200 plaintiﬂs remain. Neither Newmont nor Yanacocha


can reasonably estimate the ultimate loss relaking to such claims.

Conga. Yanacocha is involved in a dispute with the Provincial Municipality of Celendin regarding the authority oi
that governmental body to regulate the development oi the Conga project. In the fourth quarter oi 2004, the
Municipality oi Celendin enacted an ordinance declaring the area around Conga to be a mining-free reserve and
naturally protected area. Yanacocha challenged this ordinance by means of two legal actions, one iiled by
Yanacocha (as the lease holder of the Conga mining concessions) and one filed by Minera Chaupiloma (as the
titleholder of the Conga mining concessions). In August 2007, a Peruvian Court oi first instance upheld Chaupiloma's
claim, stating that the Municipality of Celendin lacks the authority to create natural protected areas. The Municipality
of Celendin has not appealed the ruling. In July 2008, a Peruvian Court of iirst instance dismissed Yanacocha’s claim
as groundless. Yanacocha appealed the ruling to the appellate Court in Lima, and in January 2009, the appellate
Court in Lima reversed the lower Court ruling and upheld Yanacocha’s claim.

Newmont Yandal Operations Ply Ltd (“NYOL ") — 100% Newmont Owned

On September 3, 2003, J. Aron & Co. commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court oi New South Wales
(Australia) against NYOL, its subsidiaries and the administrator in relation to the completed voluntary administration
of the NYOL group. J. Aron & Co., a NYOL creditor, initially sought injunctive relief that was denied by the court on
September 8, 2003. On October 30, 2003, J. Aron & Co. filed a statement of claim alleging various deficiencies in the
implementation of the voluntary administration process and seeking damages and other relief against NYOL and
other parties. Newmont cannot reasonably predict the final outcome of this lawsuit.

PT Newman! Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”) — 45% Newmont Owned

Under the Batu Hijau Contract of Work, beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2010, a portion of PTNNT's
shares must be offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or, second, to Indonesian nationals, equal to the
difference between the following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned by the Indonesian
government or Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 23% by March 31, 2006; 30% by March 31, 2007;
37% by March 31, 2008; 44% by March 31, 2009; and 51% by March 31, 2010. As PT Pukuaiu Indah (“PTPI”), an
Indonesian national, has owned and continues to own a 20% interest in PTNNT, in 2006 a 3% interest was required
to be offered for sale and in each oi 2007 through 2010 an additional 7% interest must be offered (for an aggregate
31% interest). The price at which such interest must be offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest oi the
then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares would be accepted ior listing on the Indonesian Stock
Exchange, or the fair market value of such interest as a going concern, as agreed With the Indonesian government.
Pursuant to this provision, it is possible that the ownership interest of NTP in PTNNT could be reduced to 49% or that
subsequent disputes could arise concerning the divestiture of the ownership interest of NTP in PTNNT.

Initial arbitration matter

PTPI has owned and continues to own a 20% interest in PTNNT, and therefore the Newmont»Sumitomo
partnership was required to offer a 3% interest in PTNNT ior sale in 2006 and an additional 7% interest in each of
2007 through 2010. In accordance with the Contract of Work, an oifer to sell a 3% interest was made to the
Indonesian government in 2006 and an offer for an additional 7% interest was made in each oi 2007 and 2008. A
iurther 7% interest in the shares of PTNNT was offered ior sale in March 2009. While the central government
declined to participate in the 2006 and 2007 offers, local governments in the area in which the Batu Hijau mine is
located expressed interest in acquiring shares, as did various Indonesian nationals. In January 2008, the Newmont-
Sumitomo partnership agreed to sell, under a carried interest arrangement, 2% of PTNNT’s shares to Kabupaten
Sumbawa, one oi the local governments, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. The Indonesian government
subsequently stated that it would not approve the transier of shares under this agreement. On February 11, 2008,
PTNNT received notiiication from the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources (“DEMR”) alleging that PTNNT
is in breach of its divestiture requirements under the Contract of Work, and threatening to issue a notice to terminate
the Contract of Work ii PTNNT did not agree to divest the 2006 and 2007 shares, in accordance with the direction of
the DEMR, by February 22, 2008, which date was extended to March 3, 2008. A second Notice of Deiault was
received relating to the alleged failure to divest the 2008 shares as well. On March 3, 2008, the IndoneSian
government filed for international arbitration as provided under the Contract of Work, as did PTNNT. In the arbitration
proceeding, PTNNT sought a declaration that the Indonesian government is not entitled to terminate the Contract of
Work and additional declarations pertaining to the procedures ior divesting the shares. For its part, the Indonesian
government sought declarations that PTNNT is in default of its divestiture obligations, that the government may
terminate the Contract of Work and recover damages for breach of the Contract of Work, and that PTNNT must
cause shares subject to divestiture to be sold to certain local governments.

Second arbitration matter

In 1997, to enable development of the Batu Hljau mine, PTNNT secured an aggregate $1,000 in flnanclng from
the United States Export-Import Bank, the Japan Bank for International Cooperatlon (formerly the Japan Export-
lmport Bank), and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaulbau (the German Export-Import Bank) (collectlvely, the “Senlor
Lenders"). The Senlor Lenders required the shareholders 01 PTNNT to pledge 100% 01 the shares of PTNNT as
security for repayment of the loans. As part of that process, on October 30, 1997, the Minister of Energy and Mineral
Resources approved the share pledge arrangements.

Subsequent to an additlonal 7% interest in PTNNT being offered by NTP for sale on March 28, 2008 (as
requlred under the Contract of Work), the Dlrector General of Mineral, Coal and Geothermal Resources at DEMR
clalmed that PTNNT breached its obllgations under the Contract of Work by allowing shares to be offered for sale
that are pledged to the Senior Lenders as security for the repayment of the senior debt. In the letter, the Director
General clalmed that NTP would be In default under the Contract of Work if the shares of PTNNT olfered lor sale In
March 2008, together with the shares olfered in 2006 and 2007, were not in the possession of “Indonesian
government and/or government owned entlties,“ tree of any such senior pledge, by July 13, 2008. Consequently, on
July 10, 2008, PTNNT flled a notice to commence an additlonal international arbitratlon proceedlng, as provided lor
under the Contract of Work, to resolve the claim that PTNNT breached its obligatlons under the Contract of Work by
allowing shares to be offered that are subject to pledge obligations to the Senior Lenders. ThlS issue was
incorporated lnto and resolved as part of the Initial arbitratlon proceedlng.

An International arbitratlon panel was appointed to resolve these claims and a hearlng was held in Jakarta in
December 2008. On March 31, 2009, the arbltration panel issued its Final Award and decision on the matter. In lts
declslon, the arbitratlon panel determined that PTNNT’s foreign shareholders had not complied Wlth the divestiture
procedure required by the Contract of Work In 2006 and 2007, but the panel ruled that the Indonesian government is
not entltled to immediately termlnate the Contract 01 Work and the panel rejected the Indonesian government’s clalm
for damages. The Arbltration Panel granted PTNNT 180 days from the date of notllicatlon of the Final Award to
transler the 2006 3% interest and the 2007 7% Interest in PTNNT to the local governments or their respective
nomlnees. The Arbitration Panel also applied a 180-day cure period to the 2008 7% interest, ruling that PTNNT must
(within such 180-day period) offer the 2008 7% interest to the Indonesian government or its nominee, and transfer
such shares if, after agreement on the transfer pnce, the Indonesian government invokes lIS right of flrst refusal
under the Contract of Work. The panel ruled that shares offered to the Indonesian government pursuant to the
Contract of Work must be oﬂered free of any pledge or obligation to re-pledge the shares to the Senlor Lenders.
Flnally, the Panel directed PTNNT to pay to the Indonesian government an allocated portion of certain legal fees and
costs of the arbitration. PTNNT submitted payment of $2 for legal fees and costs. The Company also entered a
formal agreement with the Senior Lenders under WthIl the Senior Lenders released the pledge on the aggregated
31% of shares in PTNNT that are subject to divestiture requirements in exchange for the Company and Sumitomo
agreeing to provrde joint and several guarantees, thus allowing the Company to transfer these shares tree of any
pledge or obllgation to re-pledge the shares to the lenders. As discussed in Note 22, the Company subsequently
replaced this joint and several guarantee in October with letters of credit supporting 56.25% 01 the obllgations under
the PTNNT project linancing facillty. On July 14, 2009, the Company reached agreement with the Indonesian
government on the price of the 2008 7% interest and the 2009 7% interest. PTNNT has reoﬂered the 2008 7%
interest and the 2009 7% interest to the Indoneslan government at thls newly agreed price. In September 2009, the
deadline for completlon of transfer 01 the 2006 3% interest, the 2007 7% lnterest and the 2008 7% interest was
extended to November 12, 2009 by agreement between PTNNT and the Indonesian Government. This date
COIHCldeS WlIh the deadline for the sale and transfer 01 the 2009 7% Interest. The Company cannot predict the
outcome 01 these discussions. Subsequent dlsputes may arise concernlng the dlvestiture of the shares including if
the transfer is not completed to the satislaction of the parties within the period described above.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

Tax contingencIes are provided for under income tax accounting guidance (see Note 8).

In a 1993 asset exchange, a wholly-owned subsidiary transferred a coal lease under which the subsidiary had
collected advance royalty payments totaling $484. From 1994 to 2018, remaining advance payments under the lease
to the transferee total $390. In the event of title failure as stated In the lease, this subsidiary has a primary obligation
to refund preVIoust collected payments and has a secondary obligatIon to refund any of the $390 collected by the
transferee, If the transferee faIIs to meet its refund obIIgation. The subsidIary has title Insurance on the leased coal
deposits of $240 covering the secondary obligatIon. The Company and the subsidiary regard the circumstances
entitling the lessee to a refund as remote.

The Company has minimum royalty obligations on one of its producing mines in Nevada for the IIfe of the mine.
Amounts paid as a minimum royalty (where production royaltIes are less than the minimum obligation) in any year
are recoverable in future years when the minimum royalty obligatIon is exceeded. Although the minimum royalty
requirement may not be met in a partIcuIar year, the Company expects that over the mine life, gold production will be
sufficient to meet the mInimum royalty requirements. Minimum royalty payments payable are $29 In 2009, $23 in
2010 through 2013 and $140 thereafter.

As part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company and Its affiIIates are required to provide surety
bonds, bank letters of credIt and bank guarantees as financial support for various purposes, includIng enVIronmentaI
reclamation, exploration permIttIng, workers compensation programs and other general corporate purposes. At
September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, there were $872 and $778, respectively, of outstanding letters of
credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees. The surety bonds, letters of credit and bank guarantees reflect fair value
as a condItion of their underlying purpose and are subject to fees competitively determIned in the market place. The
obligatIons associated with these Instruments are generally related to performance requirements that the Company
addresses through Its ongoIng operations. As the specific requIrements are met, the benefICIary of the associated
instrument cancels and/or returns the instrument to the issuing entity. Certain of these Instruments are assOCIated
with operating sites with long-lived assets and WIN remaIn outstandIng until closure. Generally, bonding requirements
associated with environmental regulatIon are becomIng more restrictive. In additIon, the surety markets for certaIn
types of environmental bonding used by the Company have become increasingly constrained. The Company,
however, believes It is In compliance with all appIIcabIe bonding obligations and will be able to satisfy future bonding
requirements, through existIng or alternative means, as they arise.

Newmont is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings related to its business. Except in the above-
described proceedIngs, management does not believe that adverse decisions in any pending or threatened
proceeding or that amounts that may be required to be paId by reason thereof WlII have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s fInanCIaI condition or results of operations.

Consolidated Financial Results

Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders for the third quarter of 2009 was $388, or $0.79 per share,
compared to $191, or $0.42 per share in 2008. Results for the third quarter oi 2009 compared to 2008 were impacted
by increased gold and copper sales volumes, higher realized gold and copper prices and lower costs. Net income
attributable to Newmont stockholders for the first nine months of 2009 was $739, or $1.52 per share, compared to
$827, or $1.82 per share in 2008. Results for the first nine months o12009 compared to 2008 were impacted by
higher gold and copper sales volumes, higher realized gold prices and lower costs, partially offset by lower realized
copper prices. The Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders per share for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2009, compared to the same periods for 2008, reflect higher average shares outstanding due to the
issuance of 34,500,000 shares in February 2009.

Costs applicable to sales decreased in the third quarter and first nine months ot 2009 from 2008 as detailed in
the table below. The decrease in the third quarter and lirst nine months of 2009 is due to lower waste tons mined and
lower diesel prices, partially offset by increased gold and copper sales volumes.

Amortization increased in the third quarter and lirst nine months of 2009 compared to 2008, due to increased
gold and copper sales volumes as detailed in the table below. We expect Amortization expense in 2009 to be
approximately $740 to $760.

Canadian Oil Sands Trust income decreased $29 and $75 in the third quarter and first nine months 012009,
respectively, compared to the same periods of 2008 due to reduced distributions related to a significant decrease in
oil prices. The decrease in interest income is a result of a lower global interest rate environment. Gain on sale 01
investments, net in 2008 was attributable to the sale of marketable equity securities. During the first nine months of
2009, we recognized impairments of marketable securities of $2 for Shore Gold, Inc. and $4 for other marketable
securities. During the third quarter of 2008, we recognized impairments of marketable securities of $26 for Shore
Gold Inc. and $8 for other marketable securities, resulting in total impairments for the lirst nine months of 2008 of $58
for Shore Gold Inc., $13 for Gabriel Resources Ltd. and $1 9 lor other marketable securities.

Interest expense, net decreased by $25 and $33 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009, respectively,
compared to the same periods in 2008 mainly due to higher capitalized interest, partially offset by additional interest
on the convertible senior notes. Capitalized interest increased $35 and $50 for the third quarter and first nine months
of 2009, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2008 primarily due to construction of the Boddington project.
We expect 2009 Interest expense, net to be approximately $100 to $1 10.

Income tax expense during the third quarter of 2009 was $253 compared to $6 during the third quarter of 2008.
The increase primarily relates to (i) the increase in pre»tax income, and (ii) the reduction in income taxes in 2008
resulting from revised estimates of reserves for uncertain income tax positions. Income tax expense during the lirst
nine months of 2009 was $494 compared to $193 during the first nine months of 2008. The increase primarily relates
to (i) the increase in pre»tax income, (ii) the reduction in income taxes in 2008 resulting from revised estimates of
uncertain income tax positions, and (iii) the reduction in income taxes in 2008 realized from the conversion of one of
the Company’s non-US subsidiaries to a partnership for US income tax purposes which gave rise to a significant
capital loss allowing the Company to recover income taxes paid on prior years capital gains.

In addition to the non-recurring items discussed above, the effective tax rates in the third quarter and for the first
nine months of 2009 and 2008 are diﬂerent from the United States statutory rate of 35%, primarily due to (i) U.S.
percentage depletion, and (ii) the effect of diﬂerent income tax rates in countries where earnings are indefinitely
reinvested. For a complete discussion of the lactors that influence our elfective tax rate, see Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Newmont’s Form 8»K for
the year ended December 31, 2008, filed September 15, 2009. We expect the 2009 income tax rate to be
approximately 28% to 30%, assuming an average gold price 01 $900 per ounce.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $226 and $198 in the third quarter and the first nine
months of 2009, respectively, as a result ol increased earnings at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau.

Third quarter 2009 compared to 2008
Jundee, Australia . Gold ounces sold decreased 2% due to lower inventory sales, partially ollset by milling
higher grade material. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased to $329 from $414 per ounce primarily due to
lower power and underground mining costs.
Tanami, Australia. Gold ounces sold decreased 24% due to milling lower grade material. Costs applicable [0
sales per ounce increased by 7% due to lower production, partially offset by lower royalties.

applicable [0 sales per ounce decreased 19% due to higher production and lower diesel prices.
Waihi, New Zealand. Gold ounces sold decreased 32% due to an electrical fire at the mill in May 2009 which
suspended milling actiVities until August. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased to $518 from $397 due to
lower production, partially offset by lower operating costs during the temporary suspension of milling activities.


Batu Hijau, Indonesia. Copper and gold sales at Batu Hijau increased significanlly due lo higher mill lhroughput,
grade and recovery due to processing higher grade and softer Phase 5 ore. The third quarter ol 2008 was also
impacted by a delayed shipmenl. Copper and gold production increased by 104% and 196%, respectively. As a
resull, Casts applicable to sales decreased approximalely 75%, to $0.50 per pound of copper and $178 per ounce of

Boddington, Australia. Boddington began milling ore durIng the third quarter of 2009 and had Its first gold pour
and copper concentrate shipments In September. We expect to begin commercial production In the lourth quarter of
2009. Construction was substantially complete at September 30, 2009 and we expect total project costs of
approximately $3,000, excluding capitalized interest, on a 100% basis.

First nine months 2009 compared to 2008

Jundee, Australia . Gold ounces sold were consistent as higher mill throughput was offset by lower grade and
recovery. Casts applicable to sales per ounce decreased to $339 from $41 1 per ounce due to lower power and
underground minIng costs.

Tanami, Australia. Gold ounces sold decreased 14% prImarily due to mIIIing lower grade material. Casts
applicable lo sales per ounce Increased 4% primarily as a result of lower gold productIon and higher royaltIes.

Kalgoorlie, Australia . Gold ounces sold Increased 13% due to hIgher mill throughput, grade and recovery. Costs
applicable lo sales per ounce decreased 22% due to hIgher production, lower diesel prices and lower mill
consumable costs.

Waihi, New Zealand. Gold ounces sold decreased 21% due to the temporary suspension of milling operations.
Costs applicable lo sales per ounce Increased to $457 from $428 per ounce due to lower production, higher royalty
costs and hIgher by-product credIts, partially offset by lower operating costs.

Batu Hijau, Indonesia . Copper and gold sales at Batu Hijau increased 70% and 106%, respectively, due to
hIgher mill throughput, grade and recovery due to processing higher grade and softer Phase 5 ore compared to ore
sourced primarily from lower grade stockpiles in 2008. Total Costs applicable lo sales decreased $112 due to
changes In ore stockaIes and concentrate inventory and lower mining costs. Costs applicable lo sales decreased to
$0.63 per pound ol copper and $232 per ounce of gold, primarIly a result of higher sales volumes.

On September 18,2009, Batu Hijau experienced a geotechnIcal failure in a portIon of the west wall of the open-
pit. Batu HIjau utilizes a number of preventive measures, including radar threshold alarms, to monitor movements in
the pIt walls. As a result, mobile equipment and personnel were evacuated from the pit prior to the wall failure.
Operations were suspended for approximately three weeks in the pit pending a geotechnical review and
development of a remediation plan to recommence minIng operations. Batu HIjau continued to process lower grade
ore from stockaIes during the suspensIon period. Mining operations returned to normal on October 10. With higher
than lorecasted production durIng the first nine months ol 2009, the geotechnical laIlure is not expected to have a
signifIcant impact on the Company's previously released guidance for 2009 sales volumes and unit costs. However,
the geotechnIcaI failure will requIre the accelerated removal ol waste material dIspIaced from the event as well as
changes to the balance of Phase 5 and the initIatIon of Phase 6. In general, the Company expects delays in access
to ore preVIoust antIprated in 2010 and 2011 with a marginal decrease In ore mined from the ultimate Phase 6 pit.

With the Boddington ramp up underway later in the year, we expect gold sales for the AsIa PacIfic operations of
approXImately 1.7 to 1.85 million ounces at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $450 to $470 per ounce In
2009. We expect 2009 copper sales lor the Asia Pacific operatIons to be approxImately 460 to 510 million pounds of
copper at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $0.50 to $0.65 per pound.

We currently have a 45% ownershIp Interest In the Batu Hijau mine, held through the Nusa Tenggara
Partnership (“NTP”) WIth an affiIIate of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTP and the
Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTP in turn owns 80% of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”),
the Indonesian subSIdiary that owns Batu Hijau. The remaining 20% interest in PTNNT Is owned by PT. Pukuafu
Indah (“PTPI”), an unrelated Indonesian company.

Under the Contract of Work Issued to PTNNT by the Indonesian government, beginnIng in 2006 and continuing
through 2010, a portIon of PTNNT’s shares must be oﬂered for sale to the Indonesian government or Its nomInee,
equal to the difference between the lollowmg percentages and the percentage of shares already owned by the
Indonesian government or Indonesian natIonals (if such number is posItive): 23% by March 31, 2006; 30% by
March 31, 2007; 37% by March 31, 2008; 44% by March 31, 2009; and 51% by March 31, 2010. The price at which
such interest must be olfered lor sale to the IndonesIan parties Is the highest of the then-current replacement cost,
the price at thch shares would be accepted for IIsting on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, or the fair market value of
such interest as a going concern, as agreed with the Indonesian government. In March 2008, the lndonesIan
government and PTNNT each Instituted an arbitratIon proceedIng to resolve a dispute concerning the dIvestIture ol
PTNNT shares. On March 31, 2009, the internatIonaI arbItration panel Issued a final award resolving the claims
asserted. For further Information related to the dispute and the internatIonal arbItration proceeding, Including a
description of the lactual basis for the cIaIms, and a description of the arbitration decision, refer to Note 27,
Commitments and Contingencies. Pursuant to the arbItration decIsIon and the terms of the Contract of Work, it Is
possible that the ownership interest of NTP in PTNNT could be reduced to 49% or that subsequent dIsputes may


arise concerning the divestiture oi shares.

Table of Contents

We lollow the consolidation accounting guidance which provides guidance on the identification and reporting lor
entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. Such entities are defined as Variable
Interest Entities (“VIEs”). We identified NTP, the partnership that owns an 80% interest in PTNNT, as a VIE due to
certain capital structures and contractual relationships. As a result ol our 56.25% ownership in NTP, we consolidate
Batu Hijau, and will continue to consolidate Batu Hijau, in our Consolidated Financial Statements as long as we
continue to be the primary beneficiary of NTP and NTP controls PTNNT.

A divestiture of shares that results in the ownership interest ol NTP in PTNNT being reduced to 49% may
require us to deconsolidate PTNNT. In such circumstances, if NTP does not maintain the power to direct the
activities that most significantly impact PTNNT's economic performance, we would deconsolidate Batu Hijau and
recognize the liker gain resulting from the divestiture of shares in earnings. In addition, we would record our
remaining noncontrolling interest in PTNNT at fair value, with the related likely gain also recognized in earnings.
Upon deconsolidation, we would account for our remaining noncontrolling interest in PTNNT as an equity method
investment and would recognize our portion of PTNNT’s earnings thereafter as a single line item in our consolidated
statements of income. If we continue to consolidate Batu Hijau, any gains resulting from divestiture of shares would
be included in Newman: stockholders’ equity in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 25 to the Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information relating to Batu Hijau.

The long awaited forest use permit (called a “Pinjam Pakai") was received on September 1, 2009 and the permit
renewal is valid until 2025. This permit is a key requirement to continue to operate Batu Hijau elficiently, in addition to
the ultimate life of the mine and recoverability of reserves. We had been in discussions for over three years to extend
the Pinjam Pakai.

per ounce increased to $446 from $402 due to lower gold sales volumes and processing higher cost stockpile
material, partially offset by lower waste mining and power costs.

First nine months 2009 compared to 2008

Ahafa, Ghana. Gold ounces sold increased 8% due to milling higher grade material, partially offset by lower
recovery. Ore tons mined increased 15% to 9.3 million tons as total tons mined increased 12% to 40.0 million tons
due to additional mining equipment added in late 2008. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to higher
labor, contracted services, maintenance and mill consumable costs, partially olfset by higher sales volumes and
lower diesel costs.

We continue to expect gold sales 01 approXimately 500,000 to 525,000 ounces at Costs applicable to sales of
approximately $425 to $450 per ounce in 2009.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
Our foreign operations sell their gold and copper production based on US. dollar metal prices. Approximately
22% and 28% of our Costs applicable to sales were paid in local currencies during the third quarter of 2009 and
2008, respectively. Approximately 22% and 28% of our Costs applicable to sales were paid in local currencies during
the first nine months of 2009 and 2008, respectively. Variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the
U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations decreased consolidated Costs applicable to sales per ounce by
approximately $12 and $16, net of hedging gains and losses, during the third quarter and first nine months ol 2009,
respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2008.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Provided from Operating Activities
Net cash provided from continuing operations was $1,946 for the first nine months of 2009 compared to $1,168
in 2008 primarin due to increased gold and copper sales volumes, a higher realized gold price and income tax
refunds received in 2009, partially offset by lower realized copper prices.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $2,088 during the first nine months of 2009
compared to $1,617 during the same period of 2008 due to higher additions to property, plant and mine development
and the acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in Boddington.
Additions to property, plant and mine development were as lollows:

Capital expenditures in North America for the first nine months of 2009 primarily related to surface and
underground mine development at Nevada. Capital expenditures in South America primarily related to the Conga
project and dewatering, mine maintenance and leach pad development at Yanacocha. The vast majority of capital
expenditures in Asia Pacific were for the Boddington project, (which includes 100% of expenditures lor 2009) With


other capital expenditures for mine development in Australia and equipment purchases at Batu Hijau. At
September 30, 2009, we have hedged 33% of our expected remaining Boddington project Australian dollar
denominated capital expenditures for 2009 at an average rate of 0.80. Capital expenditures in Africa primarily related
to mine and infrastructure development at Ahalo. The Company has narrowed its 2009 consolidated capital
expenditure outlook to between $1,600 and $1 ,700, primarily as a result of the later than expected start-up of
Boddington which is offset by lower capital expenditures throughout the rest of the portfolio.

Table of Contents

Capital expenditures in North America during the Iirst nine months of 2008 were primarily related to the
completion ol the power plant and mine development. South America capital expenditures were primarily related to
construction of the gold mill, development of the Conga project and leach pad expansions. Capital expenditures in
Asia Pacific largely resulted from the continued construction of the Boddington project in Australia and mine
development and construction 01 a second tailings pipeline at Batu Hijau. Capital expenditures in Africa were mainly
as a result of mine equipment purchases, the Awonsu, Ahalo North and Amoma pits development and mine
development.

Investments in and proceeds from sale of marketable debt and equity securities. During the first nine months of
2009 we received $10 from the sale of asset backed commercial paper and marketable equity securities. During the
first nine months 012008, we purchased marketable equity securities of Gabriel Resources for $11 and other
marketable securities for $7. In the lirst nine months of 2008, we received $50 from the sale of marketable equity
securities.

Acquisitions. In the first nine months of 2009, we paid $741 (net of $1 cash acquired) and paid $14 in acquisition
costs to acquire the remaining 33.33% interest in Boddington. Consideration for the acquisition also includes $240
payable in cash and/or Newmont common stock, at our option, by December 2009 and a contingent royalty capped
at $100, equal to 50% of the average realized operating margin (Revenue less costs applicable to sales on a by-
product basis), if any, exceeding $600 per ounce, payable on one-third 01 gold sales from Boddington beginning in
the second quarter of 2010. The completion of the acquisition in June 2009 brought Newmont’s interest in
Boddington to 100%. Additionally, we paid $11 for a mining property near the La Herradura, Mexico operation in the
first nine months oi 2009. During the first nine months of 2008, we paid $318 to acquire the remaining outstanding
common shares of Miramar, resulting in Miramar becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary. The total Miramar purchase
price was $1 ,353.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided from ﬁnancing activities was $2,689 during the first nine months 01 2009 compared to $215
during the same period of 2008, for the reasons explained below.

Proceeds from and repayment oldebt, net. During the first nine months of 2009, we received aggregate
proceeds from debt of $4,302 comprised of: $1,082 net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes due in 2039,
$896 net proceeds lrom the issuance ol senior notes due in 2019, $504 net proceeds from the issuance of
convertible senior notes due in 2012, $54 from short-term borrowings at Batu Hijau, $10 under the Ahalo project
facility and $1,756 under our $2,000 revolving credit facility. In addition, we repaid $2,604 of debt: $43 for Batu Hijau
project linancing scheduled debt repayments, $24 related to the sale-Ieaseback ol the relractory ore treatment plant
(classified as a capital lease), $2,513 under our $2,000 revolvmg credit facility and $24 on other credit facilities and
other capital leases. At September 30, 2009 we had no borrowings under our revoIVing credit facility. The revolving
credit facility is also used to secure the issuance 01 letters of credit totaling $320, primarily supporting reclamation
obligations (see "OtﬁBa/ance SheetArrangemenls”below).

Scheduled minimum debt repayments are $127 for the remainder of 2009, $157 in 2010, $336 in 2011, $603 in
2012, $116 in 2013 and $3,584 therealter. We expect to be able to fund maturities of debt from Net cash provided by
operating activities, cash balances, existing credit facilities, proceeds of asset sales and financing alternatives
available in the public capital markets.

At September 30, 2009, we were in compliance with all required debt covenants and other restrictions related to

C$0.3559 per share through September 30, 2009 and C$0.3031 through September 30, 2008. We paid dividends of
$147 and $136 to common stockholders in the Iirst nine months of 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests. We paid dividends of $1 1 5 and $247 to noncontrolling interests in
subsidiaries during the first nine months of 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Proceeds from stock issuance. We received proceeds ol $1,248 and $27 during the first nine months ol 2009
and 2008, respectively, from the issuance of common stock. In February 2009 we completed a public olfering of
34,500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $37 per share for net proceeds of $1 ,233.

Discontinued Operations

Net operating cash provided from (used in) discontinued operations was $3 and $(105) in the first nine months
of 2009 and 2008, respectively. During the lirst nine months of 2008, we made tax payments of $153 related to the
2007 royalty portfolio sale.

Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was $nil and $(11) in the first nine months of
2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash used in investing actiVities of discontinued operations in 2008 included payment
of accrued costs related to the 2007 royalty portfolio sale ($11) and capital expenditures at Kori Kollo ($5), partially
oﬂset by proceeds from the sale of Pajingo assets ($5).

Net cash used in ﬁnancing activities of discontinued operations during the first nine months of 2009 and 2008
were for scheduled debt payments at Kori Kollo.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have the lollowmg off»ba|ance sheet arrangements: operating leases (as disclosed in Note 30 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in our Form 8-K lor the year ended December 31, 2008, filed on September 15,
2009) and $872 01 outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees. We also provide a contingent
support line of credit to PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara of which our pro-rata share is $11. We have sales agreements
to sell copper concentrates at market prices as follows, in thousands 01 tons:

Environmental

Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the
protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming
more restrictive. We conduct our operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believe our
operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. We have made, and
expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full
amount of such luture expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory
requirements. At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, $624 and $594, respectively, were accrued for
reclamation costs relating to currently producing mineral properties.

In addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former
mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the Various
sites involved. We believe that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature
with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the compliance required to meet general
enVironmental standards. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $153 and $163 were
accrued for such obligations at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. Depending upon the
ultimate resolution of these matters, we believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could
be as much as 135% greater or 7% lower than the amount accrued at September 30, 2009. The amounts accrued for
these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in
estimates are charged to Other expense, nelin the period estimates are l'eVlSed. During the lirst nine months of
2008, we had reclamation estimate revisions of $74 that relate primarily to an increase in the reclamation liability at
the former Mt. Leyshon and Midnite mine sites. The Mt. Leyshon reclamation revision was for site characterization,
stabilization and long-term surface water management due to overflow discharge from heavy rain. The Midnite mine
site reclamation increased in light 01 the mid-2008 decisions made in the US. District Court lor the Eastern District of
Washington.

For more information on our reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Notes 23 and 27 to the Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements.

During the first nine months 012009 and 2008, capital expenditures were approximately $128 and $148,
respectively, to comply With environmental regulations. Ongoing costs to comply With environmental regulations have
not been a significant component of operating costs.

We spent $15 and $34, respectively, during the first nine months of 2009 and 2008 tor environmental obligations
related to the tormer, primarily historic, mining activities discussed in Note 23 to the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

The Accounting Standards Codification

In June 2009, the FinanCial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) established the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) as the single source of authoritative GAAP to be applied by nongovernmental entities. The ASC
is a new structure which took existing accounting pronouncements and organized them by accounting topic. Relevant
authoritative literature issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and select SEC staff
interpretations and administrative literature was also included in the ASC. All other accounting guidance not included
in the A80 is nonauthoritative. The A80 was effective for our interim quarterly period beginning July 1, 2009. The
adoption ol the ASC did not have an impact on our consolidated linancial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Subsequent Events

In May 2009, the ASC guidance tor subsequent events was updated to establish accounting and reporting
standards for events that occur alter the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are
available to be issued. The update sets forth: (i) the period after the balance sheet date during which management of
a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the
financial statements, (ii) the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring
after the balance sheet in its linancial statements, and (iii) the disclosures that an entity should make about events or
transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements. We adopted the updated guidance for
our interim period ended June 30, 2009. The adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

In December 2008, the ASC guidance for retirement benelits was updated to expand the requirements of
employers' disclosures about post-retirement benefit plan assets in a delined benefit pension or other post-retirement
plan. The objective is to require more detailed disclosures about employers' plan assets, including employers’
investment strategies, major categories of plan assets, concentrations 01 risk within plan assets, and valuation
techniques used to measure the lair value ol plan assets. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2009.
These disclosures are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes.

Equity Method Investments

In November 2008, the ASC guidance for equity method and joint venture investments was updated to clarify
the accounting lor certain transactions and impairment considerations involving equity method investments. The
intent is to provide guidance on: (i) determining the initial measurement of an equity method investment,

(ii) recognizmg other-than-temporary impairments of an equity method investment and (iii) accounting for an equity

method investee’s issuance of shares. The updated guidance was eﬂective lor our liscal year beginning January 1,
2009 and was applied prospectively. The adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

Equity-Linked Financial Instruments

In June 2008, the ASC guidance for derivatives and hedging when accounting lor contracts in an entity's own
equity was updated to clarify the determination of whether an instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to an
entity’s own stock which would qualify as a scope exception from hedge accounting. The updated guidance was
eﬂective tor our liscal year beginning January 1, 2009. The adoption had no impact on our consolidated finanCial
position or results of operations.

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments

In May 2008, the ASC guidance was updated for convertible debt instruments that, by their stated terms, may be
settled in cash (or other assets) upon conversion, including partial cash settlement, unless the embedded conversion
option is required to be separately accounted for as a derivative. The update requires that the liability and equity
components of convertible debt instruments within the scope be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects
the entity's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. This requires an allocation of convertible debt proceeds between the
liability component and the embedded conversion option (i.e., the equity component). The difference between the
principal amount ol the debt and the amount of the proceeds allocated to the liability component is reported as a debt
discount and subsequently amortized to earnings over the instruments expected life using the effective interest
method. The updated guidance required retrospective application to all periods presented.

During July 2007, we completed an offering ol $1,150 convertible senior notes due 2014 and 2017, each in the
amount of $575. The 2014 notes, maturing on July 15, 2014, pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 1.25% per
annum, and the 2017 notes, maturing on July 15, 2017, pay interest semi»annually at a rate of 1.625% per annum.
The notes are convertible, at the holder's option, equivalent to a conversion price ol $46.21 per share of common
stock (24,887,956 shares ol common stock). In connection With the convertible senior notes oﬂering, we entered into
convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions (“Call Spread Transactions"). The Call Spread
Transactions included the purchase ol call options and the sale of warrants. As a result of the Call Spread
Transactions, the conversion price of $46.21 was elfectively increased to $60.27. At September 30, 2009, the if-
converted value did not exceed the principal amounts.

During February 2009, we completed an olfering of $518 convertible senior notes due on February 15, 2012.
The notes Will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.00% per annum. The notes are convertible, at the holder’s
option, equivalent to a conversion price of $46.25 per share ol common stock (11,189,189 shares of common stock).
At September 30, 2009, the il»converted value did not exceed the principal amount.

We recorded the following in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the convertible senior
notes:

At September 30, 2009 At December 31, 2008
Convertible Senior Notes Due Convertible Senior Notes Due
2012 2014 2017 2012 2014 2017
Additional paid-in capital $ 46 $ 97 $ 123 $ — $ 97 $ 123
Principal amount $ 518 $ 575 $ 575 $ — $ 575 $ 575
Unamortized debt discount (60) (112) 162) — (127) 174)
Net carrying amount $ 458 $ 463 $ 413 $ — $ 448 $ 401

As a result of adopting the updated guidance, the effective interest rates increased by approximately
5 percentage p0ints to 8.5%, 6.0% and 6.25% for the 2012,2014 and 2017 notes, respectively, for the non»cash
amortization of the debt discount over the lives of the notes. Interest expense was increased by $9 which decreased
our Income from continuing operations and Net income by $5 ($0.01 per share) for the three months ended
September 30, 2008. Interest expense was increased by $25 which decreased our Income from continuing
operations and Net income by $16 ($0.03 per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2008. Had the update
been effective in 2008, we would have charged our fourth quarter 2008 dividends to Additional paid-in capital rather
than Retained earnings ; therefore, we made the reclassification in 2009. Cash flows from operations were not
impacted by the adoption ol the updated guidance. The impact on our 2009 opening balance in Retained earnings
was as follows:

At December 31,

2008
Balance belore application of updated guidance $ 7
Impact of adoption of updated guidance (31)
Reclassification of dividends to Additional paid-in capital 28
Balance after application of updated guidance 39 4

For the three months ended September 30, 2009, we recorded $8 and $15 of interest expense for the
contractual interest coupon and amortization ol the debt discount, respectively, related to the convertible senior
notes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we recorded $22 and $41 of interest expense for the
contractual interest coupon and amortization ol the debt discount, respectively, related to the convertible senior
notes. The remaining unamortized debt discount is amortized over the remaining 3, 5 and 8 year periods of the 2012,
2014 and 2017 convertible senior notes, respectively.

Accounting for the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

In April 2008, the ASC guidance for Goodwill and Other Intangibles was updated to amend the factors that
should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life 01 a
recognized intangible asset. The intent 01 this update is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a
recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under
guidance for business combinations. The updated guidance was effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1,
2009 and was applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired alter the eﬂective date. The adoption had no
impact on our consolidated financial position, results ot operations or cash flows.

Derivative Instruments

In March 2008, the ASC guidance for derivatives and hedging was updated for enhanced disclosures about how
and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and the related hedged items are
accounted for, and how derivative instruments and the related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
finanCial perlormance and cash tlows. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2009. The adoption had no
impact on our consolidated financial position, results ot operations or cash flows. See Note 16 for our derivative
instruments disclosure.

Business Combinations

In December 2007, the ASC guidance for business combinations was updated to provide new guidance tor
recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree. The updated guidance also provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the tinancial
statements to evaluate the nature and financial ettects of the business combination. We adopted the updated
guidance on January 1, 2009 and applied it to the acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in the Boddington
project completed on June 25, 2009 (see Note 14).

In April 2009, the guidance was updated to address application issues on initial recognition and measurement,
subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure ot assets and liabilities arising trorn contingencies in a
business combination. This update is effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The adoption of the updated guidance did
not have any impact on the Company's acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in the Boddington project
completed on June 25, 2009 (see Note 14).

Noncontrolling Interests

In December 2007, the ASC guidance for Noncontrolling Interests was updated to establish accounting and
reporting standards pertaining to: (i) ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent
(“noncontrolling interest"), (ii) the amount of net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest,
(iii) changes in a parent's ownership interest, and (iv) the valuation of any retained noncontrolling equity investment
when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. If a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment
in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value and a gain or loss is recognized in net income based on such fair
value. For presentation and disclosure purposes, the guidance requires noncontrolling interests to be classified as a
separate component 01 equity. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2009. Except for presentation
changes, the adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash tlows.

Fair Value Accounting

In September 2006, the ASC guidance for fair value measurements and disclosure was updated to detine fair
value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, and expand disclosures about fair value measurements. We
adopted the updated guidance tor assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on January 1,
2008. In February 2008, the FASB staff issued an update to the guidance which delayed the etfective date tor
nonfinancial assets and nontinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a nonrecurring basis. We adopted the updated guidance tor our nonfinancial assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on January 1, 2009.

64


Table of Contents

In April 2009, the guidance was further updated to provide additional guidance on determining fair value when
the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying circumstances
that indicate when a transaction is not orderly. In April 2009, the guidance for investments in debt and equity
securities was updated to: (i) clarify the interaction of the factors that should be considered when determining
whether a debt security is other than temporarily impaired, (ii) prowde guidance on the amount of an other-than-
temporary impairment recognized for a debt security in earnings and other comprehensive income and (iii) expand
the disclosures required for other»than-temporary impairments for debt and equity securities. Also in April 2009, the
guidance for financial instruments was updated to require disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments for
interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements. Adoption of this
updated guidance was required for our interim reporting period beginning April 1, 2009 with early adoption permitted.
We adopted the updated guidance for the interim period ended March 31, 2009. Refer to Note 15 for further details
regarding our assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Fair Value Accounting

In August 2009, the ASC guidance for fair value measurements and disclosure was updated to further define fair
value of liabilities. This update provides clarification for circumstances in which: (i) a quoted price in an active market
for the identical liability is not available, (ii) the liability has a restriction that prevents its transfer, and (iii) the identical
liability is traded as an asset in an active market in which no adjustments to the quoted price of an asset are required.
The updated guidance is eﬂective for our interim reporting period beginning October 1, 2009. We are evaluating the
potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Variable Interest Entities

In June 2009, the ASC guidance for consolidation accounting was updated to require an entity to perform a
qualitative analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest gives it a controlling financial interest in a
variable interest entity (“VIE”). This analysis identifies a primary beneficiary of a VIE as the entity that has both of the
folloWing characteristics: (i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's
economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could potentially
be significant to the VIE. The updated guidance also requires ongoing reassessments of the primary beneficiary of a
VIE. The updated guidance is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2010. We currently account for Nusa
Tenggara Partnership (“NTP”) as a VIE and are evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
(dollars in millions, except per ounce and per pound amounts).
Metal Prices

Changes in the market price of gold significantly affect our profitability and cash flow. Gold prices can fluctuate
widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and
lending; investor sentiment; the strength of the U.S. dollar; inflation, deflation, or other general price instability; and
global mine production levels. Changes in the market price of copper also affect our profitability and cash flow.
Copper is traded on established international exchanges and copper prices generally reflect market supply and
demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates.

Cash Flow Hedges

Given that the fair value of our derivative instruments are based upon market rates and prices and that the
volatility of these rates and prices are dependent on many factors subject to fluctuation, we are exposed to liquidity
risks related to these contracts. We cash settle the fair value of each contract upon settlement with our
counterparties. The settlement values of our contracts could differ significantly from the current fair values. As such,
we are exposed to liquidity risk related to unfavorable changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts.

We had the following derivative instruments designated as hedges With fair values at September 30,2009 and
December 31,2008:

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We utilize foreign currency contracts to reduce the variability of the US dollar amount of forecasted foreign
currency expenditures caused by changes in currency rates.

We hedge up to 85% of our IDR, A15, and NZ$ denominated operating expenditures each period. The hedging
instruments are forward purchase contracts with expiration dates ranging up to three years from the date of issue.
The principal hedging objective is reduction in the volatility of realized period»on»period foreign exchange rates.

We hedge up to 95% of our A$ denominated capital expenditures related to the construction of Boddington. The
hedging instruments consist of a series of fixed fonivard contracts with expiration dates ranging up to one year from
the date of issue. The realized gains and losses associated With the capital expenditure hedge program will impact
Amortization during future periods in which the Boddington assets are placed into service.

Diesel Price Risk
We hedge up to 66% of our operating cost exposure related to diesel prices of luel consumed at our Nevada
operations to reduce the variability in realized diesel prices. The hedging instruments consist of a series of linancially
settled lixed fonivard contracts with expiration dates of up to two years from the date of issue. The contracts have
been designated as cash flow hedges of future diesel purchases, and as such, the effective portion of unrealized
changes in the market value have been recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are
recorded in earnings during the period in which the hedged transaction alfects earnings. Gains and losses from
hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings.

Treasury Rafe Lock Contracts
In connection with the 2019 and 2039 notes issued in September 2009, we acquired treasury rate lock contracts
to reduce the variability of the proceeds realized from the bond issuances. The treasury rate locks resulted in $6 and
$5 unrealized gains for the 2019 and 2039 notes, respectively. We previously acquired treasury rate locks in
connection With the issuance of the 2035 notes that resulted in a $10 unrealized loss. The gains/losses from these
contracts will be recognized over the remaining terms of the respective notes.

Fair Value Hedges
Interest Rate Risk

At September 30, 2009, we had $100 fixed to floating swap contracts designated as a hedge against a portion of
our 8 5/8% debentures. The interest rate swap contracts were transacted to provide balance to our mix of fixed and
floating rate debt. Under the hedge contract terms, we receive fixed-rate interest payments at 8.625% and pay
floating-rate interest amounts based on periodic London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) settings plus a spread,
ranging from 2.60% to 3.49%. The interest rate swap contracts were designated as fair value hedges, and as such,
changes in fair value have been recorded in income in each period, consistent with recording changes to the mark-
to-market value of the underlying hedged liability in income. Changes in the mark»to-market value of the effective
portion of the interest rate swap contracts are recognized as a component of Interest expense, net. The hedge
contracts decreased Interest expense, net by $1 and $ni| for the three months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, and decreased Interest expense, net by $3 and $1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and
2008, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, losses of $1 and $ni| were included
in Other income, net for the ineffective portion of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges,
respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, losses of $2 and $nil, respectively, were
included in other income, netfor the ineffective portion of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges.
Commodity Price Risk

LME copper prices averaged $2.65 per pound during the three months ended September 30, 2009, compared
with our recorded average provisional price of $2.73 per pound before mark-to-market gains and treatment and
refining charges. LME copper prices averaged $2.12 per pound during the nine months ended September 30, 2009,
compared With our recorded average provisional price of $2.23 per pound before mark-to»market gains and treatment
and refining charges. The applicable forward copper price at the end of the quarter was $2.79 per pound. During the
three months ended September 30, 2009, increasing copper prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market
gain of $48 ($0.34 per pound). During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, changes in copper prices
resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market gain of $112 ($0.33 per pound). At September 30, 2009, we had
copper sales of 140 million pounds priced at an average of $2.79 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next
several months.

The average London PM. gold fix was $960 per ounce during the three months ended September 30, 2009,
compared With our recorded average provisional gold price of $961 per ounce before mark-to-market gains and
treatment and refining charges. The average London P.M. gold fix was $931 per ounce during the nine months
ended September 30, 2009, compared With our recorded average provisional gold price of $930 per ounce before
mark-to-market gains and treatment and refining charges. The applicable forward gold price at the end of the quarter
was $996 per ounce. During the three months ended September 30, 2009, changes in gold prices resulted in a
provisional pricing mark»to-market gain of $5 ($3 per ounce). During the nine months ended September 30, 2009,
changes in gold prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market gain of $6 ($1 per ounce). At September 30,
2009, we had gold sales of 96,000 ounces priced at an average of $996 per ounce, subject to final pricing over the
next several months.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

Information regarding legal proceedings is contained in Note 27 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements contained in this Report and is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

The following risk factors contain information that updates those contained in the Corporation's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, as filed With the SEC on February 19, 2009, and amended by
Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on June 8,2009.

Our Interest in PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”) in Indonesia May be Reduced or Terminated
under the Contract of Work

We operate Batu Hijau, a producer ol copper/gold concentrates, in which we currently have a 45% ownership
interest, held through the Nusa Tenggara Partnership (“NTP”) with an aﬂiliate ol Sumitomo Corporation of Japan. We
have a 56.25% interest in NTP and a Sumitomo aﬂiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTP in turn owns 80% of
PTNNT, the Indonesian subsidiary that owns Batu Hiyau. The remaining 20% interest in PTNNT is owned by P.T.
Pukualu Indah (“PTPI”), an unrelated Indonesian company.

Under the Contract of Work executed in 1986 between the Indonesian government and PTNNT, beginning in
2006 and continuing through 2010, a portion of PTNNT’s shares must be olfered Ior sale, Iirst, to the Indonesian
government or, second, to Indonesian nationals, such portion equal to the difference between the following
percentages and the percentage of shares already owned by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if
such number is positive): 23% by March 31, 2006; 30% by March 31, 2007; 37% by March 31, 2008; 44% by
March 31, 2009; and 51% by March 31, 2010. The price at which such interest must be offered for sale to the
Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares would be accepted
for listing on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, or the fair market value of such interest as a going concern, as agreed With
the Indonesian government. Pursuant to this provision, it is possible that the ownership interest of the NeWmont»
Sumitomo partnership in PTNNT could be reduced to 49%, thus reducing our ability to control the operation at Batu
Hiyau.

PTPI has owned and continues to own a 20% interest in PTNNT, and therefore NTP was required to offer a 3%
interest in the shares of PTNNT for sale in 2006 and an additional 7% interest in each of 2007, 2008 and 2009. In
accordance with the Contract ol Work, an oﬂer to sell a 3% interest was made to the government of Indonesia in
2006 and an oﬂer Ior an additional 7% interest was made in each of 2007, 2008 and 2009. Following notifications
Irom the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources (the “DEMR") alleging that PTNNT was in breach of its
divestiture requirements under the Contract of Work and threatening to issue a notice to terminate the Contract of
Work it PTNNT did not agree to divest by 2006, 2007, and 2008 shares in accordance with the direction of the
DEMR, the matter was submitted to an international arbitration panel. That panel ruled in March 2009 that the 2006,
2007 and 2008 shares must be sold by the end of September 2009 and gave PTNNT until then to cure any delault by
selling the shares. On July 14, 2009, the Company reached agreement with the Indonesian government on the price
of the 2008 7% interest and the 2009 7% interest. PTNNT has reolfered the 2008 7% interest and the 2009 7%
interest to the Indonesian government at this newly agreed price. In September 2009, the deadline for completion of
transler of the 2006 3% interest, the 2007 7% interest and the 2008 7% interest was extended to November 12, 2009
by agreement between PTNNT and the Indonesian Government. This date coincides With the deadline for the sale
and transfer of the 2009 7% interest. Future disputes may arise as to the divestiture of the shares, the outcome of
which cannot be predicted. It is uncertain who will acquire the divestiture shares or the nature of our relations With the
new owner or owners.

Our Batu Hijau Operation in Indonesia is Subject to Political and Economic Risks

We have a substantial investment in Indonesia, a nation that since 1997 has undergone Iinancial crises and
devaluation of its currency, outbreaks of political and religious violence and acts of terrorism, changes in national
leadership, and the secession of East Timor, one of its Iormer provinces. These factors heighten the risk ol abrupt
changes in the national policy toward foreign investors, which in turn could result in unilateral modification ol
concessions or contracts, increased taxation, denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets.
Presidential and parliamentary elections recently took place, and although the president was re-elected, new
ministers or members of parliament may have diﬂerent (and potentially more negative) views relating to mining in
general or relative to our assets and operations Irom those of their predecessors.

Recent violence committed by radical elements in Indonesia and other countries, and the presence of U.S.
forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, may increase the risk that operations owned by U.S. companies Will be the target of


violence. If our Baku Hijau operation was so targeted it could have an adverse eﬁect on our business.
