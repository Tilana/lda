</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>all previous resolutions on the problem of trafficking in persons,

18 June 2008, 11/3 of 17 June 2009 and 14/2 of 17 June 2010, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on

</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>the principles set forth in relevant human rights instruments and 
declarations, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol

Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Optional Protocol thereto, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
and the Protocols thereto, and reaffirming in particular the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress

</p>
<p>  
&#8727; The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
the Council on its seventeenth session (A/HRC/17/2), chap. I. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p> <i>Recalling also </i>the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in 
Persons and Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice resolution 20/3 of 15 
April 2011, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming </i>that trafficking in persons violates and impairs the enjoyment of human 
rights, continues to pose a serious challenge to humanity and requires a concerted 
international assessment and response and genuine multilateral, regional and bilateral 
cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination for its eradication, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that women and girl victims are 
often subject to multiple forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of 
gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture and religion, as well as national or social origin, or 
other status, and that these forms of discrimination may themselves fuel trafficking in 
persons, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> that all States have an obligation to exercise due diligence to 
prevent trafficking in persons, to investigate instances of trafficking and punish 
perpetrators, to rescue victims and to provide for their protection and access to remedies, 
and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of victims,

Contemporary Forms of Slavery and the establishment of the United Nations Voluntary 
Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children,
