<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment undertook a visit to Ghana from 8 to 14 November 2013. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation to the Government for its 
willingness to open Ghana to an independent and objective scrutiny of its human rights 
situation, particularly in regard to a number of critical issues in its criminal justice system 
and mental health-care practices. He hopes the Government will find his recommendations 
a useful tool for engaging in a constructive dialogue with all interlocutors to strengthen 
legal safeguards and improve the living conditions of those deprived of their liberty in all 
places of detention, including medical facilities and prayer camps.

<p>United Nations A/HRC/25/60/Add.<footnote name="1">3. In Nkawkaw police station the Special Rapporteur examined two detainees who had 
physical injuries which were consistent with their testimonies of recent beatings by fists or 
blunt instruments used by police during the course of their arrest, transportation and, in 
particular, interrogation. This was corroborated by forensic medical examinations, of 
which the conclusions were that the mistreatment inflicted was normally of short duration, 
consisting mainly of physical trauma caused by punches, slapping and occasionally blows 
with objects such as canes or batons.  
14. The Police Intelligence and Professional Standards Bureau is an internal 
mechanism that receives and investigates cases of alleged police brutality and violations of </footnote>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.<footnote name="1">2. The situation on the ground regarding the practice of torture or ill-treatment by the 
police is one in which abuses do occur in some individual cases during arrest, transfer to 
police stations and interrogation, but the Special Rapporteur did not find evidence that 
those abuses were part of a widespread pattern or systemic practice. The Special 
Rapporteur visited Nkawkaw central police station, Ejisu police station, the Cape Coast 
regional police station and Kotokuraba central police station. In at least three of the police 
stations visited, he noted traumatic scars on inmates&#8217; bodies that were consistent with 
allegations of beatings with canes or batons.

<p> I. Introduction.............................................................................................................  1&#8211;<footnote name="5">9. The Prisons Service Act applies progressive disciplinary steps of an incremental 
nature, from the temporary denial of some benefits, to loss of remission, to the 
implementation of more serious disciplinary procedures, such as solitary confinement for 
up to 28 days, hard labour for up to 28 days, a reduction in food for up to 7 days and 
corporal punishment in the form of caning. However, the official position of the Prisons 
Service on caning is that it constitutes a criminal offence pursuant to section 25 of the Act.

prisoner-on-prisoner violence being committed by certain prisoners designated by the 
authorities as &#8220;black coats&#8221;. Those prison leaders exercise a high degree of authority 
within the prison population. The Special Rapporteur examined several detainees in the 
two prisons and found three cases of clear physical evidence of recent and severe caning. 
The testimonies he received from detainees indicated that caning is sometimes used as a 
physical punishment by prison guards, but is most often carried out by prisoners under the </footnote>1 4

reform and reintegration. Despite that welcome change, the Special Rapporteur clinically 
documented traumatic physical injuries on seven juvenile inmates, resulting from a severe 
caning incident that had taken place within the 48 hours prior to the visit of his team. 
According to the boys&#8217; testimonies, eight children had been caned by a prison official as a 
disciplinary measure. The Special Rapporteur asked the then Acting Director-General of 
the Prisons Service to conduct an urgent, independent and impartial inquiry to establish 
accountability for this serious act of torture. The Prisons Service publicly stated that no 
such treatment would be tolerated, citing article 28 (1) (d) of the Constitution, which gives 
special protection to children against exposure to physical and moral hazards, and said that 
the complaint would be investigated without undue delay. </footnote>7 9

</p>
<p> IV. Conclusions and recommendations.........................................................................  82&#8211;<footnote name="1">8. The Special Rapporteur observed that, despite the overcrowding, the remand 
(pretrial), convicted and death row prisoners are for the most part held in separate sections 
of the prison and follow different regimes. However, at Sekondi prison he did noted that 
some juveniles were being held in very overcrowded conditions in the adult remand 
section. The Government advised that warrants do not state the age of the prisoner, but that 
investigations are conducted if there is a suspicion of a juvenile being held with adults and 
if it is established that he or she is a minor, he or she is transferred to the Senior 
Correctional Centre for juveniles. 
19. Owing to the level of overcrowding, the ratio of prison staff to prisoners is severely 
distorted. In Kumasi prison, one of the most densely overpopulated prisons, the officer-
inmate ratio is 1:20 rather than the recommended 1:<footnote name="4">5. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that in 2012 the Government increased 
the food budget threefold and the Prisons Service now allocates 90 United States cents per 
inmate per day. However, the authorities openly acknowledge that this amount does not 
allow for sufficient portions that are nutritionally balanced, owing to the overcapacity rate </footnote> (the national average is 1:7). Those 
conditions cause heightened tensions. Because of the lack of guards, there appears to be a 
practice of assigning selected prisoners to have authority over other prisoners in their cell 
or block.

<p>  B. Recommendations ..........................................................................................  94&#8211;<footnote name="1">7. Of the 43 prisons in Ghana, the Special Rapporteur visited 9: Ankaful maximum 
security prison, Nsawam medium security prison, Kumasi and Sekondi central prisons, 
Kumasi female prison, Ankaful main camp prison, Ankaful open camp prison, the 
Contagious Diseases Centre and the Senior Correctional Facility for juveniles. Many of the 
prisons are decaying forts or former slave warehouses built during the colonial era and 
transformed into prisons after independence; they are in urgent need of extensive repairs. 
</footnote>07 17 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.<footnote name="1">6. Engagement with the then Acting Director-General of the Prisons Service was a 
positive element of the visit. She stated that a shift in attitude was under way, from a 
purely punitive penal system to a more modern approach to the reform, rehabilitation and 
reintegration of inmates, in accordance with international human rights standards. The 
majority of the detainees interviewed by the Special Rapporteur had no complaints about 
their treatment by prison officials, although they sometimes alleged ill-treatment by the 
police.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b>1. The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment, Juan E. M&#233;ndez, conducted a visit to Ghana from 8 to 14 November 2013, 
at the invitation of the Government.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur met representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the 
Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Justice and the Office of the Attorney&#8211;General, the 
chief psychiatrist of the Ministry of Health, members of the Ghana Police and Prisons 
Services, the Military Legal Directorate and the judiciary, and the Commissioner of the 
national human rights institution of Ghana, the Commission on Human Rights and 
Administrative Justice. He also met representatives of United Nations agencies and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs). 
3. The Special Rapporteur thanks the National Intelligence Agency for facilitating his 
visit and expresses his appreciation to the Government for providing him with access to all 
detention facilities in accordance with the terms of reference for fact-finding missions by 
special rapporteurs (E/CN.4/1998/45, annex, appendix V). 
4. Ghana has already welcomed a number of visits by United Nations human rights 
experts. A meaningful dialogue with the Government has been initiated as a result of the 
visit of the Special Rapporteur and he looks forward to further collaboration. Ghana is at a 
critical stage in its development,<footnote name="1">International Monetary Fund, Country report No. 13/187, June 2013. </footnote> not only economically but also in advancing fundamental 
human rights for its citizens. That is an opportunity for Ghana to strengthen its role as a 
regional leader and advance down a path that prioritizes the human rights and dignity of 
one of the most marginalized sectors of society, those deprived of their liberty. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur shared his preliminary findings with the Government on 
14 November 2013 at the conclusion of his visit and an advance version of the present 
report on 7 February 2014. On 28 February 2014 the Government provided comments, 
which were taken into consideration before the report was finalized.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International level 
</b></p>
<p>6. Ghana has ratified 8 of the 10 core international human rights treaties, most 
recently the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in August 2012. Ghana 
has not yet ratified the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance or the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  
</p>
<p>7. The State has also ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and 
is a party to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional level 
</b></p>
<p>8. In 2011, Ghana made the declaration under article 34 (6) of the Protocol to the 
African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Establishment of an African Court 
on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, accepting the competence of the Court to receive and

</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>examine cases from individuals and NGOs, in accordance with article 5, paragraph 3, of 
the Protocol. 
</p>
<p><b> C. National level 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Constitutional and legislative provisions  
</b>9. Article 15, paragraph 2, of the 1992 Constitution of Ghana states that &#8220;no person 
shall &#8230; be subjected to (a) torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, (b) any other condition that detracts or is likely to detract from his dignity and 
worth as a human being&#8221;. However, the offence of torture, as defined in article 1 of the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, has not yet been included in the Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29), 
(CAT/C/GHA/C0/1, para. 9).  
</p>
<p><b> III. Assessment of the situation 
</b>10. Ghana has emerged from its past of colonialism and military rule and its economic 
progress has had a stabilizing effect in the region. There remains a strong element of 
traditional practice that must be engaged with, in order to ensure that human rights take 
hold in all regions of the country. There is clearly a resource issue in the light of the steps 
still to be taken, but a key element is also the political will to address urgent issues in both 
the criminal law and health-care systems to ensure that current practices and existing 
conditions do not give rise to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or 
even torture.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Practice of torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Police Service 
</b>11. The legal framework governing the work of the police is the Ghana Police Service 
Act, 1970 (Act 350). The Inspector-General of Police has overall responsibility for the 
prevention of crime, the enforcement of law and order, the promotion of the safety of 
citizens and respect for human rights. There are 651 police stations and posts across 11 
regions. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>human rights. According to statistics received, the Bureau has 433 cases pending. Between 
January 2011 and June 2013 it investigated and found guilty 108 officers who were 
dismissed from the service, 132 officers who were reduced in rank and 239 who received a 
warning. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Prisons Service  
</b>15. The overall responsibility for correctional facilities in Ghana, for the 
implementation of judicial decisions and for the execution of sentences lies with the 
Prisons Service under the Ministry of the Interior. The main national legal instrument 
regulating the treatment of prisoners is section 2, paragraph (a), of the Prisons Service Act, 
1972 (NRCD 46), which reiterates article 15 of the 1992 Constitution. Section 25 of the 
Prisons Service Act stipulates that &#8220;any prison officer who in any way tortures, or subjects 
to cruelty, any prisoner shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to 
imprisonment not exceeding five years&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>authority of the prison staff.2 The Government acknowledged the presence of &#8220;black coats&#8221; 
and cited prison standing order No. 460, which designates prisoners who have shown good 
conduct and steady progress, in a special class known as &#8220;star class&#8221;. The Government 
claims that these prisoners are not given special powers or allowed to exercise disciplinary 
functions. 
</p>
<p>21. According to the Government, in 2012 there were 94 deaths in custody, all from 
natural causes, as a result of malaria, tuberculosis or HIV (no cases of murder, accidental 
death or suicide were recorded). When a death in custody occurs, it is reported to the 
police and a coroner (who is also a magistrate) orders an autopsy, which is carried out by 
doctors under the Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Safeguards and prevention 
</b></p>
<p>22. In the police stations visited, the Special Rapporteur observed case files piled up on 
the desks of the chiefs of police, without an effective tracking and filing system. In fact, 
many inmates&#8217; case  files are simply lost or overlooked.3  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the &#8220;Justice for All&#8221; programme, the project  to 
review the remand system, which was established in October 2007 and is overseen jointly 
by the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Justice and the Attorney-General. The project 
established special courts in the prisons to try to reduce lengthy delays in the criminal 
justice system by reviewing the backlog of remand cases, including expired warrants. Over 
the past four years, 350 remand cases have been reviewed and, according to the 
Government, the number of prisoners with expired warrants has been reduced from 1,872 
to 763 as of December 2013. In 2012, seven special court sittings were held at Nsawam 
prison, as a result of which 59 remand prisoners were released, 62 granted bail and 27 
refused bail. Another programme to try and relieve the burden on the judiciary and speed 
up the trial process is the establishment of paralegal units at the headquarters of the Prisons 
Service and at all central prisons to review the backlog of pending cases and identify cases 
which can be dismissed, proceed to trial, or go to appeal. The Government hopes to 
receive support to establish a paralegal unit in the Nsawam prison in the future. 
</p>
<p><b>  Access to a lawyer 
</b></p>
<p>24. Section 10, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Procedure Code grants police officers 
broad powers of arrest without a warrant, including on &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; that an 
offence has been or is about to be committed. 
</p>
<p>25. Article 14, paragraph 2, of the Constitution states that a person shall be informed 
immediately, in a language he understands, of the reasons for his arrest, restriction or 
detention, and of the right to a lawyer of his choice. A person also has the right to inform a 
family member of his arrest and the location of his detention and a right to appear before a 
magistrate within 48 hours of arrest. Despite these legal safeguards, the Special Rapporteur 
is concerned that the police do not always bring suspects before a magistrate, as prescribed 
by law, but deliver suspects directly into custody.  
</p>
<p>26. A fundamental safeguard against torture and ill-treatment is the right of access to a 
lawyer at all stages of the investigation process and particularly from the moment of 
apprehension. Article 14, paragraph 2, of the Constitution provides for that right; however, 
it is not effectively exercised by indigents who cannot afford a lawyer and this vulnerable 
group of people comprises the vast majority of those in the criminal justice system. The

</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Legal Aid Scheme Act, 1997 (Act 542), provides legal assistance as a right only to persons 
charged with capital offences punishable by death or a life sentence. The scheme is not 
comprehensive enough to cover all criminal offences, so the vast majority of defendants 
have no access to legal representation.  
</p>
<p>27. The legal aid system in Ghana is severely underfunded and understaffed: there are 
only 15 public defenders. In 2012, out of 7,925 cases where legal aid services were 
provided, only 1,000 were criminal cases. In practice, appointed counsel often fail to 
appear for remand dates or trials as they are not adequately compensated. Despite the fact 
that the Bar Association of Ghana mandates the provision of pro bono services as a 
professional duty, only a few lawyers take on such cases on a regular basis when 
requested.  
</p>
<p>28. In 2011, the legal aid scheme identified 1,150 persons in custody with lapsed court 
warrants, who were subsequently released by the High Court. But there are thousands of 
inmates who languish in prison, either in remand detention for years or serving lengthy 
sentences; all are at risk of being subjected to inhumane conditions owing to a lack of legal 
safeguards. In the words of one prisoner &#8220;unless you have money to appeal then you stay 
in.&#8221;4  
</p>
<p><b>  Confession statements  
</b>29. While suspects appear to be informed by the arresting or interrogation officer about 
their right to a lawyer, if a suspect cannot afford to pay for a lawyer or the offence is not 
serious enough for him to be provided with a legal aid lawyer, the police can proceed to 
the interrogation stage. 
</p>
<p>30. Section 120, paragraph 2 of the Evidence Act, 1975 (NRCD 323), regulates the 
taking of evidence in legal proceedings and renders inadmissible as evidence statements 
made in the absence of &#8220;an independent witness (other than a police officer or member of 
the Armed Forces) approved by the accused.&#8221; A witness can be a relative, friend or third 
party who attests that they were present during the taking of the statement and that it was 
not made under duress. However, the regulation does not refer explicitly to torture or 
duress and thus the accused are at risk of making a coerced confession during 
interrogation, especially as the vast majority of defendants lack any legal representation. 
31. The representative of the Office of the Attorney-General stated that there must be 
other corroborating evidence and that a confession alone is not used to secure a conviction, 
but the Special Rapporteur has not received statistics on the application of the Evidence 
Act, or information as to whether any officials have been prosecuted and punished for 
extracting a confession under torture, or if there have been cases where the courts exclude 
confessions obtained under torture as evidence.5  
</p>
<p><b>  Complaint procedure 
</b>32. The Director of the Police Service acknowledged that, as in every country, there 
may be individual police officers who abuse the rights of suspects. The Police Intelligence 
and Professional Standards Bureau monitors police conduct but its reports are not made 
public. Upon receiving a complaint, an investigation is conducted and recommendations 
made to the Inspector-General of Police. If an officer is found guilty, disciplinary action 
may be recommended. In serious cases, the police officer involved is referred to the 
Criminal Investigation Department, which can institute criminal proceedings.

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.1

</p>
<p>33. Section 22, paragraph 1, of the Prisons Service Act provides that a prisoner can 
make a complaint of assault, maltreatment or intimidation by a prison officer, or neglect or 
non-performance of duties or other misconduct. The complaint is submitted to the block 
commander, Director or officer-in-charge of the prison and passed up the chain of 
command to the regional level and then on to the then Acting Director-General of the 
Prisons Service under the Ministry of the Interior. According to the Government, only 
three complaints have been received at the highest level; they involved prisoner-on-
prisoner violence and were immediately investigated and appropriate sanctions imposed. 
There have been no complaints about treatment by prison staff. With nearly 15,000 
prisoners living in oppressive conditions under authorities who also work in a difficult 
environment, the number of complaints seems surprisingly low. 
</p>
<p><b>  Lack of effective investigation of allegations of torture 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur noted during interviews with detainees that, even when 
there were allegations of police brutality or use of excessive force, there was a general 
reluctance to complain and, as a result, few cases appear to have been investigated. 
</p>
<p>35. During his meeting with the Police Service, the Special Rapporteur was not 
provided with recent statistical data on allegations of torture and ill-treatment and on the 
results of any investigations undertaken in respect of law enforcement (CAT/C/GHA/1, 
paras. 66&#8211;75). There was also a lack of information concerning personnel who may be 
responsible for an offence under section 25 of the Prisons Service Act. It appears that few 
investigations are conducted and officials are seldom prosecuted.  
</p>
<p><b>  Burden of proof and independent medical examinations 
</b></p>
<p>36. There is a forensic laboratory in Accra under the authority of the Criminal 
Investigation Department and the Government reported that it was satisfied with the level 
of forensic expertise. However, the Special Rapporteur notes the absence of routine 
medical examinations by qualified forensic medical doctors at the police investigation 
stage, by court order or upon admission to prison. He is also concerned about sections 10&#8211;
13 of Police Service instruction 171, which provide for medical examinations to be 
conducted under the control of government medical officers and in the presence of a police 
officer during supposedly independent medical examinations. Medical assessments 
requested for forensic purposes are performed by medical staff who have no specific 
competence in forensic medicine.  
</p>
<p><b>  Monitoring and inspection of places of detention  
</b></p>
<p>37. In accordance with articles 2 and 16 of the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Government is obliged to 
prevent acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The 
Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice does some prison monitoring, 
but does not currently receive adequate funding to conduct extensive monitoring. Some 
national NGOs have a limited monitoring and reporting role, subject to resources. 
38. The Police Intelligence and Professional Standards Bureau is mandated to visit 
police stations to check on those detained in police custody and their treatment by 
personnel (A/HRC/WG6.14/GHA/1, para. 109) but neither the frequency nor the findings 
of such visits were ascertained.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
</b>39. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the commitment of the Government of Ghana to 
ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Ibid., para. 101). In 2009, the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Government took initial steps to submit a bill on ratification to Parliament, but the process 
has stalled. Ratification of the Optional Protocol and designation of a national preventive 
mechanism under article 17 are urgently needed for more effective monitoring of all places 
of detention, particularly in the light of the critical issue of overcrowding. The 
Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice has indicated that it is ready to 
act as the national preventive mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Overcrowding 
</b>40. As of November 2013, there was a prison population of 14,101, of which between 
20 and 25 per cent were remand detainees. The Prisons Service stated that the total 
capacity of the prison system is 9,875, indicating an overcrowding rate of 140 per cent. As 
alarming as that figure is, it is an underestimate of the real rate of overcrowding, because it 
is based on the number of beds available in relation to the actual prison population. In 
some prisons, the beds themselves are so close together that, at full capacity or even at 
somewhat below capacity, living conditions would still be overcrowded. 
</p>
<p>41. According to the information received from the authorities in the prisons visited by 
the Special Rapporteur, the overcrowding actually ranges from a &#8220;low&#8221; of full capacity 
(100 per cent occupation) to a high of 400 per cent in some prisons, if the total inhabitable 
capacity of each facility is reasonably assessed. International guidelines require 1.5 to 3 
cubic metres of space per inmate, not counting common areas and toilets and showers. The 
rate of overcrowding is calculated as the actual population divided by such capacity. The 
overcrowding has been further aggravated by the dilapidated nature of some remand 
facilities, which were deemed so unfit for purpose that they were ordered to be closed. 
</p>
<p>42. Ankaful maximum security prison is a modern prison, commissioned in November 
2011, to remedy the overcrowding by housing prisoners serving lengthy sentences for 
serious and violent crimes. The first phase is operational and has an official capacity of 
2,000, but at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit there were only 343 prisoners. The 
second phase is in a preliminary planning stage and will include a school, workshops, 
recreation and religious facilities and accommodation for prison officers. 
</p>
<p>43. With the exception of Ankaful maximum security prison, the open prison camp in 
Ankaful and the Senior Corrections Facility for juveniles, the prisons visited had alarming 
rates of overcrowding. The male section of Nsawam prison was holding over five times its 
official capacity (3,773 inmates for an official capacity of 717) and Kumasi prison was 
holding over 2.5 times capacity (1,981 inmates for an official capacity of 800). Cell blocks 
there contained 115 convicted prisoners sharing a space approximately 8 x 5 metres. The 
remand sections were often even worse, with cells so overcrowded (40 in a cell designed 
for 4) that inmates were lying head to toe in a foetal position. In Sekondi prison, the 
inmates slept in shifts, sitting up, owing to the lack of space.  
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur also visited the holding cells of several police stations in 
different regions. The conditions in the cells visited were generally extremely poor. The 
situation at Nkawkaw police station was particularly bad: 32 inmates were subjected to 
extreme overcrowding in a small and overheated cell, with no ventilation, water or 
bedding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Food 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.1

</p>
<p>in the prison system, and that there is a need to undertake large-scale farming to improve 
inmates&#8217; welfare.    
</p>
<p>46. There is generally a very low standard of equipment and many of the prison 
kitchens consisted only of large pots used to produce porridge in the morning and <i>banku</i> 
(corn or cassava dough) or a thin soup that would often be served both for lunch and 
dinner.  
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur received numerous complaints from inmates regarding the 
quantity of food they were given, but the most frequent complaint was about the quality. 
He observed an apparent repetition of the dishes provided and an almost total absence of 
fruit, vegetables or meat. It appears that inmates rely heavily on their families to 
supplement their food in order to avoid malnutrition. 
</p>
<p>48. The food at the Ankaful maximum security prison was better than that of other 
prisons owing to additional funds not attributed to the food budget being available. 
Nsawam prison supplemented the standard meals with additional vegetables that inmates 
grew on land within the facility.  
</p>
<p><b>  Medical care 
</b></p>
<p>49. All inmates are registered under the national health insurance scheme and entitled 
to health-care services. However, in practice medical services provided in prisons fall far 
short of what international law requires. They are carried out not by doctors but by medical 
assistants, who are overstretched and so underequipped that even the most basic equipment 
and medicines are lacking. 
</p>
<p>50. Owing to harsh prison conditions, many inmates showed signs of illnesses that are 
preventable and treatable. A number of inmates with health problems or disorders 
requiring urgent hospitalization had experienced delays or been denied such treatment. 
Dental care was non-existent. Some inmates had obvious mental disturbances that required 
neuropsychological or psychiatric care. There are no staff specifically focused on mental 
health and &#8220;the problem and level of mental ill-health in prison is poorly documented&#8221;.<footnote name="6">0. The Special Rapporteur inspected isolation cells used for major offences but did not 
see any inmates being held in isolation. In fact, many of these cells are not used for 
disciplinary measures but to house inmates temporarily, owing to overcrowding. The 
prison authorities stated that an inmate might be held in an isolation cell for between three 
and seven days but that isolation for prolonged periods was not a practice, even for serious 
disciplinary offences. In cases of severe misbehaviour, an ad hoc panel that includes a </footnote> 
Mentally ill inmates are not routinely identified and therefore not transferred to general or 
psychiatric hospitals.  
</p>
<p>51. The then Acting Director-General of the Prisons Service openly acknowledged the 
problem of attracting and retaining health providers, especially mental health-care 
personnel, and was engaged with the Ministry of Health, the international community, 
NGOs and religious groups to try to address shortcomings. Prison officers have been sent 
on health-related courses in order to provide health-care services to inmates 
(A/HRC/25/WG.<footnote name="6">&#8220;Prisoners are bottom of the pile&#8221;, p. 24. </footnote>.14/GHA/1 para. 21).  
52. The Special Rapporteur observed that in Ankaful and Nsawam prisons there were 
screening programmes for inmates upon arrival. However, even the newest facility, 
Ankaful, had only a visiting medical doctor. The Special Rapporteur interviewed a number 
of the recent arrivals at the diagnostic centre at Nsawam and other detainees, who stated 
that they had not been examined by a medical doctor, physically or psychologically. In 
fact, Nsawam, the most populated prison, has no medical doctor on the staff, even part-
time. Nsawam does have a segregated area where detainees are held if it is suspected that 
they are ill, but as routine screenings upon entry by a doctor are rare to non-existent, an 
examination is only undertaken when obvious symptoms appear.  
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the establishment of the contagious disease 
prison in Ankaful (capacity 60 inmates). However, this centre is unable to treat the number 
of detainees in the penitentiary system who are suffering from tuberculosis, malaria, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>hepatitis or HIV. In the prisons he visited, the Special Rapporteur documented at least one 
case of tuberculosis and a number of other suspected cases of infectious or contagious 
diseases. Many places of detention have not received new supplies of drugs since 2012 and 
are dependent on donations. The diagnostic centre at Nsawam prison was not operational 
owing to the lack of supplies and Ankaful prison had insufficient medicine to equip its 
medical clinic. A common feature of all prison infirmaries visited was the extremely 
limited and insufficient supply of drugs administered to inmates, regardless of the 
diagnosis and the need for specific medicine or treatment. As a result, inmates rely on 
relatives to buy their medication.  
</p>
<p><b>  Sanitation, sleeping arrangements, work and education opportunities  
</b>54. In the prisons visited, it appeared that most inmates had access to water and the use 
of a shower or bucket to wash. However, the level of hygiene was extremely poor owing to 
overcrowding. The authorities stated that three prisons produced soap and distributed it to 
the other prisons; however, inmates said that the limited amount of soap available led to 
frequent skin irritations and other preventable health problems. 
</p>
<p>55. Those who have access to a toilet often share it with over 100 prisoners and toilets 
are often overflowing with excrement. Lockdown is generally from 4.30 p.m. to 6 a.m., so 
at night the prisoners relieve themselves in buckets or plastic bags. The lack of light and 
ventilation and the heat exacerbate the oppressive nature of the cells. Most inmates sleep 
on the floor without a mattress, mat or blanket. In the rainy season, wet and damp 
conditions contribute to poor health.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts by the prison authorities to provide 
inmates with educational opportunities and skills training (e.g. tailoring, carpentry, 
weaving). However, as acknowledged by the authorities, those opportunities are very 
limited; less than 10 per cent of inmates have access to training or work opportunities, 
mostly owing to lack of resources. In particular, working materials and machines are 
outdated or need maintenance. Even when opportunities do exist, for example at Ankaful 
main camp, they are poorly attended by inmates. Some inmates said that their lengthy 
sentences did not motivate them to participate in any programmes.  
</p>
<p>57. Ankaful has excellent recreational facilities and at Nsawam there is a large field. 
However, Kumasi prison, located in the centre of town, has only a small concrete area for 
outside use. Communal prayer, in all faiths, appeared to be the main activity available.  
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur observed education classes at Nsawam and Kumasi prisons 
and a formal education programme is being introduced into the system, including at 
Tamale and Wa Central prisons, but it has not yet reached all prisons owing to a lack of 
infrastructure. 
</p>
<p><b>  Discipline 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>high-ranking prison official recommends punishment that is ultimately imposed by the 
Director of the prison and usually consists of an entry in the inmate&#8217;s record. 
</p>
<p><b>  Family visits 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Prisons Service Act governs communications and visits from family, friends 
and legal counsel. Pursuant to section 38, prisoners are entitled to a visit from family or 
friends once every two weeks. However, these visits are closely monitored by prison staff 
sitting next to the prisoner and taking notes of the conversation. There is no physical 
contact and conjugal visits are not permitted. In practice, children under 18 are not allowed 
to visit. The authorities say this is owing to a lack of facilities to enable meaningful family 
interaction. 
</p>
<p><b>  Inmates serving life sentences or on death row 
</b></p>
<p>62. Since 1993 there has been a moratorium on executions. The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the white paper by the Government in response to the report of the 
Constitutional Review Commission, in which the Government accepted the 
recommendation of the Commission to abolish the death penalty (A/HRC/22/6, para. 
123.8). However, that recommendation has not yet been implemented. In November 2013, 
there were 129 prisoners in Nsawam prison who had been sentenced to death and 12 in 
Kumasi prison. The majority of inmates serving life sentences were also kept at these two 
prisons. Death-row prisoners are separated from the general population, are held in small, 
overcrowded, dark and poorly ventilated cell blocks and show signs of severe mental and 
physical trauma. They are denied access to any educational or recreational activities. These 
prisoners and those serving life sentences depend heavily on their families to provide food 
and medication, a burden that causes great economic hardship for their relatives. Many 
inmates stop receiving family visits as the years pass, which leaves them at greater risk of 
physical and mental deterioration.  
</p>
<p><b>  Juveniles 
</b>63. Juveniles may only be convicted by a juvenile court and the Senior Correctional 
Facility in Accra, with a capacity of 300, is the only juvenile facility in the country. When 
the Special Rapporteur visited it, there were 100 boys aged between 12 and 18 at the 
facility. The detainees receive formal education at junior high-school level and several 
have been admitted to senior high school. The centre also offers vocational training in 15 
different workshops, including on information and communications technology. The 
facility is an open camp with communal houses for sleeping. The Special Rapporteur heard 
no complaints regarding the food and, as described, meals seemed a notch above what is 
provided in adult prisons. Medical care is provided by medical aides, not professional 
doctors or nurses, just as in adult prisons. The authorities report that more than 50 per cent 
of juveniles do not receive family visits, either because the family lives too far away or the 
boy has been effectively abandoned by his family. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>65. The then Acting Director-General of the Prisons Service commissioned a formal 
inquiry regarding the actions of the authorities at the Senior Correctional Centre. It was 
found that the Chief Officer, contrary to agreed procedures, had flogged eight juveniles 
with twelve lashes on the back with a cane as a disciplinary act. Proceedings were initiated 
against three officers. The main perpetrator, the Chief Officer, has been dismissed from the 
Prisons Service. Proceedings against the duty officer and officer-in-charge are ongoing and 
the Special Rapporteur asks to be informed of the outcome.   
</p>
<p><b>  Women 
</b>66. At the time of his visit to Kumasi female prison, there were 177 females in 
detention. The conditions were generally better than in the male prisons, as overcrowding 
was less of a factor. However, not all the women were provided with bedding and the 
space for sleeping and recreational activities was very limited. The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the fact that only female officers are deployed in those facilities and that no 
allegations of mistreatment by prison guards were raised.  
</p>
<p>67. The Prisons Service has established a mother and baby unit at Nsawam prison, 
where women who give birth while in custody can keep their babies with them until the 
age of one. However, at Kumasi some women said their babies were removed after only a 
few months and then placed with a family member or social services. There is no 
additional budgetary allocation for supplementary food for pregnant or breastfeeding 
women.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Deprivation of liberty in mental health-care facilities 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Psychiatric institutions 
</b></p>
<p>68. There is no capacity to deal with mental illness within the prison system and there 
is also a serious shortage of mental health services in the country in general, with only 12 
practising psychiatrists and 600 psychiatric nurses nationwide, for a population of over 25 
million. That is only one psychiatrist for over 2 million people.7 According to the Director 
of the psychiatric hospital in Accra, to achieve proper care Ghana needs to increase the 
number of nurses in its three psychiatric hospitals almost sevenfold, from the current 600 
to about 4,000.  
</p>
<p>69. There are only three public psychiatric hospitals and the Special Rapporteur visited 
two of them, in Accra and Ankaful. Both lacked qualified staff and equipment and had 
poor sanitation. Owing to the lack of medicine and food, both institutions have 
considerably reduced the number of patients in their care over the past two years, but the 
special ward of the psychiatric hospital in Accra where those under court orders are held 
still had an overcrowding rate of 100 per cent and many patients slept in an open courtyard 
in inhumane conditions. A number of those interviewed confirmed that there was 
insufficient food and that they were often hungry. At the Ankaful hospital, patients could 
move around an internal courtyard but could not otherwise leave their ward.  
</p>
<p>70. Mental health care is not covered by the national health insurance scheme, on the 
basis of a widespread assumption that mental health care in hospitals is cost free. 
However, the hospitals are underfunded and do not provide essential medication, as their 
annual stock of medicines provided by the Government is insufficient, running out after 
the first six months of the year, and lacks variety for the range of different psychiatric 
conditions being treated. Patients are often required to buy their own medicines, which are 
usually very expensive.

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>71. The lack of recent-generation psychoactive drugs leads to the inadequate treatment 
of patients. The Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned about the application of 
electroshock therapy as practised at the psychiatric hospital in Accra, which is 
administered with the use of restraints, without adequate anaesthesia and not as a last 
resort. The hospital documents the consent of the patient, but the Special Rapporteur 
doubts that, in practice, such consent is free and informed, as international standards 
require.  
</p>
<p> <b> Prayer camps 
</b></p>
<p>72. Prayer camps are privately owned religious institutions that play a large role in 
Ghanaian society. It is estimated that 70 per cent of the population turn first to a prayer 
camp to receive spiritual healing in order to deal with any type of illness, in particular 
mental illness, as it is believed to be caused by evil spirits or demons. There are hundreds 
of private prayer camps, of which a majority are Christian-based and located in the south 
of the country, while there are some Muslim camps in the north. The camps are run by 
prophets, many of them self-proclaimed.  
</p>
<p>73. These prayer camps are essentially alternative residential facilities for those with 
mental disabilities, but they currently operate with little oversight and no State regulation. 
The Ghana Pentecostal and Charismatic Council, an umbrella body for 122 churches and 
evangelical associations in the country, has an ad hoc committee of elders but their 
oversight of the prayer camps is limited and practices in the camps are often inconsistent 
with the guidelines of the Council, which prohibit chaining or fasting of any &#8220;sick&#8221; person 
and require the camps to send persons with mental disabilities to hospitals.8  
</p>
<p>74. The Director of the Ankaful psychiatric hospital has taken the initiative of reaching 
out to the traditional healers to try to coordinate traditional and medical/psychiatric 
approaches, in order to provide holistic solutions. The Special Rapporteur observed 
extremely disturbing practices in the two prayer camps he visited. He documented cases of 
shackling and fasting forced on persons with mental disabilities or in some cases with 
neurological problems, including children. In Edfuma prayer camp men, women and 
children were shackled to the walls or floors of their cells. The building holding adult 
males contained 16 concrete cells laid out like cattle stalls. There was a separate building 
for women and juveniles where 10 persons were chained to the floor, including a 14 year-
old girl and a 7 year-old boy, who exhibited symptoms not of a mental illness but of a 
neurological disease that required specialized treatment and medication.  
</p>
<p>75. In Jesus Divine Temple (Nyakumasai) prayer camp, individuals were chained to 
trees. Some were under wooden shelters or large plastic bags but others were completely 
exposed to the elements. The main reason for the shackling of patients in the prayer camps, 
according to the leaders, was the risk of escape or the aggressive behaviour of some 
patients. However, that reason does not fall within the scope of the exceptions for 
temporary measures recognized in international standards. In addition, most of the 
individuals that the Special Rapporteur examined in the two camps were shackled 24 hours 
a day for prolonged periods - months and in some cases years. The Special Rapporteur saw 
a man confirmed to be the same individual who had been shackled when visited two years 
earlier by an NGO and he was still shackled.9  
</p>
<p>76. The traditional leaders told the Special Rapporteur that those individuals were not 
permitted to leave until the leaders received a message from God that they had been 
&#8220;healed.&#8221; Some remained even after being discharged, because their families had 
abandoned them and they could not return to their home communities. It does not appear

</b></p>
<p>that the patients detained in the prayer camps have ever had their cases reviewed by a 
court.10  
</p>
<p>77. Many of those interviewed said they had not eaten for several days and were 
uncertain for how many days they had been chained; some appeared very weak owing to 
fasting that seemed to have gone on for longer than a week. The prophets confirmed that 
forced fasting was a key component of the cure as it starved evil spirits and allowed the 
spirit of God to heal. The Edfuma prayer camp administered a mixture of traditional herbs, 
which the patients were forced to drink, as it was believed to contain special healing 
powers. 
</p>
<p><b>  Mental Health Act  
</b></p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of the Mental Health Act (Act 846) 
in 2012. The positive aspects of the legislation are that both psychiatric hospitals and 
prayer camps will be monitored, there will be an individual complaints system in place and 
a procedure for persons with mental disabilities to review and challenge their prolonged 
detention before a judge. The new Act also foresees a mechanism for funding, which is 
urgently needed in the mental health-care sector.11 However, the Special Rapporteur notes 
with concern that no further steps have been taken to implement the Act since its 
promulgation.  
</p>
<p>79. The current practice is that family members deliver individuals to a psychiatric 
hospital or prayer camp, or police remove individuals off the street when they exhibit 
confused or aggressive behaviour. Even when a person comes voluntarily to a mental 
health facility, family members or staff routinely make decisions on admission, treatment 
and discharge, thus effectively denying that person the legal capacity to make his or her 
own decisions.12 
</p>
<p>80. While the new Act has narrowed the definition of &#8220;voluntary&#8221; and excluded the 
possibility of families admitting relatives &#8220;voluntarily&#8221; without their free and informed 
consent, it presumes the &#8220;incapacity&#8221; of persons with mental disabilities. The Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that this limits their ability to decide where to live and what 
treatment to receive. 
</p>
<p>81. Just after the visit of the Special Rapporteur, the Government constituted the 
Mental Health Board, a critical first step towards implementation of the Act. However, a 
representative of the mental health community is not among the board members, as has 
been advocated by civil society. With the oversight body still not functional, there is no 
mechanism in place to monitor prayer camps effectively and routinely. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>A number of high-ranking officials in the Police and Prisons Services have 
been involved in United Nations peacekeeping missions, are aware of international 
human rights standards and appear committed to implementing a more humane 
approach to law enforcement and corrections. However, many challenges remain for 
this vision to be realized.

</p>
<p>health care. 
 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>83. <b>There are isolated incidents of torture and ill-treatment by police officers 
during the initial stages of interrogation. While prisoners did not allege ill-treatment 
by prison staff, the practice of delegating disciplinary authority to fellow inmates is a 
corrupt and bad practice that must be eradicated within the prison system.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The construction of a new prison, the &#8220;Justice for All&#8221; programme and 
presidential pardons (800 prisoners were pardoned in 2012) are helping to reduce 
prison overcrowding, but the lack of an effective criminal judicial system is at the 
core of the problem. There is no comprehensive and well-resourced legal aid 
programme; only a limited number of offences are bailable; pretrial detention is 
prolonged owing to inadequate police investigations, lost case files and a shortage of 
judges; sentencing policies result in excessively lengthy custodial sentences; remission 
of sentences is very limited; alternative measures are not implemented; and there is 
no parole system because of a lack of resources and trained officers. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>International human rights standards are not met in the Ghanaian prison 
system. The extreme level of overcrowding extends to those on remand, the convicted 
and the condemned, and results in a number of serious violations: inadequate 
nutrition, insufficient access to medical care, poor sanitation, personal insecurity and 
the absence of rehabilitation services. These substandard conditions constitute cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. On 1 March 2014, the Director-
General of the Prisons Service established a transformational task force to help 
upgrade the prisons system so that it conforms to international standards. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>In the past 20 years, no executions have been carried out; however, condemned 
prisoners experience the &#8220;death row phenomenon&#8221;, which amounts to ill-treatment 
or even torture. The Government has set up a committee to move towards 
implementation of the recommendation to abolish the death penalty. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The ratification and implementation of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment must be a priority, to allow a system of regular prison monitoring. The 
Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice currently monitors some 
places of detention and could become an effective monitoring mechanism, if 
adequately resourced to visit all places of detention regularly. However, it should not 
be considered as a substitute for effective complaints mechanisms.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The complaints system regarding allegations of torture and ill-treatment and 
the investigation, prosecution and punishment of perpetrators are provided for in law 
but not implemented, except in a very few cases. The lack of accountability is also the 
result of a very basic level of forensic services, which means that medical 
examinations, if carried out at all, are not conducted by independent forensic 
specialists but by poorly trained doctors, or even nurses, employed by the Ministry of 
the Interior.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>While the Juvenile Justice Act (2003) and the Children&#8217;s Act (1998) prohibit 
corporal punishment, such as caning, as a disciplinary measure in prisons, these laws 
must be effectively enforced and those who violate them must be held accountable.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Denying minors the right to be included in family visits to detainees is a 
violation of the prisoner&#8217;s right to family contact and of the right of the child to have 
a relationship with parents who may be in the penitentiary system.</b>13 <b>

<p><b>treatment of people with mental or intellectual disabilities for even a short period 
may constitute torture or ill-treatment (A/HRC/22/53, para. 63) if it is not required to 
prevent harm to the patients or others, and then only for as long as that harm is 
imminent. The use of electroshock treatment at the psychiatric hospital in Accra 
without adequate anaesthesia constitutes cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. 
Such treatment requires that special attention be paid to whether free and informed 
consent has been given, as required by international law. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>In the prayer camps, shackling of any duration, denial of food and medicine, 
inadequate shelter and involuntary treatment constitute torture.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>There remains a social stigma prevalent in Ghanaian society about mental and 
intellectual disabilities, despite the adoption of the Mental Health Act. With the Act 
not yet in effect, there is no functioning oversight mechanism and prayer camps 
remain unregulated. Some provisions of the Act may not be in line with the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and could be abused by health-
care staff or family members.

<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>In a spirit of cooperation and partnership, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government take decisive steps to implement the 
recommendations set out below, with appropriate financial and logistical assistance 
from the international community, including the United Nations and other actors. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>With regard to the Constitution and legislation, the Government should: 
(a) Incorporate clear legal provisions into the Constitution and national 
</b></p>
<p><b>laws to the effect that the prohibition of torture is absolute and non-derogable, in 
accordance with article 2, paragraph 2, of the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Take the necessary measures to ensure that torture is established as an 
offence in national law and adopt a definition of torture that includes all the elements 
contained in article 1 of the Convention. The Government should also ensure that 
such offences are made punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account 
their grave nature, in accordance with article 4, paragraph 2, of the Convention; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Amend the Evidence Act, 1975, concerning evidence to be admitted in 
judicial proceedings, to bring it into line with the provisions of article 15 of the 
Convention to explicitly exclude any evidence obtained as a result of torture; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Amend national laws to explicitly prohibit corporal punishment and 
limit the imposition of solitary confinement to a maximum of 15 days as disciplinary 
measures (A/66/268 para. 84).  
</b>96. <b>With regard to safeguards and prevention, the Government should:
