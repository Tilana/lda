counter and combat this kind of criminal activity. For example, the Act on countering the 
trafficking in persons was adopted on 17 April 2008 and the definition of the term 
&#8220;trafficking in persons&#8221; contained therein is consonant with that set forth in article 3 of the 
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and 
Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 
Crime. Pursuant to this law, the presidential decree of 8 July 2008 approved a national plan

2008&#8211;<footnote name="20">. During that time, he regularly spoke to his parents by telephone. He received food

of 2009, B.I&#8217;s mother went to the town of Kyzylorda to search for her son. On meeting her, 
N.M. explained that B.I. had worked for him and lived at his house, but that he did not 
possess any information regarding his current whereabouts. B.I. did not file a complaint 
with law enforcement agencies or officials of the Department of Internal Affairs of South </footnote>10. The presidential decree established the Republican Interdepartmental 
Commission to Counter Trafficking in Persons, which is a coordination body consisting of 
the heads of Government bodies and community organizations, including the Ministries of 
Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Justice, the Economy, Finances, Health and Labor and 
Social Welfare, the National Security Service, the State Customs Committee, the Women&#8217;s 
Committee, the National Human Rights Centre, the Human Rights Commissioner of the 
Oliy Majlis (ombudsman), the Mahalla Foundation, the Central Council of the Kamolot 
youth movement and the Ijtimoii Fikr public opinion research centre. Local 
interdepartmental commissions to counter the trafficking in persons have been set up in all 
regions of the country.

propose the services of his 10-person &#8220;team&#8221; to work on building sites &#8211; to which N.M. 
agreed. In June 2008, B.B. and his building team, which did not include B.I. who was then 
at another N.M.&#8217;s building site, received the sum of US$3,000 and vanished without 
completing the building. B.I. stayed on for two to three months.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to the Human Rights Council resolution 6/14, the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and its consequences, may send 
Governments communications on individual cases and general situations of concern, based 
on reliable and credible information received from victims or other persons acting on behalf 
of the victims. This addendum sets out summaries of such communications sent from 1 July 
2009 to 1 June 2010 by the Special Rapporteur. It also includes summaries of Government 
replies received from 1 July 2009 to 2 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>2. For reasons of protection, the names of some of the victims appear only in initials in 
this report. The Special Rapporteur also used initials for a number of other persons 
concerned in order to minimise their risk of possible further victimization. Moreover, with a 
view to preserve the presumption of innocence, only initials are used for the names of 
alleged perpetrators. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General observations 
</b></p>
<p>3. During the period under review, five communications were sent by the Special 
Rapporteur together with the following mandates: the Special Rapporteur on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography; the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences; the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants; the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders. The Special 
Rapporteur received three replies to the communications as of 16 June 2010 and regrets that 
she still has not received replies to the remaining two communications. The Special 
Rapporteur wishes to recall the obligations of the Governments under the Human Rights 
Council resolution 8/12 to provide her with all the necessary information related to the 
mandate to enable her to fulfill the mandate effectively, and urges the Governments to 
submit replies to her communications in a timely manner to this end. 
</p>
<p>4. In framing her interventions in these cases, the Special Rapporteur was guided by 
the 1956 United Nations Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave 
Trade and Institutions and Practices similar to slavery which declares that &#8220;no one shall be 
held in slavery or servitude&#8221;. With regard to the issue of forced marriage, the Special 
Rapporteur recalled: article 16 (2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which 
prohibits forced marriage; article 1 (1) of the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition 
of Slavery which prohibits any institution or practice whereby &#8220;a woman, without the right 
to refuse, is promised or given in marriage on payment of a consideration in money or in 
kind to her parents, guardian, family, or any other person or group&#8221;; and article 2 of the 
Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery which requires State Parties to 
&#8220;encourage the use of facilities whereby the consent of both parties to a marriage may be 
freely expressed in the presence of a competent civil or religious authority, and to 
encourage the registration of marriages&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur was also guided by ILO Convention No. 182 on the worst 
forms of child labor, which calls on States Parties to take immediate and effective measures 
to secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour as a matter of 
urgency. &quot;The worst forms of child labour&quot; comprise, inter alia, all forms of slavery or 
practices similar to slavery, such as the sale and trafficking of children, debt bondage and 
serfdom and forced or compulsory labour, as well as the use, producing or offering of a 
child for prostitution, for production of pornography or for performance. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/20/Add.<footnote name="1">8. In its response, the Government informed that pursuant to paragraph 27 of the 
Instruction concerning a unified procedure for conducting interstate searches for persons, 
which was approved by the decision of the Council of Ministers of Internal Affairs of the 
States Parties of the Commonwealth of Independent States of 7 September 2007, the above-
mentioned application was forwarded to the Central Department for Criminal Investigation 
and Counterterrorism of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Uzbekistan with a view to 
initiating investigations and an international search for B.I. It further highlighted that the 
staff of the internal affairs agencies of Kazakhstan again contacted the human rights group 
in order to exchange information on B.I&#8217;s whereabouts. According to the letter from the 
human rights group dated 3 December 2009, B.I. was then at home. 
</footnote>

</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur recalled Resolution 12/2 of 12 October 2009, in which the 
Human Rights Council expresses concern on &#8220;continued reports of intimidation and 
reprisals against individuals and groups who seek to cooperate or have cooperated with the 
United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights&#8221; and &#8220;urges Governments to prevent and refrain from all acts of intimidation or reprisal against those 
who: (<i>a</i>) Seek to cooperate or have cooperated with the United Nations, its representatives 
and mechanisms in the field of human rights, or who have provided testimony or 
information to them; (<i>b</i>) Avail or have availed themselves of procedures established under 
the auspices of the United Nations for the protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, and all those who have provided legal or other assistance to them for this 
purpose; and (<i>c</i>) Submit or have submitted communications under procedures established 
by human rights instruments, and all those who have provided legal or other assistance to 
them for this purpose.&#8221;

located in Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast. N.M. is a citizen of Kazakhstan and a 
member of the local council in Zhalagash aul. B.B. received $5,000 from N.M. in exchange 
of the young men and handed over their passports to N.M. before he disappeared. The 
young men were forced to carry out a variety of work in N.M.&#8217;s house, including 
construction work. They were forced to work under harsh conditions and without 
appropriate food and compensation. Approximately two months after the young men left 
for Kazakhstan, B.B. appeared in Khiva. B.I.&#8217;s mother went to see B.B. to ask how her son 
was. B.B. assured the mother that all the young men were well and that they would soon be 
sending money they earned in Kazakhstan. However, B.I.&#8217;s mother never heard from her 
son, as all the young men were not given any opportunity to contact their families in 
Uzbekistan. The young men except B.I. eventually managed to escape the house and return 
to Khiva.

internal affairs agencies of Kazakhstan spearheaded the hunt for the missing person by 
undertaking criminal investigations and inquiries. Medical institutions also made some 
checks in an endeavour to establish his whereabouts.

sent on 20 October 2009, highlighting that the internal affairs organs of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan were conducting investigations in order to ascertain the facts regarding the 
economic exploitation of a citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan by N.M., a citizen of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan. With a view to making a thorough and objective appraisal of the 
evidence and issuing a procedural ruling, the Office of the Procurator and the Department 
of Internal Affairs of the province of Kyzylorda were preparing a request to the law 
enforcement agencies of the Republic of Uzbekistan that they question B.I. in order to fully 
clarify the circumstances of the case.

<p>8. By letter dated 20 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Special 
Rapporteur on trafficking and the Special Rapporteur on human rights of migrants sent an 
urgent appeal to the Government of Kazakhstan concerning an Uzbek boy who was 
trafficked to Kazakhstan to work in a forced labour situation and whose whereabouts were 
unknown. 
</p>
<p>9. According to the information received, B.I., aged 17, is a resident of the Khiva town 
of the Khorezm region, Uzbekistan. In May 2008, B.I. and four young Uzbek men were 
recruited by B.B., a citizen of Uzbekistan aged 56, to travel to Kazakhstan as labour 
migrants. B.B. promised them and their parents that he would take care of their 
employment in Kazakhstan. He also assured them that being the oldest in the group; he 
would look after the young men during their stay in Kazakhstan.

<p>15. The Special Rapporteurs asked information on the current policies and the 
preventive and awareness raising measures taken to tackle the issue of human trafficking in 
Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast, Kazakhstan. They also asked information on whether 
law enforcement agencies, especially the Police, Immigration, Border Guards and Labour 
Inspectors, had received appropriate training on identification of victims of trafficking and 
protection of their human rights. Finally, the Special Rapporterus requested the 
Government to provide statistical information on prosecution of cases of trafficking in

and highlighted that no information was available about any investigations, judicial 
proceedings or other inquiries in relation to this case. According to information supplied by 
the Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan in Uzbekistan, it did not receive any oral or 
written complaints from B.I.&#8217;s mother, or anyone else, in connection with this case at any 
point in 2008. 
</p>
<p>22. The Government also referred to some of the provisions of the national code of 
criminal procedure, notably article 163 and 162, paragraphs 1 and 2 and described the 
governmental structure in place to deal with human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>23. In its response, the Government also highlighted that it was gradually implementing 
plans to combat and prevent crimes related to human smuggling and have launched 
information campaigns to counter human trafficking. It further stated that in 2009, as a 
result of the latest steps, anti-trafficking units initiated criminal proceedings in 265 cases. 
The Government also provided extensive information on the activities and programmes 
being implemented in its territory. 
</p>
<p>24. Finally, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that according to the 
statistical data supplied by the Legal Statistics Committee and in particular by the Office of 
the Procurator General on enforceable sentences for crimes under article 128 of the 
Criminal Code (human trafficking), the number of convictions was as follows: in 2007, 
three persons; in 2008, five persons; and in the first nine months of 2009, five persons. The 
number of convictions for crimes under article 133 of the Criminal Code (trafficking in 
minors) was as follows: three people in 2007; one person in 2008; and six people in the first 
nine months of 2009.<b>

<p><b> 3. Observations  
</b></p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the detailed response provided by the 
Government of Kazakhstan and commends its efforts in successfully locating B.I. who was 
missing at the time. The Special Rapporteur regrets, however, that the reply did not include 
sufficient information concerning any actions against the citizens of Kazakhstan who were 
potentially implicated in the disappearance and trafficking of B.I. The Special Rapporteur 
continues to monitor the situation in the country, particularly the steps taken by the 
Government to combat and prevent forced labour.

b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; d&#8217;une invitation personnelle au Festival du film et Forum international sur les 
droits humains pr&#233;vu du 5 au 14 mars 2010 &#224; Gen&#232;ve. Que le pr&#233;sident de la commission 
nationale des droits de l&#8217;homme a, par lettre n&#176; 675 du 2 f&#233;vrier 2010, adress&#233; une demande 
de prorogation du passeport de service n&#176; M00197773 &#233;tabli au nom de Biram Ould Dah 
Ould Abeid. Et que cette demande a &#233;t&#233; transmise au minist&#232;re de l&#8217;int&#233;rieur et de la 
d&#233;centralisation par la directrice adjointe du Cabinet du premier ministre par lettre n&#176; 012 
du 3 f&#233;vrier 2010.  
</p>
<p>34. Dans sa r&#233;ponse le Gouvernement de Mauritanie pr&#233;cise que les passeports de 
service sont r&#233;glement&#233;s par le d&#233;cret n&#176; 62.160 en date du 12 juillet 1962 r&#233;glementant les 
titres de voyage qui dispose en son article 27: &#171;les passeports de service sont accord&#233;s par 
le minist&#232;re de l&#8217;int&#233;rieur &#224; la demande du minist&#232;re des affaires &#233;trang&#232;res. En Mauritanie, 
ils sont d&#233;livr&#233;s, renouvel&#233;s ou prot&#233;g&#233;s par le minist&#232;re de l&#8217;int&#233;rieur &#224; la demande du 
minist&#232;re des affaires &#233;trang&#232;res&#187;. L&#8217;article 30 de ce d&#233;cret dispose: &#171;En Mauritanie, la 
d&#233;livrance, le renouvellement ou la prorogation d&#8217;un passeport de service est subordonn&#233;e &#224; 
la remise&#8230;, d&#8217;une ampliation de l&#8217;ordre de mission de l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233;&#187;. Les ordres de mission 
pour les fonctionnaires de l&#8217;administration mauritanienne ne peuvent &#234;tre &#233;tablis que par le </p>

<p>secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral du gouvernement. Selon l&#8217;article 29: &#171;peuvent obtenir un passeport de 
service pour le d&#233;placement &#224; l&#8217;&#233;tranger, pendant la dur&#233;e de leur mission: les 
fonctionnaires civils et militaires voyageant pour des raisons de service et poss&#233;dant dans la 
hi&#233;rarchie administrative ou militaire un grade jug&#233; suffisant par les minist&#232;res int&#233;ress&#233;s; 
les personnes charg&#233;es par un d&#233;partement minist&#233;riel d&#8217;une mission importante rev&#234;tant un 
caract&#232;re national&#187;. 
</p>
<p>35. Le Gouvernement de Mauritanie constate qu&#8217;en l&#8217;esp&#232;ce, M Briam Ould Abeid ne 
dispose que d&#8217;une invitation personnelle et ne pouvait sur cette base b&#233;n&#233;ficier d&#8217;un ordre 
de mission pris en charge par l&#8217;Etat quant aux frais de s&#233;jour et de voyage. Il ne pouvait 
donc pas voyager avec un passeport de service alors qu&#8217;il n&#8217;&#233;tait pas d&#233;tenteur d&#8217;un ordre 
de mission &#233;tabli par les autorit&#233;s administratives comp&#233;tentes. Le voyage de l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233; 
&#233;tant &#224; titre priv&#233;, il ne pouvait alors b&#233;n&#233;ficier de cette commodit&#233; accord&#233;e aux 
fonctionnaires en mission. 
</p>
<p>36. La Gouvernement reconnait avoir enregistr&#233; d&#8217;importants progr&#232;s en mati&#232;re de 
protection et de promotion des droits de l&#8217;homme. Ceci en application des principes de 
libert&#233; et d&#8217;&#233;galit&#233; &#233;dict&#233;s par l&#8217;islam et garantis par la constitution du 20 juillet 1991. Ces 
principes ont permis la reconnaissance de dizaines de partis politiques et de centaines 
d&#8217;associations de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile qui exercent leurs activit&#233;s en toute qui&#233;tude et souvent 
avec l&#8217;appui des institutions de la R&#233;publique. Dans ce cadre il a aussi &#233;t&#233; institu&#233; par 
ordonnance 2006.015 du 12 juillet 2006, la commission nationale des droits de l&#8217;homme 
afin de mener les investigations et entreprendre les actions n&#233;cessaires pour lutter contre 
toutes les formes de discrimination, notamment les s&#233;quelles de l&#8217;esclavage et autres 
traitements d&#233;gradants, d&#233;nonc&#233;s par les d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme. 
</p>
<p>37. Le Gouvernement de Mauritanie ajoute par ailleurs que M. Briam Ould Abeid 
s&#8217;active au nom de l&#8217;initiative pour la r&#233;surgence du mouvement anti-esclavage (IRA 
Section Mauritanie), une association ill&#233;gale en Mauritanie puisqu&#8217;elle n&#8217;a aucune 
existence juridique au regard de la loi mauritanienne, pas m&#234;me le d&#233;p&#244;t du moindre 
dossier de reconnaissance aupr&#232;s des autorit&#233;s administratives. Malgr&#233; cela, M. Briam Ould 
Abeid a pu s&#8217;exprimer et voyager jusqu&#8217;aujourd&#8217;hui au nom de cette association sans &#234;tre 
inqui&#233;t&#233;. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Observations 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the detailed response provided by the 
Government of Mauritania and commends its efforts to ensure that M. Briam Ould Abeid 
was able to travel to Geneva. The Special Rapporteur supports the Special Rapporteur on 
Human Rights Defender&#8217;s position in her 2009 report to the GA (<b>A/64/226, paragraphs 65 
and 104</b> ) in which she states that &#8220;criminalization of the participation in unregistered 
entities is contrary to the right to freedom of association and violates a number of 
international human rights instruments&#8230;.and that States should not criminalize or impose 
criminal penalties for activities in defence of human rights and for participating in 
unregistered entities.&#8221;

<p>40. Selon les nouvelles informations re&#231;ues, Le 1er avril 2010, M. Ould Dah Ould 
Abeid aurait &#233;t&#233; d&#233;mis de ses fonctions de conseiller de la Commission nationale des droits 
de l'homme par son Pr&#233;sident, M. Ba Mariam Koita. Il est all&#233;gu&#233; que ce dernier lui aurait

conseils tu n'as pas march&#233; avec les autorit&#233;s, ce qui t'emp&#234;che maintenant de travailler 
avec nous&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>41. Il est &#233;galement all&#233;gu&#233; que le 15 avril 2010, M. Ould Dah Ould Abeid aurait &#233;t&#233; 
convoqu&#233; par le Directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral des libert&#233;s publiques du Minist&#232;re de l&#8217;Int&#233;rieur, M. 
Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Mohamed Salah. Au cours de cet entretien, M. Ould Dah Ould 
Abeid se serait vu enjoint de cesser &#171;toute d&#233;claration ou activit&#233; de lutte contre 
l&#8217;esclavage&#187; au risque de se voir arr&#234;t&#233; et poursuivi pour activit&#233;s ill&#233;gales. M. Salah lui 
aurait &#233;galement confirm&#233; sa r&#233;vocation du poste de conseiller de la Commission nationale

</p>
<p>42. Des craintes sont exprim&#233;es quant au fait que la r&#233;vocation et la convocation de M.

<p><b> 5. Observations  
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/15/20/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
</b></p>
<p>47. By letter dated 4 May 2010, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
slavery, it causes and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the human 
rights of migrants, Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences and the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government concerning Ms. B. G., a rejected asylum-seeker who is a national of Iran. Ms. 
B.G. had exhausted most of the legal remedies available and allegedly received a 
deportation order to leave the country on 20 April 2010. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>48. The deadline was postponed due to flight disturbances. Her deportation was 
rescheduled to take place on 5 May 2010 at 19.00 hrs by flight BD931. In the meantime an 
additional fresh claim for review of her case was submitted by her solicitor on 20 April 
2010. The judicial review of the fresh claim submitted was scheduled to take place on 21 
July 2010.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>49. According to information received: Ms. B.G. is a national of Iran born on 10 
September 1974. She allegedly fled Iran escaping from a forced marriage. She allegedly 
arrived in the UK on 2 October 2006. Upon her arrival, she claimed asylum on grounds of 
forced marriage in Iran. She had reportedly been forced into the marriage by her father in 
2004 and remained in the forced marriage for approximately 2 years until she fled Iran. In 
addition, she allegedly faced physical and psychological maltreatment by her father, brother 
and uncle because she was having an extramarital affair with Mr. H. S. After filing her 
asylum claim, Ms. G. was reportedly taken to Holloway prison for 45 days after which she 
was released for the consideration of her asylum claim. The reason for her detention was 
never clarified. 
</p>
<p>50. In November 2006, Ms. G. reportedly met Mr. M. Z., a British national with whom 
she began an informal domestic partnership in October 2008. As a result of her relationship 
with Mr.Z., in 2007, Ms. G. became involved in political activities and begun working as a 
political activist with Anglo-Iranian women in the United Kingdom. She also became a 
supporter of the British Peoples Mojehadin Organization of Iran (PMOI) and the National 
Council for the Resistance of Iran (NCRI). Ms. G. campaigned on behalf of the PMOI in 
the United Kingdom to draw attention to the situation of political prisoners and the 
execution of victims in Iran during a recent unrest. 
</p>
<p>51. On 16 August 2007, Ms. B.G.'s asylum claim was rejected by the Home Office and 
by the Court on 16 October 2007. As a consequence, on 4 December 2007, she attempted to 
commit suicide by taking an overdose, and was hospitalized. She was allegedly 
unconscious for three days and was discharged from the hospital on 2 January 2008. Her 
solicitor requested a revision of the case. 
</p>
<p>52. On 29 April 2009, she was allegedly detained and removal directions were set for 4 
May on the grounds of her immigration status. On 3 May, Ms. B. G.'s solicitor submitted an 
application for a leave to remain and she was released on 17 June 2009 as her case was 
accepted for judicial review. She was allegedly detained again on 11 November 2009 and 
removal directions were set for 16 November. On the same date she reportedly began a 
hunger strike. On 16 November 2009 she was taken to Heathrow airport for deportation, 
but the deportation was cancelled by judicial order allegedly on the grounds of the need for 
further time to review the case. On 2 December 2009 she was allegedly released on bail, 
conditional upon her presentation twice a week before the United Kingdom Border Agency 
(UKBA). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/20/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>53. In January 2010, the UKBA authorities allegedly fixed 16 April 2010 as the date for 
the review of the conditions of her release. On 27 January 2010, she allegedly commenced 
another hunger strike after she was informed by Home Office solicitors that her claim had 
been rejected. 
</p>
<p>54. Given the health troubles associated with the hunger strikes she undertook, she was 
allegedly unable to comply with the condition of her release. Mr. M. Z. periodically 
provided medical certificates to the UKBA to justify that it was impossible for Ms. G. to 
comply with the condition of her release. The most recent medical certificate is dated 23 
March 2010 and justifies one month of sick leave. Her physical and mental health was 
weakened considerably to the point that she was unable to walk. Following friends&#8217; and 
medical practitioners&#8217; advice, she allegedly ended her hunger strike on 20 March 2010.  
</p>
<p>55. On 25 March 2010 Ms. G.'s solicitor submitted a fresh claim, as the UK asylum 
procedure permits rejected asylum applicants to lodge a fresh claim and give the 
Government the prerogative of deciding whether or not the fresh submission is to be 
considered.  
</p>
<p>56. On 12 April 2010, Mr. Z. brought Ms. G. to UKBA authorities in a wheelchair, in 
order to bring her health condition to their attention, and present a request for the renewal 
of her release on bail, which was to be reviewed on 16 April 2010. UKBA authorities 
requested Mr. Z. and Ms. G. to return in the afternoon of 16 April 2010. 
</p>
<p>57. On 16 April 2010 around 6:30 a.m., Home Office authorities allegedly arrived at 
Ms. G.'s place of residence with an ambulance, arrested her and detained her at Yarl's 
Wood. Mr. Z. reported that her health remained a concern while she was in detention. 
</p>
<p>58. Additional documentation was submitted to the Home Office by Ms. B.G.'s solicitor 
on 20 April 2010, who according to Mr. Z. was to submit an application for urgent 
injunction to request to suspend Ms. G.'s removal from the UK scheduled on 5 May 2010 
pending the consideration of the judicial review of the fresh claim, which was scheduled to 
take place on 21 July 2010. 
</p>
<p>59. Her forcible removal from the UK was initially planned for 20 April 2010, but was 
postponed due to flight cancellations. Her deportation was rescheduled to take place on 5 
May 2010 at 19.00 hrs by flight BD931. 
</p>
<p>60. Information received indicated that if returned to Iran, Ms. B. G. might be subjected 
to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment as a result of having abandoned a forced marriage 
and because of the possible cultural implications. Information received also suggested that 
if returned to Iran, Ms. G. might encounter harassment, arrest or detention because of her 
political involvement with the PMOI while in the UK. Furthermore, her health might be at 
risk as her physical and psychological condition was considerably deteriorated, at least 
partly due to the possibility of being deported to Iran. Additionally, she considered that her 
rights to family and private life with her partner Mr. Z., who is a British national, would 
also be infringed. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteurs asked the Government to verify the accuracy of the facts 
alleged in the summary. They then inquired whether a complaint was lodged by or on 
behalf Ms. G. to challenge the deportation order.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteurs also requested information concerning the compliance of 
the deportation of Ms. G. with relevant provisions of international law and on the measures 
taken in this particular case so as to ensure that Ms. G. will be free from cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment, if deported to Iran. </p>

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not provided a reply to the 
communication to date. The Special Rapporteur therefore calls upon the Government to 
provide information as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Uzbekistan 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication of 20 October 2009 
</b></p>
<p>64. By letter dated 20 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Special 
Rapporteur on trafficking and the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights of migrants sent a 
letter of allegation to the Government of Uzbekistan concerning the Uzbek boy who has 
been trafficked to Kazakhstan to work in a forced labour situation and whose whereabouts 
were unknown. 
</p>
<p>65. According to the information received, B.I., aged 17, is a resident of the Khiva town 
of the Khorezm region, Uzbekistan.  In May 2008, B.I. and four young Uzbek men were 
recruited by B.B.; a citizen of Uzbekistan aged 56, to travel to Kazakhstan as labour 
migrants.  B.B. promised them and their parents that he would take care of their 
employment in Kazakhstan.  He also assured them that being the oldest in the group; he 
would look after the young men during their stay in Kazakhstan. 
</p>
<p>66. Upon their arrival in Kazakhstan, the young men were taken to a house of N.M., 
located in Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast. N.M. is a citizen of Kazakhstan and a 
member of the local council in Zhalagash aul.  B.B. received $5,000 from N.M. in 
exchange of the young men and handed over their passports to N.M. before he disappeared. 
The young men were forced to carry out a variety of work in N.M.&#8217;s house, including 
construction work. They were forced to work under harsh conditions and without 
appropriate food and compensation. Approximately two months after the young men left 
for Kazakhstan, B.B. appeared in Khiva. B.I.&#8217;s mother went to see B.B. to ask how her son 
was. B.B. assured the mother that all the young men were well and that they would soon be 
sending money they earned in Kazakhstan. However, B.I.&#8217;s mother never heard from her 
son, as all the young men were not given any opportunity to contact their families in 
Uzbekistan. The young men except B.I. eventually managed to escape the house and return 
to Khiva. 
</p>
<p>67. In December 2008, B.I.&#8217;s mother lodged an appeal to the Department of Internal 
Affairs in the Khiva district and to the Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan in 
Uzbekistan to search for her son. However, she did not receive any responses from the 
authorities. Concerned for her son&#8217;s safety and desperate to find him, on 12 June 2009, she 
travelled to N.M.&#8217;s house in Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast by her own means. When 
she arrived at N.M.&#8217;s house, he shouted at her in the Kazakh language, throwing the 
passports of the young Uzbek men who were forced to work in his house. He told her that 
B.I. was taken by a Police Major from Shimkent city in Yuzhno-Kazakhstanskaya oblast.

</p>
<p>safety and protection, and the progress of the prosecution undertaken against B.B. Further, 
they requested the Government to provide the details, and where available the results, of 
any other investigation, judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in 
relation to this case. 
</p>
<p>70. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to provide 
information on the measures taken to ensure rehabilitation and reintegration of the four 
young Uzbek men who managed to escape from the house of N.M.. They also requested the 
Government to indicate whether the victims or the families of the victims had access to 
adequate procedures of compensation for damages from those legally responsible. 
</p>
<p>71. Finally, the Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to provide information 
on the current policies and the preventive and awareness raising measures taken to tackle 
the issue of human trafficking in Uzbekistan and on what action were being taken by the 
Government to address the root causes of trafficking such as poverty and high youth 
unemployment. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Response of the Government of 25 November 2009  
</b></p>
<p>72. By letter dated 25 November 2009, the Government of Uzbekistan responded to the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communication of 20 October 2009.  The Government responded that 
the investigative section of the Department of Internal Affairs of Khiva district instituted 
criminal proceedings against B.B. The investigation revealed that B.B. deceived B.I. and 
other citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan by promising monthly wages of US$ 500 and 
taking them to the Kyzyl-Ordinsk province of the Republic of Kazakhstan where he forced 
them to work in various places without pay. On 8 November 2009, B.B. was arrested and 
placed in remand centre No. 6 in Urgench. Criminal proceedings were instituted against 
B.B. on 8 November 2009 and investigations are still continuing. It has been ascertained 
that B.I. returned to Uzbekistan on 8 November 2009 and he is now living with his parents 
in the district of Khiva.

<p>75. The Ministry of Internal Affairs established a special unit to counter human 
trafficking on 26 February 2004. The Ministry of Internal Affairs formulated and issued 
guidelines on the investigation of offences linked to human trafficking. In accordance with
