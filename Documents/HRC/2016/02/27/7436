<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council has, on several occasions, recognized the important role 
</p>
<p>played by regional, subregional and interregional human rights arrangements. In its 
</p>
<p>resolutions 6/20, 12/15, 18/14 and 24/19, it requested the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights to hold international workshops to put forward concrete 
</p>
<p>proposals on ways and means to strengthen cooperation between United Nations and 
</p>
<p>regional arrangements in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>2. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)  
</p>
<p>thus organized such workshops in November 2008 (A/HRC/11/3), May 2010 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/15/56), and December 2012 (A/HRC/23/18). Participants consistently stressed the 
</p>
<p>need to strengthen cooperation between United Nations and regional human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms through the establishment of specific mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>3. At the workshop held in December 2012, participants further discussed cooperation 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, including focal points; systemized information sharing; cross-referencing of 
</p>
<p>jurisprudence and recommendations of human rights mechanisms; replication of best 
</p>
<p>practices; and enhanced cooperation with other relevant stakeholders, including national 
</p>
<p>actors such as national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations 
</p>
<p>(NGOs). OHCHR submitted a report (A/HRC/23/18) on that workshop, including its 
</p>
<p>conclusions and recommendations, to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-third session. 
</p>
<p>4. In its resolution 24/19, the Human Rights Council requested the High Commissioner  
</p>
<p>to hold a workshop on regional arrangements for the promotion and protection of human 
</p>
<p>rights to take stock of developments since the 2012 workshop. The Council requested that 
</p>
<p>the workshop include three thematic discussions on: the mainstreaming of economic, social 
</p>
<p>and cultural rights; the economic, social and cultural rights of persons with disabilities; and 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights of women. The Council also requested the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner to present to it, at its twenty-eighth session, a report containing a summary 
</p>
<p>of the discussions held at the workshop and on the progress towards the implementation of 
</p>
<p>resolution 24/19. 
</p>
<p>5. OHCHR therefore organized the workshop on 8 and 9 October 2014 in Geneva (see 
</p>
<p>agenda in annex I). Based on the concrete and practical experience of the regional 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, the workshop was aimed at sharing information on best practices and lessons 
</p>
<p>learned, and new possible forms of cooperation. Participants included representatives of the 
</p>
<p>secretariats of United Nations human rights treaty bodies and special procedures, the 
</p>
<p>African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the Inter-American Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights (IACHR), the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the Council of 
</p>
<p>Europe, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights, the ASEAN Commission on the Promotion and Protection 
</p>
<p>of the Rights of Women and Children and the Independent Permanent Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The present report 
</p>
<p>summarizes the discussions held during the workshop and includes its conclusions and 
</p>
<p>recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> II. Progress in cooperation between United Nations and regional 
human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>6. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 24/19, the first session of the 
</p>
<p>workshop was devoted to taking stock of developments since the 2012 workshop, namely,  </p>


<p>measures aimed at systematizing information sharing; development of a shared agenda of 
</p>
<p>activities; provision of information for the Universal Periodic Review; cross-referencing 
</p>
<p>jurisprudence and recommendations; and development of a matrix containing the 
</p>
<p>recommendations made by United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>7. Participants shared information on progress made in implementing the 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the 2012 workshop, highlighting challenges and presenting best 
</p>
<p>practices, and made suggestions to enhance cooperation.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>8. There was a substantial increase in the exchange of information and cooperation 
</p>
<p>between the special procedures of the United Nations and IACHR since the 2012 
</p>
<p>workshop, including the issuance of nine joint statements, mainly on freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression; testimony of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment or punishment before IACHR in a hearing on solitary confinement in 
</p>
<p>the Americas; the organization of a side event on the Standard Minimum Rules for the 
</p>
<p>Treatment of Prisoners1 by the Special Rapporteur on torture, with the participation of 
</p>
<p>IACHR, in October 2013; meeting between IACHR Special Rapporteur on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Women and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
</p>
<p>consequences, in October 2013, and increased exchange of information.  
</p>
<p>9. The Inter-American Commission and the Inter-American Court on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>found the United Nations human rights standards very important and useful when dealing 
</p>
<p>with cases where there was no established case law within the Inter-American system. 
</p>
<p>Support from United Nations special procedures and the exchange of information had been 
</p>
<p>extremely useful, particularly for the preparation of country visits. The exchange of 
</p>
<p>information with the Sub-Committee on Prevention of Torture prior to a country visit to 
</p>
<p>Paraguay in 2014 was mentioned as an example. The Inter-American Commission stated 
</p>
<p>that it was setting up a specialized section to act as focal point for enhancing cooperation 
</p>
<p>with other human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>10. The joint working group of representatives of United Nations and African 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights special procedures reviewed the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Addis Ababa road map on cooperation,2 in 2013 and in 2014, and 
</p>
<p>further reaffirmed their commitment to continued cooperation. Several joint activities were 
</p>
<p>conducted within the framework of the road map, such as the issuance of five joint 
</p>
<p>statements; joint conferences and seminars on human rights defenders, peaceful protests 
</p>
<p>and business and human rights; expert meetings on the use of force by law enforcement 
</p>
<p>agencies; and regular exchange of information.  
</p>
<p>11. The African Commission identified the primary challenge in the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the Addis Ababa road map as being the insufficient budget for cooperation activities. The 
</p>
<p>need to raise awareness among special procedures on proper implementation of the Addis 
</p>
<p>Ababa road map, annual consultations and a sufficient budget were recognized. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Adopted by the First United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of 
</p>
<p>Offenders, held in Geneva in 1955, and approved by the Economic and Social Council in its 
</p>
<p>resolutions 663 C (XXIV) of 31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 1977. 
</p>
<p> 2 Adopted in January 2012, in Addis Ababa, by the dialogue between the special procedures of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and the African Commission on Human Peoples&#8217; Rights, with a view to enhancing 
</p>
<p>mutual collaboration. </p>


<p>12. An example of inter-regional cooperation among human rights mechanisms was the 
</p>
<p>workshop on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, held in Banjul, the Gambia, in April 2013, in 
</p>
<p>which IACHR, the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights, the African 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the Special Rapporteur on the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples participated. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
</p>
<p>participated in a workshop on human rights-based approaches to combat trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons, organized by the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights in the 
</p>
<p>Philippines, in November 2013, in which she dwelled, in particular, on the human rights 
</p>
<p>aspects of trafficking, and on her mandate, in general. An exchange of views also took 
</p>
<p>place between the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons and the Council of Europe 
</p>
<p>Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, in 2013. Information 
</p>
<p>was exchanged with the United Nations special procedures prior to the visit of the Council 
</p>
<p>of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights to Spain, in 2013, particularly regarding the 
</p>
<p>impact of austerity measures on social protection and on the right to health of children and 
</p>
<p>migrants. 
</p>
<p>14. The European Committee on Social Rights frequently referred to the work of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations special procedures, in particular to the conclusions of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
</p>
<p>standard of living. 
</p>
<p>15. The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the 
</p>
<p>Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) maintained close contact with 
</p>
<p>United Nations special procedures, including the Special Rapporteurs on the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association and on the situation of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders. 
</p>
<p>16. The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance was invited to speak at a 
</p>
<p>meeting of the United Nations Intergovernmental Working Group on the effective 
</p>
<p>implementation of the  Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, in October 2013. 
</p>
<p>17. Representatives of five regional mechanisms participated in a meeting with the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Working Group on Discrimination against Women in Law and in Practice, 
</p>
<p>in Geneva, on 1 October 2013. They discussed progress and challenges in relation to 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights and explored avenues of cooperation. 
</p>
<p>18. The United Nations special procedures found the cooperation with regional 
</p>
<p>mechanisms very useful, including in terms of substantive inputs for their thematic reports; 
</p>
<p>it helped them to better understand the regional aspects of certain issues, resulting in an 
</p>
<p>enhanced acceptance of their findings and recommendations. 
</p>
<p>19. The signing of a joint declaration between OSCE-ODIHR and OHCHR, in 2014, 
</p>
<p>was mentioned as a best practice for increased exchange of information and expertise, joint 
</p>
<p>advocacy and cross-referencing. Furthermore, it was noted that the annual OSCE Human 
</p>
<p>Dimension Implementation Meeting was a good opportunity for Member States, 
</p>
<p>international organizations and civil society to take stock of the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>human dimension commitments and make recommendations for further development.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>20. Cooperation between United Nations human rights treaty bodies and regional human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms has been increasing in recent years. </p>


<p>21. The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance contributed, with its 
</p>
<p>expertise, to the work of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on 
</p>
<p>hate speech and on the role of anti-discrimination bodies.  
</p>
<p>22. Experts of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, IACHR Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child, the Special Representative on violence against children, representatives 
</p>
<p>of OHCHR, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations 
</p>
<p>International Children and Education Fund (UNICEF) participated in a meeting in Panama, 
</p>
<p>from 6 to 19 May 2013, to strategize about joint actions. They also held a public event to 
</p>
<p>promote the ratification of regional and international treaties relating to the rights of the 
</p>
<p>child. 
</p>
<p>23. The Council of Europe has promoted the signature and ratification of the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. 
</p>
<p>Reference to the United Nations standards on child rights and the general comments of the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Rights of the Child were included in the Council of Europe Strategy on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of the Child (2012-2015). In turn, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in 
</p>
<p>its concluding observations, referred to Council of Europe instruments and underlined the 
</p>
<p>added value of the child rights standards set by the Council of Europe.  
</p>
<p>24. The African Committee on the Rights and Welfare of the Child participated in the 
</p>
<p>meeting of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in May 2013.  
</p>
<p>25. Treaty bodies reported that they took the recommendations of regional human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms into consideration in their reviews. The secretariats of the treaty bodies liaise 
</p>
<p>with regional human rights mechanisms regarding individual complaints in order to ensure 
</p>
<p>that the same complaints are not dealt with at the same time by other mechanisms and to 
</p>
<p>safeguard jurisprudential coherence. 
</p>
<p>26. It was suggested that in view of the substantial body of jurisprudence developed by 
</p>
<p>the judicial organs of regional human rights mechanisms, especially the African Court on 
</p>
<p>Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, cooperation between treaty bodies and regional mechanisms 
</p>
<p>should be further enhanced for mutual benefit.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Universal periodic review  
</b></p>
<p>27. In 2008, when the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) was established, the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner addressed letters to regional organizations inviting them to submit 
</p>
<p>information to the process for the stakeholders report. OHCHR sent communications to 
</p>
<p>regional organizations before every UPR session, inviting them to submit information for 
</p>
<p>inclusion in the stakeholders&#8217; report prepared by OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>28. The Council of Europe submitted information on its member States that were being 
</p>
<p>reviewed through the desk-to-desk cooperation between OHCHR and the Council of 
</p>
<p>Europe. IACHR submitted input for the UPR of Chile, Costa Rica, Dominica, the 
</p>
<p>Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Uruguay, in 2013, and for Bolivia (Plurinational State 
</p>
<p>of), El Salvador, the United States of America, Jamaica, Panama and Honduras, in 2014.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Thematic discussions 
</b></p>
<p>29. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 24/19, the second session of 
</p>
<p>the workshop was devoted to discussions about economic, social and cultural rights. The 
</p>
<p>first panel focused on strengthening cooperation between international and regional human 
</p>
<p>rights systems to mainstream economic, social and cultural rights, while the second panel </p>


<p>discussed the role of United Nations, regional and subregional judicial and quasi-judicial 
</p>
<p>organs in promoting and protecting economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>30. The third session of the workshop was devoted to the economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights of persons with disabilities and women. The first panel of that session focused on 
</p>
<p>cooperation in promoting and protecting the economic, social and cultural rights of persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities, while the second panel discussed cooperation in promoting and protecting 
</p>
<p>the economic, social and cultural rights of women.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Strengthening cooperation between international and regional human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights systems to mainstream economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Best practices  
</b></p>
<p>31. Panellists from the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
</p>
<p>European Committee on Social Rights, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>Rights, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Indonesian NGO Coalition 
</p>
<p>for International Human Rights Advocacy and the Centre for Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights acknowledged the increasing cooperation among human rights mechanisms 
</p>
<p>at the international, regional and national level with regard to sharing and using 
</p>
<p>jurisprudence.  
</p>
<p>32. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted that its membership 
</p>
<p>enjoyed a balanced representation of all regions and drew on the practice of regional human 
</p>
<p>rights protection systems and their jurisprudence when conducting dialogues with State 
</p>
<p>parties. The Committee also indirectly supported regional mechanisms by encouraging 
</p>
<p>State parties to implement the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights in cooperation with regional mechanisms, and by recommending the ratification of 
</p>
<p>regional instruments, dissemination of publications as well as compliance with rulings of 
</p>
<p>regional human rights courts. Regional mechanisms reported that they referred to the work 
</p>
<p>of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The African Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights principles and guidelines on economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights (2011), which refer to the Committee&#8217;s concluding observations and general 
</p>
<p>comments, were cited as an example.  
</p>
<p>33. The European Committee on Social Rights stated that it recognized the 
</p>
<p>complementarity between international and regional human rights instruments and referred 
</p>
<p>to the international instruments when interpreting the European Social Charter. For 
</p>
<p>example, in a case concerning restrictions on the entitlement of illegal immigrant minors to 
</p>
<p>medical treatment and shelter, the European Committee referred to the provisions of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child. It had also referred to general comments No. 4 
</p>
<p>(1992) on the right to adequate housing and No. 7 (1997) on forced evictions of the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in deciding important cases, such as 
</p>
<p>the decisions of 5 December 2007 on complaints No. 33/2006, <i>International Movement 
</i></p>
<p><i>ATD Fourth World </i>v.<i> France</i> and No. 39/2006, <i>European Federation of National 
</i></p>
<p><i>Organisations Working with the Homeless (FEANTSA) </i>v.<i> France</i>. The European 
</p>
<p>Committee had also taken into account important contributions from other regional 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, such as the concepts of &#8220;aggravated violation&#8221; and &#8220;aggravated 
</p>
<p>responsibility&#8221; used by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in cases involving 
</p>
<p>Roma rights.  
</p>
<p>34. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights reported that, in 2013, it had 
</p>
<p>established a special unit to deal with economic, social and cultural rights and that it would 
</p>
<p>have a Special Rapporteur on economic, social and cultural rights by December 2015.  </p>


<p>35. Participants identified national human rights institutions and civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations as important stakeholders in mainstreaming economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights. Reference was made to the level of engagement of civil society organizations and, in 
</p>
<p>particular, the Indonesian NGO Coalition for International Human Rights Advocacy, which  
</p>
<p>comprises 60 NGOs actively engaged with the Committee on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights. The coalition submitted a parallel report on Indonesia to the Committee; it 
</p>
<p>also responded to the Committee&#8217;s list of issues and attended the Committee&#8217;s examination 
</p>
<p>of Indonesia in 2012. It also played an important role in the follow-up to the 
</p>
<p>recommendations at the national level by disseminating the recommendations in the local 
</p>
<p>languages, and holding seminars and workshops. The coalition also closely worked with the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Special Rapporteurs on the human rights of migrants and on the right to 
</p>
<p>adequate housing during their visits to Indonesia in 2008 and 2013 respectively.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Challenges and lessons learned 
</b></p>
<p>36. Participants shared the view that 21 years after the Vienna Declaration and 
</p>
<p>Programme of Action, which highlighted the importance of cooperation between the United 
</p>
<p>Nations and regional human rights mechanisms, such cooperation had not yet reached the 
</p>
<p>desired level.  
</p>
<p>37. One of the main challenges to cooperation, highlighted across the regions, was 
</p>
<p>financial constraints. In that regard, participants noted the need to think more of an 
</p>
<p>&#8220;alliance of minds&#8221;, rather than an &#8220;alliance of structures&#8221;, as a cost-saving measure by 
</p>
<p>enhancing methods of mutually benefiting from expertise, such as regular exchange of 
</p>
<p>information on major thematic concerns. Reference was made to the bi-monthly OHCHR 
</p>
<p>ESCR Bulletin, which provides an update on economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>38. Referring to the &#8220;emergency doctrine&#8221; developed by the Committee on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights to address the consequences of the economic and financial crisis 
</p>
<p>in 2012, the participants felt that more concerted action by international and regional 
</p>
<p>mechanisms was needed to disseminate and promote the doctrine among governments, 
</p>
<p>international organizations and civil society.  
</p>
<p>39. Participants noted the general lack of implementation of recommendations of 
</p>
<p>international and regional human rights mechanisms at the national level. Reference was 
</p>
<p>made to the need for a higher commitment by States parties as well as other national 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including national human rights institutions. Concerns were expressed by 
</p>
<p>national human rights institutions and NGOs about the lack of openness on the part of 
</p>
<p>regional mechanisms, in general, and limited available access to engage with regional 
</p>
<p>mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Forms of cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>40. Participants proposed several options for strengthening cooperation among 
</p>
<p>international and regional mechanisms, national human rights institutions and civil society:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Strengthening general interaction and sharing of information on best practices and 
</p>
<p>expertise among mechanisms at the international, regional and national level; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Promoting advocacy activities for the ratification of human rights conventions at the 
</p>
<p>international and regional level;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Developing data and evidence on particular issues and highlighting areas that need 
</p>
<p>attention;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Facilitating further engagement of national human rights institutions and civil 
</p>
<p>society groups with international and regional mechanisms, and reinforcing </p>


<p>partnerships in order to overcome implementation gaps in the area of economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Engaging with judges and lawmakers who are in a position to implement decisions 
</p>
<p>and recommendations, in addition to engaging with executive authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Role of United Nations, regional and subregional judicial and  
</b></p>
<p><b>quasi-judicial organs in promoting and protecting economic, social 
</b></p>
<p><b>and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Best practices 
</b></p>
<p>41. Panellists from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the African Court of 
</p>
<p>Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the International NGO Coalition for an Optional Protocol 
</p>
<p>to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR) 
</p>
<p>acknowledged the importance of regional and subregional judicial and quasi-judicial organs 
</p>
<p>in promoting and protecting economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>42. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights indicated that it had overcome the 
</p>
<p>formal limitation in the 1988 Protocol of the American Convention on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>which allowed individual complaints only in respect of the right to education and the right 
</p>
<p>to join unions. The Court has decided cases regarding other economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights, such as the rights of indigenous people to land, which also affects the rights to life, 
</p>
<p>health, housing, food, water and cultural identity. In 2012 and 2013, the Court&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>jurisprudence in cases related to gender discrimination, sexual discrimination and 
</p>
<p>discrimination against persons with disabilities contributed significantly to influencing 
</p>
<p>public policies. The case of <i>Furlan and family </i>v.<i> Argentina</i> was cited as an example, in 
</p>
<p>which the Court found that the omissions and deficiencies in the medical care provided to a 
</p>
<p>14-year-old boy who had a disability hindered his access to social security benefits. The 
</p>
<p>Court held that the State had violated the provisions of the American Convention on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights to the detriment of the victim.  
</p>
<p>43. Under the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the 
</p>
<p>Establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the applicable law in 
</p>
<p>deciding cases is not only the Charter, but also other international human rights instruments 
</p>
<p>to which member States are party. Therefore, in the case of economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights, the Court would refer to the relevant international treaties. It was flagged that the 
</p>
<p>Court had both contentious and advisory jurisdiction, and its decisions were binding on the 
</p>
<p>parties and not subject to appeal. Out of the 29 contentious matters that the Court has dealt 
</p>
<p>with since it became operational in 2006, four pertained to economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights, such as right to work and health care.  
</p>
<p>44. The International NGO Coalition for an OP-ICESCR, which comprises more than 
</p>
<p>250 NGOs worldwide, highlighted its advocacy for the ratification of the 2008 Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which 
</p>
<p>came into force in 2013.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Challenges  
</b></p>
<p>45. The low level of ratification of the Protocol to the African Charter establishing the 
</p>
<p>African Court of Human Rights, coupled with an even lower number of declarations 
</p>
<p>recognizing its competence to consider cases from NGOs and individuals, was cited as a 
</p>
<p>major challenge. Lack of visibility of the Court in the African continent and lack of 
</p>
<p>political will to enforce the decisions of the Court were other challenges. There was a need 
</p>
<p>to promote the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on </p>


<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Africa, so that persons, groups and communities 
</p>
<p>could submit individual complaints of violation of their economic, social and cultural rights 
</p>
<p>to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>46. Another challenge noted by participants was the low level of cooperation by public 
</p>
<p>institutions with human rights mechanisms, especially with regard to submission of 
</p>
<p>statistical data and human rights indicators necessary for the monitoring of public policies. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Forms of cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>47. Since the African Court of Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights also applied relevant United 
</p>
<p>Nations human rights instruments as regards economic, social and cultural rights, it was 
</p>
<p>suggested that cooperation with regard to interpretation and application of human rights 
</p>
<p>norms could be enhanced through dialogue and exchange between the Court and the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Economic, social and cultural rights of women 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Best practices 
</b></p>
<p>48. Panellists from the Working Group on Discrimination against Women in Law and in 
</p>
<p>Practice, the ASEAN Commission on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Women and Children, OSCE-ODIHR, the Democratic Association of Women of Morocco, 
</p>
<p>the Council of Europe Equality Division as well as the African Commission for Human and 
</p>
<p>Peoples&#8217; Rights Special Rapporteur for Women agreed on the importance of gender 
</p>
<p>mainstreaming in respect of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>49. Interacting with civil society organizations in order to better understand the situation 
</p>
<p>of women in the national context was identified as one of the best practices. The ASEAN 
</p>
<p>Commission on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and Children stated 
</p>
<p>that direct access to civil society and grass root organizations was one of its main strengths, 
</p>
<p>which helped it to advocate for gender mainstreaming in the ASEAN community.  
</p>
<p>50. Access to justice was considered key for protecting and promoting the economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights of women and combating violence against women. The Council of 
</p>
<p>Europe highlighted that access to justice was one of the focus areas of its strategies to 
</p>
<p>combat gender inequality.  
</p>
<p>51. The adoption of guidelines on reporting obligations of States under international 
</p>
<p>instruments was described as a good practice in Africa; the reporting guidelines under the 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in 
</p>
<p>Africa (the Maputo Protocol) served as a barometer to assess the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Protocol. The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights has also adopted general 
</p>
<p>comments on sexual and reproductive rights and HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Challenges and lessons learned 
</b></p>
<p>52. Participants emphasized that economic recession and austerity measures 
</p>
<p>disproportionally affected women, and critically undermined their enjoyment of economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights. Furthermore, women from 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups were more acutely impacted by economic crises. 
</p>
<p>53. It was noted that, although the proposed Sustainable Development Goals included a 
</p>
<p>stand-alone gender goal and some gender mainstreaming, they called for equity and not 
</p>
<p>equality; they do not call for accountability in relation to respect, protection and fulfilment 
</p>
<p>of international human rights obligations, nor do they refer specifically to women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>reproductive rights under access to health care. Likewise, some discussions related to the </p>


<p>economic, social and cultural rights of women, such as protection of the family by the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council, failed to articulate women&#8217;s right to equality and its incorporation 
</p>
<p>in protection of the family. 
</p>
<p>54. The need for a balance between freedom of expression and the promotion of gender 
</p>
<p>equality in the media was also discussed. Messages conveyed by the media were decisive in 
</p>
<p>shaping perceptions of roles and relations and in combating gender stereotypes and 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women. Cooperation in that field was of utmost importance. 
</p>
<p>55. Another challenge noted by participants was the issue of some contradictory human 
</p>
<p>rights standards among regional mechanisms, combined with limited and disproportionate 
</p>
<p>accessibility by women to those protection systems in order to address human rights 
</p>
<p>violations against them.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Forms of cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>56. Participants put forward proposals for cooperation between regional mechanisms 
</p>
<p>and different stakeholders, with the aim of mainstreaming economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights of women: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Forging partnerships among the regional mechanisms and developing joint 
</p>
<p>interventions to build expertise and maximize their impact, in the light of scarce 
</p>
<p>resources; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Strengthening cooperation with international mechanisms through submission of 
</p>
<p>general comments, observations and reports by regional mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Consolidating information on the economic, social and cultural rights of women; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Developing guidelines/templates for reporting obligations of member States; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Exchanging information on good practices between regional and United Nations 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, specifically on women&#8217;s economic, social and cultural rights; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Working together with media and media regulatory bodies to combat stereotyping 
</p>
<p>and promote gender equality.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Economic, social and cultural rights of persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Best practices 
</b></p>
<p>57. Panellists from the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the 
</p>
<p>African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the Qatar National Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, the International Disability 
</p>
<p>Alliance and the Human Rights and Disability Adviser to OHCHR acknowledged the 
</p>
<p>importance of involving civil society in the implementation of the Convention on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>58. Specific actions of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities were 
</p>
<p>referred to, namely, the development of a comprehensive approach to the rights of persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities, in order to avoid a &#8220;clustered&#8221; vision of disability in the field of human 
</p>
<p>rights. The Committee also held a meeting with national monitoring mechanisms in order to 
</p>
<p>discuss cooperation opportunities and strategies for the monitoring of the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the Convention. It was flagged that in 2015, the Committee will have a focal point for 
</p>
<p>interaction with national monitoring mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>59. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities obligates State parties to 
</p>
<p>take measures with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights (art. 4, para. 2) . However, according to specific jurisprudence, the </p>


<p>Committee has concluded that reasonable accommodation in the area of education was of 
</p>
<p>immediate application and not subject to progressive realization. It was also noted that the 
</p>
<p>Convention clearly states that denial of reasonable accommodation to persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities amounts to discrimination (art. 2). 
</p>
<p>60. Participants welcomed the appointment of the Human Rights Council Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>61. Reference was made to the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights 
</p>
<p>Working Group on the Rights of Older Persons and Persons with Disabilities that was 
</p>
<p>currently drafting a Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Africa. The Protocol is intended to address Africa-
</p>
<p>specific issues, such as the protection of parents, guardians and caregivers from 
</p>
<p>discrimination on the basis of their association with persons with disabilities or the 
</p>
<p>protection of persons with disabilities from harmful practices. 
</p>
<p>62. Participants recognized the important role played by national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions in encouraging States to ratify and adhere to international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments relating to the rights of persons with disabilities,.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Challenges and lessons learned 
</b></p>
<p>63. Participants agreed on the importance of civil society participation, particularly 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities and their representative organizations, in the design, 
</p>
<p>implementation and monitoring of legal instruments, public policies and other measures 
</p>
<p>relating to the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>64. The impact of austerity measures and the growing need to guarantee that the rights 
</p>
<p>of persons with disabilities would be met, even in times of economic crisis and austerity, 
</p>
<p>were discussed.  
</p>
<p>65. It was noted that regional mechanisms had a major role to play in overcoming 
</p>
<p>inconsistencies in terms of language and cultural approaches to the human rights relating to 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities which were leading to different conceptions in the implementation 
</p>
<p>of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in different regions. 
</p>
<p>66. In the case of the African continent, it was flagged that the effectiveness of the 
</p>
<p>framework to protect the rights of persons with disabilities showed a deficit and faced 
</p>
<p>normative and practical challenges because much of the disability-specific content in 
</p>
<p>African human rights instruments was understood in a medical, rather than a social rights, 
</p>
<p>perspective; core disability rights concepts, such as reasonable accommodation, legal 
</p>
<p>capacity and independent living, remain on the normative fringes of regional human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments; disability-specific interventions by the African Commission on Human and 
</p>
<p>Peoples&#8217; Rights and other regional human rights institutions were scarce. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Forms of cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>67. Participants put forward proposals for cooperation between United Nations, regional 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms, national human rights institutions, civil society and persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities through: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Promoting close consultations with, and active involvement of, persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities in formulating policies and approaches on disability issues; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Bridge building between civil society and people with disabilities by way of 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising, accessibility, empowerment and rehabilitation; </p>


<p>&#8226; Reinforcing partnerships between regional mechanisms and national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions, independent monitoring mechanisms, organizations of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and State parties in order to overcome gaps in the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Strengthening general interaction, dialogue and sharing of best practices between 
</p>
<p>international human rights mechanisms and regional mechanisms so as to achieve a 
</p>
<p>common approach on disability issues; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Developing and sharing social development indicators concerning the human rights 
</p>
<p>of persons with disabilities and increasing the production of relevant statistics and 
</p>
<p>disaggregated data; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Standardizing and simplifying the procedures to be followed by member States with 
</p>
<p>regard to reporting to regional and international human rights mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Issuing reminders to State parties about their commitments at the treaty body 
</p>
<p>reporting stage. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The workshop on enhancing cooperation between United Nations and regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights mechanisms generated valuable proposals and recommendations, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular with regard to mainstreaming economic, social and cultural rights, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>more specifically those of persons with disabilities and of women.  
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>Support to United Nations and regional organizations from intergovernmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>bodies was identified as crucial for the effective enhancement of cooperation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Participants encouraged intergovernmental organizations and States to allocate 
</b></p>
<p><b>sufficient financial and human resources to facilitate effective cooperation. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Participants recognized the critical role played by OHCHR in advancing 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation between international and regional human rights mechanisms. However, 
</b></p>
<p><b>it was noted that the capacity of OHCHR to operate as a facilitator and coordinator of 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation, including through the focal points network, was affected by financial 
</b></p>
<p><b>constraints. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Cooperation between human rights mechanisms was identified as a way to save 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources for the United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms. The need to 
</b></p>
<p><b>further develop joint activities and exchange of information was underlined.  
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The universality and indivisibility of all human rights should be the common 
</b></p>
<p><b>factor guiding the promotion and protection of human rights by international and 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional human rights mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The biennial workshops and annual meetings of the focal points on cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be continued. It was proposed that the next meeting of the focal points on 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation be held in 2015, and the next workshop be held in 2016.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Cooperation should be strengthened between the United Nations human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>system and regional human rights mechanisms, under the auspices of OHCHR. Staff 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be allocated to coordinating interaction between United Nations and regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights mechanisms and facilitating cooperation among focal points.  </b></p>


<p>75. <b>Information sharing between the United Nations human rights system and 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional human rights mechanisms should be continuous, consistent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>systematically channelled through the OHCHR focal point coordinator, in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>share, inter alia, decisions, recommendations, best practices, reports, calendars of 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities and programmes of visits. Alignment of processes and cross-referencing 
</b></p>
<p><b>would result in more coherent and targeted decisions and recommendations being 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressed to States.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>There is a need to enhance cooperation between the special procedures of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations and of the African Commission </b>for Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights<b> for 
</b></p>
<p><b>optimum exploitation of the opportunities provided by the Addis Ababa road map. 
</b></p>
<p><b>There should be annual consultations between the two bodies to assess the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the road map.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Good practices, such as desk-to-desk cooperation and the Addis Ababa 
</b></p>
<p><b>roadmap on cooperation, should be used as examples for other regions. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Annual meetings and monthly teleconferences between focal points would 
</b></p>
<p><b>enable exchange of information and facilitate the planning of common activities. Focal 
</b></p>
<p><b>points should be provided with adequate resources to effectively carry out their tasks.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The United Nations human rights system and regional human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms should encourage the gathering of statistics for monitoring human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>at the national level. Such statistics, particularly human rights indicators, would help 
</b></p>
<p><b>the human rights mechanisms to formulate concrete and measurable 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations, particularly with regard to the economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>of women and persons with disabilities.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Implementation of decisions and recommendations emanating from the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations human rights system and regional human rights mechanisms, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional judicial and quasi-judicial bodies, should be followed up and shared through 
</b></p>
<p><b>the focal points on cooperation. To that end, meetings of regional and subregional 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights courts should be held periodically. The first such meeting should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>convened by OHCHR in 2015, with the participation of regional courts and the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations treaty bodies, on the enforcement of judgements, access to courts, human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights defenders, deprivation of liberty and freedom of expression. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Regional human rights mechanisms should advocate increased mainstreaming 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the economic, social and cultural rights of women, and insist on the obligation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>States to respect, </b>protect and fulfil women&#8217;s right to equality in the Sustainable 
</p>
<p><b>Development Goals. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Regional human rights mechanisms should advocate the elimination of 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation that is discriminatory to women, in order to secure the opportunity of 
</b></p>
<p><b>women to fully and meaningfully participate in all aspects of economic and social life, 
</b></p>
<p>and tackle structural barriers which restrict women&#8217;s lives and choices. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The United Nations human rights system and regional human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms should engage in joint activities to sensitize States about ratifying 
</b></p>
<p><b>international and regional human rights instruments and to promote access to judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>and quasi-judicial bodies. National human rights institutions and civil society should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be considered as reliable partners in assessing and reporting on the human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation in their respective countries.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>There should be more cooperation and interaction between United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>treaty bodies and regional bodies including judicial mechanisms. Some sessions of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>treaty bodies, particularly the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be held in different regions in order to facilitate interaction and give visibility.  </b></p>

</p>
<p><i>Objective</i>: This session is divided into two main panel discussions. The first panel discussion (Panel 2)

</p>
<p>identify common priorities, challenges, synergies and possible complementarities.

</p>
<p>and cultural rights mean at the United Nations and regional levels? What are the key strategies used by 
</p>
<p>United Nations and regional mechanisms to mainstream economic, social and cultural rights? How can 
</p>
<p>United Nations and regional mechanisms complement each other in mainstreaming economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights? What is the role of other actors in strengthening mainstreaming of economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights? 
</p>
<p>In the second panel discussion (Panel 3), participants will discuss the role of regional and subregional 
</p>
<p>courts as well as that of other stakeholders, including NHRIs and non-governmental organizations, in 
</p>
<p>promoting economic, social and cultural rights. Some of the questions that participants will explore are: 
</p>
<p>What standards on economic, social and cultural rights have been developed by United Nations and 
</p>
<p>regional judicial and quasi-judicial mechanisms? What are the challenges faced by United Nations and 
</p>
<p>regional judicial and quasi-judicial mechanisms in enforcing economic, social and cultural rights? How 
</p>
<p>can these challenges be overcome?
