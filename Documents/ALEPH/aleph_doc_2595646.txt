Chichester Deposits (Christmas Creek & Cloudbreak) 
 
Geology
The Cloudbreak and Christmas Creek deposits lie within the Chichester Ranges, in northern Western 
Australia.  Iron mineralisation is hosted by the Nammuldi Member which is the lowest member of the late 
Archaean aged Marra Mamba Iron Formation (MMIF).  The Nammuldi Member is characterised by 
extensive, thick and podded iron rich bands, separated by equally extensive units of siliceous and 
carbonate rich chert and shale.  The Nammuldi Member in the Chichester Range is interpreted to be up to 
60 metres in true thickness.  Underlying the Nammuldi Member rocks are black shales and volcanic rocks 
belonging to the Jeerinah Formation.  Extended periods of tectonic activity have variably folded and faulted 
these rocks, together with weak metamorphism.  Subsequent erosion and hardcapping or lateritic 
processes have altered these rocks, and present outcrop of Nammuldi Member represents a ridge of low-
lying hills (relief up to 30 metres) throughout the prospect areas.  These ridges are recognised as the 
Chichester Ranges.
Drilling within the prospects has proved that the Nammuldi target horizon extends below cover away from 
the hills.  In these regions (recognised mineralisation has been intersected more than 6 kilometres from the 
outcrop) the target iron formation can be overlain by Tertiary age colluvium and alluvium (younger than 65 
Million years).  This colluvium can contain both cemented and un-cemented detrital products of iron 
enriched material, BIF, chert and shale within a matrix of finer grained sediments (including clays).  
Percolation of groundwater through the weathering profiles has resulted in precipitation of both calcrete and 
ferricrete creating resistant horizons within the extensive regolith.  More proximal to the Fortescue Marsh to 
the south, the Tertiary sediments become finer grained and more clay dominant, with some recognised 
calcareous zones.  A simplified geological cross section through the Chichester Ranges is shown in Figure 
1.  A typical stratigraphic section of the Chichester Ranges is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 1
Figure 2
Structure
The structural geology of the area is predominantly concealed with limited outcrop exposure.  However, 
small scale faulting and folding (metre offsets) can be observed in some outcrops, and larger-scale faults 
are interpreted from aeromagnetics and regional mapping, plus drilling results.  There is currently no 
evidence to suggest that the faulting or folding crosscuts the mineralisation.  In places faults may be the 
conduit for the mineralisation (hypogene model).
Iron Mineralisation Styles
The ore minerals are characteristically hematite and goethite (with variable degrees of alteration between 
these minerals).  Main gangue minerals are kaolinite, quartz and gibbsite, with minor gangue including 
carbonates, either calcite or dolomite.
Iron is enriched from the parent rock (Banded Iron Formation, BIF) by processes of supergene and, or 
hypogene enrichment.  In both processes, the original iron is present as magnetite bands within the BIF 
(iron banded with cherts and lesser carbonates), and oxidation of the magnetite to hematite and goethite 
occurs.  Contemporaneous with the iron enrichment, the original gangue minerals are partially to fully 
leached out or replaced by iron minerals, giving an overall increasing content of iron minerals depending 
upon the degree of enrichment.  A volume loss of up to 35% can occur with enrichment due to loss of 
gangue minerals.
Microplaty hematite (MplH) is recognised in varying degrees throughout FMG’s Chichester Range deposits.  
This is interpreted to occur due to hypogene enrichment of the MMIF in proximity to tectonic structures 
(faults or tight folds), which have allowed upward fluid flow, and low-grade metamorphism of the parent 
rock, resulting in extensive hematite mineralisation.
The majority of the iron within the prospects is a martite-goethite ore resulting from supergene enrichment 
of a BIF substantially rich with magnetite (oxidised to martite) in the parent rock.
Hardcapping (ferricrete development) of portions of the ore resources has been identified in mapping and 
drilling.  This process, formed at latter stages of geological development (Tertiary), has changed the 
physical and geochemical properties of the upper portions of the ore (up to 10 metres thickness).  
Hardcapped material has a higher density being pervasively cemented by goethite, commonly has vitreous 
goethite included in the matrix, and can be quite vuggy.  An associated increase in gangue content may be 
seen in hardcap due to the near surface processes of ferricretisation.
Current Drainage
Ephemeral drainages dissect the Chichester Ranges, generally in a southerly draining direction and 
commonly display alluvial sediments characterised by silt and sand sized sediments.  These shallow 
drainages become more meandering and braided on the shallower topography towards the Fortescue 
March.  The Fortescue Marsh is a wide shallow basin (up to 13 kilometres wide) associated with a widening 
of the Fortescue River, which during flood events fills with water and can remain filled for extended periods.  
The surface of this feature is Quaternary clay rich sediments.
Data and Resource Estimation
The resource estimate for each deposit is based solely on reverse circulation (RC) drilling (in addition, 236 
diamond drill holes were drilled, 37 twinned with RC drill holes to check geological and grade continuity, the 
remainder to provide material for metallurgical test work or as downhole geophysical calibration holes).  
Drill hole spacing ranges from 800 x 200m to a staggered 50 x 50m pattern, in the area of the test pit at 
Cloudbreak this was reduced to 12.5 x 12.5m (with some areas at 6.25 x 6.25m).  For Grade Control (GC) 
drilling, holes are drilled on a 25m x 25m pattern.  Drill hole collar locations were surveyed using a base 
station differential GPS with collar accuracies to within 5cm (laterally and vertically).
Exploration RC samples were collected over 1m intervals (GC samples over 0.5m and 1m intervals) using 
cone splitters from which ~3kg of material was pulverised to produce a sub-sample for analysis.  Field 
quality control procedures involved assay standards and duplicates, standards at a rate of 1 in 50 samples 
(Exploration and GC drilling) and duplicates at a rate of 1 in 33 samples (Exploration and GC drilling).  
Sample pulps were analysed for Fe, Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, CaO, MgO, Na2O, K2O, Mn/MnO, P, S, As, Pb, Zn, 
and Cl by XRF and 3 point LOI (at 370, 650 & 1,000°C) by thermogravimetric methods.  This is considered 
to be close to “a total analysis”.
Geochemical and geological logging data were used to define four geological domains within each deposit 
(Tertiary overburden, hanging wall, mineralised zone and footwall), 3-D wireframes were used to code the 
drilling data and define samples within each geological domain.  Model limits were controlled by drill hole 
data extents and Mining Lease boundaries.  Statistics were determined for each analyte within each 
domain, this confirmed that each domain was statistically discrete and justified the use of hard boundaries 
in statistical analysis and modelling.
An indicator method was used to define high grade zones within each stratigraphic unit.  The Resource 
Models were constructed using a 25mE x 25mN x 1mRL parent block size with sub-celling to 12.5mE x 
12.5mN x 1mRL to aid in following the folded domains and to allow integration of Grade Control Models.  
Grade Control Models were constructed with a parent block size of 12.5mE x 12.5mN x 1mRL and no sub-
celling.  All estimation was undertaken using Ordinary Kriging (OK) at parent cell scale.  Multiple estimation 
search passes were used for each domain.  Hard boundaries were applied between all estimation domains.  
Validation of the block models (using visual, statistical and trend analysis methods) shows good correlation 
of the input data to the estimated grades.
The mineralised domains have demonstrated sufficient geological and grade continuity to support the 
definition of Mineral Resource and Reserves and the classification applied under the JORC Code.  Drill 
spacing and data integrity, geological complexity, estimation risk and mineralisation continuity based on the 
semi-variogram ranges of influence were used to determine Mineral Resource classifications.
For Resource reporting purposes the Resource Models were regularised to a 12.5mE x 12.5mN x 1mRL 
block size prior to the GC Models being merged.  The resulting combined Resource/GC Models were then 
flagged with the mined out surface (as at April 30th 2016) and mined out exclusion zones.  Adjustments 
were then made to the Measured Mineral Resources to subtract the mining tonnage (assumed at average 
grade) for May and June, and to add in the stockpiled tonnes.
Solomon Deposits (Firetail, Kings & Queens) 
Geological Setting
The Solomon Project area is situated approximately 60 kilometres to the north of the Tom Price township in 
the northern Hamersley ranges (Figure 3).  Outcropping geology in the project area is dominated by the 
Dales Gorge, Whaleback Shale and Joffre Members of the Brockman Iron Formation which hosts large BID 
throughout the Hamersley Province.  The Firetail deposit contains the major tonnages of BID at Solomon, 
where geologically favourable environments have allowed for the formation and preservation of large 
tonnages of iron mineralisation.
Incised into this bedrock geology are regional palaeochannel systems, predominantly one to two kilometres 
in width, and stretching for tens of kilometres.  During the Miocene period deep chemical weathering and 
erosion of the generally iron rich material into these fluvial channels formed CID.  Through Fortescue’s 
interpretation of drill hole results, the CID can be subdivided into an upper ‘hard CID’ and a lower ‘ochreous 
CID’.  Clay lenses are observed as semi-discrete bands often several meters thick, sometimes of a poddy 
nature although often traceable between drill holes.  Approximately 40 km of buried CID is preserved in the 
Kings CID system, with a further 25 km of CID located in the Serenity deposit to the west.  Other CID 
occurrences are also known throughout the Solomon project area.  The material overlying the CID (and 
other areas) has been eroded from adjacent mineralised and un-mineralised bedrock.  This clastic material 
is concentrated into horizons of elevated iron grade termed DID, which forms part of the sequence of 
overlying late Tertiary aged alluvial and colluvial deposits.
Figure 3 – Location of the Solomon Deposits
Data and Resource Estimation
The resource estimates for each deposit are based solely on Reverse Circulation (RC) drilling.  Drill hole 
spacing includes areas at 400 x 100m, 200 x 100m, 100 x 50m and 50 x 50m, with some areas infilled at 
25 x 25m.  Drill hole collar locations were surveyed using a base station differential GPS with collar 
accuracies to within 10cm (laterally and vertically).  In addition ~225 diamond drills holes were drilled, 9 of 
these were twinned with RC drill holes to check geological and grade continuity, the remainder to provide 
material for metallurgical test work.  133 RC/RC twins were also drilled, again to check geological and 
grade continuity.  No major bias was identified.
Exploration RC samples were collected over 1m intervals using cone splitters from which ~3kg of material 
was pulverised to produce a sub-sample for analysis.  Field quality control procedures involved assay 
standards and duplicates, ‘field’ standards were inserted at a rate of 1 in 100 samples, pulp standards at 1 
per lab batch and duplicates at a rate of 1 in 30 samples.  Sample pulps were analysed for Fe, Al2O3, SiO2, 
TiO2, CaO, MgO, Na2O, K2O, Mn/MnO, P, S, As, Pb, Zn, and Cl and 3 point LOI (at 370, 650 & 1,000°C) by 
thermogravimetric methods (note: for some samples only the 1,000°C LOI measurement was made).  This 
is considered to be a total analysis.
Geochemical and geological logging data were used to define geological domains within each deposit 
(Table 1), 3-D wireframes were used to code the drilling data and define samples within each geological 
domain.  Model limits were controlled by drill hole data extents and Mining/Exploration Lease boundaries.  
Statistics were determined for each analyte within each domain, this confirmed that each domain was 
statistically discrete and justified the use of hard boundaries in statistical analysis and modelling.

An indicator method was used to define high grade zones within each stratigraphic unit.  The block models 
were constructed using a parent block size appropriate for the drill hole spacing, in all areas sub-celling to 
5.0mE x 5.0mN x 0.25mRL was used along domain boundaries to better define the domain interface.  All 
estimation was undertaken using Ordinary Kriging (OK) at parent cell scale.  Multiple estimation search 
passes were used for each domain.  Hard boundaries were applied between all estimation domains.  
Validation of the block models (using visual, statistical and trend analysis methods) shows good correlation 
of the input data to the estimated grades.
The mineralised domains have demonstrated sufficient geological and grade continuity to support the 
definition of Mineral Resource and Reserves and the classification applied under the JORC Code.  Drill 
spacing and data integrity, geological complexity, estimation risk and mineralisation continuity based on the 
semi-variogram ranges of influence were used to determine Mineral Resource classifications.

FMG Chichester Deposits (Cloudbreak and Christmas Creek)
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data
Criteria
Commentary
The deposits were sampled using Reverse Circulation (RC) and Diamond drill holes 
(DD).  Drill hole spacing ranges from 800m x 200m to a staggered 50m x 50m pattern.  
In the area of the test pit this was reduced to 12.5m x 12.5m (plus some at 6.5m x 
6.5m).  Grade Control (GC) drilling uses a 25m x 25m pattern.
RC samples only were used in resource estimation.  For Cloudbreak this included 
731,906 samples from 20,755 holes.  For Christmas Creek this included 596,695 
samples from 22,619 holes.
Approximately 30% of holes were down hole geophysically logged.
Sampling 
techniques
Initial exploration holes were assayed from collar to end of hole.  Partway through the 
exploration program the sampling regime was modified and analysis was restricted to 
samples with visually higher Fe, infill GC holes are sampled in a similar manner.  This 
may mean that not all potentially mineralised material has been analysed.
All holes were surveyed by qualified surveyors using a Base station Differential GPS, 
with collar accuracies to within 5 centimetres (laterally and vertically).  Analytical 
standards were used to assist in checking laboratory results.  Field duplicates were 
used to assist with determining sampling quality at the rig.  Geophysical probes were 
calibrated on a regular basis (using static methods and specific calibration holes).
RC drilling, samples from 0.5m or 1m intervals pass through cyclone and cone splitter, 
2-3kg sample collected in calico bag (~6-7% of samples total volume).  Samples from 
mineralised zones (plus ~5m above and below), as selected, are sent for analysis.
Standard face sampling hammer drilling samples from ~130mm diameter RC drill holes 
used for Resource Estimation.
201 vertical diamond drill holes were completed during the Exploration Phase.  Some 
of these were drilled as twins to RC holes, the rest were drilled to provide samples for 
metallurgical test work.  Limited analytical information located.  Most holes were PQ 
size, core not oriented as holes drilled vertically.  A further 23 diamond drill holes were 
completed during 2015, to provide additional material for metallurgical testwork
Drilling of large diameter (Bauer) holes (0.78 or 1m) commenced during the Exploration 
phase and ceased in ~2010.  These holes were limited to shallow parts of the deposit 
(by working depth of rigs).  Samples were primarily used for metallurgical test work, 
data from these holes was not incorporated into updated resource models.
The quality of each sample is recorded at the time of logging and categorised as either 
poor, moderate or good.
Drilling 
techniques
Drill sample 
recovery
No significant issues with sample collection system identified during Exploration drilling 
or subsequent infill programs.  Minimal loss of fines was achieved through the use of 
an automated sample collection and splitting system.
37 RC drill holes were twinned with diamond drill holes.  In general there was good 
correlation between both grade and geology.
There is assumed to be no expected relationship between sample recovery and grade.
Logging
Geological logging was completed by personnel experienced in iron mineralisation, 
logging considered to be adequate for resource estimation.
Quantitative – chemical analysis of samples logged as mineralised, down hole 
geophysical surveys of approximately 30% of drill holes.
Criteria
Commentary
Qualitative – texture logging completed over the whole drill hole, based on this 'ore' +/- 
3-4m surrounding waste is submitted for analysis.  Some risk of material being mis-
logged and therefore not analysed.
Effectively 100% for RC during Exploration, limited to mineralised intersections +/- 3-
4m surrounding waste during infill programs.
The majority of diamond holes were drilled to provide material for metallurgical 
testwork.  No assays from diamond holes were used in the estimate.
Samples are collected in labelled bags from each 1m of drilling, which are stored onsite 
or sent for analysis.  These samples are collected using a cone splitter installed directly 
beneath the cyclone.  Wet samples are collected using the same technique as dry 
samples, with thorough cleaning of gear between samples.  Wet samples are allowed 
to dry before being processed.  For drill rigs using riffle splitters, once wet samples are 
encountered, the splitter is changed to a chisel splitter.  Larger samples are collected 
and later split.
Sub-sampling 
techniques and 
sample 
preparation
All sub-sample preparation undertaken by the laboratory performing the sample 
analysis
Field QC procedures involved the use of certified reference material as assay 
standards together with the collection of duplicate samples.
During Exploration drilling, field (rig) duplicates were collected at a rate of 1 in 20 
samples.  Analysis of duplicates did not indicate that there were any issues.  QA/QC 
reports are available.  For Grade Control drilling, field (rig) duplicates were originally 
collected every 50 samples, subsequently increased to every 33 samples.  Sample 
numbers are pre-determined, therefore it is possible that not all duplicates will be 
analysed.  Monthly QA/QC reports are now routinely prepared.
No formal analysis of the appropriateness of sample size compared to grain size has 
been completed but the sampling regime is considered to be industry best practice.
Various laboratories have been used, including SGS (Christmas Creek and Perth), 
Ultratrace and Intertek (Cloudbreak, Solomon, and Perth) and Genalysis (Perth)).  All 
laboratories have National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia (NATA) 
accreditation.
All chemical analysis by XRF using 'standard iron ore suite' (reported as Fe, Al2O3, 
SiO2, TiO2, CaO, MgO, Na2O, K2O, MnO (Exploration) or Mn (Grade Control), P and S).  
Also three point LOI (370, 650 & 1,000°C) by thermogravimetric methods.  This is 
considered to be close to “a total analysis”.  From early 2013 As, Pb, Zn, and Cl have 
also routinely been included in sample analysis
Details of geophysical tools used for down hole geophysical analysis are available in 
the drill hole database.
Exploration - Field (rig) duplicates collected 1 in 20 samples.  Standards submitted at 1 
in every 50 samples.  Analysis of duplicates and standards did not indicate that there 
were any issues.  QA/QC reports were prepared.
Grade Control - Field (rig) duplicates collected 1 in 50 samples.  Standards submitted 
at 1 in every 100 samples (historically).  Since ~Q1 2009, field duplicates collected 1 in 
33 samples and standards submitted 1 in 50.  Sample numbers for duplicates & 
standards are pre-determined, if they occur in waste in a drill hole they may not end up 
being submitted to the laboratory for analysis.  QA/QC is performed on laboratory 
analyses prior to accepting the data in the acQuire database.  Monthly QA/QC reports 
are now routinely prepared.
Concerns over the quality of a few of the historical standards have been raised.  
Through investigation it appears that this is due to standard preparation methods, size 
of standards, and homogenisation issues (similar problems have not been noted in 
newer standards).  Also issues with inadequate round-robin testing resulting in over-
precise certified values.

Criteria
Commentary
Significant intersections have been visually inspected by senior Fortescue personnel 
and by independent consultants.
37 RC drill holes were twinned with diamond drill holes.  In general there was good 
correlation between both grade and geology.
Verification of 
sampling and 
assaying
Several different methods/systems have been used to store samples data (including 
GBIS and an ‘in-house’ system).  The sample data is now stored in customised acQuire 
drill hole databases, which include a series of automated electronic validation checks.  
Fortescue data entry procedures are documented.  Only trained personnel perform 
further manual data validation.
Conversion of MnO% to Mn% for grade estimation has been made where necessary 
(mainly exploration data).  Samples reporting below detection limits were given the 
value of half the detection limit.
All holes were surveyed by qualified surveyors using a Base station Differential GPS, 
with collar accuracies to within 5 centimetres (laterally and vertically).
During creation of the updated resource models it was noted that some of the selected 
drill holes had not been surveyed (99 at Cloudbreak, 35 at Christmas Creek).  These 
holes were subsequently excluded from resource estimation.
Location of 
data points
Grade Control Drilling – holes are occasionally missed during survey (observed when 
modelling commences, re-surveys requested.  If holes cannot be re-located then they 
are omitted from modelling).
Grid coordinates given for each point are Map Grid of Australia (GDA94) and heights 
are in the Australian Height Datum.  The project area lies inside UTM zone 50.  Drill 
hole collar elevations are also validated against local topographic data.
The topography was created from 1 metre contours from LIDAR data.  Vertical 
accuracy of the LIDAR data is +/-0.2 metres.
NOTE:  No Exploration Results Reported.  Data spacing reported below is for reported 
Mineral Resources.
Exploration Drilling - Ranges from 800 x 200m down to staggered 50 x 50m.  In the 
area of the test pit this was reduced to 12.5 x 12.5m (plus some at 6.5 x 6.5m).
Data spacing 
and distribution
Grade Control Drilling - Infill commences at 100 x 100m (where Exploration drilling 
missing), with subsequent infill at 50 x 50m and 25 x 25m.
All holes were drilled vertically.
Considered adequate for Resource Modelling.  Studies demonstrated that Resource 
Classification is closely related to drill hole spacing.
Orientation of 
data in relation 
to geological 
structure
Samples are not composited prior to analysis.
Sampling considered unbiased in terms of possible geological structures.
Drilling is perpendicular to (ie vertical) main geological structure controlling 
mineralisation (bedding, horizontal).
No sampling bias is apparent.
Sample 
security
Consignment notes (sample submission information) generated for each batch of 
samples.  Samples trucked to Perth laboratories, samples delivered directly to site 
laboratories.
Several audits have been undertaken with varying recommendations.  Those relating to 
Exploration drilling concluded that there were no major risk factors relating to the 
sampling and assaying of the Exploration data.
An audit of grade control drilling at Cloudbreak highlighted the lack of routine formal 
QA/QC reporting.  Preparation of monthly QA/QC reports is now standardised and 
implemented across all operational sites.
An independent audit of the CC resource model has been conducted and found no fatal 
flaws, in process or output.

The Cloudbreak project area is within the external boundaries of the Nyiyaparli, Palyku 
and Wunna Nyiyaparli registered native title claims.  In 2005, Fortescue entered into 
comprehensive Land Access Agreements (LAA) with the Nyiyaparli and Palyku 
traditional owners.  The LAA’s facilitate the certain grant of all required Fortescue 
tenure and related approvals.  In consideration, Fortescue provides the traditional 
owners with: training, employment, business opportunity, and consultation on a range 
of project–related matters including regular on-country meetings, comprehensive 
Aboriginal heritage identification and management procedures, and cash 
compensation.
The Wunna Nyiyaparli native title claim was registered in 2013.  Its boundaries overlap 
a small portion of the Nyiyaparli People’s native title claim and covers precisely the 
area described by the Roy Hill pastoral lease.  While Fortescue does not intend 
entering into an agreement with the overlapping claim, it has secured all tenure 
required to access and develop the Chichester Resource and Reserve through the 
processes provided under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) and is confident that this will 
continue into the future.

The Fortescue Christmas Creek mine and resource development proposed activity 
area will be undertaken within the Nyiyaparli and Wunna Nyiyaparli Native Title Claim 
areas.  Fortescue signed a Land Access Agreement (LAA) with the Nyiyaparli People 
on the 10th of October 2005 which facilitates Fortescue’s exploration and mining 
activities within the Claim area.  To ensure compliance with the Aboriginal Heritage Act 
1972 (AHA) Fortescue conducts both archaeological and ethnographic surveys over all 
land prior to the commencement of ground disturbing works.  Within the Christmas 
Creek mining and resource area heritage surveys have identified places that are highly 
significant to the Nyiyaparli People; and in some instances neighbouring Traditional 
Owner Groups.  This includes the ethnographic place Mankarlyirrkurra (ETH-NYI11-
001), and Heritage Restricted Zones associated with Kakutungutanta CB10-093 (HRZ-
0132) and CB09-292 (HRZ-0005), which should be excluded from the mining resource 
area into the future.
Fortescue Marsh has significance to the Nyiyaparli People and neighbouring Traditional 
Owner Groups.  The creek lines that run through the Christmas Creek mining and 
resource area towards Fortescue Marsh and the quality/flow of water entering the 
marsh system are important to the Traditional Owner groups.  In accordance with our 
LAA with the Nyiyaparli People Fortescue has an obligation to minimise impact to 
creeks and has committed to avoiding Kandama Creek (Christmas Creek, HRZ-006) 
and portions of Kakutungutanta Creek (HRZ-0259 and HRZ-0007) which should be 
excluded from the mining resource area into the future.  Wherever possible, when 
creeks must be temporarily diverted for mining purposes they should be re-established 
following completion of the project operations.  Fortescue has a commitment to use its

Commentary
best endeavours not to impact Fortescue Marsh and to ensure the flow and quality of 
water entering the marsh system is not affected by mining activities.  Most notably this 
is focused on the protection of known ethnographic ‘Yintha’ sites along the Marsh 
edges, which are fed by creek flows into the Marsh.  This is currently managed by 
consultation with the group and the implementation of various water management 
methods including monitors, diversions, containments and conveyance.  These water 
management methods must be continued and maintained during the development of 
Christmas Creek mine to ensure compliance with the Nyiyaparli LAA.
The tenure is currently in good standing and no impediments are known to exist.
Both BHP and Hancock Prospecting Pty Ltd (HPPL) have undertaken exploration for 
iron within the project boundaries.  No historical data has been used by Fortescue.
Iron mineralisation is hosted by the Nammuldi Member which is the lowest member of 
the late Archaean aged Marra Mamba Iron Formation (MMIF).  The Nammuldi Member 
is characterised by extensive, thick and podded iron rich bands, separated by equally 
extensive units of siliceous and carbonate rich chert and shale.  The Nammuldi 
Member in the Chichester Range is interpreted to be up to 60 metres in true thickness.  
Underlying the Nammuldi Member rocks are black shales and volcanic rocks belonging 
to the Jeerinah Formation

Database 
integrity
All drill hole data from the last 5 years has been captured and stored in an acQuire drill 
hole databases.  Field (texture) logging data is captured electronically, assay and down 
hole geophysical data are uploaded directly from source files.  Sample numbers are 
unique to each site and pre-numbered and barcoded sample bags are used.  These 
methods are all aimed at minimising data errors.
Exploration data older than this has been transferred between a number of different 
data storage systems, there is a risk that some of it may have been lost or compromised 
in the process.
Criteria
Commentary
All drill hole data used to update the resource models were reviewed by FMG 
geologists.  Complete drill holes and individual samples were excluded if any problems 
with the data were noted (eg erroneous drill hole co-ordinates, suspect assays, missing 
texture data etc).  Data exclusion is considered to have been minimal.
The acQuire drill hole databases include semi-automated validation procedures 
designed to minimise data errors.
Site visits
Site visits were undertaken by senior Fortescue personnel and by independent 
consultants during Exploration drilling programs.  Site visits by the current CP are 
undertaken on a semi-regular basis to discuss drilling/modelling progress and any other 
issues.
Geological 
interpretation
For the updated resource models, four geological zones were interpreted on the basis 
of geochemistry:  overburden, hanging wall, ore zone and footwall.  There is some risk 
of mis-interpretation in areas of wider spaced drilling where assay data is limited, this is 
not considered to be material.  In future model updates texture logging from the wider 
spaced drilling should also be reviewed to refine definition of the overburden/hanging 
wall contact.
For the Grade Control models, eleven geological zones are interpreted on the basis of 
geochemistry and down hole geophysical logging:  overburden, U8, U7U, U7l, U6, U6l, 
U5, U5l, U4, U3, U2 & U1.  The U7U, U7l, U6, U6l & U5 correspond to the ore zone of 
the Resource Models.
Interpretation based on geochemistry of RC drill samples and down hole gamma 
logging.
The updated resource models are an alternative interpretation of the drill hole data used 
to create earlier resource models and incorporate additional drill hole data.
All samples are flagged with their host geological zone, only samples with the same 
geological zone as the block to be estimated can be used in grade estimation.
There are a number of factors which have an impact of geological and grade continuity:
  Faults (geology and grade) – minor impact 
  Creeks (grade and to a lesser extent geology)  – slightly more significant impact 
(evidenced by a reduction of iron grades at both sites and erosion of the ore body, 
primarily at Christmas Creek but also locally at Cloudbreak)
  Late stage hardcapping/weathering of mineralisation 
  Localised late stage supergene Mn mineralisation
Dimensions
Up to ~80km along strike and up to 5km plan width.  Upper limit of mineralised domain 
is located between 0m to 125m below the surface.  Lower limit of mineralised domain is 
located between 1m and 130m below the surface.  The average thickness of the 
mineralised domain is 7.0m and the range of thickness is 1m to 28m.
Grade estimation using Ordinary Kriging (OK) was completed using Vulcan™ (V8.2) 
software for 14-18 analytes (see above) and 50 texture codes.
Drill hole sample data was flagged using three dimensional wireframes provided by 
FMG.
Variography undertaken on 1m drill hole composites in unfolded space.  Initial 
variography on Fe indicator values (<48% Fe = 0, >48% Fe = 1), was used to create 
wireframe solids of areas within the ore zone with indicator values >0.4 (note 48% Fe 
was selected after substantial testing to get the 'best' fit of block grade Fe distribution vs 
the composite data distribution).  The drill hole composites were re-flagged using these 
solids to give 'high grade' and 'low grade' data sets.  Additional variography was then 
undertaken for Fe, SiO2, Al2O3, P and LOI on these data sets.  Variograms were 
generally robust (low nuggets, long horizontal ranges and short Z ranges), 'low grade' 
variography was used for waste domains.  A separate Mn indicator was also created (at 
1%) and used to control estimation of Mn.

Commentary
Quantitative kriging neighbourhood analysis used to establish optimum search and 
estimation parameters.
Each geological domain was interpolated separately, the ore zone domain was 
separately interpolated for high and low grade areas.  Mn modelled separately with no 
geological domaining.
Reconciliation of previous model against production showed a loss of tonnage, decreased 
iron grade and increased contaminant grades.  Preliminary reconciliation of the updated 
models against historic production shows a marked improvement.
No assumptions regarding the recovery of by-products have been made
The iron ore suite of Fe, Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, CaO, MgO, Na2O, K2O, Mn/MnO, P, S, LOI 
370, LOI 650 and LOI 1000°C has been estimated.  Pb, As, Cl and Cu have also been 
estimated but as they are not sampled at the same density as the previously discussed 
analytes, they are not considered as accurate.
A program of selected analysis of waste material for potentially deleterious elements (eg 
Se, As) has commenced (these are not currently included in the Resource Models).  
Routine analysis for arsenic (by Intertek) is now part of the grade control drilling 
program, this data will be included in future models when sufficient information is 
available to allow interpolation.
Following kriging neighbourhood analysis, statistical investigations and discussions with 
FMG staff, a parent block size of 25m x 25m x 1m was selected (drill hole spacing 
varies from 800mx 200m to 6.25m x 6.25m in some small areas).  To allow for 
integration of grade control block models and to aid in following the folded geometry of 
the geological domains, sub-celling to 12.5m x 12.5m x 1m was allowed.
For the GC Models a block size of 12.5m x 12.5m x 1m is used (drill hole spacing 
nominally 25m x 25m).
No selective mining units were assumed in these estimates.
No assumptions about correlations between variables were made in these estimates.
Drill hole samples were geologically flagged using the interpreted domain wireframes.  
These domains were used as hard boundaries to select samples populations for 
variography and estimation.
For both Resource Models, some element grades were top-cut during estimation based 
on coefficient of variation values higher than 1.2.
The updated resource models were validated as follows:
  Block geology vs geological surfaces; 
  Visual comparison of block grades vs drill hole data (all analytes, 50m sections); 
  Review of average grades by geology (blocks vs composites); 
  Grade Trend plots on eastings, northings and rl for all analyses (100m slices); 
  Block total assay check; 
  Un-estimated block check; 
  Reconciliation against production.
The tonnages are estimated on a dry basis.
A cut-off of greater than or equal to 53.5% Fe was used to report the tonnages of all 
stratigraphic units.  53.5% Fe has been used for analogous Fortescue estimates and 
represents a similar cut-off to current product specifications.
It has been assumed that current mining methods (surface miner) will continue to be 
used in the future, the block size in the models is appropriate for this.
It has been assumed that current OPF’s will continue to be used in the future.

Commentary
A program of waste characterisation sampling is now in place as part of the 
requirements allowing mining.  No significant concentrations of environmentally 
deleterious elements have been identified to date.
Densities are average above water table (AWT) down hole geophysical strand 
(stratigraphic) densities.  Although the current down hole geophysical density data has 
not been fully calibrated with diamond core measurements, reconciliation against 
historic production data is very good.
Bulk density
Densities in both resource models are dry.
Down hole geophysical probes measure the in-situ bulk density which accounts for void 
spaces.  The measurements are grouped by geological domains.
The densities used are similar to known densities of other deposits in the region.
Overall Resource Model limits were designed to minimise extrapolation of drilling data, 
all material within the model boundaries could at least be classified as Inferred.  The 
following range of criteria were considered in determining the final resource 
classification over each model:
  Geological and mineralisation continuity; 
  Data quality; 
  Drill hole spacing; 
  Modelling technique; 
  Estimation  properties  including  search  strategy,  number  of  informing  data  and
average distance of data from blocks;
The resource classification methodology used also incorporated a number of parameters 
derived from the kriging algorithms in combination with drill hole spacing and continuity 
and size of mineralised domains.
Appropriate account has been taken of all these factors in creation of the updated 
resource models.  Block model validations show good correlation of the drill hole data to 
the estimated grades.
The Mineral Resource classification reflects the views of the Competent Person.
Classification
Audits or 
reviews
An external audit of the CB resource model has been conducted and no fatal flaws were 
identified.  Several external audits of the Grade Control modelling process have been 
undertaken.
Statistical/geostatistical procedures have not been used to quantify the relative 
accuracy of the resources.  However, comparisons with local grade control models 
show that on average tonnage and grades are similar (in some areas grade control 
models show reduced tonnages when compared with the resource models, in other 
areas the opposite is the case).
Resource models are global in that they include as much of each deposit as is covered 
by sufficient drilling to support geological and grade continuity.
Comparisons with production data are available for mined areas.  Currently these only 
cover limited areas of the resources.  The updated resource models show an improved 
reconciliation against production data.

Sampling 
techniques
Drilling 
techniques
The deposits were sampled using Reverse Circulation (RC) and Diamond drill holes 
(DD).  Approximate drill hole spacings are as follows:  Firetail – 200m x 100m and 
50m x 50m.  Kings – 400m x 100m, 200m x 100m, 100m x 100m, 100m x 25m and 
25m x 25m.  Queens – 400m x 50m and 100m x 50m.  Grade control drilling uses a 
25m x 25m pattern.
RC samples only were used in resource estimation.  For Firetail this included 60,291 
samples from 1,892 holes.  For Kings this included 213,445 samples from 6,166 holes.  
For Queens this included 66,401 samples from 1,565 holes.
Where possible, all holes undergo down hole geophysical logging.
All holes were surveyed by qualified surveyors using a Base station Differential GPS, 
with collar accuracies to within 3-10 centimetres (laterally and vertically).  Analytical 
standards used to assist in checking laboratory results.  Field duplicates used to assist 
with determining sampling quality at the rig.  Geophysical probes calibrated on a 
regular basis using static methods and specific calibration holes.
RC drilling, samples from 1m intervals pass through cyclone and cone splitter, 2-3kg 
sample collected in calico bag (~6-7% of samples total volume).  Samples from 
mineralised zones (plus 5m above and below), as selected by a geologist, are sent for 
analysis, all other samples are moved to a bag farm.
Standard face sampling hammer drilling samples from ~130mm diameter RC drill 
holes used for Resource Estimation.  All holes are drilled vertically with the exception 
of 12 inclined holes at Firetail targeting Joffre mineralisation.
Diamond drill holes were drilled as twins to reverse circulation holes and for 
metallurgical test work, they were not incorporated into resource models.  Core size 
was predominantly PQ with some 6 inch holes.  All diamond holes were drilled 
vertically, the core was not oriented.
Large diameter (Bauer) holes drilled in the shallow parts of the deposit (limited due to 
working depth of rigs).  Data used for metallurgical test work and not incorporated into 
resource models.  Approximately 1 meter diameter holes.
The quality of each sample is recorded at the time of logging and categorised as either 
poor, moderate or good.
Drill sample 
recovery
No major issues with sample collection system identified during drilling.  Minimal loss 
of fines was achieved through the use of an automated sample collection and splitting 
system.
Twin holes were drilled to compare grades, no significant sample bias occurred.
Logging
Geological logging was completed by geologists experienced in iron mineralisation, 
logging considered to be adequate for resource estimation.
Criteria
Commentary
Detailed geological logging captured the following qualitative and quantitative 
information: mineralogy, sample quality, colour and numerous physical characteristics.  
This data is relevant for both Mineral Resource estimation and future mining and 
processing.
100% of drilled meters logged.
Majority of diamond holes drilled to provide material for density determinations and for 
metallurgical testwork.  For DDH whole core was sampled.
Samples are collected in labelled bags from each 1m of drilling, which are stored 
onsite or sent for analysis.  These samples are collected using a cone or multi-tier riffle 
splitter of dry cuttings installed directly beneath the cyclone.  Wet samples are 
collected using the same technique as dry samples, with thorough cleaning of gear 
between samples.  Wet samples are allowed to dry before being processed.  For drill 
rigs using riffle splitters, once wet samples are encountered, the splitter is changed to 
a chisel splitter.  Larger samples are collected and later split.
All sub-sample preparation was undertaken by SGS Perth laboratory.
Coarse standards were inserted at rates of 1 per 50 samples.
Field (rig) duplicates were collected at a rate of 1 in 33 samples.
No formal analysis of the appropriateness of sample size compared to grain size has 
been completed but the sampling regime is considered to be industry best practice.
All samples were sent to SGS Perth laboratory for analysis.  This laboratory has 
National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia (NATA) accreditation.  The 
standard elements tested were Fe, SiO2, Al2O3, P, MnO/Mn, MgO, CaO, TiO2, Na2O, S 
and K2O by X Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and a three point LOI thermo gravimetric 
analysis at 371, 650 and 1000°C.  The three point LOI was not undertaken for all 
samples with only the LOI 1000 being completed.  A three point LOI was subsequently 
carried out on all samples with a Fe grade greater than 50%.  This is considered to be 
close to “a total analysis”.
Details of geophysical tools used for down hole geophysical analysis are available in 
the drill hole database.
Field duplicates were collected 3 in 100 samples.  Standards submitted at 1 in every 
50 samples.  Analysis of duplicates and standards did not indicate there any major 
issues.  QA/QC reports were prepared for the project areas.
Concerns over the quality of a few of the historical standards have been raised.  
Through investigation it appears that this is due to standard preparation methods, size 
of standards, and homogenisation issues (similar problems have not been noted in 
newer standards).  Also issues with inadequate round-robin testing resulting in over-
precise certified values.
Significant intersections have been visually inspected by senior Fortescue personnel 
and by independent consultants.
Over 70 twin holes have been completed to check the variance of the ore body and 
sampling.  Results show good correlation between the original RC hole and the twin 
hole.
Sample data is now stored in customised acQuire drill hole databases, which include a 
series of automated electronic validation checks.  Fortescue data entry procedures are 
documented.  Only trained personnel perform further manual data validation.
Conversion of MnO% to Mn% for grade estimation has been made where necessary 
(mainly exploration data).  Samples reporting below detection limits were given the 
value of half the detection limit.

Data spacing 
and distribution
Drill hole collar locations have been surveyed using a differential GPS (by Navaids Pty 
Ltd and VEKTA Pty Ltd), with an accuracy of better than +/- 10 cm for Easting and 
Northing and RL for the majority of drill holes.
No down hole surveys are available as the majority of drill holes are vertical and less 
than 200m in total depth, therefore any deviations from vertical would be negligible.
Collar survey data is validated against planned coordinates and dtm surface.
Grid co-ordinates are Map grid of Australia (GDA94), heights are in Australia Height 
Datum.  Area is within UTM zone 50, AusGeoid98 used to obtain separation between 
GDA94 spheroid and the Geoid.
The topography was created from 1 metre contours from LIDAR data.  Vertical 
accuracy of the LIDAR data is +/-0.2 metres.
Firetail:  Drill hole data on nominal 200m x 100m spacing for assays and geology with 
100m x 50m, 50m x 50m and 25m x 25m sections of infill and some more sparsely 
drilled 400m x 100m areas.
Kings:  Drill hole data on nominal 200m x 100m spacing for assays and geology with 
100m x 50m and 50m x 50m sections of infill and some more sparsely drilled 400m x 
100m areas.  The drilling is on an imprecise grid spacing with three different grid 
orientations.
Queens:  Drill hole data on nominal 200m x 50m spacing for assays and geology with 
100m x 50m sections of infill and some more sparsely drilled 400m x 100m areas.  
The drilling is on an imprecise grid spacing with two different grid orientations.
For all deposits Grade Control (GC) drilling is on a nominal 25m x 25m grid.
This level of data density is sufficient to define geological and grade continuity for a 
mestimate.  Locally, the drilling pattern may be inadequate to fully define bedded 
mineralisation.  In some areas, there are also uncertainties in detritals/bedded 
interface.
In the area of closer spaced drilling (50m by 50m) in Kings, estimates have been 
made of the resource using only 100m by 50m holes.  The results show that with 
increased drilling, tonnes remain the same, iron grades increased slightly and 
contaminant grades decreased slightly.
No sample compositing was conducted for this estimation.
Orientation of 
data in relation 
to geological 
structure
Firetail:  Drilling grid oriented perpendicular to the local bearing of mineralisation, all 
but 12 holes are vertical (the inclined holes were drilled to test for mineralisation in the 
Joffre, they were not down hole surveyed).  This results in no significant sampling 
bias.
Kings & Queens:  Drill hole data have been drilled as vertical holes in grid orientations 
sub-parallel to the local bearing of the orebody, and thus the mineralisation 
(paleochannel).  This results in no significant sampling bias.
No sampling bias is apparent.
Sample security  Use of consignment notes (sample submission information), direct delivery to site
laboratories.
Audits or

FMG has had a sampling audit by Snowden (in the Chichester's), there were no major 
risk factors relating to the sampling and assaying of the data.  Similar rigs and splitter 
systems were utilised in this area.

The Solomon project area is within the external boundaries of the Eastern Guruma and 
Yindjibarndi registered native title claims.  In 2009, Fortescue entered into a 
comprehensive Land Access Agreement (LAA) with the Eastern Guruma traditional 
owners.  The LAA facilitates the certain grant of all required Fortescue tenure and 
related approvals.  In consideration, Fortescue provides the Eastern Guruma People 
with training, employment, business opportunity, consultation on a range of project–
related matters including regular on-country meetings, comprehensive Aboriginal 
heritage identification and management procedures, and cash compensation.  
Fortescue has developed an excellent working relationship with the majority of the 
Yindjibarndi People through their Wirlu-Murra Yindjjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation 
(WMYAC).  In partnership with the WMYAC Fortescue has delivered significant 
training, employment, business development opportunity to Yindjibarndi people and the 
highest levels of heritage protection to areas identified as being important to 
Yindjibarndi People. Fortescue has secured all tenure required to access and develop 
the Solomon Resource and Reserve through the processes provided under the Native 
Title Act 1993 (Cth), and is confident that this will continue into the future.
The tenure is currently in good standing and no impediments are known to exist.
Both BHP and Hamersley Iron have undertaken exploration for iron within the project 
boundaries.  No historical data has been used by Fortescue.
Mineralisation within the Solomon area is hosted by buried Channel Iron Deposits 
(CID), Bedded mineralisation (BID) and Detrital mineralisation (DID).  Outcropping 
geology in the area is the Dale Gorge, Whaleback Shale and Joffre Members of the 
Brockman Iron Formation which contain the BID mineralisation.  Incised into this 
bedrock geology are the large Channel systems which contain the DID and CID 
mineralisation.

Database 
integrity
Sample data is stored using a customized acQuire database (a secure and industry 
standard system), which includes a series of automated electronic validation checks.
Only trained personnel perform further manual validation which passes on the data in 
order to confirm results reflect field collected information and geology.  In order to 
ensure integrity of the database, any changes to the database only occur after a 
review of the suggested changes are authorised, and these changes can only be 
performed by a single person.  Prior to modelling, further validation was performed on 
the dataset being used.  No issues were uncovered in this final validation step.
Site visits
Site visits, by both the CP and resource modelling/estimation geologist(s), were 
undertaken on a semi-regular basis to discuss drilling/modelling progress and issues.
Logging and geological interpretation was completed by geologists experienced in iron 
mineralisation.  Geology over the majority of the deposit is relatively straight forward.  
There is some risk of misinterpretation in areas of wider spaced drilling with limited 
assay data, this is not considered to be material.
Geological interpretation based on geological logging and geochemistry of RC drill 
samples.
The stratigraphy of the deposits is well known and it is envisaged that any alternative 
geological interpretation, with or without further drilling, would not have a material 
impact on the resource estimate.  Further close spaced drilling may improve the 
confidence in the stratigraphic interpretation of the BID mineralisation in the Kings & 
Queens deposits.
All samples are flagged with their host geological zone, only samples with the same 
geological zone as the block to be estimated can be used in grade estimation.
Kings & Queens:  The major source of error is at detrital/bedded and detrital/CID 
interface.  The structure and stratigraphy is unknown in the bedded material.
Firetail:  The bedded mineralisation has a strike length of 7km and outcrops on the 
north and south limbs of an anticline.  Mineralisation is strata bound, has an average 
thickness of 20m and extends to a depth of 100m below surface in places.
Kings:  The CID mineralisation has a strike length of 20 km and a width of 1 - 2km.  
Though the CID mineralisation outcrops in the southeast corner of the deposit, the 
majority of the CID mineralisation is buried and occurs at depths of up to 40m below 
surface and the defined mineralised units are between 1m and 65m thick
Queens:  The CID mineralisation has a strike length of 10km and a width of 0.5 - 1km.  
The CID mineralisation is buried and occurs at depths of up to 60m below surface and 
the defined mineralised units are between 1m and 65m thick.
Ordinary Kriging was used to estimate grades.  Estimation was done using Vulcan™ 
software.  The model areas extend half the distance of drill spacing away from the 
drilling.  Kriging parameters were derived from semivariograms using Supervisor 
software.  The deposit was domained by stratigraphy, local orientation of the 
paleochannel, and mineralised/un-mineralised zones.
Comparison with previous resource estimates generally showed an increase in tonnes 
with slight decrease in Fe grades together with a slight increase in contaminant 
grades.  Insufficient production data to date (Firetail and Kings) for reconciliation.
No assumptions regarding the recovery of by-products have been made

For the GC Models a parent block size of 12.5m x 12.5m x 1m sub-blocked to 6.25m x 
6.25m x 1, is used.
No selective mining units were assumed in these estimates.
No assumptions about correlations between variables were made in these estimates, 
however significant correlation between certain variables was noted during statistical 
analysis of the drilling data
The definition of mineralised zones within each stratigraphic unit was accomplished 
using an indicator approach.  The probability of any zone being mineralised was 
estimated using appropriate geochemical indicator cut-offs for Fe, SiO2 and Al2O3 for 
the individual stratigraphic units.  These cut-offs were based on data population 
statistics and visual validation.  A ‘geozone’ code was assigned to each sample, 
defined by the stratigraphic unit and mineralisation.
Grades were top cut for estimation based on high coefficient of variation values as well 
as other statistical characteristics of the distributions.  Grade cutting is not used in GC 
models.
Visual validation of the block model coding of the geozones was completed prior to 
estimation.  Once estimated, the grade of all elements was also visually validated.  
Visual validation of both the geozones and grade were completed in Vulcan™ by 
comparing section and plan slices of the block model against the drill holes.
Statistics for the mean grade of the mineralised blocks within each stratigraphic unit 
were compared to the mean grade of the mineralised samples within each 
stratigraphic unit.  Overall, the mean values between the model and samples are well 
within an acceptable range.
Trend analysis graphs have been created for each of the mineralised geozones.  
These have been generated in Northing, Easting and RL, for all elements.  The trend 
analysis graphs show the modelled grade vs. the raw data grade at a particular slice in 
space. The trend analysis charts show that overall, the model grade is consistent with 
the raw data.  Areas with a large number of samples correlate much better with the 
model grade than do areas with few samples.
The tonnages are estimated on a dry basis.
Cut-offs were not used to define domains, they are used to report Mineral Resources.
It has been assumed that current mining methods will continue to be used in the 
future, the block size in the models is appropriate for this.

Commentary
It has been assumed that current OPF’s will continue to be used in the future.
Kings:  Density has been calculated from physical diamond core measurement 
throughout the deposit.  Average densities by geological unit and mineralisation have 
been applied globally to the model.
Physical  density  measurements  are  measured  from  diamond  PQ  core.    Density 
measurements are taken at least 4 weeks after the core has been drilled to drive off any 
excessive moisture.  Although the core has not been oven dried the core has been dried 
in the high temperatures, high evaporation rates and low humidity of the Pilbara would 
have  driven  off  any  free  moisture.    No  good  quality  down  hole  geophysics  density  is 
available in the Kings area, therefore no comparisons could be made with the diamond 
measurement.
Firetail & Queens:  Density has been calculated from physically measured diamond 
core and down hole geophysical gamma-gamma measurements conducted at Firetail 
& Queens.  Average densities by geological unit and mineralisation have been applied 
globally to the models.
Physical density measurements are measured from diamond PQ core.  Density 
measurements are taken at least 4 weeks after the core has been drilled to drive off 
any excessive moisture.  Although the core has not been oven dried the core has 
been dried in the high temperatures, high evaporation rates and low humidity of the 
Pilbara would have driven off any free moisture.  Geophysical density data is collected 
and validated with caliper data to ensure down hole data integrity.
Where used, the down hole geophysical probes measure the in-situ bulk density which 
accounts for void spaces.  The measurements are grouped by geological domains.
The densities used are similar to known densities for current and historic mines, of 
similar geology and mineralisation, across the Pilbara.
Firetail & Kings:  The resources are classified as Measured, Indicated and Inferred.  
This takes into account drill spacing and data integrity, geological complexity, and 
estimation risk and mineralisation continuity based on the semi-variogram ranges of 
influence.
Classification
Queens:  The resource is classified as Indicated and Inferred.  This takes into account 
drill spacing and data integrity, geological complexity, and estimation risk and 
mineralisation continuity based on the semi-variogram ranges of influence.
Appropriate account has been taken of all these factors in creation of the updated 
resource models.  Block model validations show good correlation of the drill hole data 
to the estimated grades.
The Mineral Resource classification reflects the views of the Competent Person.
Audits or 
reviews
No external audits of the updated resource models have been undertaken, however 
internal peer reviews have been completed.  Several external audits of the Grade 
Control modelling process have been undertaken.
Statistical/geostatistical procedures have not been used to quantify the relative 
accuracy of the resources.  However, comparisons with local grade control models 
show that on average tonnage and grades are comparable (in some areas grade 
control models show reduced tonnages when compared with the resource models, in 
other areas the opposite is the case).
Resource models are global in that they include as much of each deposit as is 
covered by sufficient drilling to support geological continuity.
FMG has a resource estimation audit by Optiro for the Solomon Project.  Overall, 
Optiro considers the methods used to categorise the Kings and Firetail Mineral 
Resource estimates to be fair, reasonable and consistent with industry standards in 
the iron ore sector.  Recommendations include further twin hole drilling; deeper drill

Fortescue Hematite Ore Reserve Reporting
as at June 30th, 2016
Ore Reserves
Fortescue Ore Reserves are based on integrating contributions from the various mine-sites and assembling 
bedded iron deposit (BID) and channel iron deposit (CID) into blended saleable products at the port.
Each of the BID and CID products includes a premium and a lower quality variety.  The BID products are 
Fortescue Blend (FB) and Super Special Fines (SSF).  The CID products are Kings CID (KCID) and Pilbara 
CID (PCID).  Within the primary BID and CID product streams, controlled blending of non-primary ore types 
occurs on an opportunistic basis to optimise product outcomes.
Due to the deposit integration inherent in the Ore Reserve, the following supporting data is comprehensive 
and addresses the Reserve generation process collectively for all deposits.
Mining Models
Mining Models consist of regularised resource models overprinted with grade control models and 
application of reconciliation grade adjustment factors and OPF upgrade performance to incorporate 
historical mining losses and dilution into the in-situ estimates and estimate products generated by the ore 
processing facilities (OPFs).  This process is summarised as
1.  The Resource models are regularized to a block size consistent with the selective mining unit (SMU) 
that is appropriate to mining method that will be applied for each style of deposit. FMG is in the process 
of transferring  Surface mining  to  Excavator  mining for  Chichester  operations  and  as such  a  larger 
SMU is adopted to reflect excavator mining practice for this years estimate.
2.  Grade Control (GC) models – built to the same block dimension as the resource models are merged
into the regularised resource models, creating the Merged Models
3.  Factoring of in-situ grades based on reconciliation between the underlying models (Resource or GC) 
and actual diluted plant feed, back-calculated from sales.  Approximately one year of historical model 
performance is used to derive factored grades in the Mining Models.  Grade adjustment factors for Fe 
and major impurities (SiO2 and Al2O3) are typically minor.  The Chichester operations utilise 11 months 
of  excavator  mining  historical  data  to  derive  these  factors,  reflecting  the  period  of  the  new  mining 
method.
4.  Application of respective OPF mass yield and upgrade factors.  The Chichester OPF upgrade factors 
are based on a combination of actual OPF performance and metallurgical test-work.  The Solomon 
CID mining models incorporate Kings OPF yields and upgrade factors based on metallurgical test-
work and actual OPF performance.  The Firetail OPF is operating in “dry” mode and therefore has no 
beneficiation factors applied.
Scheduling Inventory
Pit optimisation software is used to determine how mining inventory varies as a function of ore cut-off grade 
(Fe) and limiting strip-ratio for selected ultimate pit wall slopes.
A combination of selected Fe cut-off and limiting strip ratio is then used to identify the starting geometry for 
pit design. Higher strip-ratio peripheral shells are used to identify where ramps should be located without 
unnecessarily compromising value.
Due to the transition from surface miner to excavator mining method at the Chichesters the use of ‘strip’ 
designs has been replaced by local pit geometries suitable for excavator mining. Due to the large lateral 
extensions and flat and shallow nature of the deposits it is not feasible nor necessary to maintain detailed 
ultimate pit designs for the entire deposits, and as such Life Of Mine (LOM) planning is carried out using 
Whittle pit optimisation geometries (with conservative slope angles) to generate inventories based on 
limiting strip ratios. Detailed pit designs are developed closer to the time of mining of the deposit parts, 
incorporating the required ramp and wall geometries to facilitate safe, practical and efficient mining.
Solomon mining is by conventional drill and blast followed by excavators, and detailed LOM ultimate pit 
designs are used as the bounding geometry.
In all cases, Inferred material is converted to waste, generating mining costs but contributing no revenue.
Mine Scheduling
Mine scheduling is integrated across all FMG properties to maximise value through blending of individual 
deposit contributions.  Chichester mineralisation is combined with Solomon BID (principally from Firetail) to 
manufacture the two BID blended products, FB and SSF. The two CID products, KCID and PCID are 
predominantly sourced from the Kings and Queens deposits and will include a proportion of BID and detrital 
iron deposit (DID) mineralisation incidental to mining the CID channels.
Scheduling aims to maintain the target blended ore quality and maximise NPV.  In general terms this 
equates to deferring higher strip ratio, higher mining cost mineralisation until later in the collective 
scheduled mine life.  A commercial linear programming package is used to identify the integrated mining 
sequence that will deliver the maximum NPV for the nominated constraints.  Major constraints include the 
nominated ore tonnage and blend quality and the maximum OPF treatment rates that, in turn, are matched 
to the logistics capacity of the FMG rail and port system.
Blending between sites takes advantage of impurity synergies that maximise the ore supply relative to 
products being sourced from single sites. The proportion of each of the collective BID and CID products will 
change with time depending on the respective ore quality being delivered from individual deposits and 
these ratios are maintained in the range demonstrated as acceptable in historical sales. The constituent 
products are manufactured at the port by blending individual trains onto port stockpiles.
The scheduling inventory is initially collected into ore “bins” based on Fe and impurity cut-offs. Since 
mineralisation distributions and presentation varies with time, so too may the shorter term effective ore cut-
off grade.  The Ore Reserve cut-off can be approximated by Fe and Si cut-offs that closely approximate 
that portion of the scheduling inventory that is converted into product over the life of the Ore Reserve 
schedule (see below).
Financial Analysis
The scheduling programme utilises unit revenue (per product brand) and cost (per deposit per activity) 
information to allow a NPV to be targeted and to allow relative NPV values to be assigned to schedule 
alternatives, however these do not constitute a robust valuation.  Further financial analysis to determine 
more realistic absolute financial indicators and sensitivity analysis is performed separately using the 
quantity and quality data extracted from the scheduler.  This analysis is performed by the Finance team 
using audited business valuation models and assumptions.
A +/-30% sensitivity of the main financial drivers was carried out on the base case valuation and was 
demonstrated to be robustly NPV positive under all cases tested.
Ore Reserve Statement
The Fortescue hematite Ore Reserve is quoted on a dry product basis as at 30 June, 2016. Individual BID 
deposits included in the Ore Reserve include Cloudbreak, Christmas Creek and Firetail.  The Kings and 
Queens reserves are principally CID mineralisation.
Due to opportunistic blending and stockpiling, the Ore Reserve is not reported at a fixed cut-off.  However, 
the reported Ore Reserve quantity and quality can be closely approximated by:

Section 4 Estimation and Reporting of Ore Reserves
Commentary
The Chichester and Solomon individual resource models described in Section 3, 
depleted by mining to 31 April 2016, are the basis for the conversion to Ore Reserves 
(which are subsequently adjusted for an additional 2 months of mining depletion to 
reflect Ore Reserves position at end of June 2016).  These models are regularised, 
merged with Grade Control Models and adjusted based on reconciliation history to 
create the Mining Models that form the basis for Reserve reporting.
The Ore Reserves reported are a component of the Mineral Resources.

Ore Reserves
Site visits
Periodic site visits are undertaken by the Competent person to monitor on-going mining 
and processing operations relevant to estimation of Ore Reserves.
Cloudbreak and Christmas Creek Ore Reserves relate to operating properties that have 
been established for over 6 years.  The Firetail deposit has been mined and processed 
for approximately three years while mining and processing has occurred at the Kings 
CID deposit for just over two years. Routine integrated short, medium and long term 
planning activities are carried out according to a company planning calendar, including 
annual life-of-mine (LOM) and Reserve plans.  The technical feasibility of mining and 
processing activities is well understood based on the operating history for both the 
Chichester and the Solomon deposits.  Where possible, material Modifying Factors are 
derived from actual operating history to maximise the confidence in plan and Reserve 
outcomes.  The LOM and associated Reserve plans include an ore sales product 
strategy, ore definition and cut-offs, mine and waste designs and schedules, 
infrastructure designs including roads, drainage, remote crushing, dewatering, tails 
dams and the like, closure designs and schedules, fleet and manpower requirements, 
operating and capital costs and financial analysis.  Due to the site operating history and 
the 165Mt per annum installed infrastructure, the Chichester and Solomon Ore Reserve 
estimations are considered to be equivalent or better than a “definitive” feasibility study 
standard.  Shorter term plans (1 to 3 years) are supported by a detailed budgeting 
process.
The company produces a number of standard BID and CID blended products that are 
delivered by rail and assembled at the Fortescue Port Hedland ore stockyards from 
contributions of each mine-site.  A linear programming approach is adopted where “ore 
bins” are created and the maximum tonnage of blended ore is assembled that meets 
the collective BID and CID product specification.  Since the quality of mineralisation 
varies with time at each deposit and site, the cut-off grade(s) can also vary with time to 
achieve the required product outcome.  Due to the methodology, and opportunistic 
blending, a fixed cut-off is not used for Ore Reserve reporting.  However, Fe cut-off and 
SiO2 cut-off for each major ore type deposit can be applied to approximate the Ore 
Reserve outcome.  The Fe grade that most closely approximates the Ore Reserve for 
BID deposits is between 52.5% to ˜53.0% Fe in-situ while the equivalent Fe cut-off for 
CID deposits is ˜ 51.0% Fe in-situ.
Both the Chichester and Solomon resource models are estimated into parent block and 
sub-cells and are regularised to the parent block size to simulate the expected mining 
selectivity, dilution and ore loss.
After regularisation, the resource models are merged with Grade Control models to 
reflect the greatest level of detailed information available for each deposit.
The resulting models are compared with sales data over approximately the prior twelve 
months to derive reconciliation factors (for both the Resource and GC modelled areas) 
that are then applied to the in-situ regularised tonnage and quality attributes to create 
the adjusted in-situ tonnage and grade in the “Mining Model”.
Ore processing facility (OPF) upgrade factors (predicted based on test-work and/or 
reconciled from actual OPF upgrade performance) are then applied to the adjusted in-
situ data to create a “product” data set.  There is no beneficiation associated with ore

directed to the Firetail OPF at Solomon, so the in-situ values constitute the product 
data set.  It is this product dataset that is used as the basis for both LOM and Reserve 
plans and Ore Reserve reporting.
Chichester pit geometry with an average overall slope angle of approximately 40 
degrees are optimised based on the latest available excavator mining models with 
inferred materials included in the optimisation. Due to the Chichester ore body flat and 
shallow nature, no detailed ultimate pit designs are maintained, optimised pit shells are 
used directly for mine scheduling. However in order to account the extra waste 
inclusion during engineering pit design, a slightly larger optimum pit shell is used to 
reflect the reality.
Solomon pits are fully designed geometries with dimensions consistent with the scale 
of mining equipment employed, and geotechnical and operational considerations made.
The LOM plan fully includes Inferred mineralisation.  For the Ore Reserve plan, only 
Measured and Indicated resources are considered.  Inferred mineralisation is treated 
as waste for the purposes of scheduling, reporting and financial valuation of the Ore 
Reserve.
Cloudbreak (CB) and Christmas Creek (CC) mineralisation is all treated through 3 
existing wet processing plants at a collective Reserve design rate of 90 Mt per annum 
of (wet) product.  Processing consists of primary and secondary crushing and 
screening, and downstream beneficiation based on particle sizing and density.  Low 
grade reject is directed to wet tailings disposal facilities.  The processes are well tested 
and the sites have developed an operating history for both mass yield and element 
upgrades for typical OPF feed to supplement historical test-work.
Specifically, CB OPF yields and upgrades are based on the average of the previous 12 
months operating history.  This period is considered to reflect the latest steady-state 
operation of the plant under the current operating philosophy.
CC1 and CC2 OPF yields and upgrades are based on the design parameters for the 
plants.  The last 12 months operating history demonstrates a sustained ability to 
achieve these factors over the longer term.
Kings OPF factors were developed to reflect the last 12 months operating history and 
additional recent testwork.
Firetail OPF is a dry plant with 100% yield and no upgrading.
The CB and CC mines and associated infrastructure were initially approved under the 
Iron Ore (FMG Chichester Pty Ltd) Agreement Act 2006 (State Agreement) per CB 
Ministerial Statement 721 and CC Ministerial Statement 707 and subsequent 
amendments.  Scope of these approvals included mine pits, ore processing facilities, 
tailings storage facilities, above ground landforms, rail, conveyors, camps, roads, water 
abstraction and injection infrastructure and other infrastructure associated with mining.  
Changes relative to these primary approvals are subject to assessment by both State 
and Commonwealth entities including the WA Environmental Protection Authority 
(EPA) and other State authorities and the Department of Sustainability, Environment, 
Water, Population and Communities (DSEWPC).  Operating licences (L8199/32007/2 
for CB and L8454/2010/1 for CC) and various Works Approvals issued by the WA 
Department of Environment and Regulation (DER) are in place for both sites.
The Solomon project was referred to the EPA under Part IV of the Environmental 
Protection Act (EP Act) in July 2010 and State ministerial approval was granted in April 
2011 subject to the conditions of Ministerial Statement (MS) 862.  Subsequent project 
amendments to MS 862 addressed an increase to the railway footprint (2011) and 
additional bore field clearing (2013).  The project was also assessed and approved by 
the Commonwealth Department of the Environment (DoE) under the Environmental 
Protection and Biodiversity and Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).  The Solomon 
project is also subject to regulation by the DER through Part V of the EP Act and 
Fortescue holds a number of Works Approvals and a Licence for the site.  Construction 
of the mine(s) and associated infrastructure has been the subject of assessment and 
approval by way of Mining Proposals as required under Section 82A(2) of the Mining 
Act 1978 administered by the Department of Mines and Petroleum.  Fortescue also

holds a number of licences under the Rights in Water and Irrigation Act 1914 for the 
abstraction of groundwater.
Future amendments to existing approvals and licences will be sought on a routine basis 
as more information is gathered during the course of normal mining and processing 
operations.
All mine sites are well established with all required infrastructure and services already 
in place.  As the centre of gravity of ore mining operations moves further away from 
existing OPF’s, additional remote crushing and ore conveying facilities and associated 
infrastructure will be established on an as-needed basis to offset higher ore haulage 
costs. The scheduling optimisation process has included the capex required for mine 
development and transport for Queens deposit development.
The majority of planned capital costs to support operations are sunk.  Future capital 
costs, including sustaining capital are subject to normal annual budget financial 
analysis standards.
Operating costs are derived based on operating history and LOM cost target prediction.
Forecast metal prices and exchange rates are based on analysis of internal and 
external sources.
Rail freight and port handling costs are internal costs and are forecast based on 
operating history.  Sea freight rates are forecast based on operating history and 
external sources.
OPF treatment costs are based on operating history and LOM cost target prediction.
An iron ore fines royalty of 7.5% is payable for non-beneficiated product.  For that 
portion of OPF product that meets the beneficiation criterion the lower royalty of 5% is 
allowed. The resulting overall average royalty rate is approximately 7.3%. No private 
royalties are payable.
The individual Cloudbreak, Christmas Creek and Firetail BID OPF products are 
blended at the port to create Fortescue Blend (FB) and Super Special Fines (SSF).  
These products are sold based on Fe content at a price adjustment to the 62% Fe 
benchmark price.
The Kings OPF treats Channel Iron Deposit (CID) plus minor detrital and bedded (DID 
and BID) ore to produce Kings (KCID) and Pilbara (PCID) CID products.  The KCID 
product is sold based on Fe content at a price adjustment to the 62% Fe benchmark 
price.
Forecast sales prices and adjustments used to determine Reserves consider market 
prices for equivalent products, value-in-use assessment plus global industry capacity 
and consumption trends.  The forward price profile is commercially sensitive and is not 
disclosed.
The majority of current and future FMG iron ore sales are expected to be to Chinese 
customers with an increasing proportion to other Asian customers.  Demand in this 
market is driven by internal consumption, with further support expected during periods 
of lower prices by a slowdown in expensive local ore supply.
Fortescue has demonstrated it can compete successfully with other suppliers and 
adapt products to match changing market requirements. Current FMG product blend 
ratios are maintained over the near term (approx. 5 years) and then determined by 
scheduling optimiser to decide the optimum product ratios to deliver highest Net 
Present Value (NPV).
Economic analysis is based on discounted cash flow assessment to derive the NPV of 
the Reserves plan.  The NPV robustness is tested by carrying out a +/-30% sensitivity 
analysis of the major financial drivers (price, foreign exchange rate, opex, capex and 
discount rate).  These sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the Ore Reserves meet the 
required internal Fortescue investment criteria and deliver positive NPV outcomes.  The 
details of the economic inputs are commercially sensitive and are not disclosed.

Fortescue entered into comprehensive Land Access Agreements (LAA) with the 
Nyiyaparli and Palyku traditional owners.  The LAA’s facilitate the certain grant of all 
required Fortescue tenure and related approvals. In consideration, Fortescue provides 
the traditional owners with: training, employment, business opportunity, and 
consultation on a range of project–related matters including regular on-country 
meetings, comprehensive Aboriginal heritage identification and management 
procedures, and cash compensation.
The Wunna Nyiyaparli native title claim was registered in 2013.  Its boundaries overlap 
a small portion of the Nyiyaparli People’s native title claim and covers precisely the 
area described by the Roy Hill pastoral lease.  While Fortescue does not intend 
entering into an agreement with the overlapping claim, it has secured all tenure 
required to access and develop the Chichester Resource and Reserve through the 
processes provided under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) and is confident that this will 
continue into the future.
The Solomon project area is within the external boundaries of the Eastern Guruma and 
Yindjibarndi registered native title claims.  In 2009, Fortescue entered into a 
comprehensive Land Access Agreement (LAA) with the Eastern Guruma traditional 
owners.  The LAA facilitates the certain grant of all required Fortescue tenure and 
related approvals.  In consideration, Fortescue provides the Eastern Guruma People 
with training, employment, business opportunity, consultation on a range of project–
related matters including regular on-country meetings, comprehensive Aboriginal 
heritage identification and management procedures, and cash compensation.  
Fortescue has developed an excellent working relationship with the majority of the 
Yindjibarndi People through their Wirlu-Murra Yindjjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation 
(WMYAC).  In partnership with the WMYAC Fortescue has delivered significant 
training, employment, business development opportunity to Yindjibarndi people and the 
highest levels of heritage protection to areas identified as being important to 
Yindjibarndi People.  Fortescue has secured all tenure required to access and develop 
the Solomon Resource and Reserve through the processes provided under the Native 
Title Act 1993 (Cth), and is confident that this will continue into the future.
Approvals status is addressed under the environmental section.  There are reasonable 
grounds to assume that required Government approvals will continue to be granted 
within the timeframes anticipated in the mine schedules supporting the Reserve 
reporting.
There are no material legal agreements or marketing agreements that are anticipated 
to impact on the Reserve.

Proven Ore Reserves stated are all derived from Measured Mineral Resources.  The 
majority of Measured Resource and Proved Reserve is located in areas that have been 
infill drilled on a close-spaced 25m x 25m grade control (GC) pattern.
Probable Ore Reserves are all derived from Indicated Mineral Resources.
The Competent Person agrees that the classification properly represents the risk 
associated with the Ore Reserve estimate.
An Ore Reserve Estimation Audit focusing on the contribution made by the Firetail 
deposit to the EOFY2016 FMG Ore Reserve has been carried out by external AMC 
Consultants in June 2016.  The final report of this review has been submitted to the 
FMG Audit and Risk Management Committee (ARMC) for reporting to Board.  The 
review forms part of an ongoing program of review and audit agreed with the ARMC.
No material issues were identified with the Ore Reserves Estimation process during 
this review. A number of recommendations were made for process improvement, and 
these will be adopted over the coming year.

of FMG Board of Directors.
The Fortescue Chichester sites have been active for a number of years at full mining 
and processing rates with production data collected and reconciled against Reserve 
model predictions.  The reconciliation data is used to measure against and, when 
necessary, recalibrate the mining models that the Ore Reserves are estimated from. 
The operating history of the last 11 months of excavator mining in the Chichesters has 
been incorporated into the reconciliation process and is reflected in the factors applied 
to the mining models used for this years Ore Reserves estimate.
Reconciliation performance at Solomon (Firetail BID mining and processing) indicates 
that planned tonnage and quality outcomes are being met.  CID mining and processing 
at the Kings deposit has operated for 2 years at full production post ramp-up, operating 
data at full production are used to derive OPF factors for Kings.

Attachment 2 - Magnetite Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Report
Iron Bridge Magnetite Mineral Resources Reporting
as at June 30th 2016
Magnetite Mineral Resources
An updated Magnetite Mineral Resource estimate has been produced for the Iron Bridge Project, 
incorporating the North Star, Eastern Limb, Glacier Valley and West Star deposits.  This includes a total of 
692 Reverse Circulation (RC) drill holes totalling 133,935 metres.
Drilling activity has been carried out in conjunction with the Stage 1 Mine Development, and ongoing 
Feasibility Studies.
The operation is a Joint Venture between FMG Iron Bridge Pty Ltd (69%) and Formosa Steel IB (31%); it 
covers granted mining leases M45/1226 (North Star) and M45/1244 (Glacier Valley).
The Mineral Resource Estimate is reported in compliance with the 2012 Australasian Code for Reporting of 
Exploration results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC 2012). Only Mineral Resources are being 
reported, including material in the Measured, Indicated and Inferred Categories.
Project Location
The project area is located approximately 110 km south of the town of Port Hedland in the Pilbara region of 
Western Australia (Figure 4), where FMG’s port facility is located.  The project is also located within 25km 
of the existing FMG rail line.
Access to the project region is via the Great Northern Highway sealed road southerly from Port Hedland, 
and then via well maintained gravel roads to the Project area.
A feasibility study has been completed aimed at developing the Magnetite project by mining and processing 
at site, and then pumping fine grained concentrate to Port Hedland for drying and shipping through the 
FMG port facilities.  An initial (Stage 1) processing facility has been constructed and successfully operated 
to trial innovative processing solutions which reduce operational costs.  Over 1 million tonnes of oxide and 
magnetite ore had been processed during 2015 to 2016.
Figure 4 – Project location and projected infrastructure
Geology
The project lies within the northern part of the Pilbara Craton, which is an Archaean Granite-Greenstone 
Terrane (2940-3515Ma). The magnetite resources are hosted by Banded Iron Formations (BIF’s) in the 
Pincunah Member of the Soanesville Group which forms large north-south trending arcuate strike ridges up 
to 1,000m wide. Drilling has established resource continuity to a depth of more than 600m over a strike 
length of more than 15 km. The main mineralised zone is sub-vertical, dipping at a high angle to the West.
There are four main areas of focus within the project, the central North Star deposit, the Eastern Limb 
deposit adjacent to North Star, Glacier Valley to the south and West Star to the west (Figure 5).  The South 
Star deposit (further south from Glacier Valley) is an exploration target and is not incorporated in these 
Mineral Resources.
Figure 5 – Deposit location and tenements
Data used for Mineral Resource Estimation
Data used for Resource Estimation is largely derived from RC drilling, using boosted high pressure air and 
cone splitters to maximise sample recovery and integrity. Diamond drill holes have also been drilled to 
provide geological control on RC drill hole logging, as well as metallurgical and geotechnical samples.
RC drilling at North Star has been completed to a 25m x 25m pattern in the Stage 1 mining area, with 
50m x 50m spacing in the main South Core domain.  Other areas generally have broader 200m x 100m 
spacing with 400m x 100m towards the Northern extremities of the project. Drilling has confirmed the 
continuity of the BIF and mineralisation to depths of 450m below surface.
Drilling at Eastern Limb is spaced at 100m x 50m with the extremities at 400m x 100m. Drilling has 
confirmed the continuity of the BIF and mineralisation to depths of 450m below surface.
Drilling at Glacier Valley is spaced at 200m x 100m with the extremities at 400m x 100m, and a small area 
of infill at 100m x 100m. Drilling has confirmed the continuity of the BIF and mineralisation to depths of 
450m below surface.
Drilling at West Star was completed with holes spaced 100 metres along lines separated 200 to 300 metres 
apart. Drilling has confirmed the continuity of the BIF and mineralisation to depths of over 300 m below 
surface.
All data is logged electronically to ensure data integrity and protection, and FMG follows stringent QAQC 
procedures in data handling and testing, including validation of drill hole coordinates, assay samples and 
lab standards, field duplicates, twin holes, and round robin laboratory audits. To date, no issues of sample 
bias or assay precision or accuracy have been encountered.
The Mineral Resource estimate includes all validated drill holes and available assay data that has passed 
QAQC checks. Stratigraphy and mineralisation domains have been produced from geological mapping and 
drill hole logging, and validated by geochemical data and geophysical down-hole logging data.
Deposit areas and drill spacing are shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6 – Deposit areas and drilling
Mineral Resource Estimation Methodology
The primary data estimated initially is Mass Recovery, which is a combination of Davis Tube Recovery 
(DTR) composite data and downhole geophysical measurement of Magnetic Susceptibility (MagSus).
The geological interpretation has been used to guide the definition of mineralisation domains, which are 
based on an Ordinary Kriging Indicator estimate of Mass Recovery. The central part of North Star has a 
wide, clearly defined higher grade core of magnetite mineralisation, with multiple, less continuous lenses in 
the footwall and hangingwall. Areas to the north and south, plus Eastern Limb, Glacier Valley and West 
Star, tend to have a less well-developed core, but several quite continuous magnetite zones.
Logging of weathering and geochemistry have been used in combination to define a sub-horizontal Oxide 
domain, with Fresh material below.
Only data in each mineralised domain is used to estimate that domain. Search ellipse orientations are 
based on a combination of variography and drill spacing. An unfolding methodology based on the 
geological interpretation was used to account for variations in dip and strike.
Search ellipse dimensions varied depending on drill hole spacing and were also related to anisotropy 
observed in the variography.
A multiple search pass strategy was adopted, whereby the search was expanded if a first search failed to 
find enough samples to estimate blocks. In the first search pass, a minimum of eight composites and two 
drill holes was required to estimate a block, with relaxed parameters in the expanded second search.
The standard suite of iron ore XRF analyses has also been estimated as both in-situ head grades and 
recovered concentrate grades.
Parent block size varied depending on drill hole spacing.
Oxide domain (25m x25m spacing): 10m x 12.5m x 3m blocks (East, North, RL).
Measured and Indicated (Fresh) domains: 10m x 25m x 12m.
Inferred (Fresh) domains: 20m x 50m x 12m.
A range of criteria has been considered in determining this classification including geological continuity, 
data quality, drill hole spacing and estimation properties such as number of informing data and kriging 
variance. Measured resources are based on close spaced drilling and no extrapolation. Indicated resources 
use limited extrapolation and are confined to areas with 200m x 100m drill spacing or better. Inferred 
resources are based on wider drill spacing and/or areas extrapolated at depth.
Tonnage estimates are based on dry bulk density values derived by interpolating (estimating) the density 
into the block model in areas of suitable down hole geophysical data coverage.  Where data coverage was 
insufficient, default values by rock type (cluster) were attributed to the blocks.  The assigned density values 
by rock type was as a results of a study, completing geostatistical analysis on the results from down hole 
geophysics as well as physical measurements on diamond core.
Typical section of lithology which drives Mass Recovery in the resource model is illustrated in Figure 7.
Figure 7 –Schematic North Star & Eastern Limb cross section showing rock units
Magnetite Mineral Resource Statement
The North Star and Eastern Limb deposits are adjacent and are likely to be mined at the same time, 
therefore are reported together.  Additional drilling (mostly upon the Eastern Limb) in 2016 plus using the 
improved density classification has confirmed the tonnage of higher confidence Measured and Indicated 
Mineral Resource, which can potentially be converted to an Ore Reserve. Mineralisation peripheral to the 
centrally drilled areas is classified as Inferred.
The major increase in total Resource tonnage (including increased Indicated Resources) has occurred due 
to the addition of the Eastern Limb deposit.
The Glacier Valley estimate was also updated (with no new drilling) in 2016 using the improved density 
classification.  This has confirmed a central area classified as an Indicated Mineral Resource.  Peripheral 
Mineralisation is classified as Inferred.
The West Star estimate was also updated (with no new drilling) in 2016 using the improved density 
classification.  This resource remains classified as an Inferred Mineral Resource.
All Mineral Resource estimations utilise a 9% Mass Recovery cut off.

Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data
Commentary
Combined data from the North Star, Eastern Limb, Glacier Valley and West Star deposits 
utilised 692 Reverse Circulation (RC) drill holes (133,935 m), producing 67,826 drill chip 
samples, have been analysed, taken at 2m intervals down the drill hole, and this sampling 
was from top to bottom of the drill hole. Sample weights of 3-5kg were sent to the 
laboratories for standard Fe suite analysis.
Laboratories used for this work have been Ultra Trace and Bureau Veritas. Diamond core 
drill holes have not been systematically assayed, instead being subject to bulk sample 
metallurgical test work.
23,438 DTR assay samples made from 2m and 4m composites of the 2m RC chip samples 
in the magnetite mineralisation zones have been used in the model. DTR (Davis Tube 
Recovery) analysis was carried out using the Povey method, with grinding to a nominal -53 
micron grind size with p80 of 35 microns, and concentrates and tails were assayed by XRF 
to establish elemental abundances and metal concentrations.
DTR assay work was conducted at Spectrolab in Geraldton, and Bureau Veritas in Perth 
(approximately 78% of samples).
The 2m RC samples were dried and crushed to 3.35mm and sub-sampled with one 150g 
sub-sample used for standard XRF sample on the 2m interval, and a second 150g sub-
sample taken and composited with an adjacent sample for DTR analysis and controlled 
Povey method pulsed pulverising to a nominal p100 of 53 microns for DTR and sizing 
analysis.
Rig duplicates and Industry lab standards were included in each sample submission for 
checking lab and rig sampling QAQC. Results for standards and duplicates are analysed 
using acQuire software and proprietary statistical software programs, for precision and 
accuracy checks of laboratory processes and possible sampling bias.
Samples outside of acceptable tolerances are rejected, and rig duplicates which are highly 
variable are re-assayed and where the variability is unacceptable the entire batch may be 
rejected.
A number of metallurgical samples were taken from DD core for analysis of rock properties 
and comminution characteristics.
RC drilling was carried out using Schramm T685W drill rigs with boosted high pressure air 
capacity to maximize sample quality and recovery. McKay Drilling Pty Ltd have been 
contracted to carry out the RC Drilling. The drill hole diameter is approximately 140mm, 
and uses standard facing sampling hammer. Holes were drilled according to target and 
were drilled with azimuth 090 or 270, and dip -60, and for shallower infill pit drilling vertical 
holes were drilled.
PQ3 Diamond drilling (DD) was also carried out for metallurgical sampling and 
geotechnical investigation and Core Drilling Services have been used for diamond drilling 
work using a UDR 200 rig.
These drill holes were orientated according to target and all core was drilled with some 
degree of dip and has been orientated by site geologists and geologically logged and 
structurally/geotechnically logged prior to being used for metallurgical test work.
RC sampling is monitored by rig geologists at all times, and sample logging includes an 
estimate of chip percentage as a measure of sample return and quality, and the amount of 
sample recovered for each 2m of drilling is also assessed for significant variations in 
sample quantity.
Any large fluctuations in sample quantity is discussed with the drillers and continuously 
monitored.
Rig duplicates are used to assess any sample bias which may results from rig sampling 
methods. Results of duplicate assays show some variation in elemental abundance 
between primary and duplicates samples, but the variability is random and cannot be 
attributed to rig sampling methods.

Logging
Samples with high variance are rejected from the database if the variance is limited to a 
minor number of elements, and the entire batch maybe rejected if the rig duplicate results 
are outside of acceptable limits. Where this occurs the lab is requested to re-analyse the 
samples.
RC drilling is carried out with the use of boosted high pressure air to maximise sample 
quality and quantity.
Analysis of sample duplicates shows that sample size is not a factor in assay quality.
Diamond core is logged by geologists and the recovery of core recorded.
Trained geologists with experience in iron ore and magnetite mineralisation have been 
employed to perform the geological logging of RC chip samples. Geological logs are 
recorded for each 2m sample interval.
Logging is both quantitative and qualitative with measurement of mineral and lithological 
abundances, as well as recording physical properties of grain size and shape, recovery, 
moisture level, and some general properties derived from rig performance (hard slow 
drilling, easy drilling, difficult sampling due to clay etc.).
Sub-sampling 
techniques and 
sample preparation
Diamond core is not used for systematic sample assay, but is used for metallurgical test 
work including DTR and ore processing test work, as well as comminution and rock 
property characterisation.
RC sampling is carried out using cone splitters on the rig. Two samples are taken for each 
2m of drilling, one is dedicated to assay work and one is reserved if required for QAQC or 
additional test work.
Sample size is monitored by rig geologists for inconsistency, as is cyclone cleaning and 
sampling by drill crews.
Samples collected from the cone splitter are equivalent to approximately 6-7% of the total 
sample for each 2m interval. Cone splitters are the preferred rig sampling splitter and 
provide a good quality sample in both dry and wet. Drilling is generally dry with very little 
ground water encountered, and only sufficient water for dust suppression is injected in 
drilling.
All RC samples were assayed at either Ultra Trace or Bureau Veritas (with Ultra Trace 
doing the actual XRF analysis), and these are NATA accredited laboratories. Fortescue 
carries out blind audits of all laboratories for comparison of assay results, and Ultra Trace 
has demonstrated acceptable results in these tests.
Both a standard and extended Fe suite has been used, with the extended suite used in 
post 2012 sample assays.
The following elements have been assayed and are recorded within the block model: Fe, 
SiO2, Al2O3, P, MnO/Mn, MgO, CaO, TiO2, Na2O, S, K2O, As, Ba, Cl, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, 
Sn, Sr, V, Zn, Zr, FeO, Satmagan/magnasat (Fe3O4), and three LOI’s at 371, 650 and 
1000°C, plus total LOI.
DTR concentrate and tails samples collected from Davis Tube process, and then assayed 
using XRF, and reported analyses include all of the above listed elements for each of 
concentrate grades and tailings grades.
Concentrate grades are not available from low grade areas where there is insufficient 
sample recovered during the DTR for XRF analysis. Additional data reported for DTR 
assays includes, concentrate grade (weight%) tails grade (weight%), sizing analyses, p100 
weights for each pass of pulverizing, as well as the overall p80 sizing
Rig duplicates are taken every 30 samples, and a laboratory standard or FMG coarse 
reference standard is included for each sample batch (approximately 1 per 100 samples).
Each laboratory also carries out internal checks and sample assays, including the use of 
standards. Results for these standards and duplicates are statistically validated as part of 
the QAQC of assay results.
Early drilling at both North Star and Glacier Valley not did have systematic DTR sampling 
composites analysed. A measure of DTR recovery or mass recovery is calculated for these 
intervals based on magnetic susceptibility measurements and satmagan assay values, to 
infill where DTR assay data is not available.

Verification of 
sampling and 
assaying
The DTR MagSus relationship has been updated with additional data as part of the 2015 
Mineral Resource Estimate.
Drill logging is validated against assay data and geophysical signals to verify intersections 
and interpretations by site geologists. Senior geologists then review the intersections and 
drilling in cross-section and 3D to verify targets and drilling effectiveness.
DD holes are used as twin holes across the mineralisation to verify geological logging, and 
provide samples for petrographic and XRD work for mineral identification, and 
mineralisation characteristics.
Data is logged into Toughbooks on the rig then directly loaded into an acQuire database to 
avoid transcription error.
There is no adjustment to assay data.
Location of data 
points
Down Under Surveys (DUS) or Survey Group Pty Ltd were commissioned to pick up all drill 
collars to DGPS accuracy of 3cm Easting and Northing, and 5cm in elevation.
Coordinates are given in Map Grid Australia format (GDA94) and heights are given in 
Australian Height Datum. The area lies within UTM Zone 50.
Drill holes with a down hole gyro survey using gyro-smart tools has been carried out by 
DUS and Pilbara Wireline Services, to verify dip and azimuth of drilled holes.
Data spacing and 
distribution
Drill hole spacing for the Mineral Resource Estimate varies from 35m x 35m in the Stage 1 
mining area of North Star, to 50m x 50m in the remainder of the central part of North Star.
In the north of North Star drill spacing is 200m x 100m to 400m x 50m.
In the south of North Star drill spacing is 200m x 100m.
In Eastern Limb, drill; spacing varies from 100m x 50m in a limited area to typically 200m x 
100m, with some areas of 400m x 100m.
In Glacier Valley, drill; spacing varies from 50m x 50m in a limited area to typically 200m x 
100m, with some areas of 400m x 100m.
In West Star, drill spacing are nominally 100 m spaced holes along lines separated 200 to 
300 metres apart.
The Mineral Resource Estimate includes material in the Measured, Indicated and Inferred 
categories and the classification is considered to reflect the confidence in the continuity of 
geology and mineralisation.
2m drill hole samples have been composited to 4m for DTR analysis.
The structure of the mineralisation is sub-vertical with an overall dip to the west of 70-80o 
and drill holes have been drilled at angles (-60°) which allow transection through the strata 
even at low angles to reduce the risk of bias.
Check drilling in opposite directions is carried out to ensure there is a comparison of cross 
strata variability to assess any potential sampling bias. Analyses of drill core structures is 
also carried out to assess the attitude of the geological units to guard against significant 
down hole sample bias.
Sampling and sample security is in accordance with FMG standard procedures. Samples 
are delivered from site to Linfox distribution Centre for dispatch to the assay laboratory, and 
samples are tracked during this process.
Sample tracking is based on sample ID and this is monitored from drill site to laboratory via 
the acQuire database.  Upon receipt of a sample dispatch at the laboratory, a sample 
quality check and inventory check is carried out and any missing or damaged samples is 
communicated and this is then investigated and reconciled  prior to sample processing.

There is no material data from other parties used in this resource estimation.
Predominantly the mineralisation lies within the Pincunah Member, which is part of the 
Soanesville Group, which is part of the Pilbara Super Group in the East Pilbara Terrane.
Regionally the rock sequence is dominated by mafic to andesitic volcanics and 
volcaniclastics, BIF’s and terrigenous clastic sequences intruded by Archaean granitoids. In 
the project area the rocks have been tightly folded, having a general strike of north-south 
with a steep sub-vertical dip.
The main zones of mineralisation at North Star, West Star and Glacier Valley is the 
Pincunah Member, which is comprised of sedimentary BIF with magnetite mineralisation, 
and which   dips steeply to the west overall at approximately 70-80o.
The lithologies of the BIF sequences show a significant siderite and stilpnomelane 
component, along with the chert and magnetite bands. No asbestiform minerals have been 
detected.

Commentary
RC drilling data is recorded on Toughbooks with project specific logging templates which 
capture the data in an acQuire database.
Validation of logging is carried out by programs within the acQuire database, and a 
database administrator is employed to ensure that data is managed properly.
Validation of logging in relation to cross sections and assays is carried out when all data 
has been received, and adjustments/corrections are made when required.
Assay data is checked for QAQC within the acQuire database to ensure that rig duplicates 
and lab standards are within acceptable certification tolerances. Anomalous assay results 
are also visually checked against geological sections.

Site visits
The Competent Person has conducted a site visit, which included a review of the overall 
site and outcrops.
RC and DD hole locations were visited and drilling activities viewed.
Diamond core logging was reviewed on site and found to be competent.
RC cuttings were viewed on the ground and found to be consistent with assaying and 
logging.
The Competent Person has confirmed that all geological, logging work etc. is carried out to 
a standard that will ensure the appropriate level if confidence in the resulting data and 
Mineral Resource Estimate.
The geological interpretation has been developed over several years, and this model has 
been independently evaluated, and the geological interpretation has been shown to be 
robust and consistent between all models.
An Indicator Modelling method has been applied to provide an alternative domain 
definition, particularly in the hangingwall and footwall zones, which are difficult to interpret 
manually.
The DTR composite data has been used to define indicators (Zero/one values) at a grade 
threshold of 5% DTR, to represent the broad magnetite mineralisation envelope, and 20% 
DTR to represent the core, or higher grade material.
This methodology has confirmed and agrees with existing geological models of geology 
and mineralisation, both in area where a clear magnetite core occurs and in areas of 
thinner bands of alternating mineralised and unmineralised material.
Logging of weathering and geochemistry have been used to define sub-horizontal Oxide 
domain, with Fresh material below.
North Star comprises three distinct mineralisation style areas, North, Central and South, 
which are separated by assumed fault zones.
The Northern part of North Star extends approximately 2.4 km in strike length, 200m to 
400m across strike and has been modelled to a vertical depth of approximately 600m.
The Central part of North Star extends approximately 1.9 km in strike length, 400m across 
strike and has been modelled to a vertical depth of approximately 600m.
The Southern part of North Star extends approximately 1 km in strike length, 200m across 
strike and has been modelled to a vertical depth of approximately 600m.
Eastern Limb extends approximately 2.5km in strike length, 200m to 300m across strike 
and has been modelled to a vertical depth of approximately 400m.
Glacier Valley extends approximately 3.4 km in strike length, 200m to 300m across strike 
and has been modelled to a vertical depth of approximately 600m.
West Star is approximately 3.5 km in strike length overall, of which 1.8 km strike length has 
been modelled. The mineralisation is typically 150m to 200m across strike and has been 
limited to a depth extent of approximately 200m.
DTR is sampled on a 4m composite basis. Assay data has been composited to 4m.

Commentary
Initial statistical analysis was carried out on a range DTR Indicators to provide geostatistical 
parameters for DTR Indicator domain modelling.
Composite data was flagged with these domains and further statistical analysis was carried 
out to confirm the validity of these domains.
Geostatistical analysis was carried out on a domain basis, and generally produced robust 
variograms with a low nugget effect and long ranges along strike. Short ranges were 
generally observed across the mineralised structures. Down dip variograms were less 
robust largely due to vertical and high-angle drilling and the sub-vertical nature of the 
mineralisation.
Variograms were in all cases sufficient to define kriging parameters for the Ordinary Kriging 
process used in generation of the block model.
Search ellipse orientations for the estimation are based on a combination of variography 
and drill spacing. An unfolding methodology based on the geological interpretation was 
used to account for variations in dip and strike.
Search ellipse dimensions varied depending on drill hole spacing were related to 
anisotropy observed in the variography.
A multiple search pass strategy was adopted, whereby the search was expanded if a first 
search failed to find enough samples to estimate blocks. In the first search pass, a 
minimum of eight composites and two drill holes was required to estimate a block, with 
relaxed parameters in the expanded second search.
Only data in each mineralised indicator domain was used to estimate that domain.
Analysis of the correlation of DTR with Magnetic Susceptibility (MagSus) data was carried 
out to develop a linear regression to convert MagSus to a DTR equivalent where no DTR 
data is available.
No top cuts were applied.
No assumptions were made about modelling of selective mining units.
Mass Recovery (a combination of DTR and regressed MagSus) is the primary variable 
estimated within the domains defined by the DTR Indicator.
The standard suite of iron ore XRF analyses has also been estimated as in-situ head 
grades.
In addition, the DTR composite data set has been used to estimate recovered concentrate 
grades for the same suite of analyses.
Parent block size varied depending on drill hole spacing.
Oxide domain 35m x35m spacing : 10m x 12.5m x 3m blocks (East, North, RL)
Measured and Indicated (Fresh) domains: 10m x 25m x 12m
Inferred (Fresh) domains: 20m x 50m x 12m
Modelling results have been compared to the previously published (2012) resource 
estimates and have produced lower tonnages but higher DTR grades. This is due to the 
exclusion of poorly-informed low grade material in the hangingwall and footwall and to 
improved variography resulting in smaller searches and less grade smoothing.
Validation of the final resource has been carried out in a number of ways, including:
Drill Hole Section Comparison
Comparison by Mineralisation Zone
Swathe Plot Validation
Model versus Declustered Composites by Domain
All modes of validation have produced acceptable results.
As there has been no mining of ore material to date, no reconciliation data is available.
Tonnages are estimated on a dry basis.
The DTR cutoff grade used for Mineral Resource Reporting (currently 9% DTR) was 
determined by Whittle optimisation of the previous Resource Model, based on the V3 
Feasibility study.

Independent assessment has been carried out by several joint venture partner 
organisations. Parameters and costs are also derived from FMG operational data and costs 
from existing operations within the Pilbara Region.
Metallurgical test work and variability sampling for grade recovery and comminution work 
has been carried out at several different laboratories as well as independently by Joint 
Venture partners and product manufacturers and suppliers.
Industry standard DTR sampling has been used as the basis for the Mineral Resource 
Estimate.
Where DTR is not available, a regression based on DTR versus Magnetic Susceptibility 
has been used.
Recovered concentrate grades have been estimated based on DTR results.
Additional metallurgical test-work is planned to further define metallurgical parameters.
Approval for Stage 1 Mining of the North Star deposit has been granted. DMP have 
approved processing of the magnetite ores on site at North Star for an initial Stage 1 
Mining operation, 10Mt per annum operation for dry mining and processing. Application has 
been made for wet processing, and is expected to be approved in the near future.
Primary approvals for Iron Bridge North Star Magnetite project (also known as stage 2) are 
complete. This includes EPA part IV assessment, with approval given from both State and 
Federal governments. Secondary approvals will be granted before stage 2 mining 
progresses. These include detailed mining proposals, mine closure plan, works approvals, 
water extraction, port approvals, dangerous goods, aboriginal heritage and local 
government.
The bulk density has been estimated in the Mineral Resource model using down hole 
geophysical data where the density of data is suitable.  Outside of these higher confidence 
areas, default values were given aligned to rock type.
A correlation study between down hole geophysics and physical density (diamond core) 
measurements before assigning default values.
Downhole geophysical density measurements are calibrated to caliper measurements of 
hole diameter to ensure the impact of cavities and other hole irregularities on the calculated 
density measurement are taken into account.
Bulk density default values used in the Mineral Resource Estimate are considered to be 
dry, and are given values according to deposit area and specific rock type as summarised;
Oxide ore 2.7 to 3.0 t/m3. 
Oxide waste 1.9 to 2.8 t/m3. 
Fresh ore 3.2 to 3.5 t/m3. 
Fresh waste 2.7 to 3.1 t/m3.
The Mineral Resource has been classified in the Measured, Indicated and Inferred 
categories, in accordance with the 2012 Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC Code).
A range of criteria has been considered in determining this classification including:
Geological continuity. 
Data quality. 
Drill hole spacing. 
Modelling techniques. 
Estimation properties including search strategy, number of informing data, average 
distance of data from blocks and kriging output from the interpolation.
Measured Resources have no extrapolation and are in areas with a maximum of 50m by 
50m drill spacing.
Criteria
Commentary
Indicated Resources have a limited amount of extrapolation, based on geostatistical and 
geological continuity as observed in the data, and generally have a maximum drill spacing 
of 100m x 200m.
The limit of extrapolation of the Inferred classification in the more widely spaced areas of 
the deposits has been determined after review of continuity in closer spaced drilled areas 
and areas with deep drilling.
The Mineral Resource Classification reflects the views of the Competent Person.
Audits or reviews
No independent audits or reviews have been carried out.
An internal audit of Resources has been carried out by the FMG Resource estimation team 
and has found the consultant report to be acceptable.
Discussion of 
relative accuracy/ 
confidence
Calculated accuracy and confidence in the Mineral Resource Estimate are not explicitly 
stated. However, relative accuracy is reflected in the resource classification, based on 
relative kriging variance output from the estimation algorithms.
A subjective qualitative risk analysis assessment has also been carried out, with the overall 
risk level varying from Low to High according to the resource classification. Overall the risk 
is considered to be Moderate.
The Measured and Indicated components of the Mineral Resource Estimate are considered 
to represent a local estimate as there is reasonable confidence in the location of 
mineralisation and waste domains.
Inferred components of the Mineral Resource Estimate are considered to be global in that 
there is less certainty, particularly at depth, of the precise nature and location of the 
mineralisation.
No production data is yet available for comparison.

form and context in which it appears.
Iron Bridge Magnetite Ore Reserves Reporting
as at June 30th, 2016
Magnetite Ore Reserves 
Iron Bridge Ore Reserves are based on the onsite processing of fresh magnetite mineralised material into a 
saleable concentrate product that is pumped by slurry pipeline to port.
The following supporting data addresses the Ore Reserve generation process used for the North Star 
deposit.  The surrounding deposits of Eastern Limb, Glacier Valley and West Star have not been 
considered for this estimation.
Mining Model 
The in-situ deposit Resource model is the basis for the mining model used for Ore Reserves reporting.
Regularisation is used to incorporate mining losses and dilution into the in-situ Resource model and create 
a mining model that simulates the predicted concentrate product.  Grades and other block attributes are 
regularised into 10 m x 25 m x 12 m blocks to simulate a selective mining block (SMU).  The regularisation 
process employed combines sub-cells used to define boundaries into a regular model.
Scheduling Inventory 
Pit optimisation software is used to determine the pit geometry that provides the highest value for a deposit 
considering parameters such as slope angles, mining, processing and selling costs, cut-off grades (mass 
recovery), product prices and plant recoveries.
A combination of incremental value, physical operating constraints and strip ratios are then used to identify 
the geometry of mining cutbacks inside the final selected pit.
Mine Scheduling 
Mine scheduling aims to maximise value and maintain targeted ore quality.  In general terms this equates 
to deferring higher strip ratio, higher cost mineralisation until later in the collective scheduled mine life.
Concentrate produced at North Star is pumped to port through a slurry pipeline.
A commercial linear programming software package is used to model the mining sequence, the Ore 
Processing Facility (OPF) and different ore feeds to maximise Net Present Value (NPV) for the nominated 
parameters and constraints.  Major constraints include the nominated concentrate product tonnage and 
grade specifications, matched to the logistics capacity of the slurry pipeline and port.  The material 
selection to satisfy processing requirements is based on a cut-off grade (mass recovery) ore definition, 
derived from mining, processing and selling costs.
Pre-defined grade bins by rock type, mass recovery and resource classification are created to track 
weathering and mass recovery by grade-based blending.  This simplifies the scheduling and allows 
selective stockpiling and reclaiming of targeted quality material at different periods throughout a mine’s life 
to meet shorter term blending requirements.  Since mineralisation distributions and presentation will vary 
with time, so too may the shorter term effective ore cut-off grade.  The Ore Reserve cut-off can be 
approximated by a mass recovery cut-off that closely reproduces that portion of the scheduling inventory 
that is converted into specification product over the life of the Ore Reserve schedule.
Financial Analysis 
The scheduling programme includes revenue and cost information to maximise NPV.  The schedule 
software assesses the value generated by each block to determine whether the block is fed directly to the
plant, stockpiled or treated as waste.  Further financial analysis to determine more realistic absolute 
financial indicators and sensitivity analysis are performed separately using the tonnes and grades extracted 
from the schedule.

Commentary
The Mineral Resource model for the Iron Bridge Project was developed by 
Widenbar Associates and audited by the FMG internal Resource Definition team.
The Mineral Resource Model used for Ore Reserves was that as used for the 
JORC-2012 Mineral Resource Release current as at 30 June 2015.
Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of Ore Reserves.
A site visit by the competent person has not been undertaken as no notable 
mining activities have been undertaken at site since the previous visit by Mr Iain 
Cooper a former Golder employee (CP for 2015).
A pre-feasibility study was completed in April 2015.
The processing costs and recoveries were supplied by FMGL.  Mining costs were 
based on cost modelling completed by Golder for earlier studies.  Cut-off grades 
used in the study are:
Stage 1 Plant Fresh – 9% Mass Recovery
Stage 2 Plant Fresh – 9% Mass Recovery
Calculated cut-off grades are marginally lower.
Mining factors or 
assumptions
The Resource model was generated in February 2015 and regularised to 
10 m × 25 m × 12 m.  No further regularisation has been carried out.
The ore bodies planned to be mined in this study are bulk deposits and while 
some ore loss and dilution may occur along the edges, this edge dilution is not 
considered significant and has been accounted for in the regularisation process.  
No additional dilution has been included.
The Ore Reserves are reported within a pit design which is based on open pit 
optimisation.  The optimisation was carried out including Measured and Indicated 
Mineral Resource categories.
The mining recovery factor used was 100%.  This is accounted for in the 
regularisation process.
The optimisation used a Platts reference price of US$72 per dry metric tonne of 
iron ore concentrate at 62% Fe.
The geotechnical parameters used in pit design are based on a Feasibility Study 
developed by Golder (2014).
The stage cutbacks were around 150 m with the minimum practical mining width 
of 40 m.
The Inferred material was considered as waste in the optimisation process but 
included in Life of Mine schedule.  There is ongoing drilling to upgrade the 
Inferred material.
This is a standard truck and shovel iron ore operation located in the Pilbara 
region of Western Australia.
Magnetite concentrate product will be transported through a slurry pipeline 
between Iron Bridge and Port Hedland.
The technology being utilised is all existing proven technology.  The flowsheet 
does represent a departure from previous conventional norms however the dry 
cyclone technology around the HPGR’s is well proven in the cement clinker 
industry.
The Iron Bridge North Star flow sheet differs from conventional magnetite flow 
sheets in that dry cycloning is used around the HPGR’s and no ball mill is 
included in the flowsheet.  In these respects, the flowsheet proposed is both 
novel and different.
There are three HPGR’s and air classifiers with a cut point of 140 microns.  This 
is unconventional but it overcomes the problem with moisture in wet screen
Metallurgical factors 
or assumptions
oversize returns to the HPGR.  While this causes problems with the HPGR’s dust, 
FMGL have included bag houses to capture fine dust.
A pilot plant is operating on site and vendor testwork has been undertaken to 
support the flow sheet unit operations.
The testwork has been independently audited and the results of which showed:
Extensive geometallurgical testwork
Mineralogical characterisation
Carefully selected representative metallurgical holes
Extensive metallurgical comminution testwork, Davis tube recovery testwork, 
batch and pilot testwork
Extensive vendor testwork
Site based pilot plant
Variability testwork
Tunra bulk solids testwork.
A geometallurgical model is being developed using cluster analysis to assist with 
domaining and mineralogy.  The geometallurgical model while still being 
developed, mineralogy is incorporated into the modifying factors where available.
The assaying includes a large suite of deleterious elements.
North Star Stages 1 and 2 have been subject to extensive Environmental 
baseline studies and had Environmental Impact Statements prepared and 
assessed by the Environmental Protection Authority (Western Australia) and the 
Department of Environment (Commonwealth).  Stage 1 received Commonwealth 
Approval on 14 June 2013 following a decision by the Environmental Protection 
Authority not to assess the Project on 6 August 2012.
Stage 2 of the Project was assessed under a bilateral agreement between the 
State and Commonwealth at a Public Environmental Review level.  State 
approval was granted on 9 January 2015, followed by Commonwealth approval 
on 6 February 2015.  Construction of the open cut mine and associated waste 
and tailings landforms are subject to assessment and approval by the 
Department of Mines and Petroleum.  To date, the Stage 1 open cut mine, 
temporary waste rock landform, dry tailings landform and wet tailings storage 
facility have all been assessed via Mining Proposals and approved for 
construction.  Further amendments to the mine including transition to Stage 2 will 
be subject to future assessment and approval.
The North Star site has been subject to preliminary Acid and Metalliferous 
Drainage (AMD) assessment using desktop review as well as laboratory static 
and kinetic testwork.
The project is expected to intersect Potentially Acid Forming (PAF) material, and 
further assessment by Golder Associates including the development of a detailed 
Sample and Analysis Plan and preparation of a detailed Geochemical 
Characterisation and AMD Assessment report has been completed.  To support 
this, approximately 150 samples of waste rock were analysed at a laboratory in 
Q2 2015.  Results of this round of analysis have assisted in increasing knowledge 
of potential for AMD at North Star including the development of an AMD model.  
Further work to better understand the potentially acid generating and acid 
neutralising components within the waste rock is planned.  A field kinetic trial is 
underway to address sample representivity.  This work will improve the overall 
AMD knowledge and allow for the planning of detailed AMD handling.
The site is located approximately 120 km south of Port Hedland and 45 km to the 
east of Great Northern Highway.  Access to the mine site will be via a dedicated 
mine site access road that connects to the Great Northern Highway.  This will 
enable access for construction and ongoing support to the mining and processing 
operations.
The mine will be operated on a fly in fly out basis with personnel flying into a 
dedicated air strip 15 km from the North Star mine site and 12 km from the 
village.  Personnel will be bussed between the air strip and the village.
Environmental
Infrastructure
The existing Japal village will be upgraded as part of the project to house the 
peak construction and on-going mine operations.  The village will consist of all of 
the appropriate facilities including dry and wet mess, gym and other lifestyle 
facilities for operational personnel.
All traffic to the North Star site must pass through the Gatehouse to gain access 
to the North Star mine, Stage 1 and Stage 2 process plants.  The gatehouse area 
also includes the first aid and emergency response buildings.  This is due to its 
close proximity to access points to all of the North Star operations including plant, 
mine and village.
As the North Star site is located within mountainous terrain the location for the 
Stage 2 processing plant has been carefully chosen to minimise earthworks and 
haul distance from the mine.  All of the required infrastructure for both the 
processing plant and mining ancillary items have been combined into an area 
adjacent to the processing plant giving the ability to combine services and reduce 
earthworks.
The plant infrastructure area includes the following mining and plant infrastructure 
to enable support to both the mining and processing plant operations.
  Main Administration Building and associated Crib Rooms and Ablutions
  Control Room
  Communications Room
  Laboratory
  HV/Drill/LV Workshops & Warehouse
  HV Workshop Office, Crib Room and Ablutions
  Lube Station
  HV Go Line
  Tyre Workshop
  HV Refuelling
  LV Refuelling
  HV Washdown
  LV Washdown
  Diesel Fuel Facility
  Water Treatment Facilities
  Fixed Plant Workshop
  Welding Workshop
  Main Warehouse
It is intended to supply power from Port Hedland via a dedicated power 
transmission line to a switch yard located at the plant infrastructure area.
Concentrate from the processing plant will be conveyed via an above ground 
overland pipeline.  The pipeline will follow the mine site access road and then the 
FMG rail to the Port where it will enter the North Star dewatering facility.
Projected capital and operating costs for mining have been developed based on 
production schedules over a period of more than 20 years to achieve an annual 
production rate of:
  1.3 to 1.6 Mtpa of product from the Stage 1 plant; and
  8.5 Mtpa of product from the Stage 2 plant.
Estimation of the production rates and operating costs has been developed from 
first principles.  Capital and operating costs are based on vendors quotes
Costs
Costs include allowances for mining, administration, pumping slurry to the port 
and shipping.
All costs and revenues are in AUD.
An exchange rate of US$0.75:AU$1.00 has been applied.
Royalties of 5% have been applied.
The Iron Ore Price Forecast has been based on a combined CFR forecast from 
three leading pricing analytics groups, resulting in a base 62% Fe Platts 
reference price of US$72 per dry metric tonne.
Revenue is based on a concentrate grade of 62% Fe with a Platts reference price 
of US$72/t concentrate and a premium of US$3.50 and US$1.16 per additional 
1% Fe above 62% Fe.
The main product is magnetite slurry which will be pumped via a slurry pipeline to 
Port Hedland where it will be shipped by sea to customers expected to be mainly 
in China.
The primary market is for a premium grade magnetite concentrate.
The project economic evaluation was based on a technical and economic model 
for the operation up to the final product to be transported by slurry pipeline and 
shipped at Port Hedland.
The project is sensitive to the iron ore price, however follow-up long term 
forecasting by independent forecasters indicate that the price realised in 
Australian dollars is unchanged.
The North Star mine is located on Unallocated Crown Land managed by the 
State.  Other Project infrastructure including the camp, Stage 2 process plant, 
access roads and proposed infrastructure corridors are located on pastoral 
leases.  Negotiations with the lease holders, including holders of titles granted 
under the Mining Act are underway to ensure project tenure can be granted and 
infrastructure constructed.
The North Star Stage 1 is located on land subject to Native Title claims by the 
Karriyarra and Njamal people.  Native Title Agreements have been struck with 
both groups.
All Stage 1 and 2 project infrastructure footprints have been subject to Heritage 
(ethnographic and archaeological) survey carried out in consultation with the 
relevant Native Title group.
The Western Australian Department of Environmental Regulation (DER) 
administer Part V of the Environmental Protection Act and issue Works Approvals 
and Operating Licences for the construction and operation of prescribed 
premises.  North Star Stage 1 has sought and has in place appropriate Part V 
licences for the OPF, TSF and WWTP.  Further Part V licences will be sought for 
Stage 2 infrastructure as required.
All necessary Ministerial approvals for the construction and operation of Stages 1 
and 2 of the North Star Project have been sought and secured.  The construction 
of a concentrate filtration facility at Anderson Point to allow for the dewatering and 
stockpiling of magnetite concentrate may be subject to further environmental 
impact assessment and approval at State and Commonwealth level, and these 
negotiations with the relevant regulatory agencies are currently underway. 
Construction of the airport requires amendment to the existing State Ministerial 
approval, and this amendment is currently under assessment by the Office of the 
EPA.
No approvals have been sought for the development of the Glacier Valley, South 
Star or West Star deposits, and these areas have not yet been subject to 
environmental baseline studies.
Approval for the North Star Stage 2 project is subject to conditions imposed by 
the Minister for Environment.  Several of these conditions restrict the 
commencement of ground disturbing activities until certain surveys and studies 
have been conducted.  All necessary surveys are now complete, and the majority 
of required studies are with the Office of the EPA for review and approval.
Revenue factors
Market assessment
Economic
Social
Other
Mining within 150m of the Pilbara Leaf Nosed Bat (PLnB) roost cave identified as 
Cave 13 is prohibited by the current Stage 2 Ministerial Approval until such time 
as the Minister considers that the population of PLnB at North Star is not reliant 
on the cave (they have either relocated, or another population has been 
established in another suitable cave).
Finalisation of engineering design for critical pipeline infrastructure to allow the 
transport of magnetite concentrate to export facilities in Port Hedland is yet to be 
concluded, and as such the application for tenure has not been submitted for 
assessment and approval.
None of the above is expected to have a material impact on the development 
schedule for North Star Stage 2, as plans have been developed and action 
underway to address each of the points identified.
There is Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources within the model.  The 
Measured and Indicated Resources within the designed pits have been converted 
to Probable Ore Reserves.
Classification
Audits or reviews
No external audits of the Ore Reserves have been performed.
Discussion of 
relative 
accuracy/confidence
An internal audit of Ore Reserves was conducted by FMG in Q2 2016.  No fatal 
flaws contingent with the level of study (pre-feasibility standard) were identified 
with the Ore Reserves Estimation process during this audit.
A metallurgical due diligence was been completed by METS on 2 April 2015.
The study on which the Ore Reserves are based has been completed to a pre-
feasibility standard; Pit designs are based on Whittle optimisations.  The cost 
model is based on a life of mine schedule which has been developed using 
MineMax Scheduler.  Costs have been developed from first principles and 
industry standards.
All modifying factors have been applied to designed mining shapes on a global 
scale.
