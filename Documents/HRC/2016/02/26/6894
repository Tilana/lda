<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.<footnote name="5">. Turkey is a unitary republic with a political system based on pluralist democracy.  
Legislative power is vested in the unicameral parliament, the Turkish Grand National Assembly, 
whose members are elected through universal suffrage.  The executive branch is led by the 
Prime Minister, who is designated by the President of the Republic and is customarily the leader 
of the largest party in the Assembly.  The Turkish Grand National Assembly elects the President 
of the Republic, who serves a single seven-year term. </footnote>

</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention visited Turkey from 9 to 20 October 2006 at 
the invitation of the Government.  In the course of the visit, the Working Group met with the 
relevant authorities in the executive and judicial branches, with representatives of civil society 
and non-governmental organizations.  It visited seven prisons, as well as police stations, 
migration holding facilities and a psychiatric hospital, and interviewed in private more than 
200 detainees, a few of them previously identified, but most chosen at random while at the 
facility. 
</p>
<p> The report sets forth basic notions about the institutions and norms governing deprivation 
of liberty in Turkey.  The Working Group observes that both the criminal justice system and the 
penitentiary system in Turkey are well organized, well administered and well funded.  Since the 
beginning of the 1990s, the law governing detention in the criminal procedure has undergone a 
profound reform process, culminating in the entry into force of new criminal and criminal 
procedure laws in June 2005.  The report highlights progress, particularly in the fight against 
coerced confessions, in the shortening of the duration of police custody, in the introduction of 
limits on the duration of pretrial detention, and in the guarantee of the immediate right of access 
to a lawyer of all persons detained in the criminal process.  The Working Group also welcomes 
the reform of the juvenile justice system. 
 The report expresses concern, however, with regard to the prosecution, trial and detention 
of terrorism suspects, in which the principles underlying the reform process find it difficult to 
gain a foothold.  The definition of terrorism is overly broad and does not require that a terrorist 
offender must have committed a serious violent crime.  As a consequence, terrorism charges can 
be used to restrict the non-violent exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, association and 
assembly.  On the procedural side, in proceedings concerning terrorism suspects the law restricts 
the right of access to counsel.  The Working Group found numerous persons accused of 
terrorism held in remand detention for unacceptably long periods, in some cases more than 
10 years, without having been judged.  The detainee convicted on terrorism charges faces 
disproportionately harsh rules governing execution and access to benefits, particularly 
conditional release.  The report stresses that the overly broad definition of terrorism and the large 
number of persons detained under the anti-terror law aggravate the concerns about procedure and 
detention. 
</p>
<p> With regard to proceedings both in terrorism and in common criminality cases, the 
Working Group criticizes the failure to apply the ban on statements made in police custody in the 
absence of a lawyer to such statements made prior to the entry into force of the new criminal 
procedure code.  It also expresses concern with regard to the vulnerability of non-Turkish 
detainees and to problems in the juvenile justice system that persist despite the reform. 
 The report further discusses deprivation of liberty outside the criminal justice system. 
Turkey lacks a sufficient legal basis for the detention of migrants and rejected asylum-seekers 
pending expulsion, and their right to judicial review of such detention is violated.  The Working 
Group also notes weaknesses in the legal basis for and judicial control over deprivation of liberty 
in psychiatric hospitals and other institutions where persons are held for their own protection. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p> The final section of the report contains the Working Group&#8217;s recommendations to the 
Government on the basis of its findings.  These include amending the definition of terrorism, 
releasing detainees held on remand for more than 10 years without judgement, and making the 
ban on statements obtained by the police from the accused in the absence of a lawyer applicable 
to all pending proceedings.  Further recommendations concerning criminal justice address the 
full implementation of the recently enacted juvenile justice system.  As for detention outside the 
criminal justice system, the Working Group asks the Government to take legislative and 
administrative measures to ensure that detention is grounded in a sufficient legal framework and 
is subject to periodic review by a judicial body. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which was established pursuant to 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1991/42 and whose mandate was assumed by the 
Human Rights Council by its decision 1/102, visited Turkey from 9 to 20 October 2006 at the 
invitation of the Government.  The delegation consisted of Ms. Le&#239;la Zerrougui, 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group and head of the delegation, and Ms. Manuela 
Carmena Castrillo, member of the Working Group.  The delegation was accompanied by the 
Secretary of the Working Group, an official from the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, and two interpreters. 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group would like to express its gratitude to the Government of Turkey, as 
well as to the United Nations Country Team, which assisted with the logistics of the visit, and to 
the Turkish civil society representatives with whom it met. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  PROGRAMME OF THE VISIT 
</b></p>
<p>3. The visit included the capital, Ankara, and the cities of Izmir, Istanbul and Diyarbak&#305;r.  
The Working Group visited male and female high- and medium-security prisons holding 
convicts and remand detainees, a military prison, holding cells of police and gendarmerie 
stations, including holding cells of anti-terror police departments, &#8220;guesthouses&#8221; for foreigners 
awaiting expulsion, a psychiatric hospital and a &#8220;rehabilitation centre&#8221; for persons with mental, 
psychological or physical disabilities.  A full list of the institutions visited is attached as 
appendix I to this report. 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group met with officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of 
Justice and the Ministry of the Interior, including representatives of the National Police and 
Gendarmerie; with representatives of the Directorate for Social Services and Child Protection 
(SH&#199;EK); with judges of the Supreme Court and of trial courts; prosecutors, including judges 
and prosecutors specialized in juvenile justice; and with the Parliamentary Human Rights 
Commission, the Human Rights Presidency in the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office, as well as the 
provincial Human Rights Boards of Izmir and Diyarbak&#305;r.  The delegation also held meetings 
with representatives of civil society, including bar associations, and with numerous individual 
criminal defence lawyers, as well as psychiatrists and social service workers. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Political system 
</b></p>
<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p><b>2.  The judiciary 
</b>6. Judges and prosecutors form a single body of civil servants governed by common rules 
governing admission to service, career, remuneration, oversight and discipline.  During their 
career, members of this body can and do switch from judicial to prosecutorial service and back.  
The Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors share responsibility 
for the administration of the judiciary. 
7. The criminal justice system consists of first instance (trial) courts and the Court of 
Cassation.  There are three tiers of trial courts:  justices of the peace have jurisdiction over 
offences carrying a sentence of less than 2 years, criminal courts (consisting of a single judge) 
adjudicate offences carrying maximum sentences of between 2 and 10 years, and the 
three-judges serious crime courts have jurisdiction over offences carrying a maximum sentence 
in excess of 10 years&#8217; imprisonment.  Defendants accused of offences related to terrorism or 
organized crime are tried before special chambers of the Serious Crime Courts (referred to as 
Serious Crime Courts competent to examine crimes under article 250 of the Criminal Procedure 
Code), which in 2004 replaced the State Security Courts. 
</p>
<p>8. Requests for review of judgements of all first-instance courts go to the Court of 
Cassation.  The establishment of regional appeals courts is, however, planned for 2007. 
</p>
<p>9. The Constitutional Court reviews the compatibility with the Constitution of legislation.  It 
has no jurisdiction to receive individual complaints of violation of rights protected by the 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p>10. There is also a system of military courts with jurisdiction over military personnel, 
including men doing the compulsory military service. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  The prosecution 
</b></p>
<p>11. As already noted, prosecutors operate under the same rules governing career, 
administration, supervision and guarantees of independence as judges.  There are prosecutors 
attached to each judicial body, and in fact a court is defined as consisting of its judges and 
prosecutors. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Law enforcement:  the National Police and the Gendarmerie 
</b></p>
<p>12. Two agencies exercise preventive policing and law enforcement functions:  the National 
Police and the Gendarmerie.  Their functions are identical and competencies are divided between 
the two agencies on a geographic basis:  the National Police operate in cities and towns, while 
the areas under the Gendarmerie&#8217;s responsibility are mostly rural (92 per cent of Turkey&#8217;s 
territory is under the jurisdiction of the Gendarmerie). 
13. The National Police are directly under the authority of the Ministry of the Interior.  The 
Gendarmerie has a dual status:  they are part of the Turkish Armed Forces, but are subordinated 
to the Ministry of the Interior as far as their public order, security and law enforcement functions 
are concerned. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p><b>5.  The penitentiary system 
</b></p>
<p>14. The prisons (with the exception of military prisons) are administered by the General 
Directorate for the Penitentiary System, which is under the authority of the Ministry of Justice.  
Responsibility for the legal aspects of detention in each prison is, however, vested in the local 
Chief Prosecutor, who delegates a prosecutor to each prison. 
</p>
<p>15. Since 1997, the prison infrastructure has undergone a substantial renewal:  
since 1995, 475 new prisons have been established and since 1990, 238 old prisons have been 
closed.  As of 6 October 2006, there were 67,<footnote name="7">7. The above concerns regarding detention of persons accused and convicted of terrorism 
are greatly exacerbated by the fact that, due to the broad definition of terrorism, the number of </footnote>95 detainees in the penitentiary system, 
corresponding to 91 prisoners per 100,000 inhabitants. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Facilities for involuntary holding of persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Directorate for Social Services and Child Protection (SH&#199;EK) is a government 
authority charged with taking care of minors in economic or social difficulty.  SH&#199;EK manages 
institutions receiving both minors and adults with mental disabilities called &#8220;rehabilitation 
centres&#8221;.  While nearly all SH&#199;EK institutions are open, the rehabilitation centres have some 
closed wards, i.e. persons accommodated in those wards are in fact deprived of their freedom for 
their own protection. 
</p>
<p>17. Psychiatric hospitals also hold &#8220;involuntary patients&#8221;, both in open and in closed wards.  
A large number of them are chronic patients who live &#8220;permanently&#8221; in psychiatric hospitals 
because they cannot be released into life outside an institution and there is no other institution 
capable of taking care of them.<b>1</b>  Psychiatric hospitals also have special wards for persons 
deprived of their liberty within the context of a criminal proceeding. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Legal framework of detention within the criminal justice process 
1.  International human rights treaty obligations 
</b></p>
<p>18. Turkey has ratified all seven principal United Nations human rights treaties, including the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and, in September 2003, the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).  Turkey is also a long-standing member of the European 
Convention on Human Rights and has accepted the competence of the European Court of Human 
Rights to receive individual complaints.  Turkey is a member State of the European Convention 
for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as well, and 
regularly receives visits by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) established under that treaty, most recently in 
December 2005. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The Government informed the Working Group that there are &#8220;approximately 700 chronic 
</p>
<p>patients who cannot be discharged due to compelling reasons&#8221;.  According to representatives of 
the Turkish Psychiatric Association whom the Working Group delegation met, their number is 
around 3,000. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>19. In 2004, article 90 of the Constitution was revised, so as to recognize the primacy of 
ratified international and European conventions over domestic law. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  The Constitution 
</b></p>
<p>20. Article 19 of the Constitution governs deprivation of liberty (its full text is contained in 
appendix II to this report).  It provides, inter alia, that persons suspected of having committed an 
offence &#8220;can be arrested by decision of a judge solely for the purposes of preventing escape, or 
preventing the destruction or alteration of evidence as well as in similar other circumstances 
which necessitate detention and are prescribed by law&#8221;.  Arrest without a judicial warrant &#8220;shall 
be resorted to only in cases when a person is caught in the act of committing an offence or in 
cases where delay is likely to thwart justice&#8221;.  Individuals arrested or detained shall be promptly 
notified of the grounds for their arrest or detention and the charges against them.  The person 
arrested or detained shall be brought before a judge within 48 hours and within four days in the 
case of offences committed collectively.  These periods may be extended during a state of 
emergency, under martial law or in time of war.  Persons in detention shall have the right 
to request to be tried within a reasonable time or to be released during investigation or 
prosecution. 
</p>
<p>21. &#8220;Persons deprived of their liberty under any circumstances&#8221;, i.e. whether in the context of 
criminal proceedings or otherwise (article 19 also allows deprivation of liberty in the case of 
persons of unsound mind, alcoholics or drug addicts, vagrants or persons spreading contagious 
diseases), &#8220;are entitled to apply to the appropriate judicial authority for speedy conclusion of 
proceedings regarding their situation and for their release if the restriction placed upon them is 
not lawful&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>22. Finally, article 19 provides for a right to compensation for &#8220;[d]amages suffered by 
persons subjected to treatment contrary to the above provisions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Substantive criminal law defining terrorist offences 
</b></p>
<p>23. The main piece of anti-terrorism legislation is Law No. 3713 enacted in 1991, as 
amended by Law No. 5532 of 29 June 2006. 
</p>
<p>24. Article 1 contains the definition of terrorism: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Terrorism is any kind of acts which constitute an offence perpetrated by a person or 
persons who are members of an organization, through use of force and violence and by 
employing any of the methods of coercion, intimidation, oppression, suppression or 
threat for the purpose of altering the fundamentals of the Republic stated in the 
Constitution, its political, legal, social, secular and economic order, impairing the 
indivisible integrity of the State with its territory and nation, endangering the existence of 
the Turkish State and its Republic, weakening or annihilating or seizing the State 
authority, destroying fundamental rights and freedoms, impairing the internal and 
external safety of the State, public order or public health.&#8221; </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>25. Article 2 defines terrorist offenders as &#8220;[a]ny member of an organization, founded to 
attain the aims defined in article 1, who commits a crime in furtherance of these aims, &#8230; or any 
member of such an organization, even if he does not commit such a crime &#8230;&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>26. Article 3 of Law No. 5532 provides a long list of common offences which shall be 
considered as terrorist offences if they have been committed for the purposes of terrorism.  
Article 6 of Law No. 5532 makes various forms of propaganda for a terrorist organization 
punishable, including &#8220;[carrying] posters, banners, placards, pictures, signboards, equipments 
and materials, [chanting] slogans or [using] audio devices for the purposes of the organization&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Criminal procedure 
</b></p>
<p>27. Criminal procedure is primarily governed by the new Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) 
which entered into force on 1 June 2005.  Both CPC and the Anti-Terror Law contain provisions 
derogating from the common criminal procedure law. 
</p>
<p><b>Deprivation of liberty by the National Police and the Gendarmerie2 
</b></p>
<p>28. Deprivation of liberty by the police falls into two categories, preventive and judicial.  The 
police may preventively arrest a person who is about to commit an offence or who is otherwise a 
risk to others (e.g. because he is intoxicated). 
</p>
<p>29. Judicial arrest requires a strong suspicion that the person concerned has committed an 
offence and the issuance of a judicial arrest warrant.  However, in case of urgency, when there is 
no time to seek an arrest warrant or when a suspect is caught in flagrante delicto, the police can 
carry out the arrest without warrant.  
</p>
<p>30. At the time of arrest, the person is informed of the reasons for his arrest and of his rights, 
including the right to contact a relative, the right to legal assistance, the right to remain silent, 
and the right to challenge the arrest.  These rights are spelled out on the &#8220;Suspects Rights Form&#8221; 
which the police give the arrested person.  In order to take an arrested person into police custody, 
the police need to obtain a detention order issued by the competent prosecutor.  
</p>
<p>31. For the purposes of the maximum duration of police custody, CPC distinguishes between 
&#8220;individual offences&#8221; and &#8220;collective offences&#8221;, the latter being offences committed by three or 
more persons.  For individual offences police custody may not exceed 24 hours (plus up to 
12 hours for the transport of the suspect if the arrest takes place in a location at a considerable 
distance from the nearest court).  The prosecutor can, however, extend police custody to 
48 hours in particularly complex cases.  For collective offences, the prosecutor can order up to 
three extensions of the 24 hours of police custody, up to a total maximum of 96 hours.  In 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  In the following, the term &#8220;the police&#8221; is used to refer to both the National Police and the 
</p>
<p>Gendarmerie. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>regions where a state of emergency is in effect, the period of custody of persons apprehended in 
connection with terrorist offences can be extended up to seven days, at the request of the 
prosecutor and by decision of the judge (before whom the person concerned must be brought).  
No region of Turkey is currently under a state of emergency.  
</p>
<p>32. The arrested person, his family and his lawyer can at any time challenge the police 
custody.  A justice of the peace will decide on such challenges without a hearing. 
33. While in police custody the suspect is interrogated by the prosecutor.  The police may, 
however, subject the detainee to questioning before he is interrogated by the prosecutor.  The 
presence of a lawyer is mandatory if the suspect is a minor or is accused of an offence carrying a 
maximum sentence of five years or more of imprisonment.  If the suspect does not privately hire 
a lawyer, the local bar association will provide a lawyer.   
</p>
<p>34. No coercion is allowed during the interrogation.  Under article 148 (4) CPC, &#8220;statements 
taken by law enforcement officials in the absence of defence counsel cannot constitute the basis 
for a judgement unless they are confirmed by the suspect or the accused in front of the court&#8221;.  In 
a recent judgement, the Court of Cassation stated that this provision, which was introduced by 
the 2005 CPC, is not to be applied retroactively to statements made before the entry into force of 
the new CPC. 
</p>
<p><b>Detention on remand 
</b></p>
<p>35. If the prosecutor intends to keep the suspect in detention beyond the time limits for police 
custody, he must apply for a judicial order for remand custody.  In order to decide on remand 
custody, the competent justice of the peace must hold a hearing at which the suspect is present 
and heard. 
</p>
<p>36. The arrest and detention of a suspect may further be ordered by the justice of the peace 
upon request of the prosecutor during the course of the investigation, or also ex officio in the 
course of the trial. 
</p>
<p>37. At all stages of investigation and trial a suspect or accused person has the right to request 
his release.  The competent judge or the court decides on the question of the continuation of the 
arrest.  A decision rejecting release is subject to appeal.  
38. In the course of the investigation, the need for continued remand detention has to be 
examined every 30 days at the latest by the justice of the peace.  The suspect also has the right to 
request the judge to examine his continued detention.  During the trial phase, the competent 
judge or the court review ex officio the need for continued detention of the accused person at 
each hearing or in between hearings when the circumstances so require.  There should be a 
hearing at least every 30 days, in which case the judge will review the detention in the presence 
of the accused.  However, if the hearing is adjourned and the 30-day time limit would 
expire before the next hearing is held, the court will decide on detention on the basis of the case 
file.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>39. Article 102 of CPC establishes the time limits for detention on remand.  Persons charged 
with offences tried before ordinary courts can be held on remand for up to 6 months, which in 
complex cases can exceptionally be increased up to a maximum of 10 months.  Under 
paragraph 2 of article 102, &#8220;[t]he maximum duration of remand detention in cases falling within 
the competence of Serious Crimes Courts is 2 years.  Under compelling circumstances, this 
period may be extended by motivated decision; however, the extended period cannot 
exceed 3 years <i>in total</i>&#8221;.  Where the offence charged is related to terrorism, the time limits are 
doubled pursuant to article 252 (2) of CPC.  The maximum duration of detention on remand 
thereby reaches 6 or 10 years, depending on the interpretation of article 102 (2).<b>3</b>  Under 
article 12 of Law No. 5320, however, for terrorist offences the time limits on remand detention 
introduced by the new CPC will enter into force only on 1 April 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Access to legal counsel 
</b></p>
<p>40. The right to immediate access to legal counsel for all persons in police or remand custody 
(art. 149 (1), CPC) is a major advance of the new CPC.  As far as access to a lawyer during 
police custody is concerned, see details above under police custody.  
</p>
<p>41. This right is, however, restricted under the 2006 amendments to the 1991 Anti-Terror 
Law.  Under article 10 (b) of the law (as amended), the judge can decide upon request by the 
prosecutor that a detainee&#8217;s access to legal counsel can be delayed by 24 hours.  The suspect may 
not be interrogated during those 24 hours.  Article 10 (e)<b> </b>further<b> </b>allows that, if there is evidence 
that the defence lawyer might be &#8220;liaising&#8221; between the detainee and a terrorist organization, at 
the request of the prosecutor and following a decision by a judge, an official can be present 
during meetings between the suspect and his lawyer, and the judge will be able to examine 
documents passed between them.  Moreover, article 10 (c) establishes that during police custody 
a terror suspect can be assisted only by one lawyer. 
</p>
<p>42. Article 59 of the Law on Execution of Sentences and Security Measures (No. 5275 
of 2004) also provides that where the lawyer is suspected of being a member of a terrorist 
organization his interaction with a detainee who is his client can be monitored by the prison 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>43. Pursuant to article 101, paragraph 3, of CPC, the assistance of a lawyer is obligatory 
whenever a defendant is detained on remand.  
</p>
<p><b>Legal aid 
</b></p>
<p>44. Where a defendant does not have a privately hired lawyer but requests the assistance of a 
lawyer, he will be assigned legal counsel through the local bar association.  The bar association

</p>
<p>will claim the lawyer&#8217;s compensation from the Government, and the Government will reclaim 
the amount from the defendant, unless he can prove that he could not afford the costs of the 
lawyer. 
</p>
<p><b>Criminal trial 
</b></p>
<p>45. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure the prosecutor is in charge of the investigation.  
He is assisted by the police (or Gendarmerie).  During the pretrial phase, judicial control over the 
investigation (e.g. extension of remand detention, authorization of searches or wire-tapping) is 
entrusted to the territorially competent justice of the peace.  When the investigation is concluded 
the prosecutor will present an indictment to the competent judge in accordance with the 
seriousness of the offence (a justice of the peace, criminal court, serious crimes court or special 
serious crimes court depending on the offence).  Article 174 provides that courts may return any 
indictment that is not supported by sufficient evidence.  If the indictment is confirmed, the judge 
will set the date for the first trial hearing.  The trial judge will be the same as the judge of the 
confirmation hearing.  
</p>
<p><b>Review of first instance judgements  
</b>46. Review of first instance judgements by the Court of Cassation is mostly on the law and 
not on the assessment of the evidence and the facts.  The procedure is written:  the Chief 
Prosecutor will give his advice on the appeal to the Court of Cassation, which will also be 
communicated to the defence lawyer and the victim&#8217;s lawyer, who can react in writing.  There 
might be a hearing for oral argument, but the defendant will not be allowed to be present if he is 
detained on remand. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Juvenile justice 
</b>47. In 2005, a new Child Protection Law (Law No. 5395) entered into force.  This law 
provides for a new juvenile justice system, i.e. criminal justice affecting persons under 18 years 
of age.  It states as a fundamental principle that the &#8220;penalty of imprisonment and measures that 
restrict liberty shall be the last resort for juveniles&#8221;.  The law establishes sections specialized in 
minors within the police, special prosecutors for cases involving minors and special courts for 
trials of minors.  Judges appointed to these courts shall be &#8220;preferably specialized in juvenile law 
with training in the fields of child psychology and social services&#8221;.  Moreover, at all stages of 
criminal proceedings involving minors, an important role is assigned to social workers. 
</p>
<p>48. Where a minor is charged in relation to an offence committed together with adults, his 
case is, as a rule, handled separately by the specialized prosecutors and courts.  &#8220;In case it is 
considered imperative&#8221;, however, the adult court dealing with a case also involving a juvenile 
defendant may decide to join the minor&#8217;s case to the adult trial.  Cases involving terror offences 
are tried before the special chambers of the Serious Crimes Court, including where the defendant 
is a minor. 
</p>
<p>49. Law No. 5395 contains specific provisions aimed at putting into practice the principle 
that imprisonment shall be the last resort.  If the offence charged carries a penalty of two years or </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>less of imprisonment (five years or less in the case of minors below 15), the prosecution can, 
under certain conditions, be deferred for five years.  If the juvenile does not reoffend during 
those five years, the prosecution will be dropped.  At the conclusion of the trial, if the juvenile 
defendant is found guilty of an offence and would be sentenced to three years or less of 
imprisonment, the court may decide to suspend the announcement of the sentence and put the 
minor on probation for up to five years. 
</p>
<p>50. The law divides minors into three age groups:  up to the completion of 12 years of age 
(no criminal responsibility), between 12 and 15 years completed and from 15 years and 1 day to 
the completion of 18 years. 
</p>
<p>51. Before a minor aged 15 or less can be arrested, he has to be given a medical examination 
in order to assess whether he is capable of understanding the act he is accused of.  Moreover, 
minors in the 12-15 age group can only be arrested and detained on remand if the offence 
charged carries a minimum sentence of five years or more. 
</p>
<p>52. Both in police custody and in remand detention, minors have to be held separately from 
adults.  The investigation of offences committed by minors is conducted by the prosecutor.  
When the prosecutor interrogates a minor, a social worker should be present.  Whatever the 
offence charged, minors can only be interrogated in the presence of their lawyer.  
</p>
<p>53. The sentences provided in the Criminal Code are reduced for juvenile offenders:  for 
minors from 13 to 15 years of age (at the time of the offence) the sentence is to be halved; for 
minors from 15 to 18 years of age, the sentence is to be reduced by one third. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Deprivation of liberty on grounds of mental health 
</b></p>
<p>54. Article 432 of the Turkish Civil Code provides that persons who have mental illness, 
mental infirmity, habitual drunkenness or substance addiction and thus harm their own family 
and surroundings can, by order of a court, be placed in a health centre for their protection.  
Article 433 provides that the same court is competent to order the release of the patient from the 
mental health institution.  Article 436 provides for a right to appeal placement in an institution, 
and article 437 states that legal aid may be provided when necessary. 
</p>
<p><b>7.  Administrative detention of foreigners pending expulsion 
</b></p>
<p>55. Article 23 of Law No. 5683 of 1950, the Law on Residence of Foreign Citizens, provides 
that foreigners who have been issued an expulsion decision but cannot be immediately expelled 
because they lack a passport or for any other reason, shall reside in a location assigned to them 
by the Ministry of the Interior.  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  POSITIVE ASPECTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Cooperation of the Government </b></p>
<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>able to meet with and interview in accordance with the terms of reference whomever it wanted, 
detainees identified beforehand to the Government by their name and detainees chosen at 
random.  The Working Group would like to reiterate its gratitude to the Government of Turkey. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Well-functioning criminal justice and penitentiary systems 
</b>57. The first and most striking observation the Working Group made during its visit to 
Turkey was that both the criminal justice system and the penitentiary system were well 
organized, well administered and well funded.  In the police stations the Working Group visited, 
holding cells were clean, registers clear and generally complete, and interrogation rooms 
designed following a model layout and equipped with a video camera. 
</p>
<p>58. Courts similarly conveyed the impression that the Government allocates adequate 
resources to the judiciary and to prosecutorial offices.  As a result, delays in criminal 
proceedings are generally limited and the duration of trials in which the defendant is in custody 
is generally reasonable.  This is evidenced also by the statistics concerning the number of 
remand detainees among the overall number of persons deprived of liberty, which is just above 
50 per cent.<b>4</b>  While it would of course be desirable for significantly less than half of the prison 
population to be awaiting judgement, the ratio in Turkey is reasonable by international standards. 
59. The administration of the penitentiary institutions also appeared to be professional and 
well funded.  There are fewer prisoners than places in the penitentiary system and conditions of 
detention in the new prisons, which the Government is building at considerable speed to replace 
older facilities, are respectful of international standards. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Low incarceration rate 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Working Group also notes that, with approximately 91 detainees 
per 100,000 inhabitants, Turkey has a reasonably low incarceration rate. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Reform of the criminal procedure law 
</b></p>
<p>61. In the course of the past decade the criminal procedure law of Turkey has been 
undergoing profound changes, which have resulted in considerable strengthening of the 
safeguards against arbitrary detention.  Only a few milestones of this reform process can be 
mentioned here. 
</p>
<p>62. In 1999, a constitutional amendment abolished the military judge presiding over State 
Security Courts, making their composition entirely civilian.  In 2003, State Security Courts were 
abolished altogether and replaced by the special chambers of Serious Crimes Courts. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  According to statistics provided to the Working Group by the Government, at the time of 
</p>
<p>the visit out of the overall prison population of 67,795, 24,646 were serving a final sentence, 
8,013 were serving a sentence on the basis of a judgement still pending before the Court of 
Cassation, and 34,136 were awaiting the first instance judgement. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>63. In October 2001, article 19 of the Constitution was amended.  The maximum duration 
of police custody for &#8220;offences committed collectively&#8221; was reduced to 4 days from the 
previous 15 days.<b>5</b>  
</p>
<p>64. In January 2002, the Government decided to suspend the state of emergency provisions 
that contravened article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights (right to liberty and 
security of person), which had been in force since 1992 in some areas of the country.  In 
November 2002 the state of emergency itself was lifted. 
</p>
<p>65. The new CPC introduces for the first time non-derogable limits on the duration of 
remand detention on charges of offences tried before the Serious Crimes Courts and reduces the 
maximum duration of remand detention for lesser offences.  
</p>
<p>66. The suspect&#8217;s access to a lawyer while in police custody is now much better protected.  
Moreover, legal aid has been significantly strengthened.  Lawyers put at the disposal of suspects 
by bar associations used to account for only 10 per cent of cases, now it is four times as many.  
The Working Group has, however, been informed that, because of the high costs of the legal aid 
system, the Turkish Grand National Assembly is considering legislation that would restrict 
access to legal aid.  
</p>
<p>67. Regional appeals courts will be established in 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Measures against the use of extorted statements 
</b></p>
<p>68. All the interlocutors of the Working Group delegation, both those representing the 
authorities and those behind bars, stated that the use of torture and ill-treatment by the police had 
dramatically decreased in the past few years.  The Working Group has no doubts that the 
Government&#8217;s policy of &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; of torture is highly successful.  From a widespread 
practice used by the police to obtain self-incriminating statements from the suspect, torture has 
become the exceptional misconduct of individual police officers or gendarmes.  This was 
brought about by a number of changes to the legal system, including shorter police custody 
periods, obligatory medical visits, and changes to the laws and administrative measures aimed at 
reducing the prospects of impunity for torturers.  Most important from the point of view of the 
Working Group&#8217;s mandate is article 148 (4) of CPC, providing that &#8220;statements taken by law 
enforcement officials in the absence of defence counsel cannot constitute the basis for a 
judgement unless they are confirmed by the suspect or the accused before the court&#8221;.  As a result 
of all these developments, convictions based on extorted statements are much less likely to 
occur. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Juvenile justice 
</b>69. The new Child Protection Law that entered into force in 2005 constitutes a significant 
step in bringing juvenile justice in Turkey into line with the provisions of articles 37 and 40 of 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  The corresponding change to article 11 of the Anti-Terror Law had already been made in 1992 
</p>
<p>(Law No. 3842). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Rights of the Child and article 10 (2) (b) ICCPR.  The fundamental 
principle that the &#8220;penalty of imprisonment and measures that restrict liberty shall be the last 
resort for juveniles&#8221; is not only enshrined in the law:  the provisions allowing prosecution of 
minors accused of an offence punishable with up to two years of imprisonment to be deferred for 
five years, and the possibility of putting minors who would be sentenced to less than three years&#8217; 
imprisonment on probation provide the courts with the instruments to put that principle into 
practice.  Equally important is the establishment of specialized police, prosecutors&#8217; offices and 
tribunals to deal with juvenile delinquency.  The Working Group remains concerned, however, 
about several aspects of the juvenile justice system, both regarding the legislation and with 
respect to its implementation.  These are discussed below. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  ISSUES OF CONCERN 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Concerns related to detention in the criminal justice context 
1.  Criminal justice in terrorism cases 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Working Group has described above the reform process in the criminal justice 
system.  Many of the reforms of general application, e.g. the ban on statements obtained by the 
police in the absence of a lawyer, are of great significance to criminal proceedings involving 
terrorism suspects.  Other positive developments, such as the abolition of the State Security 
Courts and the termination of the state of emergency, are specific to terrorism cases.  The 
Working Group remains concerned, however, that the detention, prosecution and trial of 
terrorism suspects continue to take place in a &#8220;parallel system&#8221; to the common justice system in 
which the reforms encounter difficulties in showing their beneficial effects.  The problems arise 
both from the letter of the laws applicable to such cases and from the practice. 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Definition of terrorism and terrorist offender 
</b>71. As the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism states in his report on the visit to Turkey in 
February 2006, &#8220;[t]he Anti-Terror Act is drafted in a way that allows for an overly broad 
application of the term terrorism&#8221;<b>6</b> and &#8220;[s]urprisingly, there is no requirement that [a terrorist 
offender] must have committed a serious violent crime&#8221;.<b>7</b>  The Special Rapporteur also voices 
his concern about the severe limitations the Anti-Terror Act may put on the freedom of 
expression, association and assembly.<b>8</b>  The Working Group fully shares the opinion of the 
Special Rapporteur in this respect and, in the interest of brevity and to avoid duplication, refers 
to his more extensive reasoning. 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>8
</b>  Ibid., para. 18. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>72. In May 2006 the Special Rapporteur provided a legal opinion to the Justice Committee of 
the Turkish Grand National Assembly concerning certain aspects of a government bill 
introducing amendments to the Anti-Terror Act.<b>9</b>  The Special Rapporteur inter alia &#8220;expressed 
concern that the terms relating to the question of incitement were vague and therefore appeared 
to be incompatible with the requirement of legality as enshrined in article 15 of ICCPR.  
Consequently, the limitations that resulted in respect of freedom of expression would not be 
confined to countering terrorism but could be used also in respect of non-violent expression of 
opinion&#8221;.<b>10</b>  The Working Group notes that the amendments introduced by the Turkish legislator 
in enacting the bill appear to have partially taken some of the concerns expressed by the Special 
Rapporteur into consideration.  In other respects (e.g. the list of other offences which may be 
considered terrorist offences), however, the Assembly aggravated the problems identified by the 
Special Rappporteur.  The Working Group shares the preoccupations of the Special Rapporteur 
also in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Access to legal counsel in proceedings concerning terrorism suspects 
</b>73. The Working Group is equally concerned about the restrictions to the right to be assisted 
by counsel of one&#8217;s own choosing (art. 14 (3) (b) and (d), ICCPR) contained in the 2006 
amendments to the Anti-Terror Law.  As set forth above, if there is evidence that the defence 
lawyer might be &#8220;liaising&#8221; between the detainee and a terrorist organization, the judge can order 
that an official be present during meetings between the suspect and his lawyer and will be able to 
examine documents passed between them.<b>11</b>  Finally, before trial starts a terror suspect can 
appoint only one defence counsel.  The latter restriction in particular risks constituting 
heavy-handed interference with defence rights in terrorism cases, which tend to be rather 
complex (as the Government itself argues when justifying prolonged periods of remand 
detention; see below) and involve heavy prison sentences. 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Length of remand detention 
</b>74. Most disturbing to the Working Group is the situation of the numerous persons accused 
of terrorism who have spent 7, 8, 10, in some cases 13 years in detention without being found 
guilty.<b>12</b>  According to information provided by the administration of the Diyarbak&#305;r D-type 
(high-security) prison, of the 489 detainees at the time of the Working Group&#8217;s visit, only 59 
were convicts; 45 detainees had spent more than 10 years in prison without a final conviction, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

</b>  For a summary of this legal opinion, see A/61/267, para. 6. 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  Ibid.  
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  According to information provided by the Government to the Working Group, this provision 
</p>
<p>has not been applied yet. 
<b>12
</b></p>
<p>  In the course of its visit, the Working Group received information about similar cases in other 
high-security prisons it could not visit. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>and 18 of them had been detained for more than 13 years without ever having been judged at 
first instance, while the others&#8217; cases are pending before the Court of Cassation or in retrial.  
Their trials register a perfunctory hearing every month or two.  The Working Group delegation 
discussed some of these cases with prosecutors involved in them and was told that evidence was 
still being gathered and analysed.  It is not clear to the Working Group what evidence could 
possibly need to be analysed 13 years after the terrorist crime was committed, no matter how 
complex the case is.  It appears that the problem is compounded by the frequent changes in the 
judges sitting on the trials.   
75. While the new Criminal Procedure Code introduces time limits for the duration of 
remand detention, in order to be able to maintain these persons in detention for several years 
more without a judgement, the legislator has decided that for persons accused of terrorist crimes 
the limits shall enter into force only in April 2008.  Article 102 (2) of CPC, the provision 
establishing the maximum duration of remand detention in cases falling within the competence 
of Serious Crimes Courts (see paragraph 39 above), appears not to be entirely clear:  as 
explained to the Working Group by the Government, the correct interpretation is that the initial 
two years can be extended by only one additional year for compelling reasons, reaching a total of 
three years, which - doubled for proceedings in terrorism cases as provided for in article 252 (2) 
of CPC - amounts to a maximum six years&#8217; detention on remand.  The Working Group noted, 
however, that the judges, prosecutors and lawyers with whom it spoke during the visit 
understood article 102 (2) to provide that the maximum duration is two years, to be extended (for 
compelling reasons) by up to three years, thereby reaching a total of five years, which, doubled 
under article 252 (2), would allow remand detention in terrorism cases for up to 10 years.  As the 
provision will enter into force only in April 2008, there is no judicial interpretation of the norm 
as yet.  The Working Group notes that only the reading the Government has put forward in its 
correspondence with the Working Group, limiting remand detention to six years for compelling 
reasons in highly complex cases, would appear to be compatible with the right to trial within a 
reasonable time or release enshrined in article 9 (3) of ICCPR.  The Working Group would 
therefore recommend that the Government find a way to ensure that this reading prevails once 
the provision enters into force. 
</p>
<p><b>(d) Execution of prison sentences of persons found guilty of terrorism offences 
</b>76. The Working Group observed that, both in the law and in the practice, the execution of 
prison sentences is aggravated in multiple ways in the case of persons convicted of terrorism 
offences.  Disciplinary sanctions are imposed with great frequency against these detainees.  
The 2006 Anti-Terror Law provides that &#8220;those who have been imposed three times the 
disciplinary penalty of solitary confinement shall not benefit from conditional release, even if 
such disciplinary penalties have been lifted&#8221; (art. 17 (2)).  Prisoners serving an aggravated life 
sentence as result of the abolition of the death penalty (which the Working Group of course 
welcomes) cannot benefit from conditional release.  As article 17 (4) prescribes, &#8220;their heavy 
lifetime imprisonment penalties last until they are dead&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>detainees affected by these provisions and practices is considerable.  At the time of the Working 
Group&#8217;s visit, there were more than 4,000 persons deprived of liberty on terrorism charges or 
convictions.  These detainees are not necessarily accused of a violent crime.  As discussed in the 
next paragraph, many of them may be held primarily on the basis of extorted confessions.  Their 
situation is, to sum up, a major stain on Turkey&#8217;s efforts to eliminate arbitrary detention which 
cannot be justified with reference to the Government&#8217;s uncontested duty to combat terrorism. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Failure to retroactively apply the ban on statements  
made to the police in the absence of a lawyer 
</b></p>
<p>78. As already mentioned, the Working Group is convinced that the Government&#8217;s policy of 
&#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; of torture is being pursued very effectively.  Article 148 (4) of CPC, providing 
that &#8220;statements to the security forces signed in the absence of a lawyer cannot count as evidence 
unless they are repeated in front of a judge&#8221;, is a cornerstone of that policy.  It is therefore 
disheartening that the authorities (including the Court of Cassation) consider that this provision 
is not to be applied to currently pending criminal proceedings in which the accused made 
self-incriminating statements to law enforcement officials without a lawyer before the new CPC 
entered into force.  The article in the old CPC providing that the court may not convict a 
defendant based solely on his confession to the police is obviously a much weaker safeguard 
against convictions based on extorted statements.   
</p>
<p><b>3.  Vulnerability of non-Turkish detainees 
</b></p>
<p>79. Foreign detainees, whether deprived of their liberty on remand or serving a sentence, are 
in a particularly vulnerable situation in most if not all countries.  In Turkey, this vulnerability is 
exacerbated by a scarcity of effective interpreters in the criminal justice system.  The Working 
Group recalls that the right to be enabled to fully follow the proceedings is enshrined in 
article 14 (3) for all stages of the criminal process, from prompt and detailed information on the 
charges at the beginning (para. 3 (a)) to free assistance of an interpreter throughout the whole 
trial (para. 3 (f)). 
</p>
<p>80. The Working Group is further concerned about a procedural obstacle to contacts between 
foreign detainees and their families in the home country.  According to prison administrators and 
detainees interviewed by the Working Group, detainees are only allowed to call one number in 
their home country and the consular representatives of their home country have to certify to the 
Turkish authorities that this number actually belongs to a family member of the detainee.  Many 
consulates apparently fail to cooperate with this procedure.  As a result, detainees from those 
countries are simply deprived of all possibility of reaching their family by phone. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Juvenile justice 
</b>81. Although the 2005 Child Protection Law constitutes a very significant step forward, the 
Working Group remains concerned about some aspects in which the juvenile justice system does 
not sufficiently take into account the specific vulnerability of minors suspected of an offence.  
The time limits concerning police custody and remand detention are the same for minors in </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>the 15-18 age group as for adults.  Moreover, the provision whereby &#8220;in case it is considered 
imperative&#8221; the adult court dealing with a case also involving a juvenile defendant may decide to 
join the minor&#8217;s case to the adult trial can in many cases nullify the important guarantee of 
specialized prosecutors and courts.  This is the rule for cases involving terrorism (which, as 
mentioned above, is overly broadly defined), which are tried before the special chambers of the 
Serious Crimes Court, also where the defendant is a minor. 
</p>
<p>82. The massive arrests and detentions of minors following the riots in Diyarbak&#305;r 
from 28 March to 1 April 2006 provide evidence that these concerns are not only of a theoretical 
nature.  More than 200 minors were apprehended during and following the riots, 94 of them were 
taken into police custody (16 of them in the 12-15 age group), and 60 were remanded into 
custody on charges, including being members of an armed organization, and remained in 
detention in a special wing of the Diyarbak&#305;r high-security prison three weeks after the incidents.  
At the time of its visit, the Working Group was relieved to learn that all children arrested in 
connection with the riots had been released from pretrial detention.  According to the report of an 
inquiry into the events by several bar associations, the families of the children were not informed 
after the apprehensions and the earliest interview with lawyers took place 12 hours after 
apprehension.   
</p>
<p>83. In addition to the concerns raised by some aspects of the legislation, the Working Group 
is concerned about the delays in the implementation of the new juvenile justice law.  At the time 
of its visit, the Working Group was informed that specialized prosecutors&#8217; offices and courts had 
been established in only nine cities.  There is a great shortage of social workers, who play a key 
role in the juvenile justice system designed by the new law.  As a result, their twofold function in 
the process - assisting the court by carrying out a &#8220;social inquiry&#8221; into the juvenile offender&#8217;s 
circumstances and assisting the minor during the process, particularly during interrogation - is 
seriously compromised.  Moreover, it would appear that the scarcity of social workers is causing 
delays in the system, contrary to article 10 (2) (b) of ICCPR, which states that &#8220;accused juvenile 
persons shall be &#8230; brought as speedily as possible for adjudication&#8221;. 
84. Finally, the Working Group heard the concern expressed that the principles whereby 
juvenile cases should be adjudicated as speedily as possible and the &#8220;penalty of imprisonment 
and measures that restrict liberty be the last resort for juveniles&#8221; have not yet fully been 
assimilated by the justice system. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Concerns related to detention outside the criminal justice context 
</b>85. Article 9 (1) of ICCPR provides that &#8220;[n]o one shall be deprived of his liberty except on 
such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law&#8221;.  To ensure the 
effectiveness of that right, both within the context of criminal proceedings and also outside, 
where the guarantees of paragraphs 2 and 3 of article 9 do not apply, article 9 (4) prescribes that 
&#8220;[a]nyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take 
proceedings before a court, in order that that court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of 
his detention and order his release if the detention is not lawful&#8221;.  The Working Group observes 
considerable shortcomings in the protection of these rights outside the criminal justice system.   </p>

</p>
<p><b>1.  Detention of foreigners awaiting expulsion 
</b></p>
<p>86. Foreigners who are in Turkey without the documents necessary to allow them to stay 
lawfully in the country can be, and are in great numbers, arrested by the police or the 
Gendarmerie.  After a brief period in police custody they are taken to a so-called &#8220;guest house&#8221; 
for foreigners run by the Ministry of the Interior, where they are - in spite of the welcoming 
name of these institutions - to all effect locked up awaiting expulsion.  However, no written 
decision to this effect is issued to them.   
</p>
<p>87. Article 23 of the Law on Residence of Foreign Citizens, providing that foreigners who 
have been issued an expulsion decision but cannot be immediately expelled, shall reside in a 
location assigned to them by the Ministry of the Interior, does not constitute a sufficient legal 
basis for this practice.  Neither this law, nor any other, provides further details as to the 
preconditions for, modalities of or maximum duration of assignment to a residence for foreigners 
awaiting expulsion.  As this is not a measure adopted within the criminal process, judges of the 
peace have no jurisdiction to rule on challenges against such measures.  It would appear that 
administrative tribunals are competent.  However, this remedy appears not to be exercised in 
practice.  Challenges to the expulsion decision may have an impact also on the question of 
detention, but they simply do not constitute the remedy against the fact of deprivation of liberty 
required by article 9 (4) of ICCPR. 
</p>
<p>88. It is important to stress that this has nothing to do with the criminal proceedings which 
can be initiated against a foreigner for illegal entry into Turkey.  Such proceedings are not 
regularly pursued and in case of a guilty finding result in a fine, not deprivation of liberty.   
</p>
<p>89. Another aggravating aspect is that, according to information provided by the police, not 
only foreigners who are actually the subject of an expulsion decision are assigned to guest 
houses (i.e. deprived of their liberty), but also so assigned are many who - in the opinion of the 
police - are likely to receive an unfavourable outcome in expulsion proceedings initiated against 
them.  This practice violates even article 23 of the Law on Residence of Foreign Citizens. 
</p>
<p>90. To sum up, there is no remedy for the foreigners awaiting expulsion to challenge their 
detention, and no control over the detention by a judicial authority.  It may be true that in some 
cases the person to be deported spends only a few days at the guest house.  But in others, where 
there are difficulties obtaining valid travel documents (as appears to be the case for many 
African migrants), the detention can last months and even more than a year. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Deprivation of liberty in psychiatric institutions 
</b></p>
<p>91. This situation is in some respects similar to that of persons assigned to stay in a mental 
institution without their consent.  Just as the Working Group does not in any way dispute the 
right of the Government to regulate the entry of foreigners into Turkey, to expel those who are 
there without a legal basis, and to detain some of them pending expulsion where it was really 
necessary, there is no doubt that some persons have to be deprived of their freedom in mental </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>health institutions in order to prevent them from seriously harming themselves and others.  But 
whenever a Government, also for the most legitimate purposes, decides to deprive someone of 
his or her freedom, international law provides that it needs to do so on a sound legal basis and to 
provide an opportunity to challenge the deprivation of liberty before a court.   
</p>
<p>92. Article 432 of the Civil Code allows the territorially competent civil court to assign 
persons with mental health problems who &#8220;harm their own family and surroundings&#8221; to an 
institution.  Article 433 provides that the same court is competent to order the release of the 
patient from the mental health institution.  The provisions apply equally to persons with 
substance abuse problems. 
</p>
<p>93. The Working Group has two main concerns in this respect.  Firstly, the law should 
provide more detail both on the substantive criteria and the procedural safeguards for involuntary 
commitment to mental health institutions, including an automatic periodic review of the 
necessity of deprivation of liberty.  Secondly, in practice in many cases there is no judicial 
decision providing a legal basis for the assignment.  The Council of Europe Committee for the 
Prevention of Torture found on the occasion of a recent visit that &#8220;most involuntary patients in 
the Adana and Bakirk&#246;y hospitals had been hospitalized <i>without any judicial intervention</i>&#8221;.<b>13</b>  
The Working Group shares this impression.  According to the procedure currently in use at the 
Bakirk&#246;y Hospital, recently arrived involuntary patients are admitted on the basis of a decision 
taken by three hospital psychiatrists.  In some cases judicial authorization is sought ex post facto after committal, but as there are apparently delays also in the judiciary&#8217;s examination and 
decision on the reports of the psychiatrists&#8217; committee, most patients&#8217; stay in the closed ward 
takes place without the judicial basis provided for in the law.  As the remedy against involuntary 
hospitalization is (pursuant to article 433 of the Civil Code) a decision by the same judge to 
review the committal decision, as long as the initial judicial decision has not been taken the 
remedy is non-existent in practice. 
</p>
<p>94. The persons deprived of their liberty in psychiatric hospitals (according to information 
received, approximately 90 per cent of patients are involuntary committals) are entitled to a 
better legal basis, both with respect to substantive criteria and to procedural safeguards.  The 
psychiatrists running these institutions also need a legal basis for the measures they take which 
interfere with human rights, including the right not to be arbitrarily detained.  To fill the current 
vacuum, the Turkish Psychiatric Association has proposed to the Minister of Justice a draft 
Mental Health Law, but there appears to have been little progress in this regard.   
</p>
<p><b>3.  Other forms of administrative deprivation of liberty 
</b></p>
<p>95. In addition to the involuntary committal to psychiatric hospitals, there are a number of 
other situations to which the Working Group&#8217;s attention was drawn in which vulnerable persons

</p>
<p>are taken to institutions where they are de facto deprived of their freedom with little procedural 
guarantees.  This is the case of some of the persons with mental disabilities accommodated in 
rehabilitation centres, such as the Saray institution outside Ankara that was visited by the 
Working Group.  According to information received from reliable sources, which the Working 
Group was not able to verify, this may also be the case with respect to certain institutions for 
children at risk (of delinquency, prostitution, or sexual abuse) which are not formally classified 
as places of detention, but are nonetheless guarded by the police. 
</p>
<p>96. The Working Group recalls that whenever persons are deprived of their freedom, de facto 
or de jure, there must be a procedure in place for prompt (and thereafter periodic) review of the 
legality and necessity of the measures taken.  In the Working Group&#8217;s opinion, in Turkey the 
legal basis and the procedural safeguards accompanying these forms of deprivation of liberty are 
not always sufficiently well defined. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>97. In the course of the last 15 years Turkey has made impressive progress in the reform of 
its criminal justice system.  This progress is particularly visible in the fight against torture 
(which, as far as the Working Group&#8217;s mandate is concerned, is the fight against intimidation of 
persons in detention and against extorted confessions).  But the duration of police custody has 
also been significantly shortened:  limits on the duration of pretrial detention were introduced for 
the first time in the 2005 CPC, which also guarantees the immediate right of access to a lawyer 
for all persons detained in the criminal process. 
</p>
<p>98. The Working Group notes, however, a great reluctance on the part of the authorities to 
fully extend the beneficial effects of the reforms to persons accused of terrorism, which - due to 
the overly broad definition of terrorist offences - affects thousands of individuals, many of whom 
have non-violently challenged the constitutional order of Turkey.  In the Working Group&#8217;s 
opinion, most of the extraordinary rules and practices and resulting restrictions on the safeguards 
against arbitrary detention cannot be justified with reference to the duty to defend the country 
and its population against terrorist threats. 
</p>
<p>99. The other great challenge Turkey faces is to put in place laws and procedures that will 
extend the protection against unlawful and unnecessary deprivation of liberty to those detained 
outside the criminal justice system, whether on the grounds of mental health issues, or because 
they are minors at risk, or because they are foreigners awaiting expulsion. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> On the basis of its findings, the Working Group would like to make the following 
recommendations to the Government. 
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> With regard to detention on terrorism charges, the Working Group recommends: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The amendment of the definition of terrorism with a view to limiting the scope 
thereof, as recommended by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism; </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>As a matter of urgency, the release of detainees detained for more than 10 years 
without having been found guilty.  Measures should also be taken with regard to 
those held for more than 10 years on remand, even if they have already 
been found guilty at first instance.  The Government should further ensure that 
article 102 (2), when it enters into force, is understood by judges and  
prosecutors as limiting remand detention to three years (i.e. six years in 
terrorism cases under article 252 (2) CPC, the provision doubling the time 
limits for remand detention of defendants charged with terrorism  
offences); 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>As a further matter of urgency, that the legislator introduce legislation clarifying 
that article 148 (4) CPC should be applied in all ongoing proceedings, whether 
the declaration to the police was made before or after the entry into force of the 
new CPC; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The lifting of the limitation on the number of defence counsel in terrorism 
cases. 
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> With regard to detention in the juvenile justice system, the Working Group 
recommends: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Increasing efforts to fully implement the principle that deprivation of liberty 
shall be the last resort for juvenile offenders and to limit periods of remand 
detention by expediting proceedings in juvenile cases; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Amending the law in order always to provide for the separate trial of defendants 
who are charged with having committed an offence as minors; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensuring that the specialized police departments, prosecutors&#8217; offices and courts 
for juvenile offenders provided for by law are established covering the entire 
territory of Turkey, and that a sufficient number of social workers are hired to 
assist those specialized institutions, as provided by law. 
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> With regard to forms of deprivation of liberty outside the criminal justice process, 
the Working Group recommends: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>As a matter of urgent priority, the enacting of a law creating a framework for 
the detention of foreigners whose detention is considered necessary to ensure the 
implementation of migration laws.  Even before this legal framework is 
established, the competent police departments should start issuing decisions to 
all foreigners assigned to guest houses indicating, inter alia, the 
remedies available to contest such decisions, which should include judicial 
review; </b></p>

<p><b>ARTICLE 19 OF THE CONSTITUTION 
</b></p>
<p> &#8220;Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.   
</p>
<p> &#8220;No one shall be deprived of his liberty except in the following cases where 
procedure and conditions are prescribed by law:  execution of sentences restricting liberty 
and the implementation of security measures decided by court order, apprehension or 
detention of a person in line with a court ruling or an obligation upon him designated by 
law; execution of an order for the purpose of the educational supervision of a minor or 
for bringing him before the competent authority; execution of measures taken in 
conformity with the relevant legal provision for the treatment, education or correction in 
institutions of a person of unsound mind, an alcoholic or drug addict or vagrant or a 
person spreading contagious diseases, when such persons constitute a danger to the 
public; apprehension or detention of a person who enters or attempts to enter 
illegally into the country or for whom a deportation or extradition order has been  
issued.   
</p>
<p> &#8220;Individuals against whom there is strong evidence of having committed an 
offence can be arrested by decision of a judge solely for the purposes of preventing 
escape, or preventing the destruction or alteration of evidence as well as in similar other 
circumstances which necessitate detention and are prescribed by law.  Apprehension of a 
person without a decision by a judge shall be resorted to only in cases when a person is 
caught in the act of committing an offence or in cases where delay is likely to thwart 
justice; the conditions for such apprehension shall be defined by law.   
 &#8220;Individuals arrested or detained shall be promptly notified, and in all cases in 
writing, or orally, when the former is not possible, of the grounds for their arrest or 
detention and the charges against them; in cases of offences committed collectively 
this notification shall be made, at the latest, before the individual is brought before the 
judge.   
 &#8220;The person arrested or detained shall be brought before a judge within at latest 
48 hours and within at most four days in the case of offences committed collectively, 
excluding the time taken to send him to the court nearest to the place of seizure.  No one 
can be deprived of his liberty without the decision of a judge after the expiry of the above 
specified periods.  These periods may be extended during a state of emergency, under 
martial law or in time of war.   
</p>
<p> &#8220;The arrest or detention of a person shall be notified to next of kin immediately. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Persons under detention shall have the right to request to be tried with a 
reasonable time or to be released during investigation or prosecution.  Release may be </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.5

</p>
<p>made conditional on the presentation of an appropriate guarantee with a view to securing 
the presence of the person at the trial proceedings and the execution of the court sentence. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Persons deprived of their liberty under any circumstances are entitled to apply to 
the appropriate judicial authority for speedy conclusion of proceedings regarding their 
situation and for their release if the restriction placed upon them is not lawful.   
</p>
<p> &#8220;Damages suffered by persons subjected to treatment contrary to the above 
provisions shall be compensated for according to law, by the State with respect to the
