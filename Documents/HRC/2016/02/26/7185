<p><b>Cuba:  draft resolution 
</b></p>
<p><b>7/&#8230; The negative impact on the realization of the right to food of the worsening 
of the world food crisis, caused, inter alia, by soaring food prices 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> all previous resolutions and decisions on the issue of the right to food 
adopted in the framework of the United Nations, in particular by the General Assembly, in its 
resolution 62/164 of 18 December 2007, and the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 7/14 
of 27 March 2008, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides that everyone 
has the right to a standard of living adequate for her or his health and well-being, including food, 
the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition and the United Nations 
Millennium Declaration, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further</i> the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, in which the fundamental right of every person to be free from hunger is 
recognized, </p>

<p>A/HRC/S-7/L.1 
page 2 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food 
Summit Plan of Action and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, adopted 
in Rome on 13 June 2002, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to 
Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National 
Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations in November 2004, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same 
footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming further</i> that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic 
environment, at both the national and international levels, is the essential foundation that will 
enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the worsening of the world food crisis, caused inter alia by soaring food 
prices, creates a situation in which the right to adequate food is threatened to be violated on an 
unprecedented scale, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses</i> grave concern at the worsening of the world food crisis, caused inter alia 
by soaring food prices, which seriously undermines the realization of the right to food for all; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls upon</i> Member States and other relevant stakeholders to participate actively in 
the High-level Conference on World Food Security: the Challenges of Climate Change and 
Bioenergy, to be held from 3 to 5 June 2008, in Rome, organized by the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to attend and present a written 
contribution to the High-level Conference on World Food Security, so as to help mainstream a 
human rights perspective in the analysis of world food crises, with a focus on the realization of 
the right to food; </p>

<p> A/HRC/S-7/L.1 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Invites</i> the General Assembly to consider calling, as soon as possible, a special 
session in order to take the necessary decisions aimed at responding rapidly to the emergency 
created by the worsening of the world food crisis, taking into account the results and 
recommendations of the High-level Conference on World Food Security; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue reporting on further 
developments on this issue to the Council and the General Assembly.
