<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conduct of the visit 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography made an official visit to France from 21 November to 2 December 2011.1 She 
met with a number of stakeholders involved in the issues covered by her mandate in the 
cities of Paris, Lyons, Marseilles and Bordeaux.2 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the French Government for having arranged 
meetings with the official bodies, and for its cooperation before, during and after her visit.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur held discussions with the Minister for Solidarity and Social 
Cohesion, as well as with the Secretary of State responsible for the family and 
representatives of her ministry. The Special Rapporteur met representatives of the Ministry 
of Foreign and European Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Justice, the 
Ministry of Education, the Subdirectorate for Tourism at the Ministry of the Economy, 
Finance and Industry, as well as of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Health 
(see appendix). The Special Rapporteur also met with representatives of the General 
Councils involved in the work of the Child Social Welfare Service (ASE). She spoke with 
the Defender of Rights and his deputy, the National Consultative Council of Human Rights 
(CNCDH), the Chairperson of the Higher Council for Adoption, a member of parliament 
and representatives of the Public Interest Group Children at Risk (GIPED). The Special 
Rapporteur also met with officials from the International Criminal Police Organization 
(INTERPOL). 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur also held discussions with representatives of the UNICEF 
France Committee. She met representatives of civil society and the private sector and 
visited reception centres for children at risk. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Purposes of the visit 
</b></p>
<p>5. The purpose of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit was to establish the scale and impact 
of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and to look at the general 
child protection framework, the initiatives and measures taken by the French Government, 
local authorities, members of third-sector associations and private-sector stakeholders in 
terms of prevention and to protect, care for and reintegrate children, as well as the penalties 
meted out to the perpetrators of such crimes and those who exploit children. The Special 
Rapporteur paid particular attention to the causes and risk factors at the root of these 
problems.  
</p>
<p>6. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur consulted the various stakeholders involved 
in child protection, discussing both the measures that had proved successful and those in 
need of strengthening, with a view to elaborating specific and targeted recommendations 
that were appropriate to the context and viable.  
</p>
<p>  
 1  The second visit undertaken under the mandate, her predecessor having visited France in 2002. 
 2 This report largely focuses on metropolitan France; the Special Rapporteur did not visit the Overseas 
</p>
<p>Departments and Territories and was not therefore able to obtain enough information in that regard. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 </b>GE.12-11044  (EXT) 
</p>
<p><b> II. Situation analysis 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Scale and forms of the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography 
</b></p>
<p>7. The true scale of these problems remains difficult to gauge because of their 
clandestine nature and the lack of centralized and disaggregated data.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Sale of children 
</b></p>
<p>8. The sale of children in France appears to be limited. The police services and some 
judges mentioned a case prosecuted in 2007 which involved the sale, between 2003 and 
2006, of 22 babies of Bulgarian origin. The children had apparently been sold for between 
&#8364;6,000 and &#8364;15,000 for illegal adoption by French families. The police services also cited 
an isolated attempt to sell a baby in the car park of an Angoul&#234;me supermarket. Some of the 
associations consulted also raised cases of the sale of young girls, mainly from sub-Saharan 
Africa, for the purposes of sexual exploitation3 or to be sold as domestic labour (one case 
was cited in Paris and another in Marseilles). 
</p>
<p>9. It is difficult to determine the true scale of sale for international adoption. However, 
given the large number of French families wishing to adopt (30,000) and the possibility of 
resorting to individual adoption procedures, the adoption of foreign children through 
commercial intermediaries continues to pose a significant risk. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Child prostitution 
</b></p>
<p>10. None of the services consulted was able to provide the kind of official data &#8212; 
disaggregated by gender, profile, age and status &#8212; on the victims or on the perpetrators 
apprehended and prosecuted that could provide an overview of child prostitution. 
According to many of the stakeholders consulted, child prostitution in France mainly 
involves foreign minors (whether or not unaccompanied), mainly from Eastern Europe or 
sub-Saharan Africa, and sometimes the victims of trafficking networks. To a more limited 
extent, it may also involve unaccompanied minors or minors who have run away (from 
their hostel or from reception centres) and are using prostitution to secure a livelihood.  
</p>
<p>11. The police services consulted recognized that little was known about child 
prostitution and that it was a difficult issue to come to grips with, but they did not consider 
that it was on the increase. The police had, however, observed a constant increase in sexual 
assaults on minors, and that development was confirmed by the forensic medical unit at 
Cr&#233;teil intercommunal hospital centre.4  
</p>
<p>12. The police services of the Paris Prefecture reported about a dozen children working 
as prostitutes in the area around the Gare du Nord in Paris, as well as a few other cases 
around the Bois Boulogne, largely involving minors from Eastern Europe. The Minors 
Brigades <i>(brigades de protection des mineurs)</i> in Lyons, Bordeaux and Marseilles provided 
vague estimates identifying only between two and seven cases annually. It emerged from 
the conversations which the Special Rapporteur had that the minors who were the victims 
of sexual exploitation were between 14 and 18 years-old. The statistics provided by the 
Parisian police services are in marked contrast to the estimates provided by the associations 
involved in protecting minors, who are the victims of prostitution, which carry out regular 
</p>
<p>  
 3  Largely noted by those associations in the 18th district of Paris. 
 4  See paragraph 70 below. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.12-11044  (EXT) <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>patrols. According to those associations, there are about one hundred minors who are the 
victims of sexual exploitation in Paris. One of the associations, which focuses its efforts at 
identifying victims principally in the 18th district of Paris, has apparently identified some 
40 minors, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, who are the victims of prostitution.  
</p>
<p>13. The research and interviews conducted by the Special Rapporteur have highlighted 
the clear absence of a centralized system of information and data collection that would 
make it possible to provide reliable disaggregated data. The last study commissioned by the 
Ministry of Justice5 on the subject dates back to 2006 and does not consider the problem 
over the country as a whole, which again underscores the need for a more comprehensive 
and updated analysis of the problem.6  
</p>
<p>14. As regards sexual tourism involving children, the Central Office for Combating 
Violence against the Person (<i>Office central pour la r&#233;pression des violences aux personnes</i>, 
OCRVP) mentioned 20 French offenders apprehended since 2007. But, according to those 
consulted, that is far from the true figure, given the difficulty in obtaining information from 
destination countries 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>15. As far as child pornography is concerned, all of the stakeholders consulted were 
unanimous in confirming that there had been a worrying increase in recent years, with a 
growing pattern and viewing of child pornography images on the Internet, but also 
increasingly violent images and ever younger victims.  
</p>
<p>16. The Central Office for the Repression of Human Trafficking noted that these crimes 
were more often the work of individuals (who could have entirely different profiles) than of 
criminal networks. The National Gendarmerie services for the prevention of cybercrime 
flagged up the figure of 600 reports annually and 106 victims identified in France by the 
police services, out of a total of more than 1 million images collected in the database. The 
Association of Internet Access and Service Providers <i>(Association des fournisseurs d&#8217;acc&#232;s 
et de services Internet)</i> (AFA) recorded a peak of 8,000 reports between 2004 and 2005.7 
</p>
<p>17. According to the police services, the number of instances of grooming on the 
Internet has reached alarming proportions. A cyber-infiltration exercise8 had revealed that 
in less than five minutes about a dozen adults were explicitly grooming children for sexual 
purposes.  
</p>
<p>18. A new development in recent years involves the circulation of pornographic 
photographs or films, which are sent by young girls to their partners and then distributed 
without their consent.  
</p>
<p>19. The circulation of all of those images has irreparable consequences for the victims, 
in both the short and the long term, because once they have been put into circulation, they 
can never be completely withdrawn and may re-emerge at any moment in their life.9  
</p>
<p>  
 5  <i>La prostitution de mineurs &#224; Paris</i>, commissioned from the Anthropos consultancy by the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Justice. 
 6  The Children&#8217;s Ombudsperson raised the possibility of making a problem-oriented study of the issue. 
 7  Substantiated by the Act on numerical reliability promulgated in 2004. 
 8  Act 2007-297 enabled the police services to establish cyber patrols and even exchange illegal files for 
</p>
<p>infiltration purposes. 
 9  Only the &#8220;Photo DNA&#8221; system makes it possible to prevent re-victimization by preventing a 
</p>
<p>photograph from being uploaded on to a network. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 </b>GE.12-11044  (EXT) 
</p>
<p>20. However, all of the statistics put forward are far from reflecting the true scale of the 
problem, particularly because of the lack of human resources devoted to the issue. The 
difficulty in preventing child pornography, which has a cross-border dimension, is basically 
the consequence of the alarming rise in such crimes, the ultra-sophisticated technologies 
used by the criminals which are difficult to penetrate (ultra-secure encrypted peer-to-peer 
forums such as <i>Gigatribe</i>) and the fact that the identification of victims is highly dependent 
on the quality of the technological expertise and access to the information that is held by 
the Internet access providers.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Causes and risk factors 
</b></p>
<p>21. The factors underlying the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
are multiple and correlated: on the one hand, pressure factors (absent or dysfunctional 
families, economic instability, mobility/migration, children&#8217;s ease of access to information 
and communication technologies which it is difficult to control, early hyper-sexualization 
of children, dropping out of school, absconding, etc.) and, on the other, the demand factors 
(international increase in demand for sexual services involving children, very profitable sex 
industry, increasingly structured abuser networks, increasingly sophisticated technologies, 
swift and frequent development of sexual tourism destinations involving children and high 
demand for international adoption).  
</p>
<p>22. Some categories of children are more vulnerable, namely: children living on or 
wandering the streets; children placed in an institution [according to the National 
Observatory for Children at Risk (<i>Observatoire national de l&#8217;enfance en danger</i>, ONED),10 
more than 267,000 children had been taken into care by the ASE at 31 December 2008 
(an increase of 6 per cent compared with 2004)]; children who are the victims of sexual 
abuse within the family; children who are drug- or alcohol-dependent; and unaccompanied 
foreign minors11 (estimated to number between 6,000 and 8,000), some of whom are the 
victims of trafficking networks seeking to use them for sexual purposes, begging or for 
crime.  
</p>
<p>23. France has currently to contend with a deteriorating economic situation: 
unemployment (in the second quarter of 2011, the employment rate in France was 9.2 per 
cent); insecurity and poverty (there were 8.2 million people living below the poverty line in 
2009, nearly 2 million of them children);12 housing difficulties or homelessness [16,000 
children under 18 had no fixed abode in 2005,13 making it difficult for them to enrol in 
school (enrolment being contingent on domicile)]; dropping out from school (according to 
the Ministry of Education&#8217;s Directorate-General of School Education, 230,000 children 
have dropped out of school) despite the legislation in force (any child, whatever their 
gender or nationality, is entitled to receive free, compulsory education between the ages of 
6 and 16) and the efforts made by the Government.14

</b></p>
<p>GE.12-11044  (EXT) <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>24. All of the stakeholders consulted were concerned at the early hyper-sexualization of 
children as a result, among other things, of their being exposed to pornographic material 
which had a marked impact on their sexual conduct. This was borne out by the increase in 
the number of sexual assaults committed by one minor on another, the rise in the abortion 
rate and the use of the morning-after pill by adolescents,15 and the availability online of 
erotic photographs and videos of sexual acts carried out by minors. Sex education 
programmes, which have been made compulsory by statute, have been introduced to tackle 
the problem. However, given the early age of sexual relations, some contributors propose 
that such programmes should be systematically provided from primary level.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Measures to combat and prevent the sale of children,  
child prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Regional and international instruments for the promotion and 
protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>25. France ratified the Convention on the Rights of Child in 1990.16 It further ratified, in 
2003, the two additional protocols to the Convention: the Optional Protocol on the 
Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and the Optional Protocol on the Sale of 
Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. 
</p>
<p>26. France is a State party to all of the main international human rights treaties except 
for the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers 
and Members of their Families. 
</p>
<p>27. In 1990, France ratified International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 
No. 138 concerning the Minimum Age for Admission to Employment (1973) and, in 2001, 
it ratified ILO Convention No. 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour (1999). France 
also ratified, in 1998, the Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect 
of Intercountry Adoption (1993) and, in 2002, it ratified the supplementary Protocol to 
Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children 
(2000). 
</p>
<p>28. As a Member State of the European Union and the Council of Europe, France has 
ratified many regional instruments, including the European Convention on the Exercise of 
Children&#8217;s Rights (2007) and the Council of Europe&#8217;s Convention on the Protection of 
Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, known as the Lanzarote 
Convention, (2010). France is in the process of transposing into national law Directive 
2011/93/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on combating the sexual abuse 
and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, and replacing Council 
Framework Decisions 2004/68/JHA, and the resolution adopted, in 2011, by the General 
Assembly of INTERPOL, promoting victim-centric management of child abuse at the 
national level. Ratification of the Council of Europe&#8217;s Convention on preventing and 
combating violence against women and domestic violence is under way.  
</p>
<p>  
 15  According to the mother and child protection services in Lyons. 
 16  France has entered declarations in regard to articles 6, 30 and 40, as well as reservations in regard to 
</p>
<p>articles 30 and 40. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8 </b>GE.12-11044  (EXT) 
</p>
<p><b> B. National legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. General legislative framework for child protection 
</b></p>
<p>29. The mechanism for child protection is essentially rooted in Framework Act 
No. 2007-293 on the reform of child protection. The main objectives of that piece of 
legislation are to: prevent ill-treatment; improve the early warning system; identify the 
threat of risks to minors; and diversify the methods of intervening and of supporting 
children and their families. The framework act also clarified the rules on professional 
secrecy and stepped up training for professionals. Without interfering with the overall 
arrangements, the legislation has restricted systematic recourse to the justice system in 
favour of social measures. It has improved the circulation of information between the 
various stakeholders in the system, particularly the ASE and the judicial authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Sale of children 
</b></p>
<p>30. While French law does not contain provisions specifically banning the sale of 
children, as defined by the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and 
Child Pornography, the Criminal Code contains many provisions under which sale in 
various forms is punishable by law. 
</p>
<p>31. French law prohibits offering for sale, handing over or accepting a child, whatever 
the means used or the intended aim: for the purposes of the sexual exploitation of the child 
(see the section below); for the purpose of transferring the child&#8217;s organs for payment 
(art. 511-2 to 511-5 of the Criminal Code); for the purposes of forced labour [prosecution 
for conditions of work contrary to the dignity of the person or complicity in that offence 
(art. 225-14 to 225-16 of the Criminal Code)]; or for the purposes of illegal adoption 
(art. 227-12, paras. 1 to 3, of the Criminal Code).  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Child prostitution 
</b></p>
<p>32. French law protects minors who engage in prostitution, even on an occasional basis, 
since they are regarded as children at risk and benefit from the protection of the juvenile 
court judge under the educational welfare procedure (art. 13-II of Act No. 2002-305 of 4 
March 2002).17 
</p>
<p>33. French law specifically punishes both the person using the child prostitute and the 
person who benefits as a result, namely the procurer.  
</p>
<p>34. Articles 225-12-1 and 225-12-2 of the Criminal Code penalize &#8220;soliciting, accepting 
or obtaining, in return for payment or the promise of payment, relations of a sexual nature 
from a minor engaging in prostitution, including on an occasional basis&#8221;.18  
</p>
<p>35. Procuring is punishable under articles 225-7 and 225-7-1 by 10 years&#8217; imprisonment 
and a fine of &#8364;1,500,000 when committed in relation to a minor, and by 15 years&#8217; 
imprisonment and a fine of &#8364;3,000,000 when committed in relation to a minor under the age 
of 15.  
</p>
<p>36. It is important to note that, pursuant to article 7, paragraph 3, of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, the time-limit for bringing a prosecution (10 years) in respect of 
</p>
<p>  
 17  The guarantee of protection is reinforced by the Act of 5 March 2007, although prime responsibility 
</p>
<p>for protecting children at risk now resides with the General Council. 
 18 The penalties may vary between 3 and 5 years imprisonment and a fine of between &#8364; 45,000 and 
</p>
<p>&#8364;75,000. The penalties are increased to 7 years imprisonment and a fine of &#8364;100,000 where the victim 
is a minor under the age of 15. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.12-11044  (EXT) <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>crimes committed against minors does not begin to run until a minor has reached the age of 
majority. 
</p>
<p>37. Article 225-12-3 provides that these penalties are applicable even if the offences are 
committed abroad by a French national or a person ordinarily resident in French territory. 
That extraterritorial jurisdiction therefore enables France to act in cases of sexual tourism 
involving children. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>38. The law penalizes producers of child pornography images and the consumers and 
perpetrators of crimes who use the Internet for sexual exploitation (art. 225-7 of the 
Criminal Code) or for grooming a minor (art. 227-22-1 of the Criminal Code).  
</p>
<p>39. For example, the law prohibits the fixing, recording or transmission of pornographic 
images of minors with a view to their distribution (art. 227-23); the distribution of 
pornographic images if likely to be viewed by a minor (art. 227-24); and habitually viewing 
or possessing child pornography images (art. 227-23).19 The pornographic representation of 
minors includes any montage constructed using photographs of children, but it also includes 
entirely virtual images of a paedophile nature (montage or drawing). 
</p>
<p>40. Act No. 2007-297 of 5 March 2007 established the responsibility of Internet website 
hosts by introducing a system of self-regulation, based on informatics and prevention, for 
which professionals in the sector bear responsibility.20  
</p>
<p>41. Act No. 2011-267 of 14 March 2011 (LOPPSI 2 &#8211; <i>Loi d&#8217;orientation et de 
programmation pour la s&#233;curit&#233; interne</i>) called into question the arrangements provided for 
under the Act on confidence in the digital economy (the LCEN &#8211; <i>Loi pour la confiance 
dans l&#8217;&#233;conomie num&#233;rique</i> &#8211; of 21 June 2004) and made it possible to require Internet 
access providers to block access to websites publishing child pornography content. A 
blacklist of sites, which is not published, is drawn up by the police services; for their part, 
the Internet service providers are required to block access to such sites and filter the 
Internet protocol addresses designated by administrative order. Some of the stakeholders 
consulted voiced reservations about the actual effectiveness of the act which, while 
blocking sites, does not make it possible to eliminate their content. 
</p>
<p>42. All of the stakeholders consulted agreed that France had a very solid legislative 
framework which imposed severe penalties on offenders. However, the police services 
expressed some regret at the slowness of the judicial process and the fact that the judicial 
system minimized the seriousness of certain cases of cyber child pornography because of 
the &#8220;virtual&#8221; aspect of the crime. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur noted the difficulties encountered by the various 
stakeholders in getting to grips with the plethora of constantly changing child protection 
legislation. The representatives of the Ministry of Justice also flagged up the legislative 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>(&#8220;pornographic images of a person whose physical appearance is that of a minor&#8221;). 
 20 The warning &#8220;may not be access by minors&#8221; <i>(mise &#224; disposition des mineurs interdite)</i> becomes 
</p>
<p>mandatory if a document poses a risk to young people because of its pornographic nature. That act, 
supplemented by the Decree for the suppression of certain forms of computer crime and the 
prevention of child pornography of 30 March 2009, has given officers and officials with 
responsibility in the field the possibility of &#8220;taking part in electronic exchanges using a pseudonym; 
being in contact via that exchange with persons likely to have committed offences; extracting, 
transmitting in response to a specific request, acquiring or storing illegal content in conditions laid 
down by decree&#8221; (cyber-infiltration). </p>

</p>
<p>inflation taking place at European Union and the Council of Europe level, which 
constituted an additional burden in terms of the transposition and application of that 
legislation. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Juvenile justice system 
</b></p>
<p>44. The 1945 order on young offenders, which has been recast on numerous occasions, 
is the cornerstone of the juvenile justice system in France. It had provided for judges 
(juvenile court judges) and specialist courts (juveniles courts and juvenile assize courts), as 
well as for the focus to be on educating rather than punishing, by taking into account a 
child&#8217;s background and personality in order to determine the most appropriate response 
possible. 
</p>
<p>45. The provision of care for foreign unaccompanied minors is contingent on proof that 
they really are minors.21 Despite the legislation22 which attaches priority to the documents 
establishing minority, the authenticity of the documentation provided by minors is often 
challenged, in some cases requiring birth certificates with identity photographs.23 As soon 
as he or she is detained in a holding area, a foreign unaccompanied minor who does not 
have a civil-status document, or whose identity papers are challenged, may be subject to a 
forensic report (including bone tests) carried out by the medical-judicial facility with local 
responsibility. However, the medical profession does not recognize the reliability of bone 
tests, as the margin of error is at least 18 months, particularly from the age of 15.24 As 
policy on migration has been tightened, bone tests are carried out extensively. Children 
declared to have reached the age of majority are then either immediately excluded from the 
ASE arrangements &#8212; without even giving them time to provide proof that they are in fact 
minors, thus leaving them alone and on the streets, from one moment to the next, with no 
money and nowhere to turn to &#8212; or placed in holding centres to await deportation.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur shares the concerns of many of the stakeholders consulted, 
including the CNCDH and UNICEF, in regard to the punitive approach adopted in recent 
years in the field of juvenile justice. From the Perben I and II Acts of 2002 and 2004 to Act 
No. 2011-939 of 10 August 2011 on citizens&#8217; participation in the operation of the criminal 
justice system and the prosecution of minors, and including Act No. 2007-297 on the 
prevention of [youth] crime, it is clear that penalties have been, and are increasingly being, 
stepped up. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Institutional child protection framework 
</b></p>
<p>47. The organization of child protection in France is based on a particularly complex 
structure involving many stakeholders. Since the legislation on decentralization, which was 
introduced between 1983 and 1986, responsibilities for child protection have been devolved 
to the <i>d&#233;partements</i> (General Councils). The State does, however, have a role to play in the 
system of protection: it has sovereign powers under the laws and provisions governing the 
conditions under which the social welfare bodies may intervene, as well as responsibilities 
</p>
<p>  
 21  According to article 47 of the Civil Code, foreign civil-status documents are regarded as authentic but 
</p>
<p>subject to a number of conditions, which are set out in the circular of 1 April 2003 on fraud in relation 
to foreign civil-status documents submitted to the French authorities. 
</p>
<p> 22  Article 47 of the Civil Code. 
 23  Most birth certificates do not include a photograph. 
 24  It is established that if there is doubt as to whether, in the light of the medical examination, a young 
</p>
<p>person is a minor, the young person must be given the benefit of the doubt and, in those 
circumstances, automatically be declared to be a minor. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.12-11044  (EXT) <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>in the judicial field. The State also retains a presence through the many institutions involved 
in child protection: the police services; the hospitals and the national education system. The 
arrangements for child protection are twofold, taking the form of administrative protection 
(General Council) and judicial protection (public prosecutor and juvenile court judge). 
</p>
<p>48. The Ministry of Solidarity and Social Cohesion prepares and implements French 
Government policy in regard to solidarity and social cohesion. The Directorate-General for 
Social Cohesion drives forward the national policies of solidarity, social development and 
the promotion of equality. Its Director-General performs the role of inter-ministerial 
delegate for the family and heads the Subdirectorate for children and the family which 
oversees child protection policy. During discussions with the Special Rapporteur, the 
Minister of Solidarity and the Minister of State responsible for the family stressed that, as 
far as child protection was concerned, prevention was a priority for the Ministry, 
particularly by way of the national policy on parenting support.25 Under a call for projects, 
the National Fund for financing child protection26 allocated, in June 2011, &#8364;6 million 
distributed among 48 innovative projects.27 Some stakeholders consulted expressed regret 
that the funds had been deployed very late and frugally. 
</p>
<p>49. The <i>d&#233;partements</i> have a pivotal role in the arrangements for the administrative 
protection of children, linking up closely with the judicial protection system. The 
responsibilities of the ASE are entrusted to the General Councils. Defined by the Social 
Welfare and Family Code, and revised by the act of 5 March 2007, those responsibilities 
include measures of prevention and support for the benefit of children and families 
experiencing psycho-social difficulties, and child care measures which may take the form 
of a variety of support measures, placement with a foster family or in an institution.28 Each 
General Council organizes its responsibilities as it considers most appropriate, within the 
framework of the various laws governing its actions and taking account of the powers 
reserved for the State. The General Councils organize ASE on the basis of five-year 
departmental child protection strategies. As set out in the 2007 act, through its units 
responsible for collecting information giving rise to concern and its departmental child 
protection monitoring services, the General Council is also the linchpin in the system for 
collecting and evaluating information giving rise to concern and relating to children at risk. 
The General Councils also provide the public health services for the protection of the 
maternal and child health and work closely with the other social services such as the 
regional health agencies. The <i>d&#233;partements</i> have also to deal with the heavy burden of 
responsibility,29 which has grown significantly in recent years as a result of the arrival of 
increasing numbers of unaccompanied foreign minors. This additional care burden has led 
to significant tensions, as the General Councils consider that the reception of foreigners, 
their admission and the issuing of a residence permit are traditionally sovereign State 
responsibilities. The issue has led to a rift between the partners responsible for child 
</p>
<p>  
 25 The objectives of combating poverty, which, according to the commitment entered into by the 
</p>
<p>Government in 2007, should fall by a third between now and 2012, have also been emphasized by the 
Directorate-General for Social Cohesion DGCS. The objectives include reducing child poverty. 
</p>
<p> 26  Set up under the act of 5 March 2007. In 2011, the Fund&#8217;s total revenue amounted to &#8364;40 million. 
 27  The purpose of the Fund was to offset the cost to the <i>d&#233;partements</i> of implementing the act and to 
</p>
<p>support activities falling within the scope of the reform. The projects funded largely correspond to the 
latter objective. 
</p>
<p> 28 No measure of administrative protection may be set in place without the agreement of the parents. 
Where their agreement cannot be obtained or the situation of the child requires the imposition of 
mandatory measures which affect the exercise of parental authority, the juvenile court judge is asked 
to intervene.

</p>
<p>protection arrangements, and, in several <i>d&#233;partements</i>, they have engaged in a veritable 
trial of strength.30 Many professionals involved in ASE activities expressed their regret at 
seeing the State gradually withdraw from the area of child protection.  
</p>
<p>50. It should be noted that there are differences between the General Councils in terms 
of approaches, practices, programmes and the allocation of resources. In addition, the 
implementation of the multi-year strategy remains highly dependent on the budgets 
allocated annually.  
</p>
<p>51. The Ministry of Justice is responsible for the judicial protection of children through 
its prosecutors and juvenile court judges. The act of 5 March 2007 clearly stipulated that 
intervention by the judiciary was subsidiary to administrative protection, which means that 
a situation must not be reported to the prosecutor and an educational support measure 
ordered by the juvenile court judge unless intervention by the General Council is not 
enough to resolve an at-risk situation. This principle of subsidiarity has been put into effect 
by reformulating the criteria governing the mandatory referral to the judicial authorities of 
situations of children at risk, or likely to become at risk, in such a way as to make them 
more restrictive.31 The new provisions were intended to remedy certain shortcomings, 
including: the lack of coordination between stakeholders; the watering down of 
responsibilities; the tendency excessively to refer reports and measures to the courts leading 
to a backlog at prosecutors&#8217; offices; an increase in the time taken to process cases; and 
increased distrust of social workers by families. The various prosecutor&#8217;s office and 
juvenile court judges consulted generally stressed that cooperation with the ASE services 
was good, but they pointed out that the number of cases referred to them remained very 
high and that it had not been possible to resolve the problem of an overburdened judicial 
system.  
</p>
<p>52. Since the 2007 reform, the Department for the judicial protection of young people 
has seen its responsibilities in relation to educational support cut and the focus shifted to the 
criminal aspect. It was none the less tasked, in December 2010, with providing 
inter-ministerial coordination in order to improve coordination between the different 
stakeholders and harmonization of practices and procedures to secure better care for 
unaccompanied foreign minors. The representatives of the Department for the judicial 
protection of young people highlighted a number of difficulties in that regard during their 
conversations with the Special Rapporteur, including the position of minors approaching 
their majority and the slow pace and complex nature of the asylum-seeking process. 
</p>
<p>53. Along with the various police services involved, and most particularly the Minors 
Brigades <i>(brigades de protection des mineurs)</i>, the Ministry of the Interior plays a key role 
in protecting children from sexual exploitation, sale and trafficking. While some Minors 
Brigades deal solely with victims who are minors (the Parisian Minors Brigade has a 
section which deals exclusively with sexual assault on minors), others deal with both 
minors who are victims and minors who have committed offences. The resources allocated 
vary from one brigade to another32. The different brigades33 with which the Special 
Rapporteur met explained that the limited resources available to them meant that they were 
</p>
<p>  
 30  Particularly in Seine-Saint-Denis during the second half of 2011. 
 31  That referral is now mandatory in three sets of circumstances: if the administrative protection set in 
</p>
<p>place has failed to yield effective results; if the parents refuse the support measures offered by the 
services of the General Council; or if it is impossible to evaluate the situation. 
</p>
<p> 32  The Paris BPM, for example, has 85 staff members specializing in assaults on minors (compared with 
14 in Bordeaux). 
</p>
<p> 33  Cases involving minors who have been the victims of prostitution may also be referred to the 
Anti-procurement Squad <i>(Brigade de r&#233;pression de prox&#233;n&#233;tisme)</i> (formerly the Vice Squad &#8211; 
<i>Brigade des moeurs</i>). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.2

</b></p>
<p>no longer able to conduct patrols (or exercises to identify children at risk on the streets) as 
often as in the past. 
</p>
<p>54. The OCRVP focuses 90 per cent of its activity on combating child pornography and 
10 per cent on sexual tourism involving children. With a particularly expert staff, the group 
provides its expertise to the territorial departments of the police services. It also acts as the 
central national INTERPOL office and as the EUROPOL contract point. The Central Office 
for Combating Cybercrime linked to Information and Communications Technologies holds 
the blacklist of Internet sites to be blocked because of their child pornography content.  
</p>
<p>55. The Department for combating cybercrime within the National Gendarmerie also 
plays a key role in preventing cyber child pornography. With only five non-commissioned 
officers who conduct investigations and two analysts from the National centre for the 
analysis of child pornography images, this police service is not able to process all of the 
offences which need to be dealt with. They engage in cyber infiltration (as do the OCRVP, 
the Paris Minors Brigade and some sections of the National Gendarmerie). The National 
Gendarmerie and police services work closely together in combating cyber child 
pornography in order to prevent any duplication. The Special Rapporteur noted, however, 
that their work would be made easier and they would be more effective, if all of the 
services involved were coordinated by a single body. 
</p>
<p>56. National policy on adoption in France is steered by the Ministry of Solidarity and 
Social Cohesion, relying on the opinion of the Higher Council for Adoption. Set up in 
2009, the International adoption service (Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs) is the 
central authority for international adoptions, as provided for under the Convention on 
Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of InterCountry Adoption. It draws up a 
strategy for intercountry adoption after consulting the other French stakeholders involved in 
intercountry adoption: the French Adoption Agency and the 34 authorized adoption 
agencies.34 The stakeholders consulted highlighted the mismatch between the number of 
children available for adoption and the demand. A new bill designed, among other things, 
to facilitate national adoptions, improve the process of according approval and secure the 
Agency&#8217;s accreditation in all countries was due to be debated in the National Assembly in 
early 2012.35 
</p>
<p>57. The Ministry of Education helps protect children through its educational policy of 
risk prevention but also through its educational establishments, working closely with the 
General Councils. As well as providing information and awareness-raising, in cases of risk 
or the likelihood of risk, these establishments forward the information giving rise to 
concern to the president of the General Council and report the most serious circumstances 
to the State Prosecutor.  
</p>
<p>58. GIPED, comprising the National Monitoring Service for Children at Risk (ONED) 
and the National Helpline for Children at Risk (119 &#8211; <i>All&#244; Enfance en danger</i>, a freephone 
number funded by the State), is a key player in the child protection system. ONED is tasked 
with collating the statistics collected for the purpose of better coordinating interventions, 
making an inventory of and evaluating the practices of prevention, screening and care of 
children, and conducting studies. Since the act of 5 March 2007, ONED has in particular 
been tasked with collecting from the departmental child protection monitoring services all 
</p>
<p>  
 34 In 2010, 3,504 children were adopted abroad by French families. Haiti was the main source of 
</p>
<p>adoptive children (992 children), followed by Ethiopia, Vietnam, the Russia Federation and 
Colombia. Only 800 French children are available for adoption annually. 
</p>
<p> 35  The adoption system in France was reformed in 2005, but the reform was subsequently judged to be 
inadequate. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 </b>GE.12-11044  (EXT) 
</p>
<p>of the data relating to information giving rise to concern that has been collected and 
processed within their territory.  
</p>
<p>59. The professionals working in GIPED stressed the challenges posed by coordinating 
among the different stakeholders involved in child protection and the efforts made by 
ONED to develop tools to ensure a common perception, as the very concept of children at 
risk remains problematic. 
</p>
<p>60. The third sector also plays an important role in child protection. Within the 
framework of contractual undertakings entered into with the <i>d&#233;partements</i> or the State, it 
assumes the role of intermediary or service provider by carrying out patrols,36 providing 
assistance in an open environment, reception, accommodation and care, as well as the 
reintegrating children or young adults.  
</p>
<p><i>  National coordination and strategy 
</i></p>
<p>61. The complex nature of the child protection framework and the large number of 
stakeholders, but also the sensitive relationship between the administrative and judicial 
branches make coordination particularly difficult.  
</p>
<p>62. Many efforts have been made in that regard, by ONED in particular.37 In addition, 
the Directorate-General for Social Cohesion is responsible for enhancing cooperation 
between the State, the local authorities and the associations either through its exchanges 
with the Assembly of French <i>D&#233;partements</i> or directly with the local authorities; it is also 
involved in the inter-ministerial work on social welfare. The Special Rapporteur noted, 
however, that the efforts at coordination undertaken would benefit from being stepped up, 
including by defining the areas of competence and the responsibilities of those involved in 
child protection. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur noted that while the act of 5 March 2007 is the framework 
recognized by all stakeholders, there is no genuine integrated national child protection 
strategy based on an approach with the focus is on the rights of the child.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Programmes of detection, care and child monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>64. Caring for and effectively protecting children who are the victims of sale, 
trafficking, abuse or sexual exploitation is a complex process that requires an 
interdisciplinary and holistic approach, which makes it possible to monitor the child from 
the point at which he or she is identified and taken into care (which may take the form of 
accommodation in a refuge centre) to that child&#8217;s rehabilitation/reintegration which it is 
essential to monitor, via a period of medical, legal and psychological support. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Identification, reporting and complaint procedures 
</b></p>
<p>65. In France, there are several methods of reporting or filing a complaint which are 
accessible to everyone, including children. A child victim may be identified in a number of 
ways. First of all, by using 119, a freephone service that operates around the clock. The 
purpose of the 119 service is to take calls concerning children who are at risk or likely to 
become at risk, in order to make it easier to protect them. The service is also tasked with 
</p>
<p>  
 36  The aim of street patrols being to respond to immediate needs, to build a dialogue and help steer 
</p>
<p>minors to reception or support facilities. 
 37  For instance, the Technical steering committee established in 2011 for improved transmission to the 
</p>
<p>departmental child protection observatories and to ONED of empirical evidence of the child 
protection processes. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.12-11044  (EXT) <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>passing information giving rise to concern to the appropriate services of the General 
Councils or to report it directly to the prosecutor&#8217;s office if the information obtained 
justifies this. The police services, doctors, school staff, social workers, children themselves 
or any other person within their environment may also make a report to the ASE services or 
to the prosecutor&#8217;s office.38 
</p>
<p>66. As regards complaints of sexual abuse on the Internet, several avenues for reporting 
such abuse have been established, including via the contact point set in place by the 
Association of Internet Access and Service Providers (<i>Association des fournisseurs d&#8217;acc&#232;s 
et de services Internet</i> &#8211; AFA) and the official portal for reporting illegal content on the 
Ministry of the Interior&#8217;s website (www.internet-signalement.gouv.fr).  
</p>
<p>67. In November 2011, the OCRVP submitted a proposal for an online reporting system 
for cases of sexual tourism involving children, drawn up jointly with End Child Prostitution 
in Asian Tourism (ECPAT) (a network working for the prevention of child prostitution, 
child pornography and the trafficking of children for sexual purposes). A decree authorising 
the proposal will have to be issued before it can be put into effect.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Assistance to and care of children 
</b></p>
<p>68. Psycho-social support and integrated care for the victims of sexual crimes, and 
minors in particular, have been stepped up for several years now. For instance, article 
706-52 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, introduced by the Act of 17 June 1998 requires 
the audio-visual recording of a child victim&#8217;s evidence, particularly where that child is the 
victim of a sexual crime. In order to make the experience less traumatic for the minor, the 
act also provided that the taking of evidence from a child who has reported offences of a 
sexual nature must take place in the presence of either a psychologist, a child psychiatrist or 
a child specialist, or an ad hoc administrator or person appointed by the juvenile court 
judge. As emerged from a number of the interviews with the Special Rapporteur, some 
investigators direct the victim to a victim support group once the hearing is over.  
</p>
<p>69. During her visits to the Minors Brigades, the Special Rapporteur did, however, note 
that limited technical resources meant that it was not always possible to make video 
recordings.39 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>70. A noteworthy aspect of the care of the child, once he or she has been identified, is 
the existence in some hospitals of forensic medical units which specialize in taking 
evidence from the child. Victims thus benefit from multi-disciplinary care provided by 
psychologists and doctors. Specially fitted out interview rooms have been set up to ensure 
that the victim&#8217;s evidence is taken in the best possible way by specialist investigators, with 
the result that the child is not required to go through the painful process of having to repeat 
his or her account of the facts. The Special Rapporteur noted, however, that none of the 
Minors Brigades with which she met used these interview rooms. She visited the forensic 
medical unit at Cr&#233;teil hospital centre which has the advantage of offering a complete 
platform of care facilitating cooperation with the other services.  
</p>
<p>71. The General Councils spend more than &#8364;6 billion annually on child protection. 
Children at risk or likely to become at risk may be subject to a variety of care measures in 
</p>
<p>  
 38  In April 2011, at the instance of the High Authority for Health, the Ministry of Justice took part in the 
</p>
<p>preparation of a fact sheet for doctors entitled &#8220;Identification and reporting of incest by the medical 
profession: recognizing sexual abuse within the family in relation to minors&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 39  In some case, the recording camera had been out of action for several months. In another brigade, the 
interview room for victims had been converted for other uses, so that interviews took place in the 
investigators&#8217; own offices, on occasion at the same time as another victim was being interviewed. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16 </b>GE.12-11044  (EXT) 
</p>
<p>the form of educational support in the home by agreement, or care in a foster family or 
child protection facility.40  
</p>
<p>72. Children placed, by agreement, in care facilities run by either the ASE of by 
non-governmental organizations benefit from psychological and educational support. Some 
facilities offer a specific type of care, focusing on certain categories of minor, such as 
minors experiencing family break-up, unaccompanied foreign minors or young adults.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>73. The care of unaccompanied foreign minors, which is currently the focus of a major 
controversy, remains inadequate and varies from one <i>d&#233;partement</i> to another, as a result, 
among other things, of the capacities of those <i>d&#233;partements</i> which are taking in large 
numbers of these young people simply becoming overburdened. The Government has 
therefore set up a working group involving the State and the General Councils to identify 
solutions that will enable the young people to be distributed more evenly through the whole 
country. The majority of the professionals involved in caring for unaccompanied foreign 
minors also voiced great frustration regarding the efforts made to develop a way forward 
with these minors, who may then be deported once they reach the age of 18.  
</p>
<p>74. As regards children who are the victims of networks of exploitation, the various 
stakeholders have great difficulty in extracting them from the circle of exploitation, as the 
victims feel tied to their exploiters through fear or duty. As a rule, these minors run away 
from the centres which taken them in. In addition, the lack of alternatives for these minors, 
who are forced into prostitution, makes it hard to reintegrate them.  
</p>
<p>75. All of the stakeholders interviewed stressed a number of problems: namely the high 
numbers of children absconding from centres; &#8220;institutional vagrancy&#8221; with children 
moving from one facility to the next, resulting in a breakdown or discontinuity of care; the 
lack of safe facilities for children who are the victims of networks or procurers; the slow 
pace of judicial and asylum procedures; and the desperate shortage of places available with 
foster families and also in residential facilities, which is a major obstacle to providing 
appropriate care for children.  
</p>
<p>76. During these meetings and visits, disparities also emerged in relation to 
programmes, resources allocated and practices.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Reintegrating and monitoring children 
</b></p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur noted that there were few initiatives to ensure that the 
children taken into care by the ASE services were monitored. Limited resources mean that 
the stakeholders involved in child protection do not have the wherewithal to ensure 
monitoring of children, and so prioritize cases in need of urgent attention. Some 
<i>d&#233;partements</i>, such as the <i>d&#233;partements</i> of la Gironde and of Paris, have conducted 
selective studies on what has happened to children who have benefited from ASE support, 
but these monitoring arrangements have yet to be systematized.41 According to the 
representative of ASE Paris with whom the Special Rapporteur spoke, one third of persons 
currently of no fixed abode in Paris were &#8220;former ASE children&#8221;. That is an alarming 
statistic indicating that greater attention needs to be paid to reintegrating and monitoring 
these children  
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur noted that the process of caring for and monitoring the child 
victims who had been identified remains fragmented because there is no comprehensive 
</p>
<p>  
 40  All care programmes seek, as far as possible, to guarantee that the child&#8217;s family links are maintained.  
 41  The implementation of the Decree of 28 February 2011 organizing the anonymous transmission of 
</p>
<p>information on children at risk to the departmental observatories and to ONED should, however, 
make it possible to gain a better knowledge of these processes. </p>

<p>and integrated system, equipped with the necessary means and properly qualified resources, 
and tailored to children&#8217;s profile, experience and needs. Hence the need to implement 
relevant and personalized programmes which are provided by properly qualified staff.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Measures of prevention 
</b></p>
<p>79. Preventing any form of exploitation of minors is a lengthy task which must extend 
beyond mere awareness-raising campaigns. Effective protection attacks the root of the 
problem, including vulnerability factors, pressure and demand factors. 
</p>
<p>80. Many of the professionals working in child protection (the police services, 
health-care professionals, teachers, social workers, the third sector, etc.) visit schools to 
discuss directly with the children such issues as the problems of sexual violence and abuse, 
addiction (to drugs and alcohol), use of the Internet, [mobile] telephony, television and 
video games (the Ministry of Education draws up guides for educators in that regard).42 The 
Directorate of School Education regretted the fact that syllabuses do not include a specific 
slot for these sessions, and noted the difficulty in integrating them into other lessons. The 
Ministry of Health has set in place a significant number of preventive measures in relation 
to health (drugs, HIV, sexual health, etc.).43 
</p>
<p>81. Combating dropping out from school and a rise in truancy is a priority for the 
Ministry of Education which introduced parental support measures and a &#8220;parental 
responsibility contract&#8221;44 in 2006. The Special Rapporteur was sorry to see that the number 
of specialist support networks for pupils in difficulty was in decline. 
</p>
<p>82. In addition, advertising spots that pack a real punch are broadcast on French public 
television networks to bring to the attention of parents and children the dangers of 
inappropriate use of the Internet and other telecommunications media, as well as of video 
games. It would be helpful if these campaigns of education, information and 
awareness-raising were continued over the long term.  
</p>
<p>83. In partnership with the association <i>e-enfance</i>, the Ministry of Education provides an 
anonymous and confidential freephone line <i>(Net &#201;coute)</i>, aimed at children, to respond to 
their questions or problems concerning use of the Internet, [mobile] telephony or video 
games. The <i>Web de Net &#201;coute</i> website provides a link to the AFA reporting site. 
</p>
<p>84. The authorities have set in place various mechanisms to prevent offenders from 
re-offending.45 However, there has yet to be a specific study on offender profiles or on the 
increasing demand. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Training and capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>85. Appropriate and interdisciplinary training of professionals working with the children 
is a vital component of an effective policy of prevention. The Subdirectorate for training 
and capacity-building of the Ministry of the Interior provides police officers with 
high-quality in-service specialist training in relation to child victims, and that training is 
</p>
<p>  
 42 Since the 2011 Abortion Act, sessions on information and sex education have become compulsory 
</p>
<p>three times a year (they had been taken place for years but had not been made a formal requirement). 
 43 Some initiatives, like the &#8220;information cyber-spaces&#8221; <i>(cyberespaces d&#8217;information)</i> are particularly 
</p>
<p>innovative. 
 44  Repeated truancy may lead to the payment of family benefits being suspended. 
 45  For example, minimum sentences (act of 10 August 2007) and the national computerized database of 
</p>
<p>sex offenders (art. 706-53-1 <i>et seq.</i> of the Code of Criminal Procedure). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18 </b>GE.12-11044  (EXT) 
</p>
<p>also open to judges and social workers. However, limited resources mean that there are few 
trainers and they are able to provide only a limited amount of training. The Special 
Rapporteur also noted that training levels were uneven across the police services.46  
</p>
<p>86. Judges are required to complete five days of in-service training a year provided by 
the National College for the Judiciary, which offers a wide range of targeted modules and 
placements within other partner agencies in the justice system (Minors Brigades, Central 
Office for Combating Cybercrime linked to Information and Communications 
Technologies, etc.). On changing post (to become a juvenile court judge, for example), the 
judge must complete two weeks of prior training. 
</p>
<p>87. In recent years, many multi-disciplinary diplomas have been introduced, such as the 
diplomas in child protection, in forensic practices and in dealing with difficult adolescents.  
</p>
<p>88. Although education in human rights instruments, including in the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, is provided for in school syllabuses, the Special Rapporteur noted 
inadequate knowledge of not only those instruments but of a rights-centred approach, 
particularly in the case of some stakeholders working directly with children.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Participation of children 
</b></p>
<p>89. The 32 Young Ambassadors for Children&#8217;s Rights reporting to the Defender of 
Rights, under the citizenship initiative, meet with children in educational establishments but 
also in leisure centres and specialist facilities to raise children&#8217;s awareness of various issues 
relating to their rights, including protection against any form of violence and exploitation.47  
</p>
<p>90. The Young People&#8217;s Consultative Committee, made up of 20 young people between 
the ages of 14 and 18, meets twice a year with the Children&#8217;s Ombudsperson to discuss 
matters linked to the rights of the child. The Committee also contributes to preparing the 
thematic forums <i>Paroles aux jeunes</i> (Giving Young People a Voice). 
</p>
<p>91. The <i>Engagement Jeunes-&#201;ducation au d&#233;veloppement</i> (Engaging with Young 
People-Education in Development) service of UNICEF France performs a role of 
awareness-raising and advocacy in relation to the rights of the most vulnerable children in 
the world through its programmes Club UNICEF Jeunes, <i>Jeunes Ambassadeurs</i> and 
UNICEF Campus.48  
</p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur noted, however, that participation by children in France 
remains relatively limited. It was not clear that children were actively involved in decisions 
pertaining to them. During her discussions, the Special Rapporteur stressed, on a number of 
occasions, the importance of taking account of the words and views of children and 
regarding them as an integral part of the solutions to be applied in preventing, and 
protecting children from all forms of abuse, violence and exploitation. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Watchdogs 
</b></p>
<p>93. The Defender of Rights, a new body under the Constitution since 1 April 2011, 
combines the responsibilities of four other &#8212; previously separate &#8212; bodies: the 
</p>
<p>  
 46  The vast majority of the staff of the Paris and Bordeaux Minors Brigades had, for example, had that 
</p>
<p>training, whereas other brigades had received only very little such training. 
 47  Between September 2010 and June 2011, the Young Ambassadors met with 27,000 children.  
 48  For the moment, the awareness-raising and advocacy activities do not relate to the situation of the 
</p>
<p>rights of the child in France. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.12-11044  (EXT) <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>Ombudsman of the Republic, the Children&#8217;s Ombudsperson, the National Security Ethics 
Committee and the High Authority to Combat Discrimination and Promote Equality. The 
Defender of Rights may be approached directly and free of charge by any natural or legal 
person on various issues relating to the defence of rights and freedoms, and has its own 
powers of investigation. The Defender of Rights is assisted by deputies with expertise in all 
areas of its activity (defence of children, security ethics and combating discrimination). 
</p>
<p>94. The Deputy Children&#8217;s Ombudsperson, Vice-chairperson of the Council for the 
defence and promotion of the rights of the child, promotes the rights of the child and has 
powers to act on her own initiative.49 It is probably too soon to gauge the effectiveness of 
this new institution, but the Special Rapporteur took note of a number of concerns about the 
limited autonomy of the Children&#8217;s Ombudsperson.  
</p>
<p>95. The CNCDH is the national institution that promotes and protects human rights in 
accordance with the Principles relating to the status of national institutions for the 
promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles). Its role is to act as a watchdog, 
make proposals, provide monitoring and raise awareness in relation to Government, 
Parliament and citizens, on all issues relating to human rights and international 
humanitarian law. During the meeting with the Special Rapporteur, the CNCDH reiterated 
its great concern over the punitive approach taken by the authorities, to the detriment of an 
educational approach, and the reception and care of unaccompanied foreign minors.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Social responsibility of the private sector 
</b></p>
<p>96. The AFA50 was set up in 1997 on the initiative of the main Internet access providers 
to draw up a code of ethics for the industry. The AFA makes available to Internet users a 
form which they can use to report any offensive content on the Internet.51 At the meeting 
with the Special Rapporteur, the staff of the AFA (numbering just three professionals) 
stressed the need to act at domain name level (by deactivating them and preventing them 
from re-registering elsewhere) and not just block hosts. 
</p>
<p>97. As regards the prevention of sexual tourism, many stakeholders, from both civil 
society and the private sector are mobilizing. For example, ECPAT52 France is conducting 
several initiatives and awareness-raising campaigns in partnership with tourist industry 
professionals like Air France, Petit Fut&#233;, Club M&#233;diterran&#233;e, the French Federation of 
Tourism Technicians and Professionals, the National Trade Union of Travel Agencies, as 
well as the ACCOR group and other associations like the Association against child 
prostitution.  
</p>
<p>98. At the round table organized by the Subdirectorate for Tourism and involving 
associations and professionals in the tourist industry, the point was made that, as the 
premier international tourist destination, France had to remain particularly vigilant about 
sexual tourism involving children in France. Some participants highlighted the need for 
</p>
<p>  
 49  In 2010, 2,042 complaints relating to 2,899 children were processed. Currently, 50 voluntary 
</p>
<p>delegates are able to receive complaints at 650 centres. 
 50  The members of the AFA are: Aricia, Azuria, Bouygues Telecom, Can&#8217;L, Google, Mana, 
</p>
<p>Numericable, Orange and SFR. 
 51  This initiative has the support of the European Commission and, since 1999, an international scope 
</p>
<p>with the creation of the International Association of Internet Hotlines (INHOPE), made up of foreign 
counterparts of the contact point. The main purpose of the international association is to remove child 
pornography content at its source. 
</p>
<p> 52  Network for the prevention of child prostitution, child pornography and the trafficking of children for 
sexual purposes. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20 </b>GE.12-11044  (EXT) 
</p>
<p>greater involvement of the media and the Subdirectorate for Tourism in efforts at 
prevention. 
</p>
<p><b> J. International and regional cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>99. The Special Rapporteur took note of the significant efforts made by France in 
relation to international and regional cooperation. This is demonstrated by the commitment 
of France within INTERPOL, EUROPOL and EUROJUST. At the meeting with 
INTERPOL, the commitment of France was noted in terms of contributing to the 
INTERPOL image bank and to the identification of victims and offenders. The police 
services consulted generally stressed the good cooperation with their colleagues in several 
countries, which had made it possible to identify a number of victims, arrest offenders and 
dismantle exploiter networks.  
</p>
<p>100. A member of many francophone networks (such as FRANCOPOL),53 France takes 
part in European programmes, such as the European Police College (for the purpose of 
harmonizing and coordinating activities) and the European Union&#8217;s PHARE programmes 
for the benefit of countries applying to accede to the European Union. 
</p>
<p>101. Within the framework of bilateral or multilateral cooperation, France is involved in 
many cooperation projects with several countries outside the European Union relating to 
the training of police officers and judges, the exchange of best practice and technical 
support.  
</p>
<p>102. The International Adoption Service is involved in international cooperation projects 
relating to intercountry adoption, particularly for the benefit of countries which are not 
signatories to the Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of 
Intercountry Adoption. 
</p>
<p>103. Nevertheless, difficulties persist, largely as a result of differences in legislation 
concerning the legality of certain acts and the applicable penalties, in procedures and 
working methods (particularly in regard to preventing cyber child pornography and sexual 
tourism involving children), but also as a result of a lack of will to cooperate on the part of 
some countries when it comes to information exchange and feedback and mutual judicial 
assistance.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the commitment of France and its high level 
of mobilization, working with many stakeholders from both the third sector and the 
private sector, to prevent, and to protect children from, sale, prostitution and child 
pornography.  
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Indeed, the results are encouraging: an extensive arsenal of legal measures in 
tune with the main international and regional instruments, effective decentralized 
arrangements for prevention and protection, with many programmes of assistance, 
support and care for children in difficulty and a universal education and social 
welfare system.

</b></p>
<p>GE.12-11044  (EXT) <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>However, despite these significant achievements, some challenges remain: the 
build-up of legislation and the current trend towards a punitive approach are likely to 
jeopardize the achievements of a solid legislative framework that has made it possible 
to set in place very detailed child protection arrangements; children, often the most 
vulnerable children from dysfunctional and/or insecure families, slip through the 
safety net. Unaccompanied foreign minors seem to be the most disadvantaged and the 
most vulnerable to all forms of exploitation. Despite all of the efforts made by the 
authorities and the high degree of mobilization by civil society, care of children 
remains fragmented and uneven, depending on the department, and suffers from a 
lack of intersectoral cooperation. The social welfare services are swamped, and their 
capacities to take in and support children are overwhelmed.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>In a spirit of dialogue and cooperation, the Special Rapporteur wishes to set out 
the following recommendations which are designed to consolidate and enhance the 
French Government&#8217;s current efforts. She is persuaded that all necessary resources 
will be employed to put them into effect and is prepared to offer her full cooperation 
and assistance. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>As regards the legislative aspect, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
French Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Incorporates all of the texts of the legislation on child protection in a 
single practical guide to make it easier to understand and implement them; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensures the full implementation of the solid range of legal instruments in 
place designed to protect minors, particularly the Act of 5 March 2007 reforming 
child protection; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Protects what has been achieved in relation to justice for minors by 
opting for the educational approach in preference to an exclusively punitive approach, 
including in the case of children who, although they have committed offences, are the 
victims of networks of exploitation or trafficking;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) [Ensures that] a restrictive policy on migration is not prejudicial to the 
protection of unaccompanied foreign minors, who are the most vulnerable to all forms 
of abuse and exploitation. Establishing minority must not solely be based on the not 
very reliable practice of bone tests; similarly unaccompanied foreign minors who have 
established an educational or occupational project in France must not be deported 
because they have reached the age of majority; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Speeds up the process of reforming the adoption system in France to 
encourage national adoptions, particularly by means of the bill on abandoned children 
and adoption tabled in that connection in September 2011; reviews the procedures for 
issuing approval for adoption by the General Councils; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Improves the professionalism of the authorized adoption agencies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Issues the decree making it possible to implement the proposed system 
for reporting online instances of sexual tourism submitted by OCRVP and drawn up 
jointly with ECPAT; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22 </b>GE.12-11044  (EXT) 
</p>
<p><b> (h) Ensures that children&#8217;s involvement in the judicial process</b>54<b> is consistent 
across the board, in order to prevent re-victimization;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Speeds up judicial procedures and simplifies procedures for the granting 
of asylum;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Systematizes training for police officers, gendarmes and judges, while 
providing them with the necessary resources, in order to harmonize practices and 
guarantee that children are effectively protected. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>As far as policies and strategies are concerned, the Special Rapporteur strongly 
encourages the French Government to adopt a cross-cutting approach with the focus 
on the rights of the child, designed to establish a national strategic framework for 
child protection. The departmental child protection strategies would then become a 
variant of this national strategic framework, thus constituting integrated regional 
child protection systems that are harmonized and consistent with international rules 
and standards. In order to achieve this, the Special Rapporteur recommends:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Mapping all of the programmes and actors involved in child protection 
in order to identify: (i) good practices and then pass them on; (ii) duplication in order 
to secure synergy of action and complementarity; and (iii) inefficiencies and 
disparities in order to remedy them;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Defining the areas of competence and responsibility of each stakeholder: 
(i) by establishing effective intersectoral coordination arrangements; and (ii) by 
introducing accountability arrangements for each area of intervention;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Introducing a centralized, standardized and reliable system for the 
collection and processing of data, aggregated by age, gender, profile, status and a 
clear description of the nature of the crime committed against the child; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Devising child protection indicators, on a participatory basis, with all 
stakeholders; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Establishing rigorous monitoring and evaluation procedures concerning: 
(i) the implementation of the national strategy; (ii) its regional variants; (iii) the extent 
to which the child protection indicators have been achieved; and (iv) the impact of the 
strategies on the situation of children and their rights;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Determining the resources needed and timetable for implementing the 
national framework and its regional variants; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Maintaining the level of resources allocated to child protection despite 
the constraints imposed by the current economic climate; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Embarking upon a process of inclusive consultations with all 
stakeholders with a view to preparing the fifth periodic report to the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child.
