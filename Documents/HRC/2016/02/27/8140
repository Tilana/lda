<p> The present report reflects the status of implementation of Human Rights Council 
resolution 19/22 of 23 March 2012. It contains information on the recent developments on 
the ground up until 11 May 2012, a summary of the information submitted by the 
Government of the Syrian Arab Republic in several notes verbales addressed to the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights during the reporting period, 
as well as information on measures and actions taken by relevant international stakeholders. 
</p>
<p> Although a ceasefire brokered by the United Nations was announced on 12 April 
2012, its implementation remained partial and fragile during the reporting period. Despite 
some improvements on the ground, violence and killings, including during armed clashes, 
through shelling and the use of explosive devices, continued throughout the Syrian Arab 
Republic, and the civilian population remained significantly insecure. There were credible 
reports of ongoing serious human rights violations.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council condemned in the strongest terms 
the sharply escalating widespread, systematic and gross violations of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms perpetrated by the authorities of the Syrian Arab Republic. In the 
resolution, the Council requested actions from the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
to put an immediate end to all violence and all human rights violations. It also requested 
that I present a report on the implementation of resolution 19/22 at its twentieth and twenty-
first sessions. The present report, which is submitted to the Council pursuant to that request, 
summarizes the recent developments on the ground up until 11 May 2012 and information 
submitted by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic by means of notes verbales addressed to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) between 2 April and 7 May 2012. The report also contains information on 
actions taken by relevant international stakeholders, including the Security Council, the 
Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the League of Arab States, and other United 
Nations entities. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Recent developments  
</b></p>
<p>2. On 16 February 2012, the General Assembly adopted resolution 66/253, in which it 
endorsed the Plan of Action of the League of Arab States of 2 November 2011 and the 
League&#8217;s decisions of 22 January and 12 February 2012. In that context, the Assembly 
</p>
<p>requested me and other United Nations entities to support the efforts of the League of Arab 
States, including through the appointment of a special envoy to promote a peaceful 
solution, and through technical and material assistance. On 23 February 2012, in response 
to resolution 66/253, the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States and I announced 
the appointment of Kofi Annan as our Joint Special Envoy to help to resolve the Syrian 
crisis. The Security Council lent its support to the appointment in the statements made by 
the President of the Council on 21 March (S/PRST/2012/6) and 5 April 2012 
(S/PRST/2012/10), and in resolutions 2042 and 2043 (2012) of 14 and 21 April 2012, 
respectively.  
</p>
<p>3. The mandate of the Joint Special Envoy is to use his good offices to bring an end to 
all violence and human rights violations and to promote a peaceful solution to the Syrian 
crisis, working with all relevant actors of the United Nations and the League of Arab States 
through consultations on the political, socio-economic, security and humanitarian situation 
in the Syrian Arab Republic. Since his appointment, the Envoy has engaged with the 
Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and the Syrian opposition, as well as with 
regional and international stakeholders, with a view to finding a peaceful solution to the 
crisis. 
</p>
<p>4. On 25 March 2012, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic pledged to 
implement the six-point plan proposed by the Joint Special Envoy, which aimed at bringing 
an immediate end to all forms of violence by all parties, to protect civilians, obtain 
humanitarian access and facilitate an inclusive Syrian-led political process to address the 
legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people. In a communication addressed to 
the Envoy on 1 April 2012, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic pledged to 
immediately cease troop movements, end the use of heavy weapons in population centres 
and begin to pull back military concentrations in and around population centres no later 
than 10 April 2012. Similar commitments to respect the cessation of violence were sought 
from anti-Government armed groups by the Envoy. While the ceasefire came into effect on 
12 April 2012, it was not fully respected during the reporting period. </p>


<p>5. In the framework of the six-point plan, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
also committed itself to intensify the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained 
persons, including especially vulnerable categories of persons and persons involved in 
peaceful political activities, and to allow access to detention places. The Government also 
pledged to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists, and to 
ensure a non-discriminatory visa policy for them. In addition, the Government undertook to 
respect freedom of association and the right to peaceful assembly. 
</p>
<p>6. It should be recalled that the Security Council, in its resolution 2043 (2012), 
authorized, for an initial period of 90 days, the deployment of the United Nations 
Supervision Mission in the Syrian Arab Republic (UNSMIS), comprising an initial 
deployment of up to 300 unarmed military observers as well as an appropriate civilian 
component, as required by the Mission to fulfil its mandate. Its mandate is to monitor the 
cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties, and to monitor and support the 
full implementation of the above-mentioned six-point plan. During the reporting period, a 
certain reduction in violence was observed in areas where UNSMIS was present. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Information from the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic 
</b></p>
<p>7. In its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council requested specific actions from 
the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to address the human rights and humanitarian 
situation, particularly in paragraphs 3, 4, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17 and 18. On 12 April 2012, 
OHCHR, on my behalf, addressed a note verbale to the Permanent Mission of the Syrian 
Arab Republic in which it requested information on any steps taken by the Government to 
implement resolution 19/22. In response, on 1 May 2012, the Permanent Mission addressed 
a note verbale to OHCHR in which it pointed out that the Government rejected and would 
continue to reject resolution 19/22, arguing that it went beyond the mandate of the Council, 
was inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations and did not reflect the reality on the 
ground. According to the Government, resolution 19/22 lacked credibility owing to the 
absence of reference to the grave and systematic human rights violations perpetrated by 
what it called &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;. The Government provided information on human 
</p>
<p>rights violations that it attributed to &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;, as described below. 
</p>
<p>Information on alleged violations committed by other actors was not provided.  </p>
<p>8. In its note verbale of 1 May 2012, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
stated that, in accordance with its international obligations and commitments and in line 
with the State&#8217;s sovereignty and the choices of the Syrian people, it had cooperated openly 
</p>
<p>and transparently with all United Nations mechanisms, eschewing politicization and 
prejudgements based on &#8220;fabricated evidence&#8221; to condemn the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>According to the Government, States seeking the &#8220;destruction&#8221; of the Syrian Arab Republic 
</p>
<p>had ignored its cooperation with the United Nations. In this context, the Government 
considered that the information it had transmitted to OHCHR and the United Nations prior 
to the adoption of Human Rights Council resolution 19/22 had not been reflected in the 
resolution. The Government considered resolution 19/22 to be part of a campaign against 
the Syrian Arab Republic and, in its view, it merely reflected accounts from media outlets 
funded by States seeking the &#8220;destruction&#8221; of the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>9. In its note verbale of 1 May 2012, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
stated that resolution 19/22 sent a clear message to &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; and their 
sponsors that they were allowed &#8220;to spill Syrian blood and to continue their operations&#8221;. In 
</p>
<p>the view of the Government, this negative and dangerous message had resulted in an 
escalation of terrorist operations in Damascus and the second largest city in the Syrian Arab 
Republic, Aleppo, in addition to other cities where, the Government stated, residents did </p>


<p>not obey the instructions of &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;. The Government also stated that 
</p>
<p>intentional, widespread and gross violations that amounted to crimes against humanity 
committed by &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; had intensified in Syrian cities. The Government 
</p>
<p>deplored the fact that resolution 19/22 did not address the issue of countries that fund, arm 
and train &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;, contrary to the Charter. In this context, the Government 
</p>
<p>noted that neighbouring countries were being used as a base for &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>and reported that the relevant Syrian authorities had been thwarting infiltration attempts of 
&#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; into the Syrian Arab Republic on a daily basis. 
</p>
<p>10. From 2 April to 7 May 2012, the Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic 
addressed several notes verbales to OHCHR<i>, </i>mainly on casualty figures within the national 
security and armed forces, as well as among civilians, reportedly as a result of acts 
committed by &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;. The Government also provided information on 
kidnappings and armed attacks on, and the sabotage and looting of, private and public 
property. The present report includes the most recent figures submitted by the Government. 
According to information sent by the Government, &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; had committed 
</p>
<p>the following violations: 
</p>
<p> (a) <b>Killings</b>. According to the Government, more than 6,144 Syrian citizens, 
including civilians and members of national security forces and armed forces, had been 
killed. The Government also reported that 478 members of the national security and 2,091 
members of the armed forces had been killed by &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; between 23 
</p>
<p>March 2011 and 20 March 2012. It added that more than 100 Syrian scientists, intellectuals 
and athletes had been killed for refusing to join the &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;. The 
</p>
<p>Government reported that different methods had been used by the &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; 
to kill people from different groups: those who did not support the calls of the &#8220;terrorist 
</p>
<p>armed groups&#8221; and belonged to given groups in society were shot and killed, while the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;slaughter technique&#8221; was reserved for other population groups. The Government reported 
that dead bodies had been put on display, killings had been filmed by perpetrators and 
footage disseminated over the Internet; 
</p>
<p> (b) <b>Kidnappings and abductions</b>. According to the Government, more than 
1,500 citizens had been kidnapped or abducted, of whom the fate of 1,000 remained 
unknown. The majority of those kidnapped or abducted had been reportedly subjected to 
torture and detention. The Government reported that it had begun to find bodies of victims 
in wells, rivers and sanitation networks; 
</p>
<p> (c) <b>Torture</b>. The Government stated that &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; had kidnapped 
and tortured citizens in detention facilities under their control, a number of which were 
reportedly in areas &#8220;freed from the grip of terrorists&#8221;. The Government added that 
</p>
<p>instruments utilized for torture were found at these locations. According to the 
Government, people were killed if the requested ransom was not paid, or were executed 
without any request for ransom; 
</p>
<p> (d) <b>Violations of freedoms of religion and belief</b>. The Government reported 
that &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; had targeted and tried to expel particular communities from 
</p>
<p>areas in which they have lived for generations by threatening, intimidating or killing those 
who refused to give up their private property. The Government also pointed out that 
terrorist armed groups had targeted mosques, churches and monasteries; 
</p>
<p> (e) <b>Violations of freedom of opinion and expression</b>. The Government stated 
that &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; had threatened, intimidated and killed those who disagreed 
with them or ignored their calls to participate in strikes or protests, or whom they suspected 
of supporting the Government, as well as journalists who, according to the Government, 
wrote the truth and were targeted and killed; </p>


<p> (f) <b>Violence against women</b>. According to the Government, there were many 
cases where citizens had been held up on highways, with women raped before being shot. 
The Government reported on other cases where women had been kidnapped and forced to 
become sex slaves by &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;, reportedly in detention facilities under their 
</p>
<p>control;  
</p>
<p> (g) <b>Violence against children</b>. According to the Government, &#8220;terrorist armed 
groups&#8221; had lured several children into carrying out terrorist operations for money, and 
reportedly kidnapped and killed children (as in the case of a boy named &#8220;Adnan Amran&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>less than 9 years old, whose body was found on the rooftop of a building in Al-Ladhiqiyah). 
According to the Government, children had been killed to put pressure on their parents (as 
in the case of the son of the Grand Mufti of the Syrian Arab Republic, Saria Hassoun); 
</p>
<p> (h) <b>Violations of the right to food</b>. According to the Government, &#8220;terrorist 
armed groups&#8221; had destroyed sources of staple food, olive groves and water resources 
relied on by farmers. In some areas, farmers had reportedly been prevented from reaching 
their farms and gathering their harvest;  
</p>
<p> (i) <b>Violations of the right to health</b>. According to the Government, &#8220;terrorist 
armed groups&#8221; had kidnapped and killed doctors, raped nurses, shelled hospitals and stolen 
and destroyed medical supplies. The Government underlined the psychological suffering of 
Syrian citizens as a result of these acts;  
</p>
<p> (j) <b>Violations of the right to education</b>. The Government stated that &#8220;terrorist 
armed groups&#8221; had deprived citizens of their right to education by preventing children and 
</p>
<p>students from going to school and university in some governorates and by using schools as 
a base for their terrorist operations; 
</p>
<p> (k) <b>Incidents of theft and sabotage</b>. The Government reported that there had 
been 1,292 incidents of looting, 2,256 cases of theft of vehicles and 2,618 cases of sabotage 
of private and public property from the beginning of the events to 15 March 2012. 
According to the Government, the financial losses of the electricity sector caused by the 
attacks of &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; exceeded 334 million Syrian pounds during the period 
from 1 to 17 April 2012; 
</p>
<p> (l) <b>Transportation sector</b>. The Government reported that &#8220;terrorist armed 
groups&#8221; had killed eight employees of the Ministry of Transport, and had kidnapped 
</p>
<p>another 14. The fate of eight of them remained unknown. The Government added that 
&#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; deliberately targeted buses used to transport Ministry employees. 
The Government also added that &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221; had stolen the identification cards 
of State employees to perpetrate terrorist operations. According to the Government, damage 
to the Ministry of Transport up until the end of February 2012 exceeded an estimated 3.8 
billion Syrian pounds as a result of attacks by &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>12. In a note verbale dated 7 April 2012, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
stated that it was continuing its investigations into human rights violations and would hold 
the perpetrators accountable. It stated that it had received more than 4,800 complaints. The 
Government reported that a number of commissioned officers with different ranks, 
including two brigadier generals, non-commissioned officers and elements of the national 
security and armed forces, were facing trial, and that 74 members of the public forces of 
order had been punished. The Government stated that it would continue to investigate all 
alleged human rights violations.  </p>


<p><b> IV. Implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 19/22 
</b></p>
<p>13. In paragraphs 3 and 4 of its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council strongly 
urged the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to put an immediate end to violence and 
all human rights violations, and demanded that it meet its responsibility to protect its 
population. As noted above, the Government, in its note verbale of 1 May 2012, did not 
provide information in that regard. 
</p>
<p>14. Despite the announcement of a ceasefire brokered by the United Nations on 12 April 
2012, implementation of the ceasefire remained partial and fragile during the reporting 
period. Despite some improvements on the ground, the civilian population remained 
significantly insecure. Violence and killings, including during armed clashes, continued 
throughout the country. An increase in the use of explosive devices, inflicting loss of life 
among civilians, was also reported. Credible reports indicated that Government security and 
armed forces continued, unabated, to commit serious violations of human rights, including 
by the shelling of civilian areas and the use of lethal force against demonstrators, arbitrary 
arrests, torture and summary and extrajudicial execution of activists, defectors and 
opponents. Furthermore, ongoing violations by armed anti-Government forces continued to 
be reported, including cases of kidnapping and abduction, and the torture and killing of 
members of the security and armed forces and pro-Government elements.  
</p>
<p>15. In paragraph 9 of resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council urged the 
Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to ensure timely, safe and unhindered access for 
all humanitarian actors and to ensure the safe passage of humanitarian and medical supplies 
into the country. The Government did not provide OHCHR with information on the status 
of implementation of paragraph 9. In its note verbale of 1 May 2012, however, the 
Government stated that the Council had failed to address, in this context, the unilateral 
sanctions imposed on the Syrian Arab Republic or the attacks by &#8220;terrorist armed groups&#8221;, 
which had resulted in the current livelihood crisis in the country. 
</p>
<p>16. On the basis of a Government-led needs assessment mission conducted from 18 to 
26 March 2012, the United Nations and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation estimated 
that, at that time, 1 million people were in need of humanitarian assistance in the Syrian 
Arab Republic. The scale and scope of humanitarian operations, however, remained 
insufficient to meet humanitarian needs, and the humanitarian capacity remained limited on 
the ground. Further to the needs assessment mission, the Syrian authorities and 
humanitarian actors agreed about the significant humanitarian needs and that civilians in 
affected areas needed urgent and effectively targeted aid in terms of shelter, food, health, 
education, livelihood, agriculture, water and sanitation. As at 8 May 2012, however, the 
modalities of the humanitarian response were still being discussed with the Government of 
the Syrian Arab Republic. As a result, civilians continued to bear the brunt of the 
deteriorating humanitarian situation. 
</p>
<p>17. In paragraph 10 of resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council invited all relevant 
United Nations agencies, in particular the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR), to provide Syrian refugees, and the neighbouring countries hosting 
them, with support. In March 2012, UNHCR launched the Syria Regional Refugee Plan to 
address the needs for protection and assistance of refugees fleeing from the Syrian Arab 
Republic into neighbouring countries, namely Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. 
According to UNHCR, as at 9 May 2012, more than 67,668 refugees fleeing the Syrian 
Arab Republic were receiving assistance from UNHCR and the national authorities in Iraq 
(3,391), Jordan (15,344), Lebanon (25,922) and Turkey (23,011). The number of Syrian 
refugees in Turkey had reportedly decreased slightly in the previous month owing to 
voluntary repatriations. UNHCR had registered 55,198 persons from the Syrian Arab 
Republic in neighbouring countries. </p>


<p>18. In paragraph 11 (<i>a</i>) of resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council demanded that 
the Syrian authorities respect the demands and aspirations of the Syrian people. I took note 
of the parliamentarian elections held on 7 May 2012 and of the fact that the opposition 
boycotted the poll. As noted above, the six-point plan is aimed at facilitating an inclusive 
Syrian-led political process to address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian 
people once fully implemented.  
</p>
<p>19. In paragraph 11 (<i>b</i>) of resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council also demanded 
that the Syrian authorities put an immediate end to all attacks on journalists and to ensure 
adequate protection, fully respect freedom of expression and allow independent and 
international media to operate. The Joint Special Envoy reported that he had been informed 
by the Government that more than 114 journalists had been given visas, and that 
international reporting from the Syrian Arab Republic had increased pursuant to the six-
point plan. 
</p>
<p>20. In paragraph 11 (<i>c</i>) of resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council further 
demanded that the Syrian authorities take immediate steps to ensure the safety of foreign 
nationals in the Syrian Arab Republic, including refugees and diplomatic staff, and to 
ensure the protection of their property. The Government did not provide OHCHR with 
information on the status of implementation of paragraph 11 (<i>c</i>). According to media 
reports, some foreigners were killed while others were detained.  
</p>
<p>21. In paragraph 11 (<i>d</i>) of resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council demanded that 
the Syrian authorities lift the blockade of Homs, Dar&#8217;a and Zabadani and of all other cities 
under siege. The Government did not provide OHCHR with information on the 
implementation of paragraph 11 (<i>d</i>). Credible sources report that checkpoints controlled by 
Government forces and by armed anti-Government groups remained, mainly in Homs, 
Idlib, Dar&#8217;a and Hama.  
</p>
<p>22. In paragraphs 12 and 13 of resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council called upon 
the Government to act in accordance with the Plan of Action of the League of Arab States 
of 2 November 2011, and its decisions of 22 January and 12 February 2012, including to 
release all those detained arbitrarily following the recent incidents; to withdraw all military 
and armed forces from cities and towns; to guarantee the freedom of peaceful assembly; 
and to allow access for all relevant institutions of the League. Despite the six-point plan and 
the announcement of the ceasefire, reports of the use of live and lethal fire during protests 
continued. Furthermore, credible sources reported continued cases of arbitrary detention, 
including of children. In addition, other credible sources reported that the Government had 
not withdrawn all heavy weapons from cities.  
</p>
<p>23. Paragraphs 14, 15, 16, 17 and 21 of resolution 19/22 concerned the mandate and 
work of the independent international commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, 
established by the Human Rights Council in its resolution S-17/1 of 23 August 2011. 
Further to paragraph 14 of resolution 19/22, in which the Council extended the mandate of 
the commission of inquiry, the commission resumed its work and OHCHR continued to 
provide it with full secretariat support. The commission is to give an oral update to the 
Council at its twentieth session, and to present a written update report at its twenty-first 
session. To date, despite the fact that the Council, in paragraph 17 of resolution 19/22, 
called upon the Government to cooperate with the commission of inquiry, the commission 
has not been granted access to the country. On 26 March 2012, further to paragraph 21 of 
resolution 19/22, the Council transmitted the updated report of the commission of inquiry to 
me for appropriate action and transmission to all relevant United Nations bodies. 
</p>
<p>24. In paragraph 18 of resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council reiterated its call 
upon the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to cooperate with the special procedures 
of the Council and with OHCHR, including through the establishment of a field presence. </p>


<p>While the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic has interacted with some special 
procedures, recent requests by mandate holders for visits to the country remain pending or 
unanswered. For instance, on 19 October 2011, the Government replied positively to a 
request made by the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and 
of association to visit the Syrian Arab Republic. In its reply to the request, the Government 
invited the Special Rapporteur to visit at an appropriate time for both sides during the first 
months of 2012. A letter from the Special Rapporteur suggesting a visit in March 2012 
remained, however, unanswered. On 19 April 2012, the Special Rapporteur on the human 
rights of internally displaced persons addressed a request to visit the Syrian Arab Republic 
to its Permanent Mission in Geneva.  
</p>
<p>25. With reference to an OHCHR field presence in the Syrian Arab Republic, the 
Government did not address this issue in its note verbale of 1 May 2012. It should be 
recalled that the Ambassador of the Syrian Arab Republic, during a meeting with 
representatives of OHCHR on 11 January 2012, pointed out that, at the time, his 
Government was not yet ready to cooperate with OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>26. In paragraph 19 of its resolution 19/22, the Human Rights Council invited me to 
take the measures necessary to support the efforts of the League of Arab States to achieve a 
peaceful solution to the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic. As noted above, the General 
Assembly, in its resolution 66/253, endorsed the Plan of Action of the League of Arab 
States of 2 November 2011, and the League&#8217;s decisions of 22 January and 12 February 
</p>
<p>2012. The mandate of the Joint Special Envoy, which is based on resolution 66/253, reflects 
therefore all relevant decisions of the League of Arab States. The Envoy has regularly 
briefed the Assembly and the Security Council on his activities, and continues to provide 
regular reports thereon, as requested. I have also reported to the Assembly and to the 
Council on support for the efforts of the League of Arab States to achieve a peaceful 
solution to the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic consistent with the Charter of the 
United Nations and the League&#8217;s decisions. In this context, both the Joint Special Envoy 
and I have called on all parties to adhere to the cessation of violence in all its forms, to 
cooperate with UNSMIS and to implement the six-point plan in its entirety with a view to 
paving the way for an inclusive Syrian-led political process to address the legitimate 
aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people. As I have noted previously, the efforts of the 
Envoy and UNSMIS are possibly the only remaining chance to stabilize the situation in the 
Syrian Arab Republic and to avoid a civil war. 
</p>
<p>27. In accordance with paragraph 21 of Human Rights Council resolution 19/22, an
