<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights conducted an official 
visit to Mongolia from 3 to 7 December 2012, during which she collected first-hand 
information on the situation of people living in extreme poverty and on the impact of key 
policies relating to poverty alleviation and development in the country. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur outlines the general challenges facing 
Mongolia in implementing measures to tackle poverty and ensuring the rights of those 
living in poverty in the country. The Special Rapporteur highlights the particular 
difficulties encountered by the most vulnerable groups affected by extreme poverty along 
with the challenges preventing them their full enjoyment of rights. Particular attention is 
given to the right to social protection, to access adequate housing and to access justice.  The 
Special Rapporteur is concerned that despite the impressive growth rate in recent years 
economic prosperity has not been inclusive. There is a high level of inequality at a time 
when the country is experiencing a major economic boom.  The report recognizes the 
important steps already taken by the new Government to implement poverty reduction 
measures and highlights a number of recommendations for consideration by all 
stakeholders.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and 
human rights, Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda Carmona, undertook a mission to Mongolia from 3 to 
7 December 2012.  During the visit, the independent expert collected first-hand information 
about the situation of people living in extreme poverty in order to conduct a human rights-
based analysis of key public policies relating to poverty alleviation, development and social 
protection.   
</p>
<p>2. During her mission the Special Rapporteur met with various Government 
representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Population Development 
and Social Protection, Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Labour, as well as 
from a number of Government agencies, including the General Office for Social Welfare 
Services, General Office for Social Insurance, National Authority for Children, National 
Rehabilitation Centre and National Committee for Gender Equality.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with the National Statistical Office, National 
Human Rights Commission, and representatives from international organizations, donor 
agencies, financial institutions and a range of civil society organizations. She also visited 
communities living in poverty in the Erden soum of Tuv province, Darieh and Unur areas 
of  Bayanz&#252;rkh and Songino Khairkhan districts in Ulaanbaatar.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur wishes to extend her gratitude to the Government of 
Mongolia for its invitation and its full cooperation during the mission. She also extends her 
appreciation to the United Nations Country Team, in particular the Office of the Resident 
Coordinator, for its assistance both before and during the visit. She is very grateful to those 
interlocutors and members of civil society for their invaluable contribution to the mission. 
In particular, she is sincerely grateful to those who took the time to share their personal 
experiences of struggling with the plight of extreme poverty and social exclusion in 
Mongolia.  
</p>
<p>5.  In the spirit of coordination and collaboration among human rights mechanisms, 
sections in this report relating to the human rights impact on the most vulnerable sectors of 
the population are complemented by the report of the Working Group on the issue of 
human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, following its 
visit to the country in 2012.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General context  
</b></p>
<p>6. In recent years Mongolia has rapidly risen to the status of a lower-middle-income 
country, with a national GDP of  US$8.558 billion in 2011.1 The discovery of vast 
quantities of untapped mineral wealth combined with foreign investment in a number of 
massive mining projects and the projected extraction of coal in the southern region of the 
country is expected to triple the national economy by 2020.  
</p>
<p>7. The country has achieved impressive growth, with GDP increasing at an average 
annual rate of 10.6 per cent from 2000 to 2010. In 2011, and in the first quarter of 2012, the 
growth rate rose by an impressive 17 per cent and 16.7 per cent respectively.2 However, 
despite the significant growth rate, economic prosperity has not been inclusive; in fact, it

 2  Ibid. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>has failed to reach the most vulnerable in society and has not translated into a significant 
reduction in poverty. Mongolia ranks 108 out of 186 countries in the 2013 Human 
Development Index.  
</p>
<p>8. According to official statistics, poverty has reduced in recent years from 39.2 per 
cent in 2010 to 29.8 per cent in 2011. However, available data indicates high levels of 
inequality, with consumption by the top 10 per cent of the population rating 7.7 times 
higher than that of the lowest 10 per cent of the population.3   
</p>
<p>9. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur witnessed the significant income 
inequalities affecting communities living in poverty and noted that as the gap widens, 
poverty is becoming entrenched, not only in rural areas, but also in urban centres. These 
inequalities raise human rights concerns and require immediate efforts in order to be 
rectified.  
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the significant challenges facing the newly 
appointed Government of Mongolia in its endeavours to eradicate poverty. She welcomes 
the positive commitment it has already made during its short time in office in identifying 
the fight against poverty as one of its key focus areas  going forward. Therefore, in the 
spirit of openness and cooperation, the Special Rapporteur encourages the State to consider 
the recommendations outlined in this report as a means of ensuring that poverty reduction 
policies, in particular social protection policies, respect, protect and promote the full 
enjoyment of human rights and give particular priority to people living in poverty. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>11. Chapter 2 of the 1992 Constitution of Mongolia enshrines a plurality of human 
rights and freedoms and establishes a political and legal environment for the effective 
enjoyment of such rights. It provides for the right of vulnerable groups to material and 
financial assistance and the right to equality between men and women &#8220;in political, 
economic, social, cultural fields and in family affairs.&#8221; The Constitution affords a specific 
</p>
<p>commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights through the proactive role of 
the State (art. 19).  
</p>
<p>12. Mongolia has demonstrated its commitment to promoting and protecting human 
rights, as evidenced by steps taken to ratify most of the core international human rights 
instruments, improving their implementation at the domestic level, and engaging with 
various United Nations human rights mechanisms. It is particularly commendable that 
Mongolia was one of the first states to ratify the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that has recently entered into force. 
Additional efforts must be made, however, to ensure that the legal framework is in line with 
international human rights standards and that Mongolia accedes to key international treaties 
to which it is not yet party. 
</p>
<p>13. The Constitution obliges the State to &#8220;fulfil in good faith its obligations under 
international treaties to which it is a party&#8221; and confirms that &#8220;the international treaties to 
</p>
<p>which Mongolia is a party shall become effective as national legislation upon the entry into 
force of the laws or on their ratification or accession&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>14. The Constitution unambiguously states that no discrimination shall be enforced on 
the basis of social origins and economic situation (art. 14). However, the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that substantial gaps remain with regard to discrimination in the 
</p>
<p>  
 3  Mongolia, National Statistical Office, 2012. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>legislation, such as prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender 
identity or health status. Moreover, there is no effective mechanism to ensure that victims 
of discrimination have access to a remedy.  
</p>
<p>15. In 2003, a National Human Rights Action Programme was approved by Parliament 
as a means of reiterating Mongolia&#8217;s commitment to respecting human rights. In 2011, the 
Government conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the programme which identified 
irregularities in the implementation of international human rights treaties along 
with a lack of resources to enable the enforcement of human rights standards in the 
work place.4  
</p>
<p><b> IV. General challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Gaps in policy implementation and lack of consistency 
</b></p>
<p>16. For the most part, Mongolia has developed a robust legal framework for combating 
poverty and promoting human rights. However the Special Rapporteur received repeated 
reports regarding implementation gaps in almost all social policies, ranging from domestic 
violence to trafficking.  
</p>
<p>17. Over the last two decades, there has been a lack of consistency at the policy-making 
level, whereby legislation has been passed or social policies adopted by an outgoing 
Government, with the new incoming State structure either abolishing or failing to 
implement the laws or policies. The Special Rapporteur noted a distinct sense of frustration 
among civil society in this regard, particularly for those who had been involved at different 
stages in the development of a particular policy, only to be faced with a completely 
different structure following the election of a new Government.    
</p>
<p>18. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur found major flaws in the implementation of 
poverty reduction policies. For the most part, they have been implemented without any 
impact assessment, long-term vision, coherency or continuity, and often without financial 
and environmental sustainability. The eradication of extreme poverty requires long-term 
policies that specifically address the situation of those living in poverty through a 
comprehensive and coherent framework covering all domains of public policy and political 
action. Fragmentation and lack of coordination at the governmental level increase the 
likelihood that measures will be ineffective and the rights of people living in poverty will 
be infringed upon.  
</p>
<p>19. Of particular concern is the lack of systematic analytical research on the root causes 
of poverty in the country and the distinct lack of good quality poverty data over the years. 
The Special Rapporteur is disappointed that to date no State body has shown sufficient 
ownership and leadership in the fight against poverty and no one has been held accountable 
for the lack of progress. All these factors have greatly contributed to failure to achieve a 
significant reduction in poverty, despite the substantial amount of resources invested to this 
end.  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the Government is aware of these 
problems; nonetheless, she stresses the importance of implementing a multi-sectoral 
strategy and the need to establish regular mechanisms to ensure cross-sectoral coordination 
and accountability.

</p>
<p><b> B. Corruption 
</b></p>
<p>21. In 2010, the Universal Periodic Review of Mongolia identified corruption as a major 
cause of persistent inequality in the country, and expressed concern about the erosion of 
public services as a result. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that Mongolia 
accepted a recommendation aimed at tackling corruption during the review (A/HRC/16/5, 
para. 84.32). She recognizes that important efforts have been made to combat corruption, 
including the adoption of a National Program for Combating Corruption, the National Anti-
Corruption Council, the Law on Anti-Corruption, the ratification of the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption, the establishment of the Independent Authority Against 
Corruption and the adoption of the Law on Preventing Conflict of Interest in Public 
Service.  
</p>
<p>22. The State has recognized the important link between the fight against corruption and 
achieving development in the country by establishing the Mongolian Millennium 
Development Goal No. 9 on democratic governance and human rights.   
</p>
<p>23. Despite these notable achievements, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that efforts 
to combat corruption have not yet translated into any measurable improvements. According 
to Transparency International&#8217;s Corruption Perception Index 2012, Mongolia ranks 94 out 
</p>
<p>of 174 countries.5 There are a number of factors hindering full control of corruption, such 
as a high degree of local government centralization, rapid urbanization resulting in an 
increasing need to improve local government legislation and conflicts of interest.6 
</p>
<p>24. While recognizing the commendable steps taken by the Government to tackle 
corruption, the Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that corruption can seriously 
undermine the capacity of the State to fulfil its responsibilities and disproportionately affect 
those living in poverty. The attempt to hold high-level authorities accountable for recent 
corruption scandals raised hopes about the State&#8217;s commitment to fight corruption. 
Considering the large investment projects in the country, particularly in the mining sector, it 
is essential for Mongolia to implement a zero-tolerance policy against corruption and 
ensure accountability. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Situation of groups particularly vulnerable to poverty 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur identified groups that are particularly vulnerable to extreme 
poverty and which require specific initiatives to overcome the impact of economic 
deprivation and social exclusion.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Women 
</b></p>
<p>26. As one of the first countries to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, Mongolia has developed a comprehensive legal 
framework to ensure the protection of women&#8217;s rights in the country, including the 
introduction of laws, policies and programs to promote gender equality and address 
domestic violence. Still, additional efforts must be made to ensure implementation of these 
laws.

</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>27. Although women actively participate in social and economic life in Mongolia, they 
have been significantly underrepresented in power-sharing and decision-making. The 
percentage of women members of Parliament dropped from 25 per cent in 1990 to 3 per 
cent in 20087 and then increased to only 14.5 per cent in 2012.8 While this is a welcome 
development, the Special Rapporteur urges the State to employ measures to strengthen the 
participation of women in politics, particularly at the decision-making level. At least 30 per 
cent of the Mongolian Government must be made up of women decision-makers in order to 
achieve the Millennium Development Goal on gender equality. 
</p>
<p>28. It is estimated that the number of female-headed households increased from 10 per 
cent in 1998 to 15 per cent in 2008. These households are generally more vulnerable to 
poverty.9  Due to the unpaid care work that they often do, female head of households are 
prevented from undertaking employment and this is particularly notable in rural and remote 
areas where access to child care is not always feasible.  
</p>
<p>29. Gender-based violence remains high and new forms of violence against women are 
on the rise, such as sexual harassment in the workplace and trafficking. While the Special 
Rapporteur acknowledges the establishment of a solid legal framework through the Law on 
Gender Equality (2011) and its upcoming implementing strategy, she is concerned about 
the persistence of deep-rooted stereotypes relating to the roles and responsibilities of 
women and men in the family and society (CEDAW/C/MNG/CO/7, paras. 23-24) which 
serve as an impediment to women&#8217;s equal participation in economic and political life.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur received reports that domestic violence continues to be seen 
as a private matter in Mongolia, including among law enforcement personnel. Prosecution 
rates are low and there is a lack of provision of shelters, medical and rehabilitation services, 
as well as referral mechanisms for victims. Concerns have also been raised that the Law on 
Fighting Domestic Violence (2005), which is reportedly under review, does not contain any 
explicit provision for ensuring child protection. 
</p>
<p>31. Trafficking has also become an issue of concern in recent years especially affecting 
young women aged 18-25 coming from poor family backgrounds.10 The Special Rapporteur 
commends the important steps taken to combat trafficking, such as the establishment of the 
National Programme on Protection against Trafficking in Children and Women for the 
Purpose of Sexual Exploitation (2005-2014), the 2008 amendment to the Criminal Code to 
include persons involved in trafficking-related recruitment and transportation, the 
specialized counter-trafficking unit established in the National Police Agency (2010) and 
the Law on Combating Trafficking in Persons (2012). Nonetheless, effective 
implementation of these laws is essential for the eradication of trafficking in Mongolia.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Children 
</b></p>
<p>32. Mongolia ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990 and since then 
important steps have been taken to adopt legislative and other measures to provide 
protection for children. Despite these efforts, concern remains that a lack of sustainable 
investment in children&#8217;s rights has meant that in practice many provisions are not 
</p>
<p>sufficiently enforced. Child poverty continues to affect children and young people in

<p>Mongolia with estimates suggesting that in 2008 almost 43 per cent were living in poor 
households.11  
</p>
<p>33. While child mortality rates have witnessed a marked reduction since 1990, with 
Mongolia achieving its Millennium Development Goal target for 2015 in 2006,12 there are 
still striking disparities in the country. Due to limited access to medical services and clean 
water and sanitation facilities, overall mortality rates are higher among rural communities.13 
Nutritional deficiencies are an underlying cause of child mortality in numerous areas with 
incidences of stunting affecting many children.14 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the significant progress made in providing free 
and compulsory education with the net enrolment ratio in primary education standing at 
93.5 per cent and secondary school enrolment at 95 per cent in 2011.15 However she is 
concerned by reports that children coming from poor families are less likely to receive 
education higher than primary or lower secondary level, with 19 per cent of children in 
rural areas dropping out of school before completing Year 8.16 This is particularly relevant 
to children from herder households living in remote areas of the country who, along with 
their families, may have to move frequently, thus preventing them from receiving 
continuous education. Similarly, boys are more likely to be taken out of school by their 
families due to cultural attitudes to their role in the family. Children from families who 
migrate to the city face difficulties in securing education due to inadequacy of schools and 
despite progress made there are still problems with registration requirements.17 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur was informed that violence against children is a significant 
problem. According to reports received, 46 per cent of children between the ages of 2-14 
experienced physical and psychological punishment in their homes in 201018 and at least 
one-third of children from kindergarten through upper secondary level reported having 
experienced some form of violence (economic, emotional, physical or sexual) while at 
school.19  
</p>
<p>36. While in the country, the Special Rapporteur visited a State-funded institution20 for 
children living on the streets or who are homeless or orphaned. She commends the 
impressive efforts made to create a safe environment for the children, with nutritional food, 
warm clothing as well as educational facilities and extra-curricular activities. She received 
reports, however, that other institutions are not of the same standard and overall too many 
children are being placed unnecessarily and for too long in institutions, even though such an 
option should only be considered as a last resort for children without adequate care. The 
Special Rapporteur recalls that in line with the obligation to protect and promote the best 
interests of the child, efforts should be directed towards enabling the child to remain in or 
return to the care of his or her parents or extended family, including through tackling the 
material deprivation of the family or providing alternative family-based care.

<p>37. Child labour remains a problem with reports indicating that some 66 per cent of the 
total amount of working children are involved in the worst forms of child labour.21 The 
Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption in December 2012 of the National Action Plan 
to Eliminate the Worst Forms of Child Labour, and urges the Government to establish the 
National Committee on the issue without delay and ensure its full implementation as a 
matter of priority. 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about reports regarding the injuries and 
fatalities arising from the practice of using children as jockeys. As the use of child jockeys 
is a violation of children's right to protection from exploitation and hazardous or harmful 
labour, immediate measures must be taken to ensure their protection in line with the 
recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission and the United Nations 
agencies based in the country.  
</p>
<p>39. In 2002, the National Programme on Child Development and Protection was 
adopted in conjunction with the National Authority for Children covering the period from 
2002 to 2010.  However, lack of funding prevented implementation of many of the plans 
outlined in the programme.22 In collaboration with UNICEF and other international 
organizations, the Strategy for Strengthening Child Protection was developed. Despite these 
efforts, reports indicate that adoption of the strategy has been very slow and little progress 
has been made in this area.23    
</p>
<p><b> C. Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>40. There are more than 100,000 persons with disabilities in Mongolia24 (according to 
the National Statistical Office,25 79,000 were officially registered in 2008). Since 2010, the 
State has been party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its 
Optional Protocol and has enacted legal documents and national programmes such as the 
2008-2012 Action Plan that includes such objectives as providing persons with disabilities 
with standard facilities, as well as opportunities for a comfortable lifestyle.  
</p>
<p> 41. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes efforts made by the State to address the 
rights of persons with disabilities, she is concerned that insufficient measures have been 
taken to ensure that they have access, on an equal basis with others, to all facilities and 
services open or provided to the public, both in urban and rural areas (art. 9 of the 
Convention). Additional measures must be taken to ensure that persons with disabilities are 
able to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of society, including by 
ensuring equal access to appropriate and affordable public services in line with article 28 of 
the Convention.  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the limited opportunities to access 
education, including non-formal and short-term skills-development training, work or 
income generation by persons with disabilities. The obstacles faced by children with 
disabilities in enjoying their right to education are particularly difficult. Additional efforts 
must be made to ensure an inclusive education system at all levels. Children with 
disabilities must not be excluded from free and compulsory primary education, or from

support required, within the general education system, to facilitate their effective education 
(art. 24 of the Convention). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Herders and nomads 
</b></p>
<p>43. Livestock herding in Mongolia accounts for 21 per cent of the GDP and employs 38 
per cent of the national workforce.26  It is practised in a variety of systems &#8211; from nomadic 
livestock herding in the desert zone to semi-nomadic herders in the more fertile forest 
steppe. Poverty in rural areas increased following the 2010 <i>dzud</i> (winter storm), in which 
nearly 9,000 herders lost their entire livestock, while several thousands of herder 
households lost a majority of their livestock. Living in very isolated conditions, herders and 
nomadic communities face significant challenges in accessing basic services such as health 
care and education. Unemployment is widespread, and due to distance from urban centres, 
opportunities to re-train or develop new skills can be limited.27 
</p>
<p>44. Due to climate change, rural herder households may have to move frequently and 
over longer distances. As mentioned previously, this can impact significantly on their 
children, in terms of access to education. Women-headed households are also affected as 
grasslands may become further degraded and the ability of rural economy to sustain 
income-earning opportunities for such households can be significantly reduced. Without 
livelihood opportunities in rural areas, herders are forced to move to the city, where they 
are in an extremely vulnerable situation due to limited access to basic services, including a 
lack of schools and hospitals, little or no access to water and sanitation, as well as public 
transportation in areas where the migrant population is concentrated. This is compounded 
by a lack of necessary skills to find jobs, and registration problems.  
</p>
<p>45. Mineral exploration resulting from the recent mining boom is also forcing herders 
and nomadic communities to move to more remote regions of the country, thus limiting 
their access to basic health care, education and social welfare services. The Special 
Rapporteur concurs with the recommendations made by the Working Group on the issue  of 
human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, following their 
recent visit to the country, that adequate access to health care and social services in all 
soums and adequate infrastructure planning prior to the start-up of mining operations 
should be guaranteed by the State (A/HRC/23/32/Add.1).    
</p>
<p>46. While commending the adoption of the State Policy on Herders (2009) and the 
subsequent establishment of the National Programme to Combat Desertification (2010), the 
Special Rapporteur is concerned by reports that many of these policies have not been 
implemented, leaving herders and nomadic communities vulnerable to the perils of 
environmental change and resulting poverty. She therefore urges the Government to 
implement the relevant policies to improve the living conditions of herders and to establish 
mechanisms to allow for skills-based training, particularly for young herders, as a means of 
ensuring alternative employment, should it become necessary.

</b></p>
<p><b> E. Ethnic minorities 
</b></p>
<p>47. Mongolia is home to a number of ethnic minority groups who make up 17.6 per cent 
of the population,28 including Barga, Bayad, Buryat, Chantuu, Durbet, Kazakhs, Tsaatan 
and Tuva. Though native-born members of these groups generally enjoy citizenship rights 
and associated protections afforded them under the law, the low level of economic, social 
and cultural development of certain ethnic groups may represent de facto discrimination, 
even if it was not the direct result of a deliberate State effort (CERD/C/MNG/CO/18, para. 
19). 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that steps have been taken by the State to protect 
the rights of ethnic minorities, such as through the National Programme on Implementation 
of Human Rights which asserts that ethnic minorities have the right to receive education in 
their mother tongue. In some instances, this has reaped positive results, as was noted by the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to education during his visit to the country in 2010 
(A/HRC/14/25/Add.3). However, reports suggest that the lack of an effective minority-
centred education policy and adequately trained teachers and a shortage of minority-
language resources prevent non-Mongolian speaking minorities from enjoying the basic 
right to education. In 2010, Kazakh minorities in the province of Bayan-Ulgii reportedly 
had the highest dropout rate and the lowest preschool participation rate in the country, 
while children from the Tuva minority group had little or no access to any level of 
education.29  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the measures taken to improve access to 
information in minority languages, in particular the introduction by Mongolian National 
Broadcasting of a second channel dedicated to serving ethnic/linguistic minorities and the 
establishment of community media in minority languages. These improvements have 
contributed to addressing some of the barriers to information access faced by minorities and 
should thus be strengthened.  
</p>
<p>50. Despite these efforts, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that ethnic minority 
groups are still not able to fully participate in Mongolian society. According to reports 
received, while a number of projects and programmes have been developed at the 
provincial level to support ethnic minorities, such as the Programme to Invigorate 
Livelihood Reindeer Farms and the Programme to Improve the Tsaan Peoples&#8217; Livelihood 
Opportunities, budget restraints together with lack of coordination at the ministerial level 
have prevented many of these projects from being fully implemented.30 Furthermore, as 
Mongolia is not a party to the International Labour Organization&#8217;s Convention No. 169 
which recognizes the status of indigenous and tribal peoples, those minority groups which 
fully qualify under international law as indigenous or tribal groups are not provided with 
special rights or protections.31   
</p>
<p>51. In addition, the Special Rapporteur was informed that gaps in legislation have led to 
statelessness for certain ethnic groups, in particular those belonging to the Kazakh minority.  
This is mainly due to the fact that Mongolia does not allow dual nationality and a foreign 
citizen wishing to acquire Mongolian nationality is required to renounce his or her foreign 
nationality first. Many Kazakhs who have done just that, have faced obstacles re-acquiring 
Mongolian nationality, mainly due to the fact that the initial bilateral nationality verification

</p>
<p>process between Mongolia and Kazakhstan is often delayed. Additionally, many stateless 
persons do not approach the authorities to restore or acquire Mongolian nationality, because 
they fear the stigma of being identified as stateless. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Internal migrants 
</b></p>
<p>52. Rural to urban migration increased considerably over the last decade as people move 
to the cities in search of better living standards, employment opportunities, children&#8217;s 
education and health care. In 2010, approximately 45 per cent of the population was living 
in Ulaanbaatar alone. This phenomenon is placing substantial socioeconomic constraints on 
the Government, due mainly to the fluctuating nature of the migrant population, which 
remains largely unregistered.32 
</p>
<p>53. Despite the improvements achieved through the introduction of an integrated civil 
registry database, the Special Rapporteur was informed that rural migrants continue to face 
problems obtaining residency identification in a simple and timely manner, thus preventing 
them from securing land, employment, accessing legal aid, education for their children, 
health care and other Government services. Combined with the lack of necessary skills to 
obtain work, families in these conditions struggle to provide their children with nutritional 
food, warm clothing and are often unable to meet the basic costs of providing uniforms and 
materials for school.   
</p>
<p>54. Evidence suggests that increased social tensions and higher rates of domestic 
violence exist in these urban poor areas, where there are also fewer job opportunities for 
women, and women who do manage to find work are reportedly paid less than their male 
counterparts.33 Furthermore, widespread youth unemployment has the potential to 
exacerbate social problems such as crime and alcoholism.  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur observed that those who move to the city from rural areas 
face considerable challenges adapting to city life due to unfamiliarity with urban systems 
and ways to access services to which they are entitled. The Special Rapporteur reiterates 
that particular attention must be paid to the health situation of children who have migrated 
from rural areas of the country and who are living without official registration in the 
capital, in order to facilitate their equal access to all health and social services.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Persons living with HIV/AIDS 
</b></p>
<p>56. Mongolia is currently considered a low-HIV-prevalence country. As of the end of 
2011, the total cumulative number of infections since 1992 was 100.34 Despite the low 
prevalence of the disease, information received suggests a high level of discrimination and 
stigma against people living with HIV/AIDS. Due to the discrimination they suffer, in 
particular by health service providers, they are discouraged from seeking the services to 
which they are entitled. The Special Rapporteur commends the recent amendment to the 
2004 Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention aimed at reducing discrimination and stigma 
experienced by persons living with HIV/AIDS, and recommends that the next step forward 
would be establishing mechanisms to ensure its successful implementation at all levels.   
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned at reports of the risks faced by 
young people in the country. Lack of information and awareness-raising among this sector

</b></p>
<p>of the population, combined with high youth employment and a rise in alcoholism may 
leave the youth sector particularly vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases and 
HIV/AIDS.   
</p>
<p>58. In 2006, the National Committee for Coordinating HIV and AIDS Prevention 
activities was established through Government resolution No. 240.  In 2011, Government 
resolution No. 7 transferred management of the Committee to the Ministry of Health. 
Despite the progress made through the Committee, the Special Rapporteur is disappointed 
to learn that the new Government plans to abolish the Committee.   
</p>
<p>59. In addition, the Special Rapporteur received reports that the continuity of future 
services for people living with HIV/AIDS remains uncertain. The Special Rapporteur calls 
on the State to ensure that comprehensive access to treatment, care and support is available 
to all persons living with HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p><b> H. LGBT persons 
</b></p>
<p>60. Although the Constitution of Mongolia provides for a non-discrimination clause, 
prohibition on the basis of sexual orientation is not explicitly mentioned in the norm. As a 
result, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons in Mongolia face numerous 
human rights violations ranging from rape, physical and sexual attacks, arbitrary arrest and 
physical and sexual assault while in detention (A/HRC/WG.6/9/MNG/3). Due to fear of 
reprisals and secondary victimization, mainly by the police, many incidents of harassment 
and violence are not reported.  
</p>
<p>61. Information received suggests that discrimination against LGBT persons is endemic 
in the public, private and non-governmental sectors, and encompasses the police, the 
judiciary, health services, education, the housing sector and the media. Such levels of 
stigmatization lead to significant barriers to accessing health services, seeking employment 
and social acceptance. The Special Rapporteur also received reports that a high proportion 
of the LGBT community is living in poverty due to difficulties in finding employment or 
receiving an education because of stigmatization.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to implement the recommendations 
made during the 2011 universal periodic review of Mongolia (A/HRC/16/5) to develop 
legislation with a view to effectively protecting the rights of LGBT persons, and discourage 
the development of discriminatory ideologies in the country, through information and 
human rights education and to ensure that all allegations of attacks and threats against 
individuals targeted because of their sexual orientation are thoroughly and impartially 
investigated and punished.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Challenges to the enjoyment of specific rights by persons 
living in poverty 
</b></p>
<p>63. While people living in poverty face challenges in relation to a whole range of rights, 
this section addresses the rights that have been examined in more detail in the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s previous reports, and on which she received more information during the 
visit.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to social security and protection 
</b></p>
<p>64. The right to social security is an international human right as provided for in the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 9), the Convention on </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>the Rights of the Child (art. 26, para. 1) and the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women (art. 11 (e)). Under the Covenant, realization of 
the right to social security implies that States should take social protection and assistance 
measures under domestic law, ensure their sustainability, ensure that benefits are adequate 
in terms of amount and duration, and that the level and form of the benefits are in 
compliance with the principles of human dignity and non-discrimination. States are 
therefore obliged to establish social protection systems. 
</p>
<p>65. Since its transition to democracy in 1990, Mongolia quickly shifted from a planned 
economy to a market-oriented one. Social security had previously been provided through 
State intervention; however, with transition came mounting poverty and economic 
uncertainty. Successive Governments have attempted to use economic policies to overcome 
poverty and inequality through a variety of social protection schemes. The principal 
challenge has been to reconvert the social protection system from universal access to 
targeted assistance, with limited resource availability.  
</p>
<p>66. Since 1995 &#8211; when a new social security system came into effect &#8211;, key components 
have been covered, including social welfare services, assistance benefits, employment 
services and social insurance for working people to palliate the risk of falling into 
poverty.35 There are several schemes in place that provide financial support to a variety of 
vulnerable groups, including children, people with disabilities and older persons. 
</p>
<p>67. Despite these efforts over recent years, the expected results have not been produced.  
Politically motivated, too fragmented and ad hoc, these schemes have not ensured that the 
most vulnerable in Mongolian society are protected by social security.  
</p>
<p>68. Moreover, according to reports received by the Special Rapporteur, in recent years, 
previous Governments have used changes to the social welfare system as a means of 
garnering votes. The political manipulation of the social welfare system, in particular, the 
universal child grant scheme, seems to have created a sense of disillusionment among the 
population and a broad perception that universal access is not effective. Unverified 
assumptions suggesting that universal grants create disincentives to work or that people 
living in poverty do not invest the money wisely seem to underpin public policies, despite 
the lack of concrete evidence in this regard. Serious problems in the design and 
implementation of previous social welfare programmes should not be used as a reason for 
eliminating the provision of universal social assistance benefits across the board. Social 
protection programmes must be evidence-based and must always respect human rights 
principles and norms, in particular the principles of autonomy and agency of people living 
in poverty.   
</p>
<p>69. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, she was informed that the Government was 
working to devise and implement a new social security strategy. She welcomes the 
Government&#8217;s pledge to review the social protection system with the aim of depoliticizing 
it. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the Government&#8217;s overall intention to 
strengthen the human rights approach of its social protection system. In this regard, and 
within the limits of this report, the Special Rapporteur makes the following 
recommendations to assist the Government in developing a social protection system that

</b></p>
<p>complies with Mongolia&#8217;s international and constitutional human rights obligations and 
protects the most disadvantaged, as a matter of priority.36  
</p>
<p><b>  Targeting  
</b></p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to comprehensively assess the 
benefits of a proxy means testing methodology, through broad consultation with all 
stakeholders, including the general population and on the basis of independent and 
evidence-based reports. Particular attention should be paid to the administrative costs of 
implementing this methodology.  
</p>
<p>72. From a human rights perspective, targeting mechanisms as a means of reaching the 
poorest in society must be viewed with caution. In principle, human rights standards are not 
compromised by the use of targeted schemes as a form of prioritization of the most 
vulnerable and disadvantaged groups within a longer-term strategy of progressively 
ensuring universal protection. However, targeted schemes must be implemented with the 
intention of providing widespread coverage. 
</p>
<p>73. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that targeted schemes are implemented within a 
longer-term strategy of progressively developing universal protection, avoiding unfair 
exclusion of beneficiaries and in compliance with all other human rights principles.   
</p>
<p>74. Universal non-contributory benefits require the simplest structure with the lowest 
administrative costs and therefore are more likely to be successful in achieving their aims. 
Universal benefits can also reduce opportunities for corruption as they are available to all 
who meet the requirements, and there is no stigma attached. 
</p>
<p>75. Implementing an income- or poverty-targeted system introduces exclusion errors 
because the selection of beneficiaries is a complex and often controversial process. While 
the State has some mechanisms to minimize this (e.g. cross-checking targeting and re-
targeting exercises), which can significantly increase administrative costs, the exclusion of 
rightful beneficiaries constitutes a violation of their right to social security. Moreover, those 
excluded are often the most vulnerable who will find it more difficult to make a claim for 
their inclusion. 
</p>
<p>76. Targeting requires sophisticated administrative systems that may be too expensive to 
implement in Mongolia. Moreover, the more complicated the method of calculation &#8211; such 
as proxy means testing &#8211;, the more opaque the eligibility criteria becomes and the harder it 
is for the intended beneficiaries to scrutinize the process. As the process becomes less 
transparent it becomes increasingly difficult for individuals to make claims for protection. 
</p>
<p>77. As stressed in previous reports, the Special Rapporteur reminds the State that for all 
the above reasons,  universal schemes are more in line with human rights obligations as: (a) 
they respond to the claim of universality of human rights norms; (b) they comply with the 
principle of equality and non-discrimination; (c) they reduce opportunities for corruption 
and manipulation in the selection of beneficiaries, which typically excludes the poorest; and 
(d) they reduce possible stigmatization as they are available to all who meet the 
requirement.  
</p>
<p><b>  Legal and institutional framework and long-term strategy 
</b></p>
<p>78. The social protection system must be enshrined in law37 in order to ensure that it is a 
sustainable, transparent and accountable. 
</p>
<p>  
 36  Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 19 (2008) on the right to 
</p>
<p>social security. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>79. Lack of a strong legal and institutional framework and a complementary long-term 
strategy can seriously threaten the enjoyment of human rights by the intended beneficiaries, 
as the programmes would be more vulnerable to political manipulation, and the long-term 
involvement of State authorities in all stages of the programme would not be guaranteed.  
</p>
<p>80. A social protection strategy established by law and a long-term institutionalized 
commitment to resourcing are essential prerequisites to ensuring fiscal sustainability and 
reliable and effective implementation. Moreover, they are guarantees that the programmes 
will not terminate with each change of Government and leave beneficiaries in a more 
difficult situation than before the institution of the programme, due to the abrupt loss of 
income or other support.  
</p>
<p><b>  Adequacy of benefits 
</b></p>
<p>81. The State must ensure that benefits are adequate in terms of amount and duration, 
and that the form of the benefits provided are in compliance with the principles of human 
dignity and non-discrimination.38  
</p>
<p><b>  Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>82. Effective accountability mechanisms not only enhance protection for beneficiaries, 
they also improve the efficiency of social programmes, minimize wastage and 
mismanagement, and strengthen public support for social protection systems. When social 
protection systems are not accompanied by accountability and redress mechanisms, they are 
less likely to be understood in terms of entitlements and rights, and may rather be viewed as 
instruments of clientelism which can be manipulated by political actors or local elites. 
Independent and effective mechanisms to monitor the administration of programmes, as 
well as the establishment of built-in mechanisms to collect and process complaints are thus 
essential to prevent both the occurrence and appearance of abuse by authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to housing  
</b></p>
<p>83. While poverty is more prevalent in rural and remote areas of Mongolia, inequality in 
living standards is more pronounced in urban areas. Since 2000, urbanization has occurred 
at a rapid pace in Mongolia: Ulaanbaatar&#8217;s population has grown at 4.2 per cent annually; 
the rural population has declined by an average of 1.9 per cent in the same period. The 
capital&#8217;s share of the total population has reached 44 per cent and the overall urban 
population has reached 68 per cent of the total population, imposing significant 
socioeconomic and health challenges for the Government.39 The rural population declined 
from 43 per cent of the total population in 2000 to 32 per cent in 2010.40 
</p>
<p>84. The demand for housing in urban areas exceeds supply, particularly in Ulaanbaatar, 
leading to deterioration in housing quality. Reports received by the Special Rapporteur 
suggest that out of 273,000 families living in Ulaanbaatar in 2010, there were 
approximately 168,000 households living in <i>ger </i>districts of the city.41 The Special 
Rapporteur met with a number of families living in informal settlements in the capital and

<p>witnessed the extremely precarious situation in which they are forced to live, with no access 
to adequate shelter, water and sanitation facilities, and limited access to basic services. 
According to the World Health Organization, air and soil pollution caused by inadequate 
heating systems is contributing to serious health risks, such as respiratory disease and 
hepatitis.42  
</p>
<p>85. The State has an obligation under international human rights law to ensure that 
housing complies with all the elements to be considered adequate. The requirements for 
adequate housing are defined in general comments No. 4 and No. 7 of the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and include the principles of accessibility, 
availability of services, habitability, location and affordability. In practical terms, this 
means that steps must be taken to ensure sustainable access to safe drinking water, energy 
for cooking, heating and lighting, sanitation and washing facilities, means of food storage, 
refuse disposal, site drainage and access to emergency services. Adequate space should be 
provided to ensure that residents are protected from the elements (particularly important 
given the harsh winters in Mongolia) or other threats to health, structural hazards and 
disease vectors. Location should allow access to employment options, health-care services, 
schools, child-care centres and other social facilities. Both housing law and policy should 
take fully into account the special housing needs of vulnerable groups.43 Affordability is 
also important. The amount that a person or family pays for housing must not be so high 
that it threatens or compromises the attainment and satisfaction of other basic needs. This is 
particularly relevant for families, in particular young couples, who, due to circumstances, 
are now being forced to opt for apartments which are very expensive. There is therefore a 
need to ensure that housing costs are proportionate to overall income levels, and 
establishing subsidies for those unable to acquire affordable housing must be considered. 
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the significant challenges facing the State in 
providing adequate infrastructure for an ever-increasing urban population. She welcomes 
the efforts made by the previous Government and the Municipality of Ulaanbaatar, in 
collaboration with the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), to 
introduce a <i>ger-</i>area upgrading project. Still she remains concerned about reports received 
regarding informal settlers living under the staircases of old apartments. Their precarious 
situation needs to be assessed in line with human rights obligations, and a solution provided 
as a matter of urgency.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to access justice 
</b></p>
<p>87. In recent years, the Government has taken a number of initiatives to improve access 
to justice for those living in poverty, such as committing to the National Programme on 
Legal Aid for the Indigent (2007-2012)44 and the joint Access to Justice and Human Rights 
project (2007). The project resulted in the establishment of legal aid centres in all 21 
aimags, nine districts of the capital and six soums.45 A number of dispute-resolution 
mechanisms, including legal clinics and mediation, have also been introduced; however, the 
Special Rapporteur is concerned at reports suggesting that the allocation of limited 
resources to these centres has in some cases diminished the quality of service provided.

<p>88. The Special Rapporteur also received reports that a Legal Aid Bill is being reviewed 
as part of the current legal reform package. She commends the Government for the broad 
consultation that was carried out during the drafting of the bill, and encourages the prompt 
enactment of the law and recommends that the process be used as a model for public 
consultation in the development of important legislation in the future. 
</p>
<p>89. Despite significant progress in the juvenile justice system, much remains to be done 
to ensure the full compliance with international human rights standards. The Special 
Rapporteur encourages the State to implement rehabilitation programmes and adopt child-
centred approaches to crime prevention aimed at addressing the underlying social 
causes of youth crime, in accordance with the United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention 
of Juvenile Delinquency (General Assembly resolution 45/112, annex), and to ensure that 
pretrial detention facilities are not only adequately equipped, but are also child friendly. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. International assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>90. Mongolia used to be one of the most aid-dependent countries in the world, with $2.5 
billion of foreign aid received from 1991 to 2002. However, due to the country&#8217;s strong 
</p>
<p>economic growth in recent years, aid dependency has decreased.46 
</p>
<p>91. Despite the fact that, in terms of economic growth, Mongolia now enjoys the status 
of a middle-income country, international cooperation will remain crucial, particularly in 
relation to the enhancement of social policies and further developing the legal and 
institutional framework for human rights. The high level of inequality necessitates 
continued support from the international community and the Special Rapporteur therefore 
urges donors to provide Mongolia with the necessary funds to assist with the development 
of a comprehensive poverty-reduction programme.    
</p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur also urges the Government to increase its efforts to take 
ownership of services currently provided with the assistance of the donor community and 
international agencies. Of particular concern is the work related to HIV/AIDS and the 
health care provided for those living with tuberculosis. The Special Rapporteur encourages 
the Government to take steps to ensure that when funding stops for the provision of  
services for HIV/AIDS (Global Fund) and for tuberculosis (GAVI Alliance) procedures are 
in place to continue the services provided for both groups.. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the steps already taken by the recently 
established Government to tackle poverty and inequality, increase employment 
</b></p>
<p><b>generation and improve the effectiveness of poverty-reduction measures. However, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>evidenced in this report, considerable challenges remain, particularly with regards to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the increasing income gap between the rich and the poor, lack of implementation in 
</b></p>
<p><b>relation to legislation and poverty reduction policies, and the lingering risk of 
</b></p>
<p><b>corruption. In order to ensure a future where everyone benefits </b>from Mongolia&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>economic growth, immediate action must be taken to more effectively implement the 
</b></p>
<p><b>poverty-reduction strategies.
