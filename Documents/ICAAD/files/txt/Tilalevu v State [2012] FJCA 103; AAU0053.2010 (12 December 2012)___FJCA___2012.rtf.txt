6.      
A single Judge of the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to decide on an application to withdraw an appeal. In terms of Rule 39 of the Court of Appeal Rules, the single Judge should direct the application for withdrawal to the made before the Full Court.

Therefore I direct that this case be placed in the list of cases to be heard before the Full Court.
