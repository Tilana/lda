</p>

<p><b>S-9/1. The grave violations of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, particularly due to the recent Israeli military attacks  
against the occupied Gaza Strip 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging </i>that peace, security, development and human rights are the pillars of the 
United Nations system, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people and the inadmissibility 
of the acquisition of land by the use of force, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming </i>the applicability of international human rights law to the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem, </p>

<p>A/HRC/S-9/L.1 
page 2 
 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming also </i>the applicability of international humanitarian law, namely the Fourth 
Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, to the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that international human rights law and international humanitarian law are 
complementary and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the obligations of the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva 
Convention,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that each High Contracting Party to the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to 
the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is under the obligation to respect and ensure 
the respect for the obligations arising from that Convention, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that the right to life constitutes the most fundamental of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing serious</i> <i>concern</i> at the lack of implementation by the occupying Power, Israel, 
of previously adopted resolutions and recommendations of the Council relating to the human 
rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the massive ongoing Israeli military operation in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, has caused grave violations of the human 
rights of the Palestinian civilians therein, exacerbated the severe humanitarian crisis in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory and undermined international efforts towards achieving a just and 
lasting peace in the region,  
</p>
<p><i> Condemning </i>all forms of violence against civilians and deploring the loss of human lives 
in the context of the current situation, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that the Israeli siege imposed on the occupied Gaza Strip, including the 
closure of border crossings and the cutting of the supply of fuel, food and medicine, constitutes 
collective punishment of Palestinian civilians and leads to disastrous humanitarian and 
environmental consequences, </p>
