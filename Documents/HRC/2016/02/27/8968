<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 2005/41 entitled &#8220;Elimination of 
violence against women&#8221;, encouraged the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, its 
causes and consequences (hereinafter &#8220;the Special Rapporteur&#8221;) to respond effectively to reliable 
information that comes before her and requested all Governments to cooperate with and assist 
the Special Rapporteur in the performance of her mandated tasks and duties, to supply all 
information requested, including with regard to implementation of her recommendations, and to 
respond to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visits and communications. 
</p>
<p>2. The present addendum to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s annual report contains, on a country by 
country basis, summaries of individual allegations, as well as urgent appeals sent to 
Governments on individual cases and general situations of concern to her mandate. This report 
includes summaries of the communications sent from 5 December 2007 to 28 February 2009 
(with respect to allegation letters), and from 5 January 2008 to 02 April 2009 (with respect 
to urgent appeals). The report also contains summaries of government replies received 
until 30 April 2009. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur recalls that in issuing urgent appeals and transmitting allegations, 
she does not make any judgment concerning the merits of the respective cases, nor does she 
necessarily support the opinions and activities of the persons on behalf of whom she intervenes. 
The names of individual victims and alleged perpetuators have been replaced by initials in order 
to protect the privacy and prevent further victimization of the former and to prevent undue 
judgement of the latter. In the original communications, the full names of victims and 
perpetuators have been provided to the Government concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  OVERVIEW OF COMMUNICATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>4. From 5 December 2007 to 02 April 2009, the Special Rapporteur 
transmitted 93 communications to 34 Member States: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, 
Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, Egypt, 
Ethiopia, France, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Iran, Iraq, Ireland, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, 
Mexico, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Norway, Pakistan, People&#8217;s Republic of China, 
Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, 
United Kingdom, Zimbabwe. A total of 37 communications (which represents 40 %) were sent 
to five States alone, i.e. Iran, Pakistan, India, Mexico and Sudan. 
</p>
<p>5. A total of 51 communications are allegation letters pertaining to allegations of human 
rights violations that had already occurred or reflect longstanding concerns. In 42 cases, the 
Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal because a human rights violation was ongoing or 
imminent, and there was a need to inform the government authorities about the allegations 
received without any delay. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 5 
 
</p>
<p>6. 80 out of 93 communications were sent jointly with other mandate holders of the Human 
Rights Council, as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders (41) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression (30) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment (25) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers (14) 
&#8226; The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions (9) 
&#8226; The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (8) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living (5) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur on the right to education (3) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health (3) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance (2) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief (2) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people (2) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants (1) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The independent expert on minority issues (1) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography (1) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food (1) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea (1) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international 
financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly 
economic, social and cultural rights (1) </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Independent Expert appointed by the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights in Haiti (1) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation (1) 
</p>
<p>7. The largest number of joint communications were sent together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and, the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Special Rapporteur 
notes that this fact indicates that the reporting of the forms of human rights violations 
experienced by women converge with that of more conventional forms of violations. However, 
the complaints contained in this report are not representative of the full range of human rights 
violations women encounter in different parts of the world. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Cooperation and replies of Governments to the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>8. In each of the communications, the Special Rapporteur has asked Governments to respond 
to a detailed set of questions in order to clarify the allegations submitted. The Special Rapporteur 
remains concerned that only 19 Governments out of the 34 concerned replied to communications 
sent to them. The Special Rapporteur expresses her appreciation to have received 38 responses 
during the period under review, and wishes to thank the Governments of China, Turkey and 
the United States of America for their responses to earlier communications sent between 2005 
and 2007. 
</p>
<p>9. The following Member States did not respond to any of the communications that the 
Special Rapporteur sent during the period under review<i>:</i> Afghanistan, Brazil, Colombia, 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Honduras, Iraq, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Norway, 
Papua New Guinea, Somalia, Sudan, and the United Kingdom. 
</p>
<p>10. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to recall Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 2005/41 in which the Commission requested all Governments to cooperate with and 
assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of her mandated tasks and duties and to supply 
all information requested, including with respect to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communications. 
</p>
<p><b>III. COMMUNICATIONS SENT AND GOVERNMENT  
REPLIES RECEIVED 
</b></p>
<p>11. The communications contained in this report are provided in the original language 
submitted or received, with the exception of government replies for which a translation was 
required. In some cases the Special Rapporteur provides suggestions on which additional 
information is required to respond effectively to the information received or draws the attention 
of Governments concerned to relevant findings and recommendations contained in her country 
mission reports and international human rights instruments. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>12. On<b> 24 April 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
of freedom of opinion and expression sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning 
Ms. K. A., deputy editor-in-chief of <i>Radio Faryad </i>and producer of a talk-show about political 
and social issues in Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>13. According to the information received, on 11 April 2008, unidentified gunmen carried out 
a grenade attack against Ms. K.A.&#8217;s home in Herat province. Over the past two months, she had 
been receiving anonymous calls in which she was warned to leave her job. On 6 April, in a 
similar grenade attack, part of her home was destroyed. According to sources, this attack could 
be part of efforts by hard-line groups to constrain the media, particularly in relation to the role of 
women as journalists and their right to work in the media. 
<b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>14. On<b> 22 May 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right of 
freedom of opinion and expression sent an urgent appeal concerning the situation of Mrs. N. H., 
presenter of the local public television station, <i>Heart TV. 
</i></p>
<p>15. According to the information received, on 14 May 2008, Ms. N. H. was injured on her way 
to the TV station by two men and a woman armed with a knife. They put her in a taxi and 
accompanied her to her office, warning her that &#8220;if [she does] not resign, the next time will be 
the end&#8221;. This incident was preceded by several threatening phone calls. 
</p>
<p>16. On 15 May, Ms. N. H. was stabbed in her home in Herat by an unidentified woman. She 
was taken to a hospital and discharged on the same day. Since then, she has continued receiving 
death threats, and has repeatedly changed residence. Despite her appeals for help, Ms. N. H. did 
not receive any police protection. 
</p>
<p>17. In early May 2008, following threats from unidentified individuals to all public radio and 
TV employees, 13 male and female journalists resigned. 
18. Serious concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of N. H. 
Further concern was expressed that the abovementioned acts of harassment against N. H. may be 
related to her exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Finally, concern was 
also expressed that this more recent physical attack could be part of efforts by hard-line groups 
to constrain the media, particularly in the Heart province, mainly in relation to the role of women 
as journalists and their right to work in the media. 
<b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>19. On<b> 14 August 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers sent an allegation letter to 
the Government concerning Ms. M. A., member of the <i>Afghan Women&#8217;s Skills Development 
Centre (AWSDC)</i>, a non-governmental organization (NGO) dedicated to reducing the suffering 
of Afghan women and children through rehabilitation and development projects and the 
promotion of peace. 
</p>
<p>20. According to information received, on 21 July 2008, Ms M. A. went to the Attorney 
General&#8217;s office with a client who had been summoned there. In an argument with the women, 
the Attorney General claimed that the AWSDC supported prostitutes and that its members must 
pay the price for this. Ms M. A. was detained for three hours. No reason was given for her 
detention. 
</p>
<p>21. Concern was expressed that the detention of Ms M. A. may be related to her legitimate and 
peaceful activities to defend women&#8217;s rights in Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Afghanistan did not reply to any of 
the above communications sent during the period under review. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur reiterates her interest in receiving responses from the Government 
in regard to the allegations submitted and would be particularly interested to know whether these 
cases have resulted in any prosecutions of alleged perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall the recommendations contained in her report 
following her visit to Afghanistan in July 2005, which she considers to be still valid. 
</p>
<p><b>Bahrain 
</b></p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>25. On <b>26 August 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 
sent an allegation letter to the Government regarding current judicial practices in relation to 
family matters and the absence of a Family Code in the Kingdom of Bahrain, with implications 
for women&#8217;s ability to enjoy family rights upon divorce and leave abusive relationships. 
26. The Special Rapporteur noted that in the absence of a family code, judges seemed to 
appear to decide cases according to their personal interpretation of Shari&#8217;a, often favouring men.<b>1</b> 
In this regard, the Committee against Torture cited the broad discretionary powers of Shari&#8217;a 
courts in the application of the law to cases relating to personal status cases and recommended 
that Bahrain adopt a Family Code.<b>2</b>

</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government, the case of 
Ms. S. A-M., a Bahraini citizen, divorced from her husband, with whom she had a daughter. 
When the girl reached seven years of age, her father filed a case at a Shari&#8217;a Court to obtain the 
guardianship of his daughter. It is reported that according to Shari&#8217;a Law, guardianship of a child 
who reaches seven is transferred from the mother to the father. 
</p>
<p>28. Through the help of a lawyer, Ms. S. A.-M. filed a case at the First Level Shari&#8217;a 
Court n&#176; 3, Jaffaria Division. Hearings between Ms. S. A-M. and her ex-husband were held 
on 6 May, 20 May and 15 June 2008. The next hearing was fixed for 7 September 2008. 
</p>
<p>29. Both parties had reached an informal agreement at the end of June for the mother to keep 
the daughter, with an increased number of visits by the father. However, during the hearing held 
on 29 June 2008, Ms. S. A.-M.&#8217;s ex-husband allegedly refused any agreement. 
</p>
<p>30. It is reported that Ms. S. A- M. approached the Supreme Council for Women in April 2008, 
seeking legal aid and support. She filed a case (n&#176; 365) but since then has never heard back from 
the Supreme Council. 
</p>
<p>31. Ms. S. A-M had also contacted the brothers and sisters of her ex-husband, who confirmed 
her allegations that he is mentally unstable. She also alleged that her ex-husband had sexually 
abused the child when she was 3 years old. She apparently has a medical certificate attesting to 
the abuse. 
</p>
<p>32. It is reported that Ms. S.A-M. contacted the Child Protection Unit within the Ministry 
of Social Affairs. This Unit promised to provide an independent report to the Shari&#8217;a Court, 
based on observations and assessment of living standards at her home as well as at that of her 
ex-husband. It is however alleged that judges of Shari&#8217;a Courts are not obliged to follow any of 
the recommendations of the report. 
</p>
<p>33. Concerns were expressed that the guardianship of that child could not be decided upon 
based on objective criteria, which take into account the best interests of the child and consider 
both parties equally. 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>34. On <b>21 October 2008</b>, the Government replied to the letter sent on 26 August 2008. It 
stated that on 29 January 2001, the husband of <b>Ms. S. A-M. </b>filed a suit against his wife before 
the competent (Shari&#8217;a) court, in which he demanded that his wife return to the marital home. 
According to the Government, Ms. S. A- M. filed two counter-suits before the competent 
(Shari&#8217;a) court, petitioning for a divorce from her husband. The court decided to join the latter 
two suits to the one filed by the husband. 
</p>
<p>35. The Government maintained that the court delivered several other relevant rulings. In the 
case in which the wife (Ms. S. A- M.) petitioned for a divorce from her husband, a judgement 
was delivered granting the wife a divorce. In the case in which the husband demanded his wife&#8217;s 
(Ms. S. A- M.) return to the marital home, the court issued a judgement dismissing the petition </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>on the grounds that the divorce rendered it void. In the case in which the wife (Ms. S. A- M.) 
petitioned for payment of the deferred part of the marriage gift (mu&#8217;akkhar al-sadaq), the matter 
was referred to the competent Shari&#8217;a court. 
</p>
<p>36. The Government moreover indicated that on 1 February 2006, the husband filed an appeal 
against the decision of the court to grant a divorce to Ms. S. A-M. On 20 May 2006, a judgement 
was issued dismissing the appeal. On 22 April 2008, the husband filed a suit, petitioning 
for custody of his daughter and an annulment of the maintenance payment arrangement. 
Ms. S. A-M. filed a counter-suit asking to be allowed to retain custody of the child, and to 
continue to receive maintenance payments. The court decided to consider both cases together 
and set a date of 28 October 2008 for the hearing. 
</p>
<p>37. The Government of Bahrain further informed the Special Rapporteur that, with regard to 
the abduction of the child by the father, a judgement was issued finding the husband guilty of 
abducting the child, ordering him to pay a 200 dinar fine and granting the mother (Ms. S. A- M.) 
the right to retain custody of the child. 
</p>
<p>38. The Government also asserted that the legal procedures followed by the court in deferring 
sessions, hearing the testimony of both parties and the witnesses, and assessing the documentary 
and other evidence, were based on its competence and knowledge of the specific nature of 
Shari&#8217;a cases, together with its assessment of the actual damage in the case. The court 
furthermore acted in conformity with the rules set out in the Code of Procedures issued by 
Decree Law No. 26 of 1986, concerning the Shari&#8217;a courts. 
</p>
<p>39. Concerning the regulations applied by the Shari&#8217;a courts on the guardianship of children 
upon divorce, the Government stressed that the courts followed the rules of the Islamic Shari&#8217;a in 
cases referred to them by the Sunni and Ja`fari divisions, and were essentially guided by the best 
interests of the child, which constituted the basis of all measures taken in accordance with the 
Islamic Shari&#8217;a and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>40. Moreover, concerning the adoption of a family code, the Government of Bahrain stated 
that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the bureau of the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) in the Kingdom had signed a project document (on 28 July 2008) to support 
an action plan to follow up on the implementation of the Government&#8217;s voluntary commitments 
and pledges to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>41. The Government further stated that in July 2008, a committee was set up to oversee the 
implementation of the commitments and voluntary human rights pledges made by the Kingdom 
in connection with the universal periodic review report. 
</p>
<p>42. Finally, the Government presented a timetable for the development of a draft law on the 
family, and a process to ensure its adoption and implementation with the assistance of 
governmental and non governmental stakeholders that are members of the committee. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Bahrain for its reply to her 
communication of 26 August 2008. </p>

<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>44. On <b>12 January 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture sent an allegation 
letter to the Government concerning Ms. L. A. B., a 15-year-old girl who was sexually abused 
while in detention. 
</p>
<p>45. According to the information received, in October 2007, Ms. L. A. B. was arrested on 
suspicion of petty theft and placed in pre-trial detention in the city of Abaetetuba, Par&#225; State. For 
a period of 26 days she was held in a police cell with about 20 adult male prisoners. Ms. L. A. B. 
was reportedly raped by several co-prisoners during this time. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Brazil did not reply to this 
communication. The Special Rapporteur reiterates her interest in receiving responses from the 
Government in regard to the allegation submitted and would be particularly interested to know 
whether this case has resulted in any prosecutions of alleged perpetrators and investigations as to 
detention practices by relevant authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>Canada 
</b></p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>47. On<b> 14 March 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, sent an allegation letter to the Government regarding acts of ritual 
abuse in Canada, as shown in the case of Ms. A. C., a Canadian female university student, 
born 8 October 1984. 
</p>
<p>48. According to the allegations received, A. C. claimed that she had been - and still was - 
victim of &#8220;ritual abuse-torture&#8221; (<i>sic</i>) both within her family and by a group of persons unknown 
to her. Her father, W. C., and mother, J. C., abused her physically and sexually at home. Her 
father also brought her to &#8220;ritual abuse-torture&#8221; meetings, where members of the group abused 
and tortured her, both alone and in front of others. Amongst the perpetrators were also her 
grandparents, D. and D. W., and other persons, some of which she recognised as being members 
of a local Mormon church her family used to go to, and others unknown to her. 
</p>
<p>49. The alleged ritual abuse-torture took place in various places around Calgary in the 
province of Alberta and in Toronto, Ontario. During one of the meetings Ms. A. C. was required 
to attend, she was forced to prematurely give birth to her baby, whose body was used as an object 
of the group rituals. 
</p>
<p>50. Ms. A. C. attempted to report her abuse to the police in Toronto and in Calgary 
between 2002-2007 but allegedly she was never believed and no report was taken. Allegedly, the 
police told her there would probably be no evidence or treated her as if she was crazy. She also </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>tried to talk to nurses and doctors in the places she was hospitalized several times between 2001 
and 2005 for depressiveness and suicidal tendency, but without any result. Thus, according to the 
information received, no action, investigation, or protection measures were taken by any 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>51. Apparently Ms. A. C. also attempted to run away as a child, was placed in foster care, but 
was always returned to her family where she was continuously abused. Ms. A. C. affirms she has 
been dealing with frustration, isolation and hopelessness all her life, because of the refusal of 
government agencies and social and health professionals to assist her. 
</p>
<p>52. In 1993, the final report of the Canadian Panel on Violence against Women, (Changing the 
landscape: Ending violence ~ Achieving equality; Catalogue No. SW45-1/1993; Ottawa: 
Minister of Supply and Services Canada), which provides comprehensive documentation on 
violence against women in Canada from a variety of perspectives and makes recommendations 
for government and private-sector action at all levels, informed the Canadian government that 
action needed to be taken to protect women and children from &#8220;ritual abuse and torture&#8221; which 
according to the Panel&#8217;s report was occurring in every region of Canada. The Panel also referred 
to Ms. A. C.&#8217;s case among others. However, according to the information received, no action had 
been taken to address the alleged abuses. 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>53. On 29 July 2008, the Government replied to the letter sent on 14 March 2008. It stated that 
the lack of specific information in the allegation letter made it difficult to find relevant 
information. 
</p>
<p>54. The Canadian Government said that an initial search for details concerning Ms. A. C. or 
her case yielded no information, proof that her allegations were not in the public domain. 
According to the Government, her details did not appear in any search of public records such as 
the popular press, the internet or any court case involving the allegations contained in the 
complaint. 
</p>
<p>55. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the information concerning 
allegations by Ms. A. C. could not be confirmed by Canada without a search of protected 
personal information contained in Government records or the records of other public or private 
entities and persons, protected by legislation on privacy and the protection of personal 
information. 
</p>
<p>56. Furthermore, the Government stressed that the allegations regarding the lack of response 
by the police and medical and other professionals into ritual abuse or other forms of violence 
against women required an investigation into matters which lie at the core of personal 
information. The laws of both Alberta and Ontario were such that written consent was required 
from the complainant before relevant information could be collected and shared. 
</p>
<p>57. The Canadian Government, therefore, asked the Special Rapporteur to attempt to 
obtain the express signed consent of the complainant in respect of information held by relevant </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p>identities or persons. The Government provided assurances that if and when the signed consent 
forms were received by Canada, an investigation into the allegations of the complainant could 
begin in earnest. 
</p>
<p>58. The Government&#8217;s reply also contained two excerpts taken from decisions of Canadian 
courts concerning descriptions of ritual abuse.<b>3</b> Reference to a third case was also made, where 
nine people, including five police officers, were arrested on more than 150 child abuse charges.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>59. Finally, the Government provided as Annex a document outlining legislative, regulatory 
and other measures against ritual abuse in the Province of Ontario (including the Domestic 
Violence Action Plan; Child and Family Services Act; and initiatives undertaken by the Ministry 
of the Attorney General and of the Ontario Women&#8217;s Directorate). 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter (follow-up to 29 July 2008 response from the Government) 
</b>60. On <b>17 November 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, sent a follow-up letter to the Government regarding Ms. A.C., and her complaint 
of having been victim of &#8216;ritual abuse-torture&#8217;. 
</p>
<p>61. As suggested by the Government, the Rapporteur contacted Ms. A. C., who, after a period 
of reflection, decided to sign the consent forms on the disclosure of personal information that the 
Government had submitted. 
</p>
<p>62. As an accompaniment to each consent form, Ms. A. C. expressed fears over the future 
conduct of an investigation and what it may reveal. She also expressed strong concerns over how 
the suffering she faced was considered. Ms. A. C. expressed her hopes that her suffering be 
acknowledged as &#8220;ritual abuse-torture&#8221; and not &#8220;Satanic rituals&#8221;, as discussed in one of the 
court&#8217;s decisions recalled by the Government in its reply. Ms. A. C. believed that the commonly 
used term &#8220;ritual abuse&#8221; did not adequately describe the violent acts she had endured. 
</p>
<p>63. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur drew the Government&#8217;s attention to the different 
forms of gender-specific violence which could amount to torture, referring to the last report to 
the Human Rights Council of the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture (A/HRC/7/3), as 
well as to the Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Canada for its reply to her 
communication of 14 March 2008. The Special Rapporteur hopes to receive a more 
comprehensive response following her follow-up letter sent on 17 November 2008, and would be 
particularly interested to know whether this case has resulted in any prosecutions of alleged 
perpetrators and whether the victim has been granted reparation.

<p>65. El <b>5 de septiembre de 2008</b>, la Relatora Especial sobre la violencia contra la mujer, con 
inclusi&#243;n de sus causas y consecuencias, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los 
defensores de los derechos humanos enviaron un llamamiento urgente al Gobierno de Colombia 
en relaci&#243;n con un ataque contra la Sra. L. F. M. R., integrante de la <i>Fundaci&#243;n Esperanza y 
Dignidad</i>. Esta organizaci&#243;n defiende los derechos humanos de las mujeres y las ni&#241;as. 
66. La Sra. L. F. M. R. supuestamente se ha visto obligada a desplazarse a diferentes regiones 
de Colombia a ra&#237;z de amenazas en su contra. Seg&#250;n se nos informa, las &#193;guilas Negras la 
hab&#237;an declarado objetivo militar, hab&#237;a recibido amenazas telef&#243;nicas y por correo electr&#243;nico, y 
sus hijos tambi&#233;n hab&#237;an sido amenazados. 
67. De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas, el 21 de agosto de 2008, la Sra. L. F. M. R. 
habr&#237;a sido atacada por dos desconocidos en un parque en Bogot&#225; cuando iba a una oficina de 
Bienestar Familial para recoger unos documentos. Uno de los desconocidos la habr&#237;a agarrado y 
habr&#237;a presionado un arma de fuego contra su costado. Mientras tanto, el otro habr&#237;a intentado 
pincharla con una aguja hipod&#233;rmica. El que llevar&#237;a el arma de fuego habr&#237;a preguntado a la 
Sra. L. F. M. R. si quer&#237;a morirse all&#237; cuando &#233;sta habr&#237;a intentado soltarse, y el otro la habr&#237;a 
pinchado tres veces con la aguja, inyect&#225;ndole un l&#237;quido desconocido. Los desconocidos 
la habr&#237;an empujado y le habr&#237;an advertido que le quedaban doce horas de vida. Luego la 
Sra. L. F. M. R. habr&#237;a ido a un hospital donde habr&#237;a recibido asistencia m&#233;dica y psicol&#243;gica. 
</p>
<p>68. La Relatora Especial ha expresado preocupaci&#243;n que el ataque y las amenazas contra la 
Sra. L. F. M. R. podr&#237;an estar relacionados con sus actividades leg&#237;timas en la defensa de los 
derechos humanos de las mujeres y las ni&#241;as. Tambi&#233;n se expresa preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad 
f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de la Sra. L. F. M. R. y la de su familia. 
</p>

<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>71. On <b>2 April 2009, </b>the Special Rapporteur jointly with Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of </p>

</p>
<p>human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding U.S. 
citizens Ms. L. L. and Ms. E. L., journalists with the San Francisco based online television 
station <i>Current TV</i>. 
</p>
<p>72. According to information received Ms. L. L., Ms. E. L. and their cameraman Mr. M.K. 
were arrested on 17 March 2009 by North Korean authorities on the border between North Korea 
and China. They were on a reporting assignment to investigate the alleged trafficking and sale of 
women from North Korea into China. It is not clear whether Ms. L. L. and Ms. E. L. were 
arrested on North Korean territory. Several sources suggest that North Korean border guards 
may have crossed the Tumen river (that forms the border) while they were filming on the 
Chinese bank. 
</p>
<p>73. Ms. L. L. and Ms. E. L. are currently being held in Pyongyang on charges of entering 
North Korea &#8220;illegally&#8221; and of carrying out &#8220;hostile activities&#8221;. If convicted they face a sentence 
of up to 10 years of forced labour. A Swedish diplomat has been allowed to visit them in 
Pyongyang. Mr. M. K. who managed to escape from the North Korean border guards, was 
detained for several days by Chinese authorities before being deported. Their guide, a Chinese 
citizen of North Korean origin, is reportedly still being detained by the Chinese police.  
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>74. On <b>8 April 2009</b>, the Government replied to the letter sent on 2 April 2009. It stated that 
the Government did not feel the need to respond to such a communication as it considered it an 
attempt to instruct a sovereign state on what it should do based on distorted information. The 
Government added that the two American reporters were detained on 17 March 2009 as a result 
of their hostile acts and illegal entry into DPRK territory by crossing the DPRK-China border. It 
further said that while the investigation was under way, consular contacts were allowed and the 
detained were treated in accordance with relevant international law. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its prompt reply and 
invites the Government to regularly update the Rapporteurs on the progress and findings of the 
investigation.<b>

<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>76. On <b>16 May 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of expression, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders 
sent an allegation letter to the Government regarding Ms. M. A., a medical professional with the 
El Nadim Centre for Psychological management and Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence, an 
organisation that assists victims of torture and violence. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>77. According to the information received, on 30 April 2008, Ms. M. A. was physically 
assaulted by a police officer in a courtroom in the town of Kafr El Dawwar, in the district of 
Beheira. She suffered a broken shoulder, as well as injuries to the head. She lost consciousness 
for thirty minutes. 
</p>
<p>78. The assault occurred after Ms. M. A. had testified in a case concerning members of a 
local family who allegedly had been subjected to torture by local police. On the morning of 
30 April 2008, El Nadim Centre had released a statement calling for an investigation into the 
allegations of torture and other ill-treatment of members of the S. M. S. H. family by the local 
police in Kafr El Dawwar. 
</p>
<p>79. After the assault, the police officer who attacked Ms. M. A. was taken into custody. He 
later stated that he had been following the orders of Chief intelligence officer Mr. A. M. of the 
Kafr El Dawwar police. 
</p>
<p>80. During the hearing, the car of Ms. M.H.I.H., another psychiatrist at the El Nadim Centre, 
which was parked outside the courtroom, was vandalized under circumstances that were not 
clear. 
</p>
<p>81. Concern was expressed that the assault against Ms. M. A. could have been related to her 
legitimate and non-violent work in the defense of human rights, in particular her work to defend 
the rights of victims of violence and torture. Concern was expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Ms. M. A. as well as that of all members of the El Nadim Centre. 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>82. On <b>25 July 2008</b>, the Government replied to the letter sent on 16 May 2008. It stated that 
while domestic mechanisms continued to consider the complaint and were impartially reviewing 
the allegations of the different parties and the evidence at their disposal, it was for the Egyptian 
courts to have the final say on the parties&#8217; allegations. 
</p>
<p>83. The Government of Egypt stated that the State had safeguarded the rights of all the parties 
throughout every phase of the investigation. It offered assurances that, should the police officer 
identified by the victim be proven to be involved in the commission of the offence, the State 
would take rigorous action to deal with the situation through the courts and through internal 
monitoring and disciplinary mechanisms. The Government also committed itself to inform the 
Special Rapporteur on any new developments on the case. 
</p>
<p>84. The Government stated that the police lieutenant in charge of criminal investigations at the 
Buhairah Security Department said, when questioned, that on 30 April 2008, Ms. M. A. had gone 
to the hearing without first notifying the judicial or police authorities and without informing the 
persons in charge of security for the court building and for the defendants in the case. He said 
that as the victim was heading for the staircase of the court, the accused, A. A. I., had grabbed 
her handbag. However, when she had called out for help, the accused had let go of her handbag 
and she had fallen over, injuring herself. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>85. The Government also stated that the police lieutenant said that a number of persons had 
managed to catch the accused and had then assaulted and injured him. He added that the 
investigation had not found any link between the accused and a member of the Kafr al-Dawwar 
police force. He also said that an inquiry was being conducted to identify those responsible for 
vandalizing Ms. M.H.I.H.&#8217;s car. Further, the Government added that the police lieutenant stated 
that there was no truth to Ms. M. A.&#8217;s statements about the accused stealing papers or 
documents; the accused had let go of her handbag when passers-by had chased and finally caught 
him. 
</p>
<p>86. Moreover, the Government added that, when questioned, the second victim, 
Ms. M. H. I. H. (the owner of the car that was vandalized), said that on the date of the incident 
she had driven Ms. M. A. in her car to the appeal hearing at Kafr al-Dawwar Court. She had 
parked her car outside the court building and she and her passenger proceeded to enter the court 
room. Upon entering the room, she had seen the officer identified by the first victim and sensed 
that two persons were there watching them. Later, as she was leaving the room, she heard a voice 
calling for help and she found her friend lying unconscious with a wound above her right 
eyebrow. She ran out to fetch her car only to find that the front and back tires and the right-hand 
mirror had been vandalized. She did not know who was responsible for the damage but blamed 
the aforementioned officer for inciting a person to vandalize her car, because the El Nadim 
Centre had threatened him in the press with imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>87. The Government further detailed the actions that had been taken, including: the issuance of 
a medical report on the victim, a medical report on the accused A. A. I.; the examination of the 
car by the Department of Public Prosecutions; the signed medical report by the accused A.A. I. 
indicating the date on which his injuries had occurred, what had caused them and how they had 
been inflicted, as well as the events leading up to the incident; the signed medical report by 
Dr. M. M. A. indicating the date on which the injuries had occurred, what had caused them and 
how they had been inflicted, as well as the events leading up to the incident; the decision by the 
Department of Public Prosecutions to place A. A. I. in custody for four days pending further 
investigations, which was then extended by a further 15 days by the court. 
</p>
<p>88. Furthermore, the Government of Egypt said that at a hearing held on 17 May 2008, the 
Misdemeanours Court decided to release the accused, A. A. I. on condition that he provide 
his address and declare that he was not being sought for any other offence. On the same day, 
the Department of Public Prosecutions appealed the decision. The appeal was heard on 
18 May 2008. The court accepted the appeal as being in good and due form but decided on the 
merits to uphold the decision to release the accused, on condition that he was not being sought 
on another count. Finally, the Government stated that the investigators were still questioning 
M. A. A.S., a lawyer, and H. Q., a journalist, about the incident.

<p><b>Ethiopia 
</b></p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>90. On <b>5 March 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture sent an allegation 
letter to the Government concerning Ms. H. M. H.,<b> </b>the 12-year-old daughter of Mr. M. H. A., a 
Djiboutian refugee. 
91. According to information received, on 17 December 2007, Ms. H. M. H, was abducted by 
Mr. E. M., a 23-years-old Ethiopian, and his family. A complaint for abduction and confinement 
was lodged by Mr M. H. A. 
</p>
<p>92. Reportedly, E. M. raped H. M. H. during 17 days. In order to avoid that E. M. be charged 
with the rape and convicted, his uncle, a police commander, and one of his assistants, allegedly 
charged Ms. H. M. H. for the theft of a washing tab and detained her. 
</p>
<p>93. Allegedly, the victim was forced to admit the theft, to state she had no family, to change 
her name and to mention she was older (over 16) than she actually was, so as to utilize this 
wrong information in court. Ms. H. M. H. was detained at the Central Prison in Addis Abeba, 
together with adults, until 15 February 2008. On 24 December 2007, her father was 
finally informed of the situation. However, he was not allowed to visit his daughter 
before 26 January 2008. 
</p>
<p>94. The Ethiopian Embassy in Paris, which was contacted by mail by some organizations 
supporting Ms. H. M. H.&#8217;s father, orally replied that the girl was 16 and that she was the wife of 
a young Ethiopian. These facts have reportedly been proven false however, by her birth 
certificate and health card issued by an Ethiopian hospital, which state that she was born 
on 20 September 1995. Neighbours and her family have also declared that she was not married. 
</p>
<p>95. On 15 February 2008, H. M. S. was released. However, the investigation into the 
accusations against her concerning the theft was still ongoing<i>.</i> 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>96. On <b>21 January 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning<b> </b>the restrictions on human rights 
organizations in Ethiopia that may result from the adoption of the &#8220;Proclamation for the 
Registration and Regulation of Charities and Societies&#8221; (hereinafter: &#8220;the Proclamation&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>97. The Proclamation was the subject of a previous urgent appeal sent on 17 July 2008, by the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. No reply has been 
received to date from your Excellency&#8217;s Government to that communication. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>98. The Proclamation was adopted on 5 January 2009 by the Ethiopian Parliament. The 
adoption of the law was preceded by several months&#8217; negotiations during which the draft was 
subject to amendments. The Rapporteurs noted that<b> </b>while they considered the stated aim to 
enhance the transparency and accountability of civil society organizations as legitimate, they 
were of the opinion that the law in its current form would result in serious restrictions on the 
activities of NGOs working on a host of human rights issues. The strict implementation of the 
Proclamation would render it nearly impossible for many civil society organizations to carry out 
their work in Ethiopia. 
</p>
<p>99. The Proclamation establishes three categories of non-governmental organizations (referred 
to in the Proclamation as &#8220;charities&#8221; or &#8220;societies&#8221;): Ethiopian Charities or Societies; Ethiopian 
Residents Charities and Foreign Charities. The consequences of the new definitions are serious, 
as Foreign and Ethiopian Resident Charities are expressly banned from carrying out any work 
related to: &#8216;the advancement of human and democratic rights&#8217;; &#8216;the promotion of equality of 
nations, nationalities and peoples and that of gender and religion&#8217;; &#8216;the promotion of the rights of 
the disabled and children&#8217;s rights&#8217;; &#8216;the promotion of conflict resolution or reconciliation&#8217;; &#8216;the 
promotion of justice and law enforcement services&#8217;.<b>5</b> 
100. The Proclamation expressly bars Ethiopian NGOs which receive more than 10% of their 
funding from foreign sources from working in the areas listed above. It would also make any 
work by foreign NGOs in these fields illegal without the written consent of the Ethiopian 
government. The Proclamation establishes the Charities and Societies Agency (hereinafter, the 
Agency) with reportedly wide-ranging and discretionary powers to decide on the legal 
recognition of NGOs, to disband NGOs that have already been legally recognized, and to subject 
NGOs to intrusive patterns of surveillance. 
</p>
<p>101. The Proclamation also prescribes criminal penalties for administrative infractions. 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>102. By letter dated <b>16 February 2009</b>, the Government replied to the communication sent 
on 21 January 2009. It confirmed that the Parliament passed the Charities and Societies 
Proclamation, which would contribute to ensuring transparency and accountability. The 
Government stated that the statements made by the Rapporteurs did not accurately describe the 
words and spirit of the Proclamation. It said that one of the objectives of the Proclamation had 
been to introduce the rule of law in the formation, operation and dissolution of these 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>103. The Government recognized that while Ethiopian Charities were free to engage in any 
charitable activity, certain limitations were imposed on non-Ethiopian charities. The restricted 
charitable activities, listed in the Proclamation, related to political activities, which the 
government believed should not be left to foreigners and foreign funds. The Government added 
that the State was at the early stages of democratization and that this process should have its

<p>roots in the country and its people before it is exposed to the undue influence of foreigners. 
Other activities that did not affect the political system of the country and traditional charitable 
activities were identified and allowed in the Proclamation. 
</p>
<p>104. The Government said that one of the motives for the issuance of the legislation was to 
ensure accountability and transparency. The Agency entrusted with the implementation of the 
Proclamation, has registered and recognized charities and societies, and ensured observance of 
the law by these. In addition to supervision through inquiries and investigation of reports, the 
Agency may suspend or cancel the permits of civil society organizations that do not abide by the 
law. However, the government disagreed with the statement that the Agency had intrusive 
powers and that its powers were &#8220;broad and vaguely defined&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>105. The Government stated that the &#8220;fine&#8221; was the only penalty the Proclamation had 
introduced and that the amount varied according to the gravity of the offence and the ability to 
pay. As to the other forms of punishment, the Proclamation referred to the Criminal Code which 
applies to all without any distinction, including charities and societies and officers associated 
with them. 
</p>
<p>106. The Government specified that the Proclamation had been issued by the House of People&#8217;s 
Representatives (HPR) and that, according to the Constitution, the HPR must abide by the 
Constitution. It further stated that the Proclamation on Charities and Societies did not profess to 
regulate freedom of expression and assembly. 
</p>
<p>107. The Government also recognized that Ethiopian law does not allow political associations 
by foreigners but that this prohibition is related to the preservation of the sovereignty of the 
country. 
</p>
<p>108. Finally the Government also commented on the consultative process that led to the 
adoption of the Proclamation by Parliament and some of the amendments that were introduced in 
the final draft based on recommendations by civil society members.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>109. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Ethiopia for its response to 
her communication dated 21 January 2009. She regrets nevertheless, that the Government did not 
reply to her communication of 5 March 2008 and would be particularly interested to know 
whether this case has resulted in any prosecutions of alleged perpetrators and whether the victim 
has been granted reparation. She considers response to her communications as an important part 
of the cooperation of Governments with her mandate, and urges the Government to respond to 
the concerns raised.<b> </b></p>

communication au Gouvernement exer&#231;ant la Pr&#233;sidence du Conseil de l&#8217;Union europ&#233;enne au 
sujet de la Directive 2008/.../EC du Parlement europ&#233;en et du Conseil sur les normes et 
proc&#233;dures communes applicables dans les Etats membres au retour des ressortissants de pays 
tiers en s&#233;jour irr&#233;gulier (COM (2005) 0391 - C6-0266/2005 - 2005/0167 (COD) (la &#171; Directive 
de retour &#187;). Cette directive fut adopt&#233;e par le Parlement europ&#233;en le 18 juin 2008. 
</p><p>111. Il fut mentionn&#233; que la Directive de retour pouvait &#234;tre consid&#233;r&#233;e comme un effort visant 
&#224; mettre en place des normes communes en mati&#232;re de retour de ressortissants de pays tiers en 
s&#233;jour irr&#233;gulier; et &#224; renforcer les m&#233;canismes de protection dans certains Etats membres de 
l&#8217;Union. Le texte et le pr&#233;ambule de la Directive font r&#233;f&#233;rence aux normes et standards 
internationaux et europ&#233;ens des Droits de l&#8217;Homme ainsi que l&#8217;obligation de fournir une 
assistance l&#233;gale aux ressortissants d&#8217;un pays tiers en situation irr&#233;guli&#232;re envisag&#233;e dans 
l&#8217;article 13. N&#233;anmoins, les Experts des Droits de l&#8217;Homme ont relev&#233; plusieurs sujets de 
pr&#233;occupation concernant la Directive. 
</p>
<p>112. Un des principaux sujets de pr&#233;occupation est li&#233; au r&#233;gime de d&#233;tention pendant la 
proc&#233;dure de retour ou d&#8217;&#233;loignement des ressortissants des pays tiers en situation irr&#233;guli&#232;re, y 
compris des mineurs non-accompagn&#233;s et d&#8217;autres personnes vuln&#233;rables, comme pr&#233;vu dans les 
articles 15 et 17 de la Directive. 
</p>
<p>113. L&#8217;article 15 de la Directive de retour &#233;tablit qu&#8217;en r&#232;gle g&#233;n&#233;rale, la p&#233;riode de d&#233;tention 
ne devrait pas exc&#233;der six mois, pourvu que des mesures suffisantes mais moins coercitives ne 
puissent &#234;tre appliqu&#233;es effectivement et qu&#8217;il existe un risque de fuite ou que le ressortissant 
d&#8217;un pays tiers &#233;vite ou emp&#234;che la pr&#233;paration du proc&#232;s de retour ou d&#8217;&#233;loignement. Toutefois, 
dans les cas particuliers, cette p&#233;riode peut &#234;tre prolong&#233;e par les Etats membres jusqu&#8217;&#224; un 
maximum de 12 mois additionnels. L&#8217;article 17 de la Directive permet aux Etats membres la 
d&#233;tention de mineurs non-accompagn&#233;s se trouvant en situation particuli&#232;rement vuln&#233;rable. 
</p>
<p><i>Proportionnalit&#233; de la d&#233;tention (article 15) 
</i></p>
<p>114. Il fut mentionn&#233; que les migrants en situation irr&#233;guli&#232;re ne sont pas des d&#233;linquants. En 
r&#232;gle g&#233;n&#233;rale, les migrants ne devraient pas &#234;tre sujets &#224; la d&#233;tention. Les Etats membres 
doivent recourir &#224; la d&#233;tention uniquement en dernier recours, conform&#233;ment &#224; l&#8217;application 
stricte du principe de proportionnalit&#233;. Le consid&#233;rant 16 et l&#8217;article 15, paragraphe 1, de la 
Directive tiens compte de ce principe. Cependant, l&#8217;obligation des Etats membres de consid&#233;rer 
l&#8217;application de mesures moins coercitives devrait &#234;tre express&#233;ment &#233;tablie, ainsi que 
l&#8217;obligation de r&#233;aliser une &#233;valuation exhaustive de la possibilit&#233; d&#8217;appliquer ces mesures. 
Aussi, l&#8217;article 15, paragraphe 1, ne fournit pas une liste exhaustive de motifs concrets de 
d&#233;tention. De ce fait, il est &#224; craindre que les Etats membres aient recours &#224; la d&#233;tention de 
mani&#232;re excessive et consid&#232;rent celle-ci comme une r&#232;gle et non pas une exception. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>115. De plus, les Etats membres ont l&#8217;obligation d&#8217;assurer que les personnes victimes de trafic 
ne soient pas poursuivies pour la violation de lois d&#8217;immigration ou pour des activit&#233;s r&#233;alis&#233;es 
en cons&#233;quence directe de leur situation de victime de trafic. Ces personnes ne doivent pas &#234;tre 
plac&#233;es dans des centres de d&#233;tention de migrants ou maintenues sous quelque autre forme de 
privation de libert&#233;. Nous sugg&#233;rons que la Directive de retour soit r&#233;vis&#233;e afin d&#8217;y inclure cette 
garantie, ainsi que tout autre dispositions relatives &#224; la protection des personnes victimes de 
trafic, conform&#233;ment aux Principes et Directives concernant les Droits de l&#8217;Homme et la traite 
des &#234;tres humains (E/2002/68/Add.1) &#233;labor&#233;e par l&#8217;Office du Haut-commissariat des 
Nations Unies aux Droits de l&#8217;Homme. 
</p>
<p><i>P&#233;riode maximum de d&#233;tention (Article 15) 
</i></p>
<p>116. Les Experts ont aussi signal&#233; que la dur&#233;e de 18 mois de p&#233;riode maximale de d&#233;tention 
leur paraissait excessive. En particulier lorsque les obstacles &#224; la pr&#233;paration du retour ou &#224; 
l&#8217;&#233;loignement ne sont pas imputables &#224; la sph&#232;re de responsabilit&#233; du migrant, par exemple 
lorsqu&#8217;il est difficile d&#8217;obtenir la documentation n&#233;cessaire du pays d&#8217;origine ou du pays de 
destination. La proposition originale de la Commission europ&#233;enne &#233;tablissait une p&#233;riode 
maximale de d&#233;tention de six mois (COM/2005/391 final, article 14, paragraphe 4). 
</p>
<p><i>D&#233;tention et retour de mineurs non-accompagn&#233;s (Articles 10, 14 et 17) 
</i></p>
<p>117. Les Experts ont aussi demand&#233; si les Etats membres pouvaient indiquer dans quelles 
circonstances la d&#233;tention des mineurs non-accompagn&#233;s pouvait &#234;tre justifiable. L&#8217;article 17, 
paragraphe 1, de la Directive de Retour transcrit simplement les termes de l&#8217;article 37, lit. (b) 
clause 2 de la Convention des Droits de l&#8217;Enfant. A notre avis, la Directive n&#8217;&#233;tablit pas de 
garanties l&#233;gales et de proc&#233;dures suffisantes concernant les mineurs non-accompagn&#233;s. Ils ont 
aussi demand&#233; de recevoir des informations sur les conditions n&#233;cessaires pour que la structure 
d&#8217;accueil pour mineurs non-accompagn&#233;s dans l&#8217;Etat de retour soit consid&#233;r&#233;e comme 
&#171; ad&#233;quat &#187; (article 10, paragraphe 2). 
</p>
<p>118. Des pr&#233;occupations concernant l&#8217;abaissement des normes relatives au droit &#224; l&#8217;&#233;ducation, 
particuli&#232;rement les opportunit&#233;s &#233;ducatives pour les mineurs, ont aussi &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es. La 
proposition originale de la Commission europ&#233;enne inclue dans l&#8217;article 6, paragraphe 4, interdit 
aux Etats membres d&#8217;expulser des mineurs sans consid&#233;rer leur droit &#224; l&#8217;&#233;ducation. Le texte 
actuel requi&#232;re simplement aux Etats membres de prendre en consid&#233;ration dans la mesure du 
possible l&#8217;acc&#232;s des mineurs au syst&#232;me d&#8217;&#233;ducation basique d&#233;pendant de l&#8217;autorisation de 
s&#233;jour (article 14, paragraphe 1). Une disposition similaire est contenue dans l&#8217;article 17, 
paragraphe 3, qui &#233;tablit que les mineurs en d&#233;tention auront acc&#232;s &#224; l&#8217;&#233;ducation d&#233;pendant 
uniquement de la dur&#233;e de leur s&#233;jour. 
<i>R&#233;vision judiciaire de la l&#233;galit&#233; de la d&#233;tention administrative (Article 15) 
</i>119. Les experts ont souhait&#233; voir les garanties l&#233;gales relative &#224; la r&#233;vision judiciaire de la 
l&#233;galit&#233; de la d&#233;tention administrative incluse dans l&#8217;article 15 de la Directive d&#233;velopp&#233;es 
davantage afin d&#8217;obliger les Etats membres &#224; d&#233;finir la limite des d&#233;lais plut&#244;t que d&#8217;indiquer 
que ces r&#233;examen doivent &#234;tre &#171; acc&#233;l&#233;r&#233;s &#187; et &#224; &#171; intervalles raisonnables &#187;. </p>

</p>
<p><i>Situations d&#8217;urgence (article 18) 
</i></p>
<p>120. De plus, ind&#233;pendamment du fait que les Etats membres puissent invoquer l&#8217;existence de 
situations d&#8217;urgence permettant la d&#233;rogation des limites maximales pour la r&#233;vision judiciaire, 
d&#233;j&#224; assez impr&#233;cises, et adopter des mesures d&#8217;urgence conform&#233;ment &#224; l&#8217;article 18 de la 
Directive, les circonstances peuvent &#234;tre au-del&#224; du contexte du ressortissant d&#8217;un pays tiers 
passible de retour. Il fut rappel&#233; aux Etats membres que le recours &#224; la r&#233;vision judiciaire sans 
d&#233;lai de la l&#233;galit&#233; de la d&#233;tention n&#8217;est pas un privil&#232;ge mais un droit fondamental. C&#8217;est un 
droit qui ne peut &#234;tre d&#233;rog&#233; sauf en cas de danger public exceptionnel conform&#233;ment &#224; 
l&#8217;article 4, paragraphe 1, du Pacte international de Droits civils et politiques (voir l&#8217;observation 
g&#233;n&#233;rale n. 29 du Comit&#233; des droits de l&#8217;homme, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.11). De m&#234;me, 
l&#8217;article 13, paragraphe 2, de la Directive de retour n&#8217;&#233;tablit pas un effet suspensif aux recours 
d&#8217;appel contre les d&#233;cisions de retour ou d&#8217;&#233;loignement ni contre les d&#233;cisions d&#8217;interdiction 
d&#8217;entrer, donnant lieu &#224; une pr&#233;occupation qui g&#233;n&#233;ralise le &#171; fait accompli &#187;. 
</p>
<p><i>Interdiction d&#8217;entr&#233;e (article 11) 
</i></p>
<p>121. La possibilit&#233; que la d&#233;cision de retour ou d&#8217;&#233;loignement comporte une interdiction 
d&#8217;entr&#233;e d&#8217;une dur&#233;e de cinq ans au maximum, telle qu&#8217;&#233;tablie par l&#8217;article 11 de la Directive de 
retour, pourrait violer le principe de non-refoulement, consid&#233;rant que la situation dans un pays 
donn&#233; peut se d&#233;t&#233;riorer dramatiquement pendant cette p&#233;riode. Afin d&#8217;assurer que le principe de 
non-refoulement soit pleinement respect&#233; conform&#233;ment &#224; l&#8217;article 4, paragraphe 4, il fut 
demand&#233; que la Directive soit plus pr&#233;cise sur les crit&#232;res sp&#233;cifiques &#224; prendre en compte lors 
de sa mise en &#339;uvre (voir article 5 lit. (c)). 
</p>
<p>122. L&#8217;introduction de cette interdiction d&#8217;entr&#233;e pourrait cr&#233;er des conditions dans lesquelles 
des migrants chercheraient &#224; revenir irr&#233;guli&#232;rement dans l&#8217;Union europ&#233;enne, en augmentant le 
risque de trafic. En cons&#233;quence, la Directive pourrait accro&#238;tre la vuln&#233;rabilit&#233; des migrants &#224; 
devenir des victimes de trafics. La garantie &#233;tablit dans la Directive que les victimes de trafic 
ayant obtenu un permis de r&#233;sidence &#171; ne feront pas l&#8217;objet d&#8217;une interdiction d&#8217;entr&#233;e &#187; para&#238;t 
insuffisante. La prompte et ad&#233;quate identification des victimes de trafic est un probl&#232;me 
r&#233;pandu dans plusieurs pays laissant par cons&#233;quent, un groupe substantiel de victimes mal 
identifi&#233;es sans droits de protection et d&#8217;assistance. 
</p>
<p><i>Groupes vuln&#233;rables (article 14) 
</i></p>
<p>123. Les experts ont not&#233; avec satisfaction que l&#8217;article 14 de la Directive comprend une clause 
reconnaissant la n&#233;cessit&#233; de prendre en compte les besoins particuliers des personnes 
vuln&#233;rables et que ces besoins sp&#233;ciaux seront pris en consid&#233;ration, ainsi que l&#8217;article 3 lit. (i) 
de la Directive contienne une d&#233;finition du terme &#171; personnes vuln&#233;rables &#187;. N&#233;anmoins, il fut 
mentionn&#233; l&#8217;importance de la protection et des garanties sp&#233;cifiques pour ces groupes 
vuln&#233;rables. Il fut &#233;galement mentionn&#233; l&#8217;importance que les victimes de s&#233;v&#232;res formes de 
violence psychologique, physique et sexuelle, incluant les victimes de violation sexuelle, soient 
trait&#233;es avec une sensibilit&#233; particuli&#232;re pendant la d&#233;termination de leur cas et la p&#233;riode de 
retour volontaire ou involontaire. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>124. Malgr&#233; que la majorit&#233; des ressortissants des pays tiers affect&#233;s par la Directive n&#8217;aient pas 
demand&#233; l&#8217;asile politique ou le refuge dans des pays de l&#8217;Union europ&#233;enne, les normes 
existantes relatives &#224; la d&#233;termination des cas d&#8217;asile peuvent &#234;tre utiles, par analogie, pour 
l&#8217;application de la Directive de retour et en particulier de son article 14. les experts ont sugg&#233;r&#233; 
qu&#8217;au moment de d&#233;cider le retour ou l&#8217;&#233;loignement d&#8217;un ressortissant d&#8217;un pays tiers, que les 
Etats membres prennent en consid&#233;ration que la violation ou autre forme de violence sexuelle 
(ainsi qu&#8217;en cas de trafics ou de violence domestique) pour des motifs de race, religion, 
nationalit&#233;, opinion politique ou d&#8217;appartenance &#224; un groupe social particulier, soit consid&#233;r&#233;e 
comme pers&#233;cution sous la d&#233;finition de &#171; r&#233;fugi&#233; &#187; contenus dans la Convention relative au 
statut des r&#233;fugi&#233;s de 1951. 
</p>
<p>125. La Directive devrait &#234;tre r&#233;vis&#233;e afin d&#8217;y inclure des garanties sp&#233;cifiques pour les 
victimes de violations des droits de l&#8217;homme, y compris hommes, femmes et enfants ayant fait 
l&#8217;objet de trafiqu&#233;s pour leur exploitation sexuelle ou de travail. La Directive devrait garantir 
l&#8217;acc&#232;s aux recours pour les victimes de trafic, avant qu&#8217;une d&#233;cision sur leur expulsion soit 
prise. La prompte identification des victimes de trafic est essentielle ; les Etats membres 
doivent d&#233;velopper des proc&#233;dures et directives pour les autorit&#233;s pertinentes charg&#233;es de 
d&#233;tecter des migrants irr&#233;guliers et permettant l&#8217;identification prompte et fiable des victimes 
de trafic. 
</p>
<p>126. Les experts ont indiqu&#233; que la Directive ne refl&#232;te pas de mani&#232;re ad&#233;quate certaines 
dispositions et garanties pour les victimes de trafic contenues dans la Convention du Conseil 
de l&#8217;Europe sur la lutte contre la traite des &#234;tres humains entr&#233;e en vigueur en f&#233;vrier 2008. 
La Directive devrait &#233;galement refl&#233;ter et conformer aux Principes et Directives concernant 
les Droits de l&#8217;Homme et la traite des &#234;tres humains &#233;labor&#233;e en 2002 par l&#8217;Office du 
Haut-commissariat des Nations Unies aux Droits de l&#8217;Homme. 
</p>
<p>127. Les experts ont finalement demand&#233; aux Etats membres &#224; travers le Gouvernement 
exer&#231;ant la Pr&#233;sidence du Conseil de l&#8217;Union europ&#233;enne la r&#233;vision de la Directive de retour. En 
suivant l&#8217;accord du Parlement europ&#233;en du 5 juin et avant l&#8217;adoption de l&#8217;accord du Conseil de 
l&#8217;Union europ&#233;enne pr&#233;vu pour les 24 et 25 juillet 2008, ils ont consid&#233;r&#233; qu&#8217;il est de la plus 
haute importance que cette Directive soient en conformit&#233; avec toutes les normes et les standards 
internationaux des Droits de l&#8217;Homme applicables et prenne pleinement en consid&#233;ration les 
obligations des Etats en tant que pays receveur, transit et origine des migrants.  
</p>
<p><b>R&#233;ponse re&#231;ue 
</b></p>
<p>128. Le 4 septembre 2008, le Gouvernement exer&#231;ant la pr&#233;sidence de l&#8217;Union europ&#233;enne 
envoya une r&#233;ponse &#224; la communication envoy&#233;e conjointement le 16 juillet 2008 concernant le 
texte de la directive &#171; relative aux normes et proc&#233;dures communes applicables dans les Etats 
membres au retour des ressortissants de pays tiers en s&#233;jour irr&#233;gulier &#187;. 
</p><p>129. En qualit&#233; de repr&#233;sentant de la pr&#233;sidence en exercice, il fut mentionn&#233; les &#233;l&#233;ments de 
r&#233;ponse suivants : </p>

 page 25 
 
</p>
<p><b>L&#8217;Union europ&#233;enne est une communaut&#233; fond&#233;e sur le droit

<p>130. Des r&#232;gles de droit fixent ainsi les conditions d&#8217;entr&#233;e, de s&#233;jour et de r&#233;sidence des 
ressortissants de pays tiers dans les pays de l&#8217;Union. L&#8217;efficacit&#233; de la politique d&#8217;admission 
suppose &#233;galement la mise en &#339;uvre d&#8217;une politique d&#8217;&#233;loignement &#224; l&#8217;encontre des personnes 
qui ne respecteraient pas ou plus les r&#233;glementations relatives &#224; l&#8217;entr&#233;e ou au s&#233;jour. Nul ne 
conteste &#224; cet &#233;gard aux Etats la facult&#233; de mettre en &#339;uvre une politique d&#8217;&#233;loignement.

<p>131. Le Conseil europ&#233;en a invit&#233; &#224; d&#233;finir des normes communes pour la mise en &#339;uvre de leur 
politique d&#8217;&#233;loignement par les Etats membres. Tel est pr&#233;cis&#233;ment l&#8217;objet de la directive &#171; 
relative aux normes et proc&#233;dures communes applicables dans les Etats membres au retour des 
ressortissants de pays tiers en s&#233;jour irr&#233;gulier &#187;. Ce texte a fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;un accord politique au 
Conseil (JAIS des 5-6 juin 2008, avant d&#8217;&#234;tre adopt&#233; en premi&#232;re lecture par le Parlement 
europ&#233;en le 18 juin dernier, mettant ainsi un terme &#224; une n&#233;gociation engag&#233;e en 
septembre 2005. 
</p>
<p>132. L&#8217;adoption de ce texte constitue en soi une avanc&#233;e significative. Comme le relevait en 
effet la Commission dans les documents pr&#233;sent&#233;s en appui de sa Proposition Initiale, la situation 
qui pr&#233;vaut, dans l&#8217;attente de la transposition de la directive, se caract&#233;rise par une tr&#232;s grande 
diversit&#233; des r&#233;gimes applicables, qu&#8217;il s&#8217;agisse de la d&#233;finition m&#234;me des notions en cause ou 
des r&#232;gles et proc&#233;dures mises en &#339;uvre. La directive vise ainsi &#224; harmoniser et &#224; rendre 
obligatoires des r&#232;gles communes pour tous les Etats membres, y compris en mati&#232;re de 
garanties proc&#233;durales et juridiques. Le respect de ces normes pourra le cas &#233;ch&#233;ant &#234;tre contr&#244;l&#233; 
par la Commission et par le juge europ&#233;en, conform&#233;ment aux proc&#233;dures pertinentes pr&#233;vues 
par le trait&#233; CE. 
</p>
<p>133. Naturellement, la directive ne fait pas obstacle &#224; l&#8217;adoption ou &#224; l&#8217;application de normes 
plus favorables (article 4 paragraphe 3). Cette directive est &#233;galement sans pr&#233;judice aux r&#232;gles 
applicables en mati&#232;re d&#8217;asile. 
</p>
<p>134. La directive pr&#233;cise explicitement que les r&#232;gles qu&#8217;elle contient doivent &#234;tre mises en 
&#339;uvre dans le respect des droits de l&#8217;homme et des libert&#233;s fondamentales des personnes 
concern&#233;es. 
</p>
<p>135. L&#8217;Union europ&#233;enne s&#8217;est toujours fortement engag&#233;e en faveur des droits de l&#8217;Homme, 
qu&#8217;elle d&#233;fend et promeut, en son sein et partout dans le monde. En accord avec les valeurs et les 
principes fondamentaux qui sont les siens, l&#8217;Union europ&#233;enne place ainsi au rang de ses 
premi&#232;res pr&#233;occupations la garantie du respect des droits de l&#8217;Homme de tous les immigrants, 
ainsi que la lutte contre le racisme, la x&#233;nophobie, et la traite des &#234;tres humains, tout 
particuli&#232;rement dans le cadre de sa politique migratoire. 
</p>
<p>136. En tout &#233;tat de cause, il appartiendra aux Etats membres d&#8217;appliquer l&#8217;ensemble des 
dispositions de la directive dans le respect de l&#8217;acquis communautaire en mati&#232;re de droits de 
l&#8217;Homme, d&#8217;immigration et d&#8217;asile, et des conventions internationales ratifi&#233;es par les Etats 
membres en la mati&#232;re. 
</p>
<p>137. Il est &#224; noter &#224; cet &#233;gard que plusieurs dispositions dans le texte de la directive s&#8217;inspirent 
des dispositions pertinentes de la Convention Europ&#233;enne des Droits de l&#8217;Homme. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1

</p>
<p>138. La directive &#171; relative aux normes et proc&#233;dures communes applicables dans les Etats 
membres au retour des ressortissants de pays tiers en s&#233;jour irr&#233;gulier &#187; ne constitue que l&#8217;un des 
volets de l&#8217;action de l&#8217;Union en mati&#232;re migratoire. 
</p>
<p>139. Dans le cadre de la mise en &#339;uvre des programmes de Tampere (1999) et de 
La Haye (2004), l&#8217;Union europ&#233;enne a progressivement d&#233;velopp&#233; une politique et des 
instruments communs dans le domaine de l&#8217;immigration et de l&#8217;asile. 
</p>
<p>140. En d&#233;cembre 2005, une &#171; Approche globale des migrations &#187; a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;finie, qui vise, par 
une collaboration accrue entre pays de d&#233;part, de transit et de destination, &#224; promouvoir une 
gestion int&#233;gr&#233;e et &#233;quilibr&#233;e des questions migratoires comprenant des politiques destin&#233;es, en 
coop&#233;ration avec les pays tiers, &#224; tirer parti des avantages de la migration l&#233;gale et &#224; lutter contre 
l&#8217;immigration ill&#233;gale. Le champ g&#233;ographique de cette approche, initialement orient&#233; vers 
l&#8217;Afrique et &#224; la M&#233;diterran&#233;e, a &#233;t&#233; &#233;tendu &#224; l&#8217;Europe orientale et du sud-est par le Conseil 
europ&#233;en de juin 2007. 
</p><p>141. L&#8217;Union europ&#233;enne s&#8217;applique aujourd&#8217;hui &#224; mettre en &#339;uvre les instruments n&#233;cessaires 
&#224; la r&#233;alisation de cette Approche globale, en coop&#233;ration avec les pays tiers d&#8217;origine et de 
transit, notamment en mati&#232;re d&#8217;organisation de la migration r&#233;guli&#232;re et professionnelle ou de 
migration circulaire. 
</p>
<p>142. De fait, l&#8217;Europe <i>largo sensu </i>s&#8217;av&#232;re aujourd&#8217;hui la premi&#232;re destination des migrants 
internationaux, loin devant l&#8217;Asie et l&#8217;Am&#233;rique du nord. L&#8217;Union europ&#233;enne accueille 
aujourd&#8217;hui quelque 18,5 millions de ressortissants en provenance de pays tiers. 
S&#8217;agissant plus pr&#233;cis&#233;ment des questions soulev&#233;es dans la correspondance : 
</p>
<p>Concernant la proportionnalit&#233; de la r&#233;tention : 
</p>
<p>143. Le texte de la directive ne tend pas &#224; privil&#233;gier la voie de la r&#233;tention, mais bien celle du 
d&#233;part volontaire. 
</p>
<p>144. Le consid&#233;rant (16) rappelle que &#171; le recours &#224; la r&#233;tention aux fins d&#8217;&#233;loignement devrait 
&#234;tre limit&#233; et subordonn&#233; au respect du principe de proportionnalit&#233; en ce qui concerne les 
moyens utilis&#233;s et les objectifs poursuivis. La r&#233;tention n&#8217;est justifi&#233;e que pour pr&#233;parer le retour 
ou proc&#233;der &#224; l&#8217;&#233;loignement et si l&#8217;application de mesures moins coercitives ne suffirait pas &#187;. 
</p>
<p>145. Pr&#233;cis&#233;ment, l&#8217;article 15 pr&#233;voit que la r&#233;tention d&#8217;un ressortissant de pays tiers en s&#233;jour 
irr&#233;gulier est appliqu&#233;e &#224; la seule fin de pr&#233;parer le retour et/ou de proc&#233;der &#224; l&#8217;&#233;loignement, en 
particulier lorsque ce migrant pr&#233;sente un risque de fuite ou lorsqu&#8217;il fait obstacle &#224; la proc&#233;dure 
de retour ou d&#8217;&#233;loignement. 
</p>
<p>146. Dans tous les cas, les Etats membres ont l&#8217;obligation d&#8217;envisager en priorit&#233; l&#8217;application 
de solutions moins coercitives, conform&#233;ment &#224; l&#8217;article 15 paragraphe 1. Cette disposition vise 
pr&#233;cis&#233;ment &#224; inciter au retour volontaire des ressortissants en s&#233;jour irr&#233;gulier. Le consid&#233;rant 
(10) rappelle aussi que &#171; lorsqu&#8217;il n&#8217;a pas lieu de craindre que l&#8217;effet utile d&#8217;une d&#233;cision de 
retour s&#8217;en trouve compromis, il convient de privil&#233;gier le retour volontaire par rapport au retour 
forc&#233; et d&#8217;accorder &#224; cet effet un d&#233;lai de d&#233;part &#187;. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 27 
 
</p>
<p>147. De fa&#231;on g&#233;n&#233;rale, il convient de noter que le consid&#233;rant (6) rappelle que &#171; les d&#233;cisions 
prises en vertu de la pr&#233;sente directive devraient l&#8217;&#234;tre au cas par cas, en tenant compte de 
crit&#232;res objectifs, ce qui implique que l&#8217;on prenne en consid&#233;ration d&#8217;autres facteurs que le 
simple fait d&#8217;&#234;tre en s&#233;jour irr&#233;gulier &#187;. En particulier, le texte de la directive inclut des 
dispositions sp&#233;cifiques concernant les personnes vuln&#233;rables au sens de son article 3 (i), 
conform&#233;ment &#224; l&#8217;article 14 paragraphe 1. 
</p>
<p><b>Concernant la p&#233;riode maximum de r&#233;tention : 
</b></p>
<p>148. Il importe de rappeler que, conform&#233;ment &#224; l&#8217;article 15 paragraphe 5, la dur&#233;e maximale de 
r&#233;tention est fix&#233;e &#224; six mois. Si le texte de la directive ouvre la facult&#233; d&#8217;&#233;tendre cette dur&#233;e de 
r&#233;tention, cette extension constitue une exception, limit&#233;e &#224; douze mois suppl&#233;mentaires et 
strictement conditionn&#233;e, conform&#233;ment aux dispositions du paragraphe 6. 
</p>
<p>149. Ces dispositions doivent &#234;tre appr&#233;ci&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;aune des r&#233;gimes actuellement appliqu&#233;s &#224; titre 
national par les Etats membres (et aussi par des pays hors de l&#8217;Union europ&#233;enne). Aujourd&#8217;hui, 
dans plusieurs d&#8217;entre eux, la dur&#233;e de r&#233;tention s&#8217;av&#232;re en effet sup&#233;rieure &#224; six mois ou peut 
m&#234;me &#234;tre illimit&#233;e. 
</p>
<p>150. Le texte de la directive introduit ainsi une innovation significative. En la mati&#232;re, le texte 
de la directive permet &#233;galement le maintien d&#8217;un dispositif plus favorable dans les Etats 
membres qui appliqueraient aujourd&#8217;hui une dur&#233;e de r&#233;tention plus courte. 
Concernant la r&#233;tention et le retour de mineurs non-accompagn&#233;s : 
</p>
<p>151. De fa&#231;on g&#233;n&#233;rale, il importe de rappeler que le texte de la directive ne cr&#233;e aucune 
obligation en mati&#232;re de r&#233;tention et d&#8217;&#233;loignement des mineurs. En revanche, il impose aux 
Etats membres qui en d&#233;cideraient de respecter un ensemble de normes minimales en la mati&#232;re. 
</p>
<p>152. Le consid&#233;rant (22) rappelle que &#171; conform&#233;ment &#224; la Convention des Nations Unies 
relatives aux droits de l&#8217;enfant (1989), &#8221;l&#8217;int&#233;r&#234;t sup&#233;rieur de l&#8217;enfant&#8221; devrait constituer une 
consid&#233;ration primordiale pour les &#201;tats membres lorsqu&#8217;ils transposent les dispositions de la 
pr&#233;sente directive &#187;. L&#8217;article 5 fait pr&#233;cis&#233;ment obligation aux Etats membres, lorsqu&#8217;ils 
transposent la directive, de tenir d&#251;ment compte de l&#8217;int&#233;r&#234;t sup&#233;rieur de l&#8217;enfant (ainsi d&#8217;ailleurs 
que de la vie familiale). 
</p>
<p>153. Ce principe d&#8217;application g&#233;n&#233;rale trouve plusieurs d&#233;clinaisons dans le corps de la 
directive, notamment au titre de l&#8217;article 10 et plus g&#233;n&#233;ralement des garanties proc&#233;durales 
vis&#233;es notamment aux articles 14 (acc&#232;s des mineurs au syst&#232;me &#233;ducatif de base) et 17 
(conditions de r&#233;tention des mineurs). 
</p>
<p>154. Ces dispositions s&#8217;appliquent sans pr&#233;judice des dispositions plus favorables pr&#233;vues dans 
les droits nationaux ou dans des accords bilat&#233;raux ou multilat&#233;raux, telle la convention des 
Nations Unies relative aux droits de l&#8217;enfant, d&#233;j&#224; mentionn&#233;e. 
Concernant la r&#233;vision judiciaire de la l&#233;galit&#233; de la r&#233;tention administrative : 
</p><p>155. Il convient de noter que le texte de la directive introduit des dispositions importantes 
concernant les garanties proc&#233;durales, s&#8217;agissant en particulier de l&#8217;assistance judiciaire. Le texte </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p>de la directive suit en la mati&#232;re les dispositions pertinentes de la CEDH ainsi le principe 
directeur n&#176; 8 des vingt principes directeurs sur le retour forc&#233; adopt&#233;s par le Conseil des 
Ministres du Conseil de l&#8217;Europe le 4 mai 2005. 
</p>
<p>Concernant les situations d&#8217;urgence : 
</p>
<p>156. Les d&#233;rogations pr&#233;vues pour les d&#233;lais de contr&#244;le juridictionnel et les conditions de 
r&#233;tention sont limit&#233;es aux situations d&#8217;urgence, lorsqu&#8217;une charge lourde et impr&#233;vue p&#232;se sur la 
capacit&#233; des centres de r&#233;tention d&#8217;un Etat membre. Dans le cas o&#249; un Etat membre d&#233;cide de 
recourir &#224; ces mesures exceptionnelles, il a l&#8217;obligation d&#8217;informer la Commission de sa d&#233;cision 
et de la fin de ces mesures d&#233;rogatoires, d&#232;s que les natifs justifiant leur application ont disparu. 
Concernant l&#8217;interdiction d&#8217;entr&#233;e : 
</p>
<p>157. Il convient de rappeler que, conform&#233;ment &#224; l&#8217;article 11 paragraphe 1, une interdiction 
d&#8217;entr&#233;e n&#8217;est de droit que dans deux cas particuliers: si aucun d&#233;lai n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; accord&#233; pour le 
d&#233;part volontaire (notamment dans les cas vis&#233;s &#224; l&#8217;article 7 paragraphe 4) ou si l&#8217;obligation de 
retour n&#8217;a pas &#233;t&#233; respect&#233;e. La possibilit&#233; d&#8217;assortir une d&#233;cision de retour d&#8217;une interdiction 
d&#8217;entr&#233;e constitue autrement une simple facult&#233;. En tout &#233;tat de cause, la dur&#233;e d&#8217;une telle 
interdiction ne peut d&#233;passer cinq ans, sauf cas exceptionnels (menace &#224; l&#8217;ordre du public par 
exemple). Cette dur&#233;e maximale doit &#234;tre appr&#233;ci&#233;e &#224; l&#8217;aune des pratiques aujourd&#8217;hui suivies 
par plusieurs Etats membres (et aussi par des pays hors de l&#8217;Union europ&#233;enne). 
</p>
<p>158. En tout &#233;tat de cause, des d&#233;rogations sont pr&#233;vues par le texte de la directive : les Etats 
membres ne peuvent appliquer l&#8217;interdiction d&#8217;entr&#233;e aux personnes victimes de la traite des 
&#234;tres humains (article 11 paragraphe 3) ; ils peuvent s&#8217;abstenir d&#8217;imposer, lever ou suspendre une 
interdiction d&#8217;entr&#233;e, pour des raisons humanitaires (ibidem) ou, pour certaines cat&#233;gories de cas, 
pour d&#8217;autres raisons (ibidem). 
</p>
<p>159. Les dispositions concernant une &#233;ventuelle interdiction d&#8217;entr&#233;e doivent &#234;tre comprises 
&#233;galement comme une incitation au d&#233;part volontaire. 
</p>
<p>160. De fa&#231;on plus g&#233;n&#233;rale, les d&#233;cisions d&#8217;interdiction d&#8217;entr&#233;e sont assorties de garanties 
proc&#233;durales, conform&#233;ment aux dispositions des articles 12 et 13 (d&#233;cisions rendues par &#233;crit, 
motivation en fait et en droit, informations relatives aux voies de recours disponibles.). 
</p>
<p>161. Au-del&#224;, le texte de la directive m&#233;nage la possibilit&#233; pour les Etats membres de moduler la 
dur&#233;e d&#8217;interdiction d&#8217;entr&#233;e, voire, au cas par cas la possibilit&#233; de lever une telle interdiction 
(article 11 paragraphe 3). 
</p>
<p>Concernant les groupes vuln&#233;rables : 
</p>
<p>162. Le texte de la directive vise &#224; prendre d&#251;ment en compte les besoins particuliers des 
personnes vuln&#233;rables notamment en ce qui concerne les garanties assur&#233;es dans l&#8217;attente 
du retour (article 14), conditions de r&#233;tention et l&#8217;acc&#232;s aux soins m&#233;dicaux (article 16, 
paragraphe 3). A noter que la d&#233;finition des &#171; populations vuln&#233;rables &#187; s&#8217;av&#232;re relativement 
large, aux termes de l&#8217;article 3 (i). </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 29 
 
</p>
<p>163. De fa&#231;on plus g&#233;n&#233;rale, l&#8217;encadrement des mesures concernant ces groupes vuln&#233;rables a 
&#233;t&#233; significativement renforc&#233; &#224; la faveur de la n&#233;gociation du projet de directive.<b> 
Observations 
</b></p>
<p>164. La Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale tient &#224; remercier le Gouvernement de la France exer&#231;ant la 
pr&#233;sidence de l&#8217;Union Europ&#233;enne, pour sa r&#233;ponse d&#233;taill&#233;e aux questions soulev&#233;es dans la 
communication conjointe des experts ind&#233;pendants du Conseil des droits de l&#8217;homme. 
</p><p>165. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of France, in its capacity as 
holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, for the detailed response to the 
allegations raised in the joint communication. 
</p>
<p><b>Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p><b>Llamamiento urgente 
</b></p>
<p>166. El <b>20 de marzo de 2008, </b>la Relatora Especial sobre la violencia contra la mujer, 
con inclusi&#243;n de sus causas y consecuencias, junto con el Representante Especial del 
Secretario-General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, enviaron un 
llamamiento urgente al Gobierno de Guatemala en relaci&#243;n con las amenazas supuestamente 
recibidas por la Sra. A. R. L. C., coordinadora de la Defensor&#237;a de la Mujer en la Procurador&#237;a de 
Derechos Humanos en el departamento de Quich&#233;. 
</p>
<p>167. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, la Sra. A. R. L. C. habr&#237;a jugado un papel destacado en 
el procesamiento de dos agentes de polic&#237;a ante la justicia por la violaci&#243;n de una mujer 
ind&#237;gena, la Sra. L. M., violada bajo custodia policial en 2005. En 2007 se habr&#237;a acusado a 
dichos polic&#237;as por un delito de violaci&#243;n con agravantes y abuso de autoridad. Uno de ellos 
habr&#237;a sido detenido, pero el otro se encontrar&#237;a huido de la justicia. 
</p><p>168. La segunda vista oral del juicio habr&#237;a tenido lugar el pasado 25 de febrero. Esa tarde, la 
Sra. A. R. L. C. habr&#237;a recibido en su tel&#233;fono m&#243;vil una llamada de un hombre que la 
amenazaba. La noche del 2 de marzo, unos desconocidos habr&#237;an escrito con spray &#8220;VC3 M18&#8221;, 
el nombre de una banda callejera, en el muro de la casa de la Sra. A. R. L. C. Dichos 
desconocidos habr&#237;an roto tambi&#233;n luces de la entrada de su casa y las bombillas de las farolas de 
su calle. 
</p>
<p>169. El 6 de marzo, a las 4:24 de la tarde, la Sra. A. R. L. C. habr&#237;a recibido en su tel&#233;fono 
m&#243;vil una llamada de un hombre que habr&#237;a afirmado ser un recluso de una prisi&#243;n de la Ciudad 
de Guatemala y luego habr&#237;a colgado. La Sra. A. R. L. C. nunca habr&#237;a tenido contacto con los 
reclusos de la prisi&#243;n, y el n&#250;mero de su tel&#233;fono m&#243;vil s&#243;lo lo conocer&#237;an sus familiares y 
amistades. 
</p>
<p>170. Se teme que estas amenazas est&#233;n relacionadas con el trabajo de defensa de los 
derechos humanos de la Sra. A.R.L. C, en particular con el caso que est&#225; investigando sobre la 
violaci&#243;n de una mujer ind&#237;gena. Se expresa preocupaci&#243;n por la seguridad e integridad de la 
Sra. A. R. L. C. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1

</p>
<p>171. Estos hechos, de ser confirmados, se enmarcan en el cuadro de gran inseguridad y riesgo 
constatado por la Representante Especial durante su visita a Guatemala en febrero de 2004. En 
su comunicado de prensa, la Representante Especial se&#241;al&#243; que &#8220;son especialmente objeto de 
amenazas las organizaciones que trabajan en cuestiones de justicia y de derecho a la verdad&#8221;. La 
Representante Especial tambi&#233;n reiter&#243; la preocupaci&#243;n por el nivel de impunidad ante los 
ataques y violaciones contra defensores de derechos humanos constatado durante la visita. 
</p>
<p><b>Respuesta del Gobierno 
</b></p>
<p>172. Mediante cartas fechadas el 17 de abril de 2008 y el 1 de julio de 2008, la Comisi&#243;n 
Presidencial Coordinadora de la Pol&#237;tica del Ejecutivo en Materia de Derechos Humanos 
(COPREDEH) y el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores respectivamente respondieron al 
llamamiento urgente por parte del Gobierno de Guatemala. La carta de la COPREDEH 
comunic&#243; que los hechos de intimidaci&#243;n contra la se&#241;ora A. R. L. C. fueron denunciados

<p><b>India 
</b></p>
<p><b>Response from the Government to an allegation letter sent in 2007 
</b></p>
<p>185. On <b>14 August 2007</b>, Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an allegation 
letter to the Government concerning Ms. A. B., aged 19, daughter of S. H., residing at 
Lakshmipur, Rajpara, Rajsahi district, Bangladesh. 
186. According to the information received, on 7 June 2007, at 18.45, Ms. A. B. was taken 
into custody together with Ms. C. K. by Indian Border Security Force (BSF) officers stationed 
at I &amp; II Outposts at Kargil village, Murshidabad district of West Bengali State, while they were 
trying to cross the border from Bangladesh to India. 
</p>
<p>187. Some hours after being taken into custody, Ms. A. B. was raped by a BSF officer. The 
incident was witnessed by a superior officer of the intelligence branch at the BSF, who was 
visiting the outpost that day. The superior officer advised Ms. A. B. to visit a doctor and to lodge 
a complaint at the Raninagar Police Station. However, when she attempted to do so, the 
responsible officers refused to register her case and to have a medical examination conducted. 
Thereafter she was returned to the BSF camp. 
</p>
<p>188. The next day, when Ms. A. B. was taken to Raninagar Police Station, the Senior Divisional 
Police Officer from Domkal, Mr. M. B. H., ordered that she be sent to the Beharampur District 
Hospital for a medical examination. However, according to reports, the BSF put pressure on the 
medical officer who examined Ms. A. B., Dr. S. B. K., so that the latter declared that she was not 
raped. No forensic laboratory examination was conducted. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 33 
 
</p>
<p>189. On 9 June 2007, Ms. A. B. and Ms. C. K. had to appear before the Additional Chief 
Judicial Magistrate in Lalbagh for the hearing of the case against them under the relevant 
provisions of the Foreigners Act of 1946. The Court issued an order to detain Ms. A. B. and 
Ms. C. K. in judicial custody. 
</p><p>190. On 21 June 2007, Ms. A. B.&#8217;s court case commenced. During these proceedings, her 
lawyer informed the Court that she was raped while in detention. 
</p>
<p>191. Concern was expressed that the authorities have failed to exercise due diligence to prevent, 
investigate and punish the violence against Ms. A. B. and to provide her with the required 
support and attention, including counselling. 
</p>
<p>192. By letter dated <b>21 July 2008, the Government replied to the letter sent 
on 14 August 2007</b>. It concluded that the allegation levelled against the BSF Ambush party 
appeared to be fabricated and that the medical examinations from different hospitals attested to 
that fact.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>193. Regarding the details of the case, the Government stated that on June 7, 2007 two women 
of Bangladeshi nationality, namely Ms. C. K and Ms. A. B., were apprehended by a patrolling 
party of the BSF (Indian Border Security Force). They were brought to the outpost and a 
preliminary questioning was conducted in the presence of a lady member of the Panchayat (local 
government), namely Ms. R. B. They were then taken to the Government hospital, Raninagar 
where the Medical<b> </b>Officer carried out a medical examination and certified in his medical 
remarks that &#8220;no external injury is seen&#8221;. They were then taken to the Police station of Raninagar 
to be kept in the women prison cell as there was no such facility available at the BSF outpost. 
</p>
<p>194. The Government added that the next morning, Ms. A. B. complained of sexual harassment 
by BSF patrolling party, upon which they were immediately taken to the Government hospital, 
Raninagar, where the Medical Officer re-issued a medical certificate saying that no external 
injuries were seen and also referred her to Sadar district hospital, Berharnpore for further 
examination. He also endorsed that he had examined the same lady the evening before, at which 
time she did not complain of sexual assault. The Medical Officer of Sadar district hospital 
carried out an examination and categorically denied the possibility of sexual assault of the lady 
concerned. 
</p>
<p>195. The Government concluded that the medical examinations from different hospitals 
indicated that the allegation levelled against the BSF Ambush party appeared to be false and 
fabricated and that no FIR (First Information Report) was therefore lodged by the police against 
the BSF party. The Government also stated that an<b> </b>FIR regarding the apprehension of 
Bangladeshi nationals was lodged under the Foreigners Act at the Police Station of Raninagar. 
However, on receipt of a notice from the National Human Rights Commission of India about  
allegations levelled by the Asian Human Rights Commission, an NGO, a departmental Staff 
Court of Inquiry on the matter was also ordered by the Headquarters of BSF, Kolkatta, which is 
underway. </p>

complained to her mother about the misbehaviour of the priest. A complaint was filed with the 
local police on 9 December 2005, but the investigation was not done properly, no action was

arrested the group of perpetrators. The mother of the victim was given 50.000Rs compensation 
and was told that the case was closed. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>215. By letter dated <b>29 April 2008</b>,<b> </b>the Government replied to the letter sent 
on 19 December 2007. It stated that the said communication did not include any information on 
the places of occurrence of these cases and requested these specific details to facilitate 
investigations by Indian authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>216. On<b> 29 February 2008</b>,<b> </b>the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the 
right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, sent 
an allegation letter to the Government concerning violence against Dalit women.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>217. According to the information received, Dalit women and men suffer descent based 
discrimination in various aspects of their lives and are also victims of violence and 
untouchability practices arising out of the caste system. Despite the formal abolition of 
&#8220;untouchability&#8221; by article 17 of the Indian Constitution, <i>de facto</i> discrimination and segregation 
of Dalits persists, in particular in rural areas and with regard to access to places of worship, 
housing, hospitals, education, water sources, markets and other public places. 
</p>
<p>218. Dalit women are confronted with discrimination, exclusion and violence to a larger extent 
than men. Land and property issues in particular, tend to cause or be at the root of conflicts over 
which Dalit women have faced eviction, harassment, physical abuse and assault. Dalit women 
are often denied access to or are evicted from their land by dominant castes, especially if it 
borders land belonging to such castes. They are thus forced to live in the outskirts of villages, 
often on barren land. Reportedly, on many occasions, cases of violence against Dalit women are 
not registered, and adequate procedures are not taken by the police.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>219. On 25 August 2005, Mrs. K. K., wife of R. S., and her family bought a plot on Muktasar 
road. They built a house and started to live there. On 28 August 2005, A. S. (Police official), 
D. S. (police official), K. S., D. S. and R. S. abused the victims verbally and used caste names. 
They accused the family of illegally inhabiting the plot. They broke the walls of the house and 
took all the goods from the family. Mrs. K. K. was beaten and hospitalised.<b> </b>The victim tried to 
file a complaint at the police station, but the police reportedly refused to file a complaint or take 
any other action.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>220. Mrs. F. D., wife of H. P., owns a field where she was growing crops. 
On 16 November 2005, F. Y., L. Y., U. D., S. D. and S. Y. beat her and stole her crops.<b> 
</b>On 13 December 2005, Mrs. F. D. filed a complaint with the local police. The accused were 
arrested but were immediately released on bail.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>221. By letter dated <b>29 April 2008</b>, the Government replied to the letter sent 
on 29 February 2008. It stated that the said communication did not include any information on 
the places of occurrence of these cases and requested these specific details so as to facilitate

</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>222. On<b> 5 March 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the 
right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, 
sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning two members of the Dalit caste, namely, 
Ms.<b> </b>S. D.<b> </b>of Baulia village, Shivdaspur, Post Manduvadih, Varanasi, and Ms. R, of Tahirpur 
village, Shahabad, Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>223. According to the information received,<b> </b>on 8 December 2005, approximately 30 persons, 
including 6 police officers in uniform reached Ms. S. D.&#8217;s house, in Baulia village, Shivdaspur, 
Post Manduvadih, Varanasi. The assailants started abusing and assaulting the Dalit women and 
children, and demolishing Ms. S.D.&#8217;s house. The reason seems to have been a land dispute. In 
reaction, the victims, their family members and friends demonstrated and blocked the road at 
Balia Chauraha. They were 100-150 people. The Station Officer (Police station-Manduadih) 
and other police personnel came to the spot, but no action was taken. On 25 December 2005, 
Ms. S. D. tried to lodge a complaint against three of the perpetrators, who were identified as: 
R. G., S. G. and R. G. The police neither registered the complaint nor took any further action. 
The complaint was finally registered on 25 February 2006, only upon the intervention of the 
District Court Varanasi, where Ms. S. D. filed a case. While registering the complaint factual 
details of the case were distorted and the gravity of the incident was allegedly diminished. 
The victim was reportedly threatened in order to have her withdraw her complaint. The 
perpetrators were arrested, and on 20 April 2007 Ms. S. D. was given 6250 Rupees as 
compensation.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>224. On 15 November 2006, five policemen raided Ms. R.&#8217;s house, in Tahirpur village, 
Shahabad, Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh. One of them beat Mr. M., the victim&#8217;s husband. When Ms. R. 
asked for the reason, the policeman immediately hit her in the stomach (she was pregnant at 
that time) and verbally abused her with caste names. The victim sustained many injuries to her 
back, cheeks, stomach and vagina, and lost her child as a result of the beating. Two of the 
perpetrators were reportedly identified as S. S. T. and U., who were both wearing uniforms. 
On 18 November 2006, the incident was reported to the local police station. One of the 
assailants was working there and refused to file a complaint. The assailant tried to persuade 
Ms. R. to withdraw her statement. He threatened to use his powers as a police officer against her. 
A suit was also filed against Ms. R. by the police officer S. S. T., who accused her of 
making wine and to own equipment used to produce alcohol. Ms. R. was sent to jail and brutally 
beaten. </p>

<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>225. By letter dated 30 March 2009<b> </b>the Government replied to the letter sent on 5 March 2008. 
It stated that the allegation was investigated by the Government of India and that the matter was 
<i>sub judice </i>with the Allahabad High Court, where a charge sheet had been filed against the 
accused. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>226. On<b> 5 March 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning Ms. J. S., a Dalit woman 
who was beaten and humiliated upon accusations of being a witch. 
</p>
<p>227. According to the information received, Dalit women and men suffer descent based 
discrimination in various aspects of their lives. Dalit women are confronted with discrimination, 
exclusion and violence to a larger extent than men, especially when they are widows, since they 
are perceived as more vulnerable. They are not only discriminated by people of higher castes but 
also by people of their own communities. 
</p>
<p>228. In this connection, it was allegedly reported that witch-hunting is a form of socially 
approved and religiously sanctioned violence against women, especially common in Andhra 
Pradesh. Based on accusations of being a dayan (witch) or practising <i>banamath</i>i (witchcraft), 
physical violence is employed against Dalit women as a mechanism to take possession of their 
family lands and/or to keep them under economic subjugation, sexual exploitation, gender 
domination and control. 
</p>
<p>229. Ms. J. S., a Dalit widow living in Chinta Kunta, Andhra Pradesh, was accused by M. R., 
the landlord of the village, of being a witch and of causing illness in the village, and was 
subsequently assaulted. 
</p>
<p>230. Reportedly, Ms. J. S. owns two acres of land adjacent to M. R.&#8217;s brother&#8217;s land, which 
Ms. J. S. has to pass through to reach her own land. M. R.&#8217;s brother and his family members used 
to scold Ms. J. S. and her sons for passing through their land. They quarrelled on this issue on 
many occasions and since she was not reportedly obliging M.R.&#8217;s sexual offers, he stated 
publicly that she was practising witchcraft and made the villagers believe she was causing 
sickness in the village. 
</p>
<p>231. On 4 October 2002, most of the village&#8217;s inhabitants belonging to high castes 
(over 30 persons in total) assailed her. While the main assailant was M. R., four other assailants 
were identified, namely, A., A., N. and P. The victim was beaten and humiliated in front of the 
whole village. To prove that she was a witch, her hands were soaked in kerosene and lit on fire. 
</p>
<p>232. On 5 October 2002, the incident was reported to the Darur police station. 13 persons were 
arrested but there were reportedly no convictions as of yet and the main perpetrator, the landlord 
M. R., had not been arrested. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 39 
 
</p>
<p>233. The victim had to go to many hospitals for treatment to her hands. While she was 
undergoing treatment, the landlord M. R. regularly beat the victim and her son and threatened 
them with dire consequences if they did not withdraw the complaint. As Ms. J. S. and her son felt 
they were given no protection from State authorities, they were obliged to withdraw the 
complaint. 
</p>
<p>234. The victim received 50,000 Rupees from the District Ranga Reddy as a reimbursement on 
the basis of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, which 
orders local governments to establish economic and social rehabilitation for victims of atrocities. 
However, it was not specified what costs exactly the money was to cover. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>235. On<b> 20 October 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, sent an urgent appeal concerning Ms. K. C. and 
Ms. P. S., two indigenous women of Paderu who were allegedly gang raped by Gheyhound 
policemen. 
</p>
<p>236. According to information received, on 20 August 2007, 11 indigenous women were 
allegedly gang raped by Gheyhound policemen during anti-Naxalite operations in Vakapalli 
village under Nurmati Panchayat in Visakhapatnam, in the district of Andra Pradesh. 
Reportedly, 21 Greyhound policemen entered the village at around 6 am and raided their houses 
on charges that their family members were associated with the Naxalites. Some of the women 
were raped in their house, others in the fields. On 30 March 2007 the National Human Rights 
Commission took <i>suo moto</i> cognizance of the incident and sent notice to the Senior 
Superintendent of Police, Visakhapatnam district, and the Director General of the Police, A. P., 
calling on them to submit a factual report within four weeks. However, reportedly no action has 
been taken to date by the police to identify and prosecute the rapists. 
</p>
<p>237. On 17 October 2008, two of the 11 victims, Ms. K. C. and Ms. P. S., were to travel to 
Delhi in order to attend a consultation meeting with women&#8217;s non-governmental organizations 
from the Asia-Pacific region. However, on 14 October, the representative of the local NGO that 
was to accompany Ms. K. C and Ms. P. S. was threatened by the Paderu police and was told that 
he would face dire consequences if he extended any support to the two women. As a result of the 
threats, the two women were not able to attend the consultation. 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>238. By letter dated <b>6 April 2009</b>, the Government replied to the letter sent on 20 October 2008. 
It stated that the allegations were investigated by the Government of India and that while a 
complaint was registered on 20 August 2007, the investigation conducted into the alleged 
complaint by a senior police officer at the directive of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh 
revealed the complaints to be false. The conclusions of the investigation were based on medical 
reports which did not support any evidence of rape/sexual intercourse, as well as on the 
considerable variations between the earlier and subsequent versions of the complaint by the 
alleged victims.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>239. On<b> 03 December 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, sent an allegation letter concerning the 
harassment, arrest and detention of five members of the NGO Sangama, an NGO working on 
issues related to the human rights of persons belonging to sexual minorities, especially <i>hijras</i> 
(male-to female transsexuals). 
</p>
<p>240. According to the information received, on 20 October 2008, M. M., D. F., K., S. B. and 
S. S. went to the Girinagar police station as they had received news about five<i> hijras</i> who had 
been arrested and detained, and allegedly beaten by members of the Girinagar police. As they 
tried to inquire about the detention of the <i>hijras,</i> the members of the Sangama crisis intervention 
team were assaulted and detained at the Girinagar police station, and later at the Banashankari 
police station. They were accused of offences punishable under Section 143 <i>(unlawful assembly)</i>, 
145 <i>(joining unlawful assembly ordered to be dispersed)</i>, 147 <i>(rioting)</i>, and 353 <i>(obstructing 
government officials in performing their duty) </i>of the Indian Police Code. They were brought 
before a magistrate and placed in judicial custody later that evening. All five crisis team 
members were subsequently released on bail on 22 October 2008. 
</p>
<p>241. On the evening of the 20 October 2008, approximately 150 human rights activists and 
lawyers gathered in front of the Banashankati police station to peacefully protest against the 
arrest and detention of the Sangama crisis team members and to try and negotiate their release. 
Six delegates among the protesters were detained for about four hours at the police station and 
were subjected to physical and verbal abuse. Reportedly, members of the Banashankati police 
also attacked the peaceful protesters with sticks and subjected them to physical, verbal and 
sexual assault. Thirty-one human rights activists were placed into a small police van, and kept 
there for approximately seven hours. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>242. On<b> 4 February 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment sent an allegation letter to the Government of India in 
relation to the residents of Dharkar. 
</p>
<p>243. According to the information received, on 29 January 2009, more than 50 police officers 
went to Dharkar, located at Hukulganj in Varanasi, and started to beat the residents living there. 
It is believed that women, children and elders were brutally beaten, including R., aged 19, R. and 
V., both aged 35, and L., aged 70. In addition, the police officers, believed to have been 
inebriated, tried to rape the women, and beat a pregnant woman with a <i>lathi.</i> The police officers 
also threatened to place a bomb in the locality if the residents of Dharkar did not leave before 
morning. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 41 
 
</p>
<p>244. Complaints were filed with the District Magistrate in Varanasi and with the Additional 
District Magistrates, requesting them to issue orders for medical examinations and treatment. 
However, the complaints were reportedly ignored, and the complainants threatened to keep 
silent. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>245. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of India for the responses it 
provided to some of the communications she sent during the period under review, and invites the 
Government to respond to the remaining allegations submitted. She considers responses to her 
communications as an important part of the cooperation of Governments with her mandate. 
</p>
<p>246. Regarding the Government response of 29 April 2008 to the communication sent 
on 19 December 2007, the Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government failed to address the 
general situation of Dalits, and in particular Dalit women in India. The communication made 
reference to the general descent based discrimination that Dalit women and men suffer, the lack 
of proper implementation of existing legislation as well as the lack of police and judicial action 
to protect the rights of Dalits. In that communication the Rapporteurs referred to a large number 
of cases in order to illustrate the extent and variety of allegations of violence against Dalit 
women in India. In most cases, the name of the victim(s), the alleged perpetrator(s), and in some 
instances also the location of the incident, were reported. However, it was not possible to provide 
the full details of each individual case, either because the victims did not wish to reveal their full 
identity for privacy or safety concerns or because the source providing the information did not 
have the full details for each of the cases. While it is not excluded that each of these cases be 
subsequently addressed on a case by case basis, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government of 
India to provide information regarding the measures taken to guarantee the rights and freedoms 
of Dalits. 
</p>
<p><b>Iran (Islamic Republic of) 
Response from the Government to an urgent appeal sent in 2007 
</b></p>
<p>247. On <b>17 October 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders<b> </b>sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding Ms. R. S., 
a campaigner for women&#8217;s rights and a member of the One Million Signatures campaign which 
calls for an end to discriminatory laws against women in Iran. 
</p>
<p>248. According to information received, on 8 October 2007, Ms. R. S. participated in an event 
to mark the International Day of the Child during which she collected signatures for the One 
Million Signatures campaign. 
</p>
<p>249. On 9 October 2007, nine agents of the security forces entered the home of Ms. R. S. and 
seized literature pertaining to the One Million Signatures campaign, her computer as well as 
some other personal belongings. Ms. R. S. was arrested shortly afterwards and placed in  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 42 
 
</p>
<p>detention at the local Office of Information and Security Ministry in Sanandaj, Kurdistan. 
Allegedly, she was being held in <i>incommunicado</i> detention as all efforts on the part of family 
members to contact her had failed. 
</p>
<p>250. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms. R. S. may be directly related to 
her peaceful human rights activities, in particular her work to defend and promote women&#8217;s 
rights in Iran. In view of her <i>incommunicado</i> detention<i>,</i> further concern was expressed with 
regard to her physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p>251. By letter dated <b>13 February 2008, the Government replied to the letter sent 
on 17 October 2007</b>. It stated that Ms. R. S. used rights related to social liberties as a pretext for 
achieving her extremist inclinations. 
</p>
<p>252. The Government of Iran detailed that on the basis of investigations, Ms. R. S. was arrested 
on charges related to her organisational links with the terrorist group PEJAK (a group allegedly 
affiliated with the Kurdish Workers Party, the PKK), including; membership in the group; 
participation in the PEJAK military training course; being an accomplice to the explosion at the 
Sanandaj city exhibition; her connection with elements engineering bomb explosions in cities; 
and the provision of explosives for terrorist activities. It stated that Ms. R.S. was still under arrest 
and that her case was under investigation. 
</p>
<p>253. The Government added that her detention had no relation to her social or alleged women&#8217;s 
rights activities and asserted that any allegations of mistreatment or lack of proper attention to 
her physical or psychological integrity were false. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>254. On<b> 19 December 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on

Ms. M. H., Ms. J. J., Ms. H. A., Ms. R. S. and Ms. D. A., members of the One Million Signatures 
Campaign, &#8216;Change for Equality&#8217;. 
</p>
<p>255. According to the information received, since the end of October, five members of the 
Iranian women&#8217;s rights movement, known as the One Million Signatures Campaign for Equality, 
were arrested and charged. Both Ms. M. H. and Ms. J. J. were charged with &#8220;inciting public 
opinion, propaganda against the state, and publication of false information&#8221; for the content of 
their writing on the website of the One Million Signatures Campaign, and were reportedly being 
held in the Evin Prison, in Tehran. 
</p>
<p>256. Ms. H. A. and Ms. R. S., both members of the campaign in the province of Kordestan, 
were reportedly detained for several weeks. On 4 November 2007, Ms. H. A. was abducted from 
her grandfather&#8217;s home in Sanandaj, Kurdistan, by seven Ministry of Intelligence agents. After 
the arrest, the officers confiscated her computer and educational pamphlet related to the 
campaign. Allegedly, Ms. H. A. was being detained in the city of Sanandaj, and was believed to 
be held at the Ministry of Intelligence detention facility. She was deemed at risk of torture or 
other ill-treatment. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1

</p>
<p>257. Ms. R. S. was allowed only limited contact with her family and no access to her lawyer. 
According to the information received, on 4 November 2007, the Tehran Court of Appeal 
sentenced Ms. D. A., another member of the campaign, to two years and six months 
imprisonment for participation in an illegal gathering, propaganda against the system, and 
disturbing public order after she participated in a peaceful rally in Tehran. An order to stay the 
sentence was issued after a statement issued by leading international human rights organizations, 
but it had reportedly expired, and the sentence could be implemented at any time. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>258. On<b> 22 February 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on

situation of Ms. R. A. and Ms. N. K., two members of the One Million Signatures Petition 
Campaign., which calls for an end to discriminatory laws against women in Iran. 
</p>
<p>259. According to the information received, on 14 February 2008, Ms. R. A. and Ms. N. K. 
were arrested in Daneshjoo Park in Tehran, while collecting signatures in support of the 
Campaign&#8217;s petition. They were then taken to the Tehran police station no. 129 (Jaami) and later 
transferred to the security police station no. 8 for interrogation. Upon completion of their 
interrogation, they were transferred to the Vozara detention centre. 
</p>
<p>260. On 15 February, Ms. R. A. and Ms. N. K. were charged by the Revolutionary Court with 
&#8220;propaganda against the state&#8221;. They were then transferred to the Evin prison as they were 
unable to provide the requested bail of $22,000. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>261. On<b> 7 March 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the cases of Ms. S. N., Ms. T. H., 
Ms. S. and Ms. A. M., who were reportedly sentenced to death and were in imminent risk of 
execution. 
</p>
<p>262. According to the information received, Ms. S. N. was arrested eleven years previously for 
the murder of her husband and sentenced to death. She claimed that her husband committed 
suicide, and a forensic examination reportedly concluded that this was a possibility. She claimed 
that she had initially confessed to the murder for fear that her son would be accused instead. 
</p>
<p>263. Ms. T. H. was convicted eight years ago of the murder of her husband and sentenced to 
death. 
</p>
<p>264. Ms. S., was sentenced to death for the murder of her five day old baby. It was alleged that 
her son was born as a result of a relationship with a drug addict who had given her refuge a year 
earlier. As she refused to name the father, a complaint was lodged by the Tehran Prosecutor and 
she was sentenced to <i>qesas</i>, which reportedly is not open to pardon or amnesty by the Supreme 
Leader. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1

</p>
<p>265. Ms. A. M. was convicted five years ago of the murder of her husband and sentenced 
to death. Ms. A. M. was forced to marry her husband who was 40 years older than she 
was. The man who helped her commit the crime is expected to be freed upon payment 
of 60,000,000 Tomans &#8220;Dieh&#8221; (blood money). 
</p>
<p>266. Concern was expressed that in the above cases, these women may have been sentenced to 
the death penalty following trials that may have fallen short of fair trial standards and failed to 
respect the principle of non-discrimination on the basis of sex. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>267. On<b> 11 March 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation 
of human rights defenders sent an allegation letter in relation to several women human rights 
defenders in Iran, including Ms. P. A., a women&#8217;s rights defender and one of the founding 
members of the One Million Signatures Campaign and Ms. E. S., also an active member of the 
movement. The aim of the campaign was legislative reform in order to achieve greater gender 
equality. 
</p>
<p>268. According to information received, on 19 February 2008, Ms. E. S. was reportedly 
sentenced <i>in absentia</i> to six months suspended imprisonment for &#8220;endangering national security&#8221; 
and &#8220;propaganda against the State&#8221; by branch 13 of the Revolutionary Court. She had been 
arrested on 10 June 2007 by the security police from Police Station 104. The sentence was to be 
suspended for two years, and was not to be implemented unless she was found guilty of another 
crime during that time. 
</p>
<p>269. On the morning of 3 March 2008, Ms. P. A. was due to travel from Tehran to Stockholm. 
She had passed through passport control and had boarded her flight when security officials 
prevented the flight from taking off until she had disembarked. Ms. P. A. was reportedly 
informed by security officials that she had been banned from leaving Iran. The agents then 
confiscated Ms. P.A.&#8217;s passport and issued her with a court order which required her to report to 
the security department of the passport office within 72 hours.

consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders and the Vice-Chairperson of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding Ms. K. M., a member of 
the Mother&#8217;s Committee of the One Million Signatures Petition Campaign. 
</p>
<p>271. According to the information received, Ms. K. M. was arrested on 8 April 2008 at her 
house by agents of the police, who forced their way into her home and refused to show her an 
arrest warrant. Ms. K. M. was then transferred to the Eshrat Abad Security Police Station, where 
she was interrogated during several hours, and, from there, to the Revolutionary Court, where 
she was interrogated by an Investigative Judge. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 45 
 
</p>
<p>272. During the hearing, Ms. K. M. denounced that she had been ill-treated during her arrest. 
She was accused of hosting political meetings in her house and was asked to identify members of 
the Petition Campaign who had participated in the meetings. Subsequently, Ms. K. M. was 
charged with &#8220;spreading of propaganda against the State&#8221;; &#8220;disruption of public order&#8221; and 
&#8220;actions against national security.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>273. A temporary arrest order was issued against her and the bail for her release was set 
to 1,000 million Rials. As she declared that she was unable to pay such an excessive amount of 
money, the Investigative Judge ordered her transfer to prison for a week. At the time of the 
appeal, Ms. K. M. was being detained at the Vozara Detention Centre. 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>274. By letter dated <b>28 April 2009</b>, the Government replied to the letter sent on 11 April 2008. 
It stated the following: &#8220;Upon the several complaints filed by neighbours of Ms. K.M., stating 
that she had been constantly disturbing the tranquillity of her neighbours by causing noise and 
disturbances, an officer from the local police office calls on Ms. K.M. to advise her not to cause 
problem for her neighbours; but as a result of her heedless reaction and obtrusive behaviour, she 
was arrested by the police officer and taken to the police station. According to the existing 
report, she was released on the same day, upon her expression of regret, and no judicial action 
was taken against her. There is much to be regretted that such an incident is maliciously reported 
to the Special Procedure and then reflected to us as &#8216;arrest by agents of the police&#8217;, &#8216;transferred 
to security police station&#8217; and etc. The charges laid down against Ms. K.M. had no connection, 
whatsoever, with her, if any, social/human rights activities, and the case was immediately settled. 
Any allegation of maltreatment, of lack of proper attention to her integrity is baseless and mere 
fabrication of lies aiming at abusing the existing instruments.&#8221; (<i>Initials used to replace original

</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>275. On<b> 16 April 2008, </b>the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders 
sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the situation of Ms. S. E., lawyer and Nobel 
Peace Price winner in 2003 for her work promoting women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p>276. According to new information received, on 5 April 2008, Ms. S. E. received an anonymous 
letter at her office which read: &#8220;S. E., your death is near &#8230;We have warned you many times to 
watch your tongue, but despite the warnings you are talking. So for the last time correct your 
behaviour or you will be avenged [sic].&#8221; Ms. S. E. immediately denounced these threats in a 
letter to the police and recalled that she has been receiving death threats for years. In this 
document, she stated that she was convinced that the reason for these threats were her human 
rights activities. 
</p>
<p>277. On 7 April 2008, Ms. S. E. left Iran temporarily. On 15 April, State media reported that 
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had ordered the police to ensure the safety of Ms. S. E. 
Apparently, he also ordered police to conduct an investigation into the case. </p>

imprisonment for &#8220;acting against national security&#8221; by the 16th Chamber of Tehran 
Revolutionary Court. 
</p>
<p>280. On 28 April 2008, Ms. R. M. and Ms. P. A. were notified that, subsequent to a hearing that 
took place on 4 February 2008, the Tehran Revolutionary Court had sentenced Ms. R. M. to 
six months&#8217; suspended imprisonment and ten lashes and Ms. P. A. to two years&#8217; imprisonment 
on charges of &#8220;acting against national security.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>281. On 4 March 2007, the Iranian authorities arrested at least 31 women&#8217;s rights activists, 
including Ms. N. A., Ms. N. J., Ms. M. Z. P., Ms. R. M. and Ms. P. A., for staging a peaceful 
demonstration against the prosecution of six women&#8217;s rights defenders charged with criminal 
offences against public order and security for having organized a peaceful demonstration in the 
Haft-e Tir Square of Tehran on 12 June 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>282. By letter dated <b>14 April 2009</b>, the Government replied to the urgent appeal sent 
on 23 May 2008. It concluded that the organizers of the gathering did not observe the 
requirements for holding an organized gathering in accordance with articles 26 and 27 of the 
Iranian Constitution. The Government stated that the individuals mentioned had not registered 
and that their two gatherings had not met the legal requirements for permits. Some of these 
women had been arrested due to their illegal actions and incitement to disorder. The Government 
added that they held another illegal gathering on 4 March 2007 in front of the court where their 
cases were under judicial procedure. 
283. Ms. N. A. was sentenced on 19 March 2007 to six months&#8217; suspended imprisonment, 
which was reinstated by the Court of Appeal on 8 September 2008. Ms. N. J. was sentenced 
on 4 February 2008 to six months&#8217; suspended imprisonment but was acquitted by the Court of 
Appeal on 18 June 2008. Ms. Z. P. was sentenced to two years&#8217; suspended imprisonment 
on 2 December 2007, a verdict which was commuted to one year suspended imprisonment by 
the Court of Appeal on 18 August 2008. Ms. R. M. was sentenced six months&#8217; suspended </p>

</p>
<p>imprisonment on 5 March 2007, judgment reinstated by the Court of Appeal on 
8 September 2008. Ms. P. A. was sentenced on 17 November 2007 to two years&#8217; suspended 
imprisonment and the review of the judgment was under review by the relevant Court of Appeal. 
</p><p>284. The Government concluded that: all the mentioned individuals were released; that none 
was sentenced to imprisonment; that three individuals, who did not have records, were sentenced 
to only six months&#8217; suspended imprisonment; and that the suspended imprisonment verdicts 
were issued merely as a deterrent, and to ensure they abide by the rule of law and public order, 
which are to be observed for the good of society. 
</p>
<p>285. The Government also stated that the sentences had nothing to do with these individuals&#8217; 
activities in defence of human rights or any other peaceful activity. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>286. On<b> 30 June 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning the arrest and detention of the 
following nine female human rights defenders, including five journalists: Ms J. B. Y., an online 
journalist with the daily <i>Sarmayeh</i> and the Canon Zeman Irani; Ms J. J., member of the 
One Million Signatures Campaign and a regular writer for the website of <i>Change for Equality</i>; 
Ms A. S., of the daily <i>Etemad </i>and <i>Change for Equality</i> website; Ms F. G. and Ms S. L., both 
journalists for <i>Canon Zeman Irani</i>; Ms A. M., a journalist and photographer; Ms N. S., lawyer 
and women and children&#8217;s rights activist; and women&#8217;s rights defenders, Ms N. M. and Ms N. A.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>287. According to information received, on 12 June 2008, all nine women were arrested by 
members of the security forces outside the Rahe Abrisham Gallery in Tehran. The women had 
gathered to attend a seminar organised to mark the second anniversary of Iran&#8217;s National Day of 
Solidarity of Iranian Women (an event which first took place in June 2005). On arrival at the 
Gallery, organisers of the event found the door to the building locked. They were informed that 
the seminar had been cancelled by the security forces, a large number of which were reportedly 
present at the scene. Ms. A. S. and Ms. N. M. remained outside the Gallery to inform participants 
about the cancellation of the seminar, but were arrested at approximately 3.00 p.m. When 
Ms. N. S. and Ms. J. B. made enquiries about the arrests of their colleagues, they too were also 
arrested. Ms. N. A., Ms. J. J., Ms. S. L., Ms, F. G. and Ms. A. M. were arrested soon afterwards. 
All were brought to Vozara Detention Centre where they were detained for approximately 
8 hours before being released in the early hours of the following morning. The women were 
waiting to hear whether charges would be brought against them. 
</p>
<p>288. On the same day, the police reportedly visited the home of Change for Equality editor, 
Ms. P. A. However, she was not in the house at the time and they were unable to arrest her. 
On 2 May 2008, Ms. P. A. received a suspended sentence of two years&#8217; imprisonment and 
ten lashings for a period of three years on charges of &#8220;illegal gathering and collusion and refusal 
to obey the orders of the police with the intent of endangering national security&#8221;. The charges 
against her were related to her involvement in the organisation of a peaceful demonstration in the 
Hafte Tir Square, Tehran, on 12 June 2006, in protest of discrimination against women. </p>

<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>289. On<b> 11 July 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Working Group on arbitrary detention, the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of the judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning 
members of the One Million Signatures Campaign, Ms. H. A., Ms. R. A. and Ms. N. K. 
</p>
<p>290. According to information received, on 4 July 2008 Ms. H. A. began a five-year prison 
sentence. Her detention started on 4 November 2007, when her computer and pamphlets relating 
to the One Million Signatures Campaign were also confiscated. The sentence was passed 
on 18 June 2008 for &#8220;gathering and collusion to threaten national security&#8221; under Article 610 of 
the Islamic Penal Code. The sentence was reportedly based on interrogations carried out whilst 
Ms. H. A. was in isolated detention and was not allowed access to her lawyer. During her 
detention she was reportedly tortured. An appeal against her sentence was filed by her lawyer, 
but the Court of Appeal had not yet issued a decision. 
</p>
<p>291. On 20 July 2008 Ms. R. A. and Ms. N. K. were to appear in court. They were arrested 
on 14 February 2008 while collecting signatures as part of the One Million Signatures 
Campaign. The following day they were charged with &#8220;propaganda against the state&#8221; and 
transferred to Evin prison. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>292. On<b> 30 July 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding eight women and a 
man who were sentenced to death by stoning for adultery: Ms. K. N., Ms. I. E., Ms. M. (S.) G., 
Ms. Z.K. and Ms. A. K., Ms. A. K., Ms. K. V., Ms. L. Q., and Mr. A. F. M.  
</p>
<p>293. According to the information received, Ms. K. N. was a victim of domestic violence who 
was forced into prostitution by her husband in order to support his heroine addiction. He was 
murdered in 1995 by one of Ms. K.N&#8217;s clients who sympathized with her plight. Ms. K. N. 
already served 8 years in prison as an accessory to her husband&#8217;s murder. The man who 
murdered her husband also served 8 years in prison and is now free after paying <i>diyeh </i>(blood 
money) and undergoing 100 lashes. 
</p>
<p>294. Ms. K. N. wrote to the Judicial Commission for Amnesty to ask for her sentence of 
execution by stoning to be commuted. However, her appeal for amnesty was rejected; she had 
exhausted all domestic remedies. It was feared that her execution by stoning could happen at any 
time. 
</p>
<p>295. Ms. I. E. was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery, nine years of imprisonment and 
seventy-four lashes for aiding in a murder, hiding a body, and the destruction of criminal 
evidence by Branch 1 of Lali General Court in 2005. In 2006 the Supreme Court confirmed the 
death sentence which was being reviewed by the Pardons Commission.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 49 
 
</p>
<p>296. Ms. M. (S.) G. was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery by Branch 12 of the 
Criminal Court of East Azerbaijan Province in 2006. Branch 27 of the Supreme Court overruled 
the verdict because of irregularities in the investigation phase. She remains under criminal 
proceedings. 
</p>
<p>297. Ms. Z. K. and Ms. A. K. were arrested on 5 February 2007 in connection with allegations 
of illegitimate relations other than adultery. On 17 March 2007, they were prosecuted in court, 
found guilty, and sentenced to 99 lashes. This sentence was executed. Thereafter, both women 
were returned to prison and another trial took place for the same charges and they were 
sentenced to death by stoning on 5 August 2007. Branch 27 of the Supreme Court confirmed the 
death sentence in 2007. The file is now with the Head of the Judiciary. 
</p>
<p>298. Ms. A. K. was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery and fifteen years of imprisonment 
for complicity in murder by Branch 1601 of Tehran General Court. In 2003 Branch 2 of the 
Supreme Court confirmed the judgment. The Pardons Commission, however, had returned the 
file to the trial court. 
</p>
<p>299. Ms. K. V. was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery and eight years of imprisonment 
for complicity in murder. Her case was at the time, before the Head of the Judiciary. 
</p>
<p>300. Ms. L. Q. was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery and fifteen years of imprisonment 
for complicity in murder by Branch 71 of the Criminal Court of Tehran. Branch 37 of the 
Supreme Court confirmed the judgment in 2007. 
</p><p>301. Mr. A. F. M. was arrested on 8 February 2005 and charged with committing adultery. He 
was convicted and sentenced to death on 21 December 2005 by the Second Branch of the 
Mazandaran Penal Court and the sentence was confirmed by Bureau 41 of the Supreme Court 
on 1 August 2006. The file was at the time with the Pardons Commission. 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>302. By letter dated <b>8 April 2009</b>, the Government replied to the letter sent on 30 July 2008. 
The Government stated that the Holy religion of Islam attributes great importance to the issue of 
safeguarding the security and morality of society, and particularly to the fundamental institution 
of the family. To that end, and in order to secure the cleanliness and purity of the generation it 
has prescribed the very heavy punishment of &#8220;<i>Hadde Rajm</i>&#8221; (Prescribed Punishment of Stoning), 
for married individuals, as a deterrent that would contribute towards the realization of the sacred 
goal of the family. It added that Islam had defined stringent conditions, requirements and 
methods for proving this group of offences, so as to minimize the rate of oversight and error. The 
Government added that the main objective of Islamic Law was the introduction of a mechanism 
to prevent and discontinue the commission of such offences, adding that &#8220;in the view of Islamic 
jurisprudents, the punishment of stoning, in its nature and enforcement is substantially different 
from execution&#8221;.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>303. Finally, the Government informed that as a result of the investigations and legal procedures 
undertaken, the stoning of Ms. M. G., Ms. A. K. and Ms. Z. K. had been ruled out.<b> </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1

</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>304. On<b> 26 August 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Working Group on arbitrary detention, the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of the judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning 
Ms. M. K., a journalist and active member of the Campaign for Equality, a women&#8217;s rights 
movement in Iran which calls for reform of laws that discriminate against women, and a member 
of the One Million Signatures Campaign in Tehran. 
</p>
<p>305. According to information received, on 13 June 2008, Ms. M. K. was arrested by plain 
clothed security officers, who boarded a bus she was travelling on from Tajrish Square near 
Mellat Park, Tehran. Prior to her arrest Ms. M. K. used her cell phone to call her mother to tell 
her that she was on her way home but that the bus was delayed in traffic. A short time later, 
Ms. M. K. reportedly called her mother again to tell her that she was being forcibly removed 
from the bus. Her cell phone was then disconnected. 
</p>
<p>306. Prior to Ms. M. K.&#8217;s arrest, a demonstration had taken place near Mellat Park in Tehran. 
The protest had been organised to demonstrate against the arrest, on 11 June 2008, of Mr. A. P., 
a member of Iran&#8217;s Majlis&#8217;s (Parliament) Judicial Inquiry and Review Committee, who had 
apparently accused several senior Iranian officials of financial corruption. According to reports, 
security forces used tear gas and electric shock batons to disperse the crowd, and check points 
were also set up by security forces in Vali Asr Street which runs alongside Mellat Park. Several 
public buses were stopped and boarded by plain clothed officers. 
</p>
<p>307. According to reports, on the day Ms. M. K. was detained, her family was unable to 
ascertain her whereabouts despite enquiries made by her brother at Vozara detention centre. The 
following day, a fellow passenger who had been on the bus with Ms. M. K. returned her bag to 
her family, informing them that all the women on the bus had been removed by security officers, 
and that seemingly none of them had been involved in any demonstration. 
</p>
<p>308. On 14 June 2008, the Head of Tehran&#8217;s Judiciary reportedly issued a press statement 
declaring that 200 people had been arrested the previous day and that those who were innocent 
or were suspected of committing only minor offences would learn about the status of their cases 
within a week. On 25 June, Ms. M. K.&#8217;s mother received a call from her daughter from Evin 
Prison saying that she was being held along with 90 other alleged female protesters. On 6 July, 
Ms. M. K. along with nine other women reportedly went on hunger strike to protest about the 
prison conditions. At that time they were all being held in a section of Evin Prison where 
detainees are not permitted visits. The protest ended after the other nine women were all released 
by 25 July. Ms. M. K. remained in detention but was moved to a &#8216;general&#8217; section of Evin 
Prison, and was since then allowed weekly visits by her family. 
</p>
<p>309. According to reports, Ms. M. K. was charged with &#8220;acting against national security,&#8221; and 
the Revolutionary Court in Mahabad has scheduled her next hearing for 1 November 2008. 
Ms. M. K.&#8217;s lawyer had reportedly only recently been allowed to see the court documents </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 51 
 
</p>
<p>concerning her case, and was to shortly meet with her for the first time since her arrest. The court 
set bail of one billion rials (approximately US$ 110,000) on 12 July 2008. However, Ms. M. K.&#8217;s 
family had been unable to raise such a large amount of money. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>310. On<b> 26 August 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning Mr. A. Y. - A., a member of the 
Men&#8217;s Committee of the One Million Signatures Campaign. 
</p>
<p>311. According to the information received, on 11 July 2007, Mr. A. Y. - A. was arrested in 
Andisheh Park in Tehran while collecting signatures for the One Million Signatures Campaign. 
He was taken to security police station in the park, and was detained there for 5 days. 
On 15 July 2007, Mr A. Y. - A. was transferred to Evin prison, where he was detained until his 
release on bail on 8 August 2007. During his detention in Evin prison, he was allegedly 
interrogated eight times blindfolded, facing a wall, and was harassed several times by the guards. 
During his detention, he was allowed no contact with his family. 
</p>
<p>312. On 25 May 2008, Mr. A. Y. - A. was convicted by the Revolutionary Court on charges of 
&#8220;endangering national security through spreading propaganda against the state&#8221;. He was 
sentenced to one year in prison. Mr. A. Y. - A. was then freed on bail, while his sentence was 
being reviewed by Branch 54 of the Appeals Court. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>313. On<b> 24 October 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding the arrest of Ms. E. M., a member of the One Million Signatures 
Campaign and the branch of the Campaign for Equality in California, where she was a student. 
</p>
<p>314. According to the information received, on 15 October 2008, Ms. E. M. was arrested when 
driving on the Moddaress Highway in Tehran. Security officials who identified themselves as 
traffic police told her that she was being arrested for having illegally overtaken another vehicle. 
She was then detained at Evin Prison in Tehran although no charges had been brought against 
her; she was reportedly deemed at risk of torture or ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>315. Ms. E. M. had been in Iran for approximately two months when she was arrested. During 
that time she visited her family and conducted research for her Master&#8217;s thesis on the Iranian 
women&#8217;s movement. Following her arrest she was taken to the home of her family, which was 
searched. Property was confiscated, including Ms. E. M.&#8217;s computer and material which was to 
be used for her thesis such as, video recordings of interviews with members of the Campaign for 
Equality in Iran. The officials had a warrant for Ms. E. M.&#8217;s arrest and a court permission to 
search the home of her family and confiscate property. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 52 
 
</p>
<p>316. Following the search of Ms. E. M.&#8217;s family home, she was taken to Section 209 of Evin 
Prison. Her family was not allowed to see her but were told that, if they did not publicize her 
arrest, she would be released soon. Nevertheless, on 20 October 2008, when Ms. E. M.&#8217;s family 
again sought information on her case, they were told by officials of the Revolutionary Court in 
Tehran that the case was being investigated and that details would not be made public until the 
investigation was finished. It was only after this that Ms. E. M.&#8217;s family publicized her arrest.

</p>
<p>318. According to the information received, Ms Z. B. had been sentenced to four years&#8217; 
imprisonment and internal exile in Zanjan in August 2008 by the Mahabad Revolutionary Court. 
This sentence was upheld on 23 August 2008 by an appeal court in West Azerbaijan. Charges

</p>
<p>320. According to the information received, on 2 September 2008, Ms. P. A., Ms. N. K., 
Ms. J. J., and Ms. M. H., were sentenced to six months&#8217; imprisonment for &#8220;publishing

sentenced to death for an offence committed as a minor; his mother, Ms. M.; and another woman 
sentenced to death, known as &#8220;Z.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>322. According to the information received, in 2004, Mr. M. H., at the time aged 17, killed his 
father, who was allegedly addicted to alcohol and beating his wife Ms. M. (M. H.&#8217;s mother). The </p>

the Supreme Court.  
</p>
<p>323. On 30 November 2001, a woman known as &#8220;Z.&#8221; (full name not known) killed her husband. 
Reportedly, Z. had confessed to killing her husband and stated that her husband often drank large 
quantities of alcohol, struck her when she disagreed with him, and sexually abused her. 
Branch 1601 of the Penal Court in Tehran sentenced her to death as <i>qesas</i> (retribution). This 
sentence was subsequently confirmed by Branch 34 of the Supreme Court in Tehran. 
On 14 September 2008, the order for the death sentence was sent to the Office for 
Implementation of Sentences in Tehran. The family of the victim had requested that the 
execution of the death sentence take place as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter (follow-up) 
</b>324. On <b>18 November 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders sent a follow-up letter to the Government of Iran expressing their deep concern 
regarding the crackdown on women&#8217;s rights defenders, and participants in the One Million 
Signatures Campaign in the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p>325. The Rapporteurs recalled that they had sent 18 joint communications concerning violations 
committed against over 70 human rights defenders involved in the campaign since 2006 and 
noted that they had until then only received three responses from the Government. 
</p>
<p>326. The Rapporteurs urged the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to hasten its efforts 
in answering the outstanding communications within the shortest possible timeframe. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal

executions, Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent an 
urgent appeal to the Government regarding several cases of persons sentenced to death by 
stoning on charges of adultery. 
</p>
<p>328. On 26 December 2008, Mr. H. K. and another man<b> </b>whose name has not been reported to 
the Rapporteurs were executed by stoning in Mashhad. These executions were confirmed 
on 13 January 2009 by Mr. A. R. J., spokesperson for the judiciary. A third man, identified as a 
citizen of Afghanistan, named M. G., reportedly managed to free himself of the pit where he was 
to be stoned. He was again in custody. 
</p>
<p>329. Ms. G. M. and Mr. G. E. were arrested, possibly in 2003, on charges of adultery. In 2005 
or 2006, they were tried and sentenced to death by stoning. The death sentences were possibly 
confirmed by the Supreme Court in 2008. </p>

</p>
<p>330. On 14 January 2009, two lawyers, Mr. M. M. and Ms. S. S., travelled to Esfahan Central 
Prison, where Ms. G. M. and Mr. G. E. were detained, to offer their services as lawyers. The 
prison authorities denied the two lawyers access to the detainees. Mr. M. M. and Ms. S. S. 
appealed to the judicial authorities in Esfahan, which ruled that the lawyers could contact the two 
convicts only if the detainees first asked to meet with lawyers. 
</p>
<p>331. The cases of Ms. Z. K. and Ms. A. K. were the subject of two urgent appeals 
dated 13 February 2008 and 30 July 2008, to which had not yet received any response. As stated 
in previous communications, Ms. Z. K. and Ms. A. K. were arrested on 5 February 2007 in 
connection with allegations of illegitimate relations other than adultery. On 17 March 2007, they 
were prosecuted in court, found guilty, and sentenced to 99 lashes. This sentence was executed. 
Thereafter, both women were returned to prison and another trial took place for the same charges 
and they were sentenced to death by stoning on 5 August 2007. Branch 27 of the Supreme Court 
confirmed the death sentences in 2007. 
</p>
<p>332. According to information received since then, the Head of the Judiciary subsequently 
quashed the death sentence imposed against Ms. Z. K. and Ms. A. K. and sent their case back to 
Branch 77 of the General Court in Karaj. This court reportedly again imposed the death sentence 
by stoning and, in the first half of January 2009, Branch 27 of the Supreme Court confirmed the 
death sentence. 
</p>
<p>333. The charges against Ms. Z. K. and Ms. A. K. were primarily based on evidence contained 
on a video footage in the camera of Z. K.&#8217;s husband, which he had allegedly secretly installed in 
his house, and which reportedly showed the two women with another man. It would appear that 
the lawyer defending the two women had never been able to view the video footage which was 
used as evidence by the court. 
</p>
<p>334. In the communication of 30 July 2008, the Special Rapporteurs further brought attention to 
reports received regarding the following other persons allegedly sentenced to death by stoning on 
charges of adultery: Ms. K. N., Ms. I. E., Ms. M. (S.) G., Ms. A.K., Ms. K. V., Ms. L. Q., and 
Mr. A. F. M. The Rapporteurs expressed regret at not having received a reply from the 
Government on those cases. 
</p>
<p>335. Reportedly, in 2002, the Head of the Judiciary issued a directive purporting to introduce a 
moratorium on executions by stoning. However, it was reported that at least four men and one 
woman had been stoned to death since 2002, including the two men stoned to death in Mashhad 
on 26 December 2008. On 13 January 2009, the spokesperson of the judiciary, Mr. A. R. J., 
reportedly stated that the directive on the moratorium had no legal weight and judges were 
therefore free to ignore it. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>336. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran for its response to some of her communications sent during the period under review. She 
considers responses to her communications to be an important part of the cooperation of 
Governments with her mandate, and urges the Government to respond to the allegations in the 
remaining communications sent.<b> </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 55 
 
</p>
<p>337. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to underline the challenges faced by women human 
rights defenders and requests that they be permitted to exercise their rights to freedom of 
assembly and freedom of expression. She considers that the arrest and detention of the members 
of the One Million Signatures Campaign may constitute a systematic attempt to curb these rights 
and urges the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to observe women&#8217;s right to exercise 
their freedom to assemble peacefully. The Special Rapporteur was concerned at the arrests on 
charges of &#8220;disturbing public opinion&#8221; and &#8220;disruption of public order&#8221; on 26 March 2009 of 
twelve members of the One Million Signatures Campaign and Mothers for Peace in Tehran. The 
Special Rapporteur is thus pleased to have received recent information that as of the 
08 April 2009, with the latest release on bail of Ms. M.K. and Ms. K.M. (released on 07 April 
and 08 April respectively), all twelve members had been released on bail, and would be 
interested in being kept informed on the developments with respect to the charges against these 
women.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Iraq 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>338. On<b> 16 May 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders sent 
an urgent appeal to the Government regarding a reported gun attack against ASUDA, the 
Organisation for Combating Violence Against Women.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>339. According to the information received, on 11 May 2008, unidentified gunmen opened fire 
on ASUDA&#8217;s protection shelter for women. The fire was reportedly opened from an unoccupied 
house nearby. One of the residents of the shelter, a mother of three, was hit by three bullets and 
was hospitalised for treatment.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>340. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iraq did not reply to her urgent 
appeal sent 16 May 2008. She reiterates her interest in receiving a response from the 
Government in regard to the allegations submitted and would be particularly interested to know 
whether the case has been investigated and resulted in any prosecution of alleged perpetrators. 
</p>
<p><b>Ireland 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>341. On<b> 21 November 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences jointly the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding 
Ms. P. I. and her two daughters N., aged 7, and J., aged 6, originally from Nigeria but resident in 
Ireland since January 2005. 
</p>
<p>342. According to the information received, Ms. P. I. had three children. Her eldest daughter E., 
died on 16 July 1994, when she was 18 months old, as a result of profuse bleeding arising from </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 56 
 
</p>
<p>the forcible perpetration of female genital mutilation (FGM) on her by the family of Ms. P.I.&#8217;s 
husband. On at least three occasions, members of the extended family tried to kidnap the two 
remaining girls, N., and J. On the last occasion, Mrs. P. I.&#8217;s husband was injured when he 
struggled with relatives to prevent them from taking his children. It was after this incident that 
Mrs. P. I. and her husband decided that for their safety, she and the children should leave 
Nigeria. As a result, Ms. P. I., together with her two daughters, claimed asylum in Ireland in 
January 2005 on the basis that she feared for the safety of her two younger daughters. 
</p>
<p>343. Ms. P. I.&#8217;s application for asylum was rejected by both the Office of the Refugee 
Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Deportation orders were issued 
for her and her two daughters in November 2005. Upon her arrest for deportation, a solicitor 
brought an application for judicial review in the high court, challenging the Minister for Justice&#8217;s 
refusal to allow Mrs. P. I. to remain in Ireland on humanitarian grounds. These proceedings were 
concluded on 30 January 2008, resulting in a refusal to accept Ms. P. I.&#8217;s application for judicial 
review. 
</p>
<p>344. Ms. P. I. then applied for subsidiary protection, which was refused by the Minister for 
Justice. This refusal was again challenged for judicial review, which was granted 
on 19 March 2008. An injunction on their deportation order was also placed 
until 12 November 2008, pending a full hearing of her judicial review. The case was due to be 
heard in the high court on 6 November 2008. As a case with similar points of law was recently 
decided in the high court and appealed to the Supreme Court, it was agreed that Ms. P. I.&#8217;s case 
should await the outcome of the Supreme Court decision. However, at the time of writing of the 
letter, Ms. P.I. had still not been given a definite date for the judicial review and the State had 
refused to agree to extend the stay on their deportation orders until the hearing. In light of this, 
an application was made to the European Court of Human Rights under Article 34 to review the 
case of Ms. P.I. 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>345. By letter dated 3 March 2009, the Government replied to the letter sent 
on 21 November 2008. It stated that Ireland&#8217;s firm view was that Mrs P. I. had been afforded 
every opportunity to have her case examined and subjected to judicial scrutiny. 
</p><p>346. The Government also informed the Rapporteur that by letter dated 11 February 2009 the 
European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) formally communicated the application of Mrs P. I. 
and her daughters and invited the Government of Ireland to submit written Observations on the 
admissibility and merits of the complaints by the 22 April 2009. The ECHR requested that 
Mrs. P. I. and her daughters not be deported until further notice. Ireland replied that they would 
comply with the ECHR request. 
</p>
<p>347. The Government detailed every step of the judicial process, including Mrs P. I. and her 
daughters&#8217; application to refugee status, the initial recommendation on 24 February 2005 by the 
Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) not to declare them eligible for 
refugee status, and the confirmation of ORAC&#8217;s recommendation by the Refugee Appeals 
Tribunal on 22 June 2005. The Government stated that Ms P. I. did not seek to have these 
decisions judicially reviewed, despite having full legal representation. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 57 
 
</p>
<p>348. The Government further stated that Mrs P. I. and her daughters failed to present to the 
Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 5 December 2005 as notified, and that Ms P. I. 
was apprehended on 12 January 2006 and placed in detention. 
</p>
<p>349. On 13 and 18 January 2006 applications were made to the High Court for an extension of 
time to institute proceedings and bring Judicial Review Proceedings against the Deportation 
Order. On 30 January 2008, the High Court issued the decision refusing Ms P. I. and her 
daughters&#8217; application for judicial review. 
350. By applications dated 4 March 2008, Ms P. I. and her daughters applied to the Minister, 
calling on him to exercise his discretion to allow them to apply for subsidiary protection under 
the Regulations (Regulation 4 (2) of the European Communities Regulations). Ms P. I. and her 
daughters were informed on 19 March 2008 that the Minister had decided to refuse to exercise 
discretion pursuant to Regulation 4(2). In fresh Judicial Review proceedings, the High Court 
granted Ms P. I. and her daughters leave to judicial review and consideration of the application 
for subsidiary protection. On 14 October 2008, the High Court upheld the manner in which the 
Minister had dealt with applications for subsidiary protection and following a two day hearing, 
refused an application on behalf of Ms P. I. and her daughters for an order to continue the 
injunction restraining their deportation. Ms P. I. and her daughters subsequently lodged an 
appeal to the Supreme Court challenging the decision of the High Court.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>351. Ms. P. I. and her daughters&#8217; solicitor lodged a case with the ECHR on 11 September 2008.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>352. In its reply to the communication, the Government also provided responses to specific 
questions, including regarding the measures and safeguards taken to ensure the protection of the 
human rights Ms. P.I.&#8217;s two daughters, should they be deported back to Nigeria. The 
Government referred to the fact that an individual is expected to avail himself or herself of State 
protection in their country of origin (where protection is available), as well as consider the 
relocation to another part of that country when such a safe relocation is possible. The 
Government also highlighted Ireland&#8217;s obligations <i>vis-&#224;-vis</i> the relevant safeguards in regard to 
expulsions.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>353. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Ireland for its reply to the 
communication sent on 21 November 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Kyrgyzstan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>354. On<b> 23 April 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, and the Vice-Chairperson of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding 
Ms. O. A., a self-employed market-woman. 
</p>
<p>355. According to the information received, Ms. O. A. had been recognised as <i>non compos 
mentis</i> (certifiably insane) by government authorities. On 18 February 2008 she went to the local </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 58 
 
</p>
<p>authority (<i>akimiat)</i> in Kerben, in order to lodge a complaint with Ms. K. O., because the 
electricity at her home had been cut. The representative refused to take her complaint arguing 
that she complained for no apparent reason, called her &#8220;crazy&#8221; and threatened to call the militia. 
Ms. K.O. asked her to report back on 20 February. When Ms. O. A. did so, she was arrested by 
three members of the militia whose first names were M., M. and A. The three men violently 
dragged her into a car, which caused her pain in her shoulders and armpits, and transferred her to 
the police station in Kerben. 
</p>
<p>356. At the police station, investigator M.A. reportedly threatened that she would be detained 
for many years if she did not sign a number of documents. Ms. O. A. signed 5 or 6 documents 
written in Russian, which she hardly understood since she is ethnic Kyrgyz and has difficulty 
reading and writing. Afterwards, Ms. O. A. was detained in a cell at the police station and raped 
by two police officers on guard during that night, one of whom was identified as I. After raping 
her the two officers beat Ms. O. A. again, hit her head against a wall and told her not to talk to 
anyone about the incident. She lost consciousness several times. The officers washed her with 
cold water from a plastic bottle. This reportedly resulted in cystitis. 
</p>
<p>357. Ms. O. A. attempted to commit suicide with 20 tablets of Carbamazepine, an 
anticonvulsant and mood stabilising drug used primarily in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar 
disorder. She was unconscious when she was admitted to a hospital in Kerben, had to be 
artificially nourished, and only regained consciousness two days later on 22 February. 
</p>
<p>358. At the hospital she was handcuffed to her bed and guarded by policemen, making it 
impossible for her to go to the bathroom, which caused her much distress because of her cystitis. 
One of the police guards, identified by his first name A., threatened her again not to report the 
rape. 
</p>
<p>359. On 22 February she was summoned to the city court of Kerben on charges of hooliganism 
brought against her. Reportedly the presiding judge A. B. did not ask any questions or listen to 
her complaints. After the trial she was returned to the hospital. On 25 February 2008 she filed a 
complaint with the Deputy Prosecutor of Kerben, E. N., who came to the hospital following the 
intervention of a human rights defender on Ms. O. A.&#8217;s behalf. She remained in the hospital 
until 26 February when she was transferred to the Legal Examination Unit of the National 
Psychiatric Hospital in Kyzylzhar, escorted by three guards, one of whom was I. who had raped 
her at the police station. Ms. O. A. remained in custody at the National Psychiatric Hospital 
when the communication was issued. 
</p>
<p>360. On 17 March, a lawyer acting on behalf of Ms. O. A. contacted the Deputy Prosecutor in 
Kerben, Mr. N., who denied the lawyer a meeting. A complaint was submitted to the Prosecutor 
General&#8217;s Office in Bishkek on 25 March. 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>361. By letter dated <b>4 August 2008</b>, the Government replied to the letter sent on 23 April 2008. 
It stated that on 20 February 2008, Ms. K. O. filed a complaint against Ms. O. A. with the 
Aksyisky district internal affairs office, accusing her of criminal mischief (hooliganism) 
committed against the complainant and her sister, Ms. N. M.<b> </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 59 
 
</p>
<p>362. The government said that the investigation found that there were grounds for the 
complaint. Accordingly, on 20 February 2008, the internal affairs office&#8217;s investigation service 
instituted criminal proceedings under article 234, part 3, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code, 
dealing with criminal mischief (hooliganism).<b> 
</b></p>
<p>363. On the same day, Ms. O. A. was arrested for the acts in question and taken into police 
custody at the Aksyisky district internal affairs office.<b> </b>On 22 February 2008, Ms. O. A., in the 
presence of counsel and of human rights defender Ms. S. V., was charged with the offence under 
the above-mentioned article and the Aksyisky district court issued a pre-trial restraining order 
authorizing her detention.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>364. On 25 February 2008, the investigator called for a psychiatric report to be done, on an 
inpatient basis, to determine whether Ms. O. A. was fit to stand trial. On 14 March 2008, experts 
at the national psychiatric hospital in the settlement of Kyzyl Zhar-12 declared that Ms. O. A. 
was suffering from a psychological disorder, &#8220;epileptic dementia&#8221;, and was thus incapable of 
understanding and controlling her actions. She was found to be unfit to plead her case, and it was 
recommended that she undergo compulsory treatment at a psychiatric hospital and be kept under 
routine observation. 
</p>
<p>365. On 27 March 2008, the Aksyisky district court issued a decision finding Ms. O. A. guilty 
of the offence in question, and she was sent to the psychiatric hospital in the settlement of 
Kyzyl-Zhar for compulsory treatment. 
</p>
<p>366. The government confirmed that on 23 February 2008 the head of the human rights NGO 
Nadezhda i Mir (Hope and Peace), Ms. S. V., filed a complaint alleging that Ms. O. A. had been 
raped on the night of 21 February 2008 while in custody at the Aksyisky district internal affairs 
office. The case in question was investigated by the Aksyisky district deputy <i>procurator,</i> 
Mr. E. M., who on 25 February 2008 ordered a forensic medical examination to be carried out. 
The Government added that on 26 February 2008, Ms. O. A, in the presence of the human rights 
defender, Ms. S.V., was unable to identify from among the staff of the Aksyisky district internal 
affairs office the persons who had allegedly raped her on the night of 21 February 2008. 
</p>
<p>367. The forensic medical report concluded that Ms. O. A. had sustained minor facial injuries in 
the form of superficial scratches, which might have been caused by an impact with a wall or the 
corner of a bed, or possibly by a fall. No signs of sexual assault were found. In light of the 
findings, the district procurator&#8217;s office decided not to institute criminal proceedings. The 
material in question was examined by the Jalalabad provincial <i>procurator&#8217;s</i> office, which found 
that the decision taken was justified. 
368. The Government therefore concluded that the allegation that Ms. O. A. was raped by staff 
of the Aksyisky district internal affairs office has been found to be unreliable. It also underlined 
that Ms. O. A. has not filed a statement with the national <i>Procurator-General&#8217;s</i> Office. The 
government added that the entire investigation of Ms. O. A.&#8217;s case took place with the 
participation of defence counsel and that the assertions that the investigator submitted for 
signature documents in Russian, without making them public, were untrue. It stated that the 
proceedings in the criminal case were conducted in the national language. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>369. On<b> 20 August 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 
sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning the rape of a minor, Ms. V. of Uzbek 
origin, residing in Chui province. 
</p>
<p>370. According to the information received, Ms. V. was 13 years old at the time of the alleged 
commission of the crime. She was the victim of rape at least five times between 7 
and 15 January 2008. The incidents happened in Jalalabat Province, Kyazyljar village. 
</p><p>371. On 7 January 2008 at night, two young men named A. T. and A. J. forced Ms. V. and her 
friend R. M. to drink alcohol, hit them, and raped them. They threatened to kill them if they told 
anyone what happened. The girls returned to their homes without mentioning the incident. 
</p>
<p>372. On the evening of January 10th, the two girls decided to flee from their homes. 
On 11 January, K. B., the son of a woman from the girls&#8217; village, who helped them hide, took the 
girls to his flat. With his friend M. T., he harassed and hit the girls. He then raped Ms. V. 
On 12 January, K. B. brought the girls to the house of Z. N., where another man was present 
named K. T. The girls were forced to drink alcohol and were beaten up. Three other men came 
whose names were K. M., A. O. and M. D. All of them hit the girls, threatened them with knives, 
and forced them to take unknown tablets. K. T. and Z. N. then raped Ms. V. and R. M. The girls 
were then thrown onto the street. On 13 and 14 January, the two girls accidentally met Z. N., 
who again raped Ms. V. twice. 
</p>
<p>373. On 15 January, the girls were found and reported to the police of Tashkumyr. A medical 
expertise conducted by the doctor K. in Shamalduusai the same day confirmed that Ms. V. 
suffered from wounds in her forehead, lips and shoulders, from concussion, and from pains in 
her abdomen and genital organs. Traces of different sperm were found on her. 
</p>
<p>374. A trial was held and four of the nine perpetrators were convicted and sentenced 
to 10 to 15 years imprisonment. One was recognized as mentally insane. The four others, A. T., 
K. M., M. D. and A. O., were not convicted. 
</p>
<p>375. On 22 January 2008, inhabitants of Kyzyljar gathered to discuss the rape of Ms. V. Among 
them were authorities, including the deputy of the village counsel A. D, representatives of three 
village <i>aksakal</i> (elderly men) counsels, the therapist of the district psychiatric hospital S. M., and 
the school principal S.A.A. The residents of the village reached the decision to evict the victim 
and her family from the village within 24 hours. The perpetrators&#8217; relatives further demanded 
that Ms. V. withdraw her complaint against the perpetrators, or else they would make sure 
Ms. V.&#8217;s family was evicted from the village. The village&#8217;s inhabitants also decided to evict the 
girl from the school and to jointly act to try to release the assailants by writing a letter to the 
court explaining the &#8220;bad&#8221; behaviour of the girl victim. 
</p>
<p>376. In a statement signed by 104 inhabitants of the village and sent to the Administration of the 
President, they accused Ms. V.&#8217;s father-in-law of being the real perpetrator of the rapes, and 
alleged that Ms. V.&#8217;s family had asked relatives of the perpetrators for USD 50,000 in exchange </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 61 
 
</p>
<p>for the withdrawal of her complaint against them. The signatories of the statement further stated 
that Ms. V.&#8217;s mother often insulted the inhabitants on ethnic grounds. They finally demanded the 
reconsideration of the cases of the convicted perpetrators. On 9 July 2008, the prosecutor 
interviewed the victim&#8217;s mother in Jalalabad Oblast, and later confirmed in writing that the 
allegations in the statement by the village&#8217;s inhabitants were unfounded. 
</p>
<p>377. A petition was filed by Ms. V with a police investigator about the threats she endured from 
relatives of the convicted perpetrators and from the medical staff of the District Psychiatric 
Hospital during her treatment. The investigator refused to accept the complaint, saying that there 
was no basis for it, since she was not beaten. The petition was also sent to the Ministry of Health 
but she received no reply. 
</p>
<p>378. On 18 July 2008, the Jalalabad court accepted to reconsider the cases of the convicted men, 
upon receipt of the above-mentioned letter by the village&#8217;s inhabitants. A. J., sentenced to a 15 
year prison term in the first instance, was upon appeal, subsequently convicted and sentenced to 
a 2 year suspended term. Upon appeal, Z. N., who had also been sentenced to a 15 year prison 
term, was released, and the similar 15-year prison term for K. B. was reduced to 10 years. In the 
case of M. T., his 10 year sentence in first instance, was reduced to a 8 year prison term after 
appeal. 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>

<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>380. On<b> 7 October 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences jointly with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding 
Ms. N. T. K., aged 18, resident in Talas. 
</p>
<p>381. According to the information received, Ms. N. T. K. was arrested at her home 
on 22 July 2008 by members of the Talas police on suspicion of theft. At the Talas police 
department, although she admitted having stolen a mobile phone, members of the police 
attempted to force her to confess to other thefts, which she denied. Ms. N. T. K. was undressed 
by a female police officer in front of male officers, who then severely beat her on the head, 
stomach and kidney. They also insulted her and threatened her with rape. 
</p>
<p>382. On 26 July, a human rights defender submitted a written complaint on Ms.<b> </b>N. T. K.&#8217;s 
behalf to the Office of the Prosecutor, asking for a medical examination and for an investigation 
into the harm Ms. N. T. K. had allegedly suffered. The resulting medical report confirmed the 
beatings she had suffered. Despite the complaint, the medical evidence and the fact that 
Ms. N. T. K identified one of the policemen who mistreated her as R., no investigation has so far 
been ordered into these events. At the time of writing, Ms. N. T. K remained in pre-trial 
detention in a cell at the Talas police department, awaiting trial in connection with the theft of 
the mobile phone. </p>

<p>386. According to the information received, since the arrival in the 1990s of logging companies 
in areas inhabited by the Penan community, workers from Malaysian companies, in particular I. 
and S., have been reported to harass and rape Penan women and girls. With the streams and 
rivers no longer navigable due to the logging activities, Penan children became dependent on 
company vehicles for accessing areas outside their settlements, including schools. Penan girls 
hitching rides to school and back are susceptible to abuses during their journey by workers of the 
logging companies. There have been cases of female students being driven to logging camps and 
raped when using transportation provided by the companies. In other cases, the transport 
operated by company vehicles were arranged in such a way that the girls had to stay overnight at 
a logging camp, where they were subject to abuses by workers. 
387. In recent years, at least a dozen cases of sexual abuses have been reported to the police, 
although it is alleged that most of them have not resulted in convictions, thereby undermining 
trust in the police. In addition, it is said that the majority of cases remain unreported. 
<b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>388. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Malaysia did not reply to this 
communication sent on 20 November 2008. The Special Rapporteur reiterates her interest in 
receiving a response from the Government in regard to the allegations submitted and would be 
particularly interested to know whether these cases have resulted in any prosecutions of alleged 
perpetrators.

mujeres supuestamente v&#237;ctimas de violencia sexual por parte de agentes de polic&#237;a durante los 
incidentes en San Salvador Atenco el 3 y 4 de mayo de 2006. 
</p>
<p>397. Seg&#250;n informaci&#243;n recibida, el d&#237;a 3 de mayo del 2006, la Sra. A. M. V. R. detenida por la 
Polic&#237;a en San Salvador Atenco, Estado de M&#233;xico. La Sra. V. habr&#237;a sido transportada en un

habr&#237;an comenzado a tocarle los senos y a introducirle los dedos en la vagina. Se informa que 
dos de los polic&#237;as la habr&#237;an forzado a practicarles sexo oral y a tragar su semen, mientras el 
resto continuaban toc&#225;ndola e insult&#225;ndola. A pesar de que fue obligada a mantener la cabeza

Blas Marcelo por el delito de &#8220;actos libidinosos&#8221; en contra de A. M. V. R. Sin embargo, se alega 
que este delito no refleja la magnitud ni la gravedad de las violaciones sufridas por la Sra. A. M. 
V. R., ya que contempla una pena menor a la prevista para el delito de violaci&#243;n sexual. Tambi&#233;n 
se informa que el delito de &#8220;actos libidinosos&#8221; no es considerado como grave, por lo tanto el

<p>420. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Mexico for its reply to

<p><b>Myanmar 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>421. On<b> 2 October 2008</b>,<b> </b>the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences jointly with the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
regarding Ms. N. T., aged 36, a human rights defender and pro-democracy activist. 
</p>
<p>422. According to the information received, Ms. N. T., a leader of the democratic opposition in 
Myanmar, was arrested on 10 September 2008 on her way to visit the mother of Mr. A. B. K., 
another detained activist, in a suburb of north eastern Yangon. At the time of the appeal, she was 
being detained and interrogated at Aung Tha Pyay Detention Centre in Yangon. 
</p>
<p>423. Mr. A. B. K. and Ms N. T.&#8217;s husband, Mr. K. M. Y. (also known as K. J.), were among 
thirteen members of the so-called &#8220;88 Generation Students Group&#8221; who were arrested 
on 22 August 2007. The following day, Ms. N. T. led around 500 people in a demonstration in 
Yangon to demand the release of fellow activists and to continue the protest against the sudden 
increase in fuel prices that had been imposed by the Government on 15 August 2007. Thereafter, 
Ms. N. T. went into hiding, forced to leave her baby daughter in the care of her family. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>424. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Myanmar did not reply to this 
communication sent on 2 October 2008 and reiterates her interest in receiving a response from 
the Government in regard to the urgent appeal submitted. </p>

<p><b>Nepal 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>425. On<b> 16 July 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences jointly with Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders sent an 
urgent appeal to the Government concerning Ms. L. B., member of the <i>District Alliance of 
Women Human Rights Defenders</i>, advocate of the right of women to good health, and Secretary 
of the <i>Women&#8217;s Empowerment Centre</i>, and other women human rights defenders in Western 
Nepal. 
</p>
<p>426. According to information received, on 6 June 2008, Ms. L. B. died when she took, or was 
forced to take, poison after having been physically abused by her husband. The work of 
Ms. L. B. in defence of women&#8217;s rights had caused major disagreement between her and her 
husband, as well as her husband&#8217;s family. She had been physically abused by her husband and 
her mother-in-law and thrown out of the house on previous occasions. 
</p>
<p>427. The police registered a First Information Report (FIR) on murder charges on 16 June, 
following intense advocacy by human rights defenders including the National Human Rights 
Commission, and international organizations. The husband of the deceased was arrested 
on 17 June and her mother-in-law soon after. 
</p>
<p>428. It is alleged that the police investigation, which concluded that Ms. L. B. was not forced to 
take poison, was inadequate and insufficient. The police investigation was completed on 2 July 
and the case was submitted to the District Court. The mother-in-law was released on 2 July based 
on an order of the Public Attorney and the husband was released on bail, on 4 July based on an 
order of the District Court. 
</p>
<p>429. Since the filing of the FIR, the Alliance of Women Human Rights Defenders in 
Kanchanpur district, in particular the Secretary of the District Alliance of Women Human Rights 
Defenders, were allegedly subject to an intimidation campaign by friends and family of 
Ms. L. B.&#8217;s husband and mother-in-law. On 2 July the Alliance submitted a written complaint to 
the police listing several security incidents in this respect. The police response to the complaint 
was allegedly inadequate, and no investigation was conducted. 
</p>
<p>430. As of 13 July, the women human rights defenders from mid-Western and far Western 
Nepal went on a relay hunger strike in Maitighar Mandala in Kathmandu, demanding a 
Commission to investigate the killing of Ms. L. B., as well as to address all forms of violence 
against women, and guarantee the security of women human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>431. On<b> 25 July 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning members of the <i>National Alliance 
of Women Human Rights Defenders</i> (NAWHRD), Ms. B. S., Ms S. C., Ms. N. S. and Ms. K. M. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 70 
 
</p>
<p>432. According to the information received, on 21 and 28 June 2008, Ms. B. S. received 
anonymous telephone calls, threatening that she would face &#8220;bad consequences&#8221; if she continued 
with her investigations into the death of Ms. L. B., a member of the District Alliance of Women 
Human Rights Defenders, advocate of the right of women to good health, and Secretary of the 
Women&#8217;s Empowerment Centre who died on 6 June 2008, when she took, or was forced to take, 
poison after having been physically abused by her husband. On 17 June Ms. K. M. received as 
well an anonymous threatening telephone call. Ms. S. C. has also been the victim of over twelve 
anonymous telephone calls in which she has received death threats and has been told not to 
intervene in Ms. L. B.&#8217;s case. On one occasion she was told that the members of the NAWHRD 
would be killed within seven days if investigations into Ms. L. B.&#8217;s case continued. Furthermore, 
in the morning of 27 June 2008, Ms. S. C. was knocked down by an unknown motorcyclist. She 
sustained minor injuries. That afternoon Ms. N. S. and Ms. K. M. were returning from a meeting 
of women human rights defenders by motorcycle when an unknown cyclist tried to stop them 
twice and briefly pursued them. On 2 July, Ms. S. C., Ms. K. M. and Ms. B. S. filed a joint 
complaint on those incidents at the Kanchanpur District Police Office. 
</p>
<p>433. In the afternoon of 2 July 2008, a group of twenty or thirty men reportedly led by the 
brother of the late Ms. L. B.&#8217;s husband came to the district office of the NAWHRD and 
threatened Ms. S. C. The mother-in-law of the late Ms. L. B. also went to the office with a group 
of women and shouted that the office should be set on fire and Ms. S. C. should be killed. The 
crowd surrounded and entered her office, but was dispersed shortly after upon arrival of the 
police. Ms. S. C. was also threatened by a similar group which had gathered outside her house. 
Ms. S C. filed two written complaints and some additional verbal complaints at the Kanchanpur 
District Police Office about these incidents. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>434. On<b> 14 January 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the killing of Ms. U. S., a journalist 
with <i>Janakpur Today Daily</i> and <i>Radio Today FM</i> and member of the Women Human Rights 
Defenders Network in Dhanusha, and alleged threats against Ms. M. J., journalist with the 
<i>Kathmandu Post Newspaper</i> in Janakpur. 
</p>
<p>435. According to information received, on 11 January 2008, around 15-20 men wielding blunt 
objects and <i>khukuri</i> knives surrounded the room which Ms. U. S. rented in Janakpur. Several of 
the assailants then entered Ms. U. S.&#8217;s room where they began to attack her. When Ms. U. S. 
tried to resist the assault, she was dragged outside onto the veranda where the attack continued. 
Ms. U. S. sustained serious injuries, including stab wounds, to her face, head, neck and stomach. 
Following the attack, neighbours immediately rushed Ms. U. S. to the nearest hospital. Ms. U. S. 
died before midnight while being transferred by road to a hospital in Kathmandu. A police 
investigation was launched into the incident. However, as yet a motive for the killing has not 
been established. 
</p>
<p>436. A few hours after the attack on Ms. U. S., an unidentified group of approximately 6 men 
began banging on the corrugated iron gate outside Ms. M. J.&#8217;s house in Janakpur. The men then </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 71 
 
</p>
<p>jumped into the compound and broke her bedroom window. Ms. M. J. alerted the police by text 
message and asked her uncle, who lives next door, for help. He raised the alarm and people 
within the neighbourhood started gathering in the vicinity. A short time later, a police van also 
arrived on the scene and the attackers fled. At some point before they fled, the assailants 
reportedly threatened Ms. M. J. that she &#8216;would be next&#8217;. Following the incident, Ms. M. J. was 
provided with security protection throughout the night. The next morning, she found that a cross 
had been drawn with mud/clay on the metal gate outside her house. 
</p>
<p>437. Ms. U. S. was an active journalist who, prior to her death, had written articles covering 
women&#8217;s rights, including criticism of the traditional dowry system, and local political issues. 
She started working as a journalist after her father and brother were abducted in September 2006, 
allegedly by the Maoists. Their whereabouts remain unknown. In December 2008, Ms. U. S. had 
reportedly received threats from an unidentified source, while Ms. M. J. had been receiving 
threats in a regular basis since November. Ms. U. S. and Ms. M. J. had purportedly informed the 
local authorities about the threats, however no action was taken. 
</p>
<p><b>Acknowledgment receipt 
</b></p>
<p>438. On <b>29 January 2009</b>, the Government of Nepal acknowledged receipt of the 
communication. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>439. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Nepal did not reply to any of the 
three urgent appeals she submitted during the period under review. She reiterates her interest in 
receiving responses from the Government in regard to the allegations submitted and would be 
particularly interested to know whether these cases have resulted in any prosecutions of alleged 
perpetrators.

respectivamente&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>443. Seg&#250;n la carta, una ni&#241;a de nacionalidad nicarag&#252;ense, a mediados del a&#241;o 2002, en

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 73 
 
</p>
<p>447. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Nicaragua for its reply to 
her communication of 14 January 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Norway 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>448. On 6 March 2009, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding Ms. E. H. A., aged 20, resident in Stavanger. 
</p>
<p>449. According to the allegations received, on 24 May 2005, E. H. A, at that time aged 16, was 
involuntarily admitted to the psychiatric ward of the Stavanger University Hospital. She had 
been taken there by a school consultant without her parents being informed or consulted 
although she had no previous history of violent or other disturbing behaviour. Since then, she has 
been kept at the hospital, including in solitary confinement at different periods. 
</p>
<p>450. According to her mother, Ms. E. H. A. had gone through a difficult period, related to a 
possible sexual assault a few months earlier. This incident was reported to the police, but the 
case was dismissed by the police authorities due to the lack of evidence. 
</p>
<p>451. Ms. E. H. A. has been forcibly administered different types of psychiatric drugs, despite 
her parents&#8217; repeated objections. The doctors&#8217; diagnoses have changed many times and do not 
appear to be consistent. Since her confinement, Ms. E. H. A.&#8217;s condition has deteriorated 
drastically: she allegedly has suffered from spasms, eyes rolled up in their sockets (dystonia), 
severe motoric restlessness (akathisia), memory problems, compulsive actions, incontinence, 
psychoses, dry mouth, teeth damage, inflammation of the gums and gross weight gain, among 
others. Ms. E. H. A. may even have sustained brain damage due to the extensive use of 
neuroleptics and other psychoactive drugs. 
</p>
<p>452. After her mother publicly criticized her treatment, her visiting rights were restricted and 
eventually denied for more than one and a half years between 2006 and 2007, and again for one 
year in 2008. The father&#8217;s visiting rights have been severely restricted as well (see table below). 
Following a complaint, the Control Commission concluded on 26 September 2008 that the 
decision to deny the parents visits for one year was illegal, but that Ms. E. H. A. should remain 
under involuntary admission. 
</p>
<p>453. For their part, the Regional Supervisory Authorities (Helsetilsynet) concluded 
on 16 July 2008 that the hospital violated Ms. E. H. A.&#8217;s legal rights related to free and informed 
consent to health care and the right to participation. However, on 4 December 2008, the 
Stavanger University Hospital filed a complaint asking for the father to be replaced as a legal 
guardian. 
</p>
<p>454. An application for free legal assistance filed on 6 November 2008 on behalf of 
Ms. E. H. A. was rejected by the authorities (Fylkesmannen) on 11 December 2008. Her father&#8217;s </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 74 
 
</p>
<p>appeal against the decision was rejected on 30 January 2009. A further appeal was pending. The 
decision rejecting the application for legal aid states inter alia that, since the issue in question is 
not of such great significance for Ms. E. H. A.&#8217;s welfare and her parents, it would not be 
reasonable that the public treasury pay for free legal aid. 
</p>
<p>455. Due to a lack of sufficient legal advice the parents of Ms. E. H. A. were not aware of the 
possibility to challenge the decision of the Control Commission of 26 September 2008 before a 
court of law pursuant to chapter 7 of the Norwegian Mental Health Care Act and chapter 36 of 
the Civil Procedure Act. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>456. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Norway did not yet reply to this 
communication. She considers response to her communications as an important part of the 
cooperation of Governments with her mandate, and urges the Government to respond to the 
concerns raised. 
</p>
<p><b>Pakistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>457. On<b> 12 March 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture sent an urgent 
appeal to the Government regarding Ms. S. N. and her husband Mr. A. Y., in Lahore, Pakistan. 
</p>
<p>458. According to the information received, in July 2004, Mr. A. Y. was kidnapped and 
detained in Faisalabad by the &#8216;Bajwa gang&#8217;, whose head is M. B., and some police officers 
including B. N. H. are members of this gang. Upon receipt of 2.2 millions rupees he was 
released. A. Y. and S. N. complained to Superintendent K. A. about the kidnapping but he and 
other police officers arrested A. Y., illegally detained him and asked for 1.4 millions rupees. 
When they demanded an additional 5 millions rupees, his wife filed a writ at the Lahore High 
Court for her husband&#8217;s release, but to no avail. It is alleged that the Chief Justice of Lahore 
High Court is a close relative of SP K. A. Ms. S. N. also complained to the national 
accountability bureau, but Brigadier A.U. refused to register her case. All of Ms. S. N.&#8217;s 
properties were confiscated. Mr. A. Y. was finally released although the circumstances of his 
release are unclear. 
</p>
<p>459. In April 2005, Ms. S. N. went to the Parliament to make a complaint but was taken to jail. 
She was released on bail, and a few days later was kidnapped by four persons outside her house 
n Johar Town, Lahore. She was then taken to an unknown place and allegedly raped and 
ill treated by SP K. A. and Inspector J. C. in the presence of several other persons. 
</p>
<p>460. On 2 September 2005, Ms. S. N. recorded her statement before the inquiry committee 
Chief Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Z. A. Q., at the Office of the Human Rights Commission 
of Pakistan (HRCP). On that occasion, the victim presented some evidence, such as her clothes 
that the perpetrators had torn apart, several marks on her body and eye witnesses who saw her 
injured after she had been ill-treated. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 75 
 
</p>
<p>461. Subsequently, Ms. S. N.&#8217;s lawyer, A. J., filed a writ petition at the judicial tribunal in the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan, which ordered the police to register Ms. S. N.&#8217;s First Information 
Report. However, the police only registered it three months later and offered no protection to 
Ms. S. N. At that point, a judicial proceeding on the case began at the trial court. On 
17 October 2005, the Supreme Court ordered the immediate arrest of SP K. A., Inspector J. C. 
and eight other policemen on charges of abduction, torture and rape. Nonetheless, on 24 
November 2005, the district and sessions court in Lahore granted bail to the perpetrators. The 
victim&#8217;s lawyer, Ms. A. J., wrote many letters to the Government requesting protection for 
Ms. S. N., but no protection was made available and she and her children have been regularly 
ill-treated or attacked by SP K. A. and Inspector J. C. and by other members of the police. The 
same group of persons also prevented her from physically reaching the Court in January 2007 so 
that in March 2007 the case was dismissed. 
</p>
<p>462. On 7 May 2007, the victim was going to her lawyer&#8217;s office to prepare an appeal to be 
lodged at the High Court but in front of A. J.&#8217;s office some police officers, under the orders of 
Punjab Chief Minister P. E., kidnapped her again and kept her in an unknown location for 
approximately six months. 
</p>
<p>463. During that period, the victim was filmed naked and taken pictures of. She was also placed 
in a grave. Moreover, she was allegedly raped by SP K. A. and his two sons in law, MNA 
Federal Minister S. M. Gill and MPA Provincial Minister J. M.G., both close relatives of Punjab 
Chief Minister P. E. 
</p>
<p>464. Ms. S. N. was finally released and is currently in hiding. She fears being taken and 
ill-treated by the police if she tries to contact her lawyer again. 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>465. By letter dated <b>24 June 2008</b>, the Government replied to the letter sent on 12 March 2008. 
The Government informed that the husband of Ms. S. N., Mr. A. Y., was an employee of the 
Excise Department, and involved in the registration of stolen vehicles. He was suspected in a 
number of criminal cases and was taken into custody, more than one year ago, but escaped. He 
has been declared a fugitive. During the judicial inquiry, sufficient evidence was provided to 
show that Mr. A. Y. is still alive and was in contact with his wife, and a few other individuals, 
during the last year. The allegation that Ms. S. N.&#8217;s husband was killed was incorrect. 
</p>
<p>466. The Government also stated that Ms. S. N. filed a petition before the High Court, Lahore 
that was dismissed on 13 July 2005. Neither Ms. S. N. nor her husband ever appeared before any 
court or tribunal after levelling the allegations of atrocities and gang rape committed by police 
officials. Ms. S. N. regularly met with the process server on each hearing date of the tribunal but 
did not appear before it. 
</p>
<p>467. The government further stated although the media reported on 30 August 2005, that 
Ms. S. N. was abducted by the police in the first week of May 2005 and raped, she had never 
levelled such allegations during the hearing before the High Court, and these allegations were </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 76 
 
</p>
<p>never proven. The government further stated that the tribunal had recommended inter alia, the 
prosecution of Ms. S. N. on the ground that she published accusations without proof and thereby 
harmed the reputation of the accused, and Mr. A. K. should be subjected to disciplinary sanctions 
following the escape of Mr. A.Y. from police custody. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>468. On<b> 18 June 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding threats to the lives of 
Ms. Sr. and her husband Mr. M. A. J., residing in Qazi Ahmed Pura, District Nawabshah, 
Sindh province, Pakistan, and of Ms. Sm. and her husband Mr. B. Z., residing in Barrage colony, 
Rohri Sukkur District, Sindh province. 
</p>
<p>469. According to information received, Ms. Sr., a 26-year-old woman, had recently embraced 
Islam and married M.A. J. They married on their own accord, without any pressure or coercion. 
However, on 12 March 2008, Ms. Sr.&#8217;s father, Mr. K. L., lodged a First Information Report 
(N&#176; 31-2008) at Qazi Ahmed Police Station, accusing her husband of kidnapping her.  
</p>
<p>470. On 31 March 2008, the couple approached the Sindh High Court, requesting immediate 
action and seeking protection from honour killing, because Ms. Sr.&#8217;s parents had declared her 
and her husband <i>Karo-kari</i> and attempted to kill both of them. The couple has reportedly been 
harassed by the family and also by the Station House Officer of Qazi Ahmed Police Station.  
</p>
<p>471. A division bench of the Sindh High Court issued notices to the Station House Officer of 
Qazi Ahmed Police Station, and also to the investigation officer. The aim of those notices was to 
know the reasons why relevant authorities did not investigate the case.  
</p>
<p>472. Ms. Sm., a 22-year-old woman residing in Barrage colony, Rohri Sukkur District, Sindh 
province, had recently embraced Islam. She changed her name from Sd. to Sm. and married 
Mr. B. Z. Her father, Mr. B. L., lodged a complaint against both of them at the Rohri police 
station.  
</p>
<p>473. After receiving life threats from Ms. Sm.&#8217;s family, on 3 April 2008, the couple came to 
Justice Farrukh Zia Sukkur Bench to seek protection. Ms. Sm. declared that she had married 
Mr. B. Z. on her free will and that the allegations referring to abduction and rape were false and 
baseless. The Sindh High Court Sukkur Bench adjourned the hearing for unknown reasons. 
According to the information received, no decision had been made.  
</p>
<p>474. Threats to the lives of Ms. Sr. and her husband Mr. M. A. J., and of Ms. Sm. and her 
husband Mr. B. Z. should be placed in a context of a widespread practice of honour killings and 
<i>Karo-Kari</i> in Pakistan. According to sources, it is reported that honour killings, carried out for 
incidents that are perceived as dishonouring the family, such as marriage of choice, seeking 
divorce or other pretexts used to discard the woman in particular, have exceeded 300 victims 
in 2007.  
</p>
<p>475. The practice of <i>Karo-Kari</i>, which refers to punishment for adultery consists in killing a 
woman after having publicly humiliated her. Despite legislation passed in 2004 prohibiting 
these practices, <i>Karo-Kari</i> has allegedly resulted in the same number of victims as honour </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 77 
 
</p>
<p>killings in 2007. In particular, in the Sindh province, many <i>Karo-Kari </i>graveyards exist where 
unnamed women have been buried at night without having been given a proper burial ceremony.  
</p>
<p>476. Concerns were expressed for the immediate physical safety and security of Ms. Sr. and her 
husband Mr. M. A. J., and of Ms. Sm. and her husband Mr. B. Z. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>478. On<b> 3 July 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning the stoning to death of 
Ms. S., a 19-year-old woman from Deen Bahar Colony, Peshawar&#8217;s Mohmand Agency, in the 
Federally Administered Tribal Areas. 
</p>
<p>479. According to the information received, Ms. S., had allegedly eloped in early March 2008 
with Mr. D. K. M., who came from Bara. 
</p>
<p>480. On 15 March 2008, Dr. A., a spokesman of the Taliban militants, declared that Ms. S. was 
a married woman and that her family had lodged a complaint against Mr. D.K. for abduction. It 
was only learnt later that she had freely eloped with him. 
</p>
<p>481. Members of the Taliban movement reportedly captured the couple in Nowshera as the 
couple was coming back from Karachi. The Taliban members allegedly organized a <i>Qazi</i> Court 
(parallel judicial system) where the couple was found guilty of adultery. According to the 
information reported, Ms. S. and Mr. D. K. were sentenced to death by stoning. 
</p>
<p>482. The sentence was carried out on 2 April 2008 in Khwaezai-Baezai, 40 km west of the 
Mohmand Agency&#8217;s headquarters, Ghalanai. The dead body of Ms. S. was reportedly abandoned 
there and local people buried her. The body of Mr. D. K. was allegedly brought to the hospital 
and handed over to his family.  
</p>
<p>483. According to sources, this was the first incident of <i>Rajm</i> (stoning to death) reported in the 
Federally Administered Tribal Areas.

</p>
<p>486. Ms. S., a 30-year-old woman living in Bhai Khot, Manga Mundi District, Province of 
Lahore, married to Mr. A. and mother of four children, was allegedly suspected by her 
brother-in-law A. of having developed illicit relations with another man. On 2 April 2008, as her

According to the information received, there had been no arrest.  
</p>
<p>487. Ms. A., a 32-year-old woman living in Lower Dir, Timergara, District of Swat, North West 
Frontier Province, was married to M. K., of Malakand since four years. He was working abroad. 
Mr. S. M., A.&#8217;s father-in-law, suspected her of having developed illicit relations with a man. He 
reportedly gathered some people of the village to kill the couple and told these people that the 
couple had been caught red-handed. According to the information received, Ms. A. was shot to 
death on 6 April 2008. It was also reported that, according to the information received, no 
complaint had been lodged or arrests made in the case.  
</p>
<p>488. Ms. S., a 21-year-old woman living in Pirabad, in Karachi District, was allegedly killed by 
her brother W., her mother and her sister. This killing happened after she fell in love with M., an 
18-year-old boy who regularly came to her coaching centre. M.&#8217;s family refused the marriage 
with S. because she reportedly was an &#8220;outsider&#8221;. S. was sent to Punjab by her family but she 
returned after a few days and eloped with M. It was reported that she was caught and grounded 
by her family. According to the information received, on 8 April 2008, her brother, mother and 
sister killed her and attempted to make the incident look like a robbery. They told the police that 
people had shot her and stolen some money. When the Station House Officer R. K. arrived, the 
family reportedly changed their statement and said S. committed suicide. The police became 
suspicious because S. could not have shot herself with the gun in her left hand. According to the 
information received, no arrest was made.  
</p>
<p>489. Ms. Z., a 45 year old woman, belonging to the Mirani tribe, lived in Mai-Gari Goth, 
Karachi District, Karachi Province. She married Mr. M., who came from the Sheikh tribe. They 
lived in Karachi for several years, after which some Mirani tribesmen found them. According to 
the information received, the parents and their nine children were having tea when the tribesmen 
forcibly entered their house and had an argument with the couple on the basis of tribal 
differences. On 7 April 2008, they shot Ms. Z. and her husband. The elder son of the couple 
lodged a complaint at the Shah Latif police station. No arrest was made. 
</p>
<p>490. Ms. N., a 35 year old woman, living in Ichhara, Lahore district, Punjab province, was 
strangled by her husband, Mr. M. B., on suspicion of adultery, on 9 April 2008. The body was 
sent to the city morgue for autopsy, and the Ichhara police registered a case against Mr. B. 
However, according to the information received, no arrest was made. 
</p>
<p>491. Ms. S., a 23 year old woman residing in Nishatabad, Faisalabad district, Punjab province, 
had frequent quarrels with her father, Mr. W. A., because he suspected her of having an illicit 
relationship with a man. On 10 April 2008, the father shot his daughter in the head, killing her. 
An autopsy was performed. The victim&#8217;s uncle lodged a complaint against Mr. A. However, 
according to the information received, no arrest was made. 
</p>
<p>492. Ms. S., a 40 year old woman, living in the village of Chak, in the Multan district, Punjab 
province, was a widow with seven children. J. and three other people from the same village </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1

</p>
<p>alleged that she had an illicit relationship with a man. On 12 April 2008, she was on her way to 
the fields when J. and his three accomplices shot her and fled from the scene. A case was 
registered with the police but, according to the information received, no arrest was made. 
</p>
<p>493. Ms. H., a 19 year old woman, living in Gaggarwali, Satrah village, Sialkot district, Punjab 
province, eloped with a young man of the same village. Six months later, on 19 April 2008, she 
returned home. When her three cousins, N., A. and I. saw her, they shot her and she died on the 
spot. They escaped from the scene. Mr. M. B., the victim&#8217;s father, registered a murder case 
against the three culprits, who never came back to the village. According to the information 
received, no arrests were made.  
</p>
<p>494. Ms. I. K., a 28 year old woman, residing in Town Committee Mohalla, Shikarpur district, 
Sindh province, was killed with an axe by her brother Mr. J. S., in his house, on 21 April 2008. It 
is alleged that, later, he went to Sitam Mohalla and axed to death his relative Mr. M. S., allegedly 
under the custom of Karo-Kari. The Chak police has registered the case and started the 
investigation.  
</p>
<p>495. Ms. R., a 27 year old woman, residing in Soofiabad, Nishtar colony, Lahore district, 
Punjab province, was married to Mr. A. R. for two years. It is alleged that, on 21 April 2008, R. 
returned home in the evening and found his wife and his brother I. in an &#8220;objectionable 
position&#8221;. R. picked up his axe and killed both of them. Then he went to the police and 
surrendered with the murder weapon. The police registered a case against R.  
</p>
<p>496. These cases should be placed in the broader context of a widespread practice of honour 
killings and <i>Karo-Kari</i> in Pakistan. Honour killings, carried out for any incident that has 
dishonoured the family, such as marriage of choice, seeking a divorce or other pretext, is used to 
discard the woman being accused, and has reportedly resulted in more than 300 victims in 2007. 
The actual numbers are possibly much higher. The practice of <i>Karo-Kari</i>, which literally means 
&#8220;black man and black woman&#8221;, is a punishment for adultery which consists in killing the woman 
after having publicly humiliated her, and is becoming increasingly common. Despite legislation 
passed in 2004 prohibiting these practices, <i>Karo-Kari</i> has reportedly made as many victims as 
honour killings in 2007, and remains a common practice in the feudal and tribal based areas in 
particular. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>497. On <b>7 July 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning Ms. A., 30 year old 
woman, residing in Harbanspura, District of Lahore, Punjab province. 
498. According to the information received, Ms. A., was married to M. I. Ms. A. had two 
daughters, S. (3 years old) and S. (8 years old). It was known before the marriage that M. I. was 
a drug and alcohol addict. He often attacked Ms. A. verbally and physically. Four months ago, 
tired of this situation, Ms. A. filed a lawsuit for divorce (khula). However, Mr. I. reportedly 
threatened to kill her and their two daughters, and the case was withdrawn. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 80 
 
</p>
<p>499. On 8 April 2008, M. I. came back home late at night and allegedly drunk. He tied A. with 
ropes and electric wires. He cut her all over her body, especially her torso, and crushed her hair 
with bricks. Ms. A. begged him to leave her, to which he answered that he was teaching her &#8220;a 
lesson for going to court and for having illicit relations with lawyers and policemen&#8221;. He 
reportedly beat her and raped her several times in front of their two daughters. He poured alcohol 
on her cuts and bruises and left her screaming until she fainted.  
</p>
<p>500. On 9 April 2008, Mr. I. went to S. A.&#8217;s house and said he had killed his wife. The family 
went to Ms. A.&#8217;s house, but Mr. I. attacked them with bricks. With the help of the police, they 
found Ms. A. almost dead. Mr. I. was detained in custody at the Harbanspura police station. He 
denied the allegations that he had attacked his wife. A medico-legal certificate was finally issued 
by the hospital, after several interventions by the family. 
</p>
<p><b>Acknowledgment receipt 
</b></p>
<p>501. On <b>4 September 2008</b>, the Government of Pakistan acknowledged receipt of the 
communication. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>502. On <b>9 July 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, sent an allegation letter to the Government regarding the alleged acid attacks 
against Ms. Sh. (22 years old) and Ms. So. (18 years old), in Defence Housing Society, District 
of Lahore, Punjab Province, Pakistan. 
503. According to the information received, acid attacks are increasingly common in Pakistan. 
Thirty-three cases were recorded by a Pakistani organization in 2007, four of which involved 
victims who were minors. Despite a regulation imposed on the sale of corrosive acids in 2007, 
the substance is allegedly sold freely and widely, without verifying the identity cards of the 
buyers, despite the fact that is mandatory. The cause for this practice can be explained by the fact 
that an acid attack is a form of revenge, whereby the perpetrators, instead of committing murder 
and possibly being subject to prosecution, achieve a painful and long-lasting result at lower cost. 
The chief motives for acid attacks are: to avenge/restore honour; refusal of a marriage proposal 
or spurned sexual advances; and domestic or property disputes or interests. There is reportedly a 
lack of implementation of regulations and of accountability - which effectively condone and 
facilitate this crime. 
</p>
<p>504. It was reported that Ms. Sh. and her sister Ms. So. had been harassed by Mr. B., a 
neighbour, for the last couple of years. He wished to have sexual relations with them but they 
repeatedly refused. When Ms. Sh. got married, Mr. B. started harassing Ms. So. 
</p>
<p>505. On 16 April 2008, Ms. Sh. was visiting her parents in the city and was walking along with 
her sister when Mr. B. intercepted them on Defence Road. He threw acid in their faces. Both 
sisters had burn injuries as a result. Mr. B. fled from the scene. Some passers-by rushed the two 
sisters to a nearby hospital where they were reported as being in stable condition. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1

</p>
<p>506. Mr. M. N., investigation officer, reported that the police had raided Mr. B.&#8217;s house in the 
night of 17 April 2008, but he was not present. The police also investigated the homes of 
Mr. B.&#8217;s friends and raided his workplace, but did not find the culprit. A First Information 
Report (FIR) was registered. However, according to the information received, no arrest had yet 
been made. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>507. On <b>11 July 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, sent an allegation letter to the Government regarding the situation of three minor 
girls who have been married according to the custom of Vani weddings: Ms. S., a 7-year-old girl 
child living in Sukkur, District of Shikarpur, Pakistan; Ms. M., a 5 year old girl living in 
Makhan Bela, District of Rahim Yar Khan, Province of Punjab, Pakistan; and Ms. S., a 
10 year old girl, living in Basti Naiwala, District of Layyah, Province of Punjab, Pakistan. 
508. It was reported that Vani weddings (&#8220;child bride&#8221;, also called <i>Swara, Watta Satta</i> or<i> Sang 
Chati</i>) are a widespread practice in Pakistan, where about a third of all marriages in rural areas 
are carried out on this basis. The Vani wedding is a practice whereby Pakistani girls are 
exchanged between families in order to resolve a dispute. It is also reported that there is 
insufficient implementation by relevant authorities of laws that could provide some protection 
against such crimes, such as the Child Marriage Restraint Act (1929), which aims to &#8220;restrain the 
solemnization of child marriages&#8221;. Under this law, a marriage in which one of the parties is a 
child, either a male under 18 or a female under 16, is prohibited. 
</p>
<p>509. According to the information received, Ms. S., a 7-year-old girl child, was married to 
a 45-year-old man to settle a dispute between two families. The dispute reportedly erupted two 
years ago when S.&#8217;s uncle, A. H. C., was accused of having &#8220;an illicit relationship&#8221; with the wife 
of Mr. B. C. The dispute was settled by an influential feudal lord, who ordered Mr. H. C. to give 
Rs 25 000 and his niece S. to Mr. B. C. in compensation. 
</p>
<p>510. On the day of the wedding, the girl-child locked herself in a room and tried to commit 
suicide. She was saved by her family and forcefully married to Mr. B. C. According to the 
information received, the authorities had not taken any action.  
</p>
<p>511. M., a 5 year old girl, was married on 20 March 2008 to a six-year-old boy. This Vani 
wedding was ordered by a Panchayat (village council) to settle a dispute between the two 
families. 
</p>
<p>512. Five months earlier, P., M.&#8217;s brother, had been accused of having &#8220;illicit relationships&#8221; 
with his cousin, N. B., the wife of Mr. R. (of T. W.). The Panchayat was convened on 
18 March 2008 to settle the dispute. The council was led by M. A., a landlord from Mauza 
Islampur. Apparently, a few members suggested a fine to punish P., but M. A., A. W., A. D., 
N. A. and other members favoured the marriage of M., the sister of P., with the 6-year-old M., 
the son of Mr. R. 
</p>
<p>513. On 20 March 2008, Mr. H. B. S. performed the Vani wedding of M. with M. The family of 
P. was also imposed a fine of Rs 30 000 in favour of R. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 82 
 
</p>
<p>514. P. and his father, B. A., along with P.&#8217;s uncle, A. S., were against this marriage. However, 
after being detained for three days by the Abbadpur Police, they changed their statement. A. S., 
the uncle of P registered a case against the Panchayat (village council) for having decided to 
marry a 5-year-old girl. According to the information received, no action had yet been taken by 
the local authorities. 
</p>
<p>515. On 3 April 2008, Ms. S., a 10-year-old-girl, was married to a 13-year-old boy to settle a 
dispute between two families. The dispute began when the uncle of S., R., eloped with 
Ms. S. M., a neighbour. S.&#8217;s father, Q. B., filed a case against R. for kidnapping at the Sadar 
Police Station. R.&#8217;s elder brother, M. H., was arrested and the father, W. H., asked the 
Union Council (UC) N. R. N. S. to release his son M. The UC N. R. N.S. suggested organizing a 
Panchayat to settle the dispute. 
</p>
<p>516. The Panchayat was constituted of: N.R.N.S.; the former Mandi Town UC, N.N.M.A.S.; 
Z.H.L.; the spokesman I.A.T.; and M.M.A.T. They heard Ms. S. M., who said that she had 
married R. of her own will. The council proposed three solutions to W.H. to settle the dispute: he 
had to return Ms. S. M. to her father, Q. B., within 24 hours, give one-acre-agricultural land to 
Q., or give the hand of a girl of his family to the family of Q. B. 
</p>
<p>517. W. H. decided to give his 10-year-old grand-daughter S. to R., the 13-year-old son of Q., 
as he had no acre of land to give and had already married his only daughter. A. M., S.&#8217;s mother, 
left her house to protest against the Panchayat&#8217;s decision. A Vani wedding was arranged and the 
<i>Nikah (</i>marriage) solemnized in front of the Panchayat members.  
</p>
<p>518. As the girl was still a minor, no official<i> Nikah</i> document was written. The UC N. R. N. S. 
argued this was not a <i>Nikah </i>but rather a <i>Dua-i-Khair,</i> an informal ceremony whereby two 
children are pledged to one another -though this is not in the form of an official marriage and has 
no legal value. Allegedly, no action was taken by State authorities to investigate or address this 
case. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter

<p>519. On <b>29 July 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning sexual violence against 
women by private persons in Pakistan. While the Special Rapporteur recognized that State 
bodies have acted upon complaints brought to their attention in some of the cases mentioned, 
they were nonetheless brought to the Government&#8217;s attention as they are symptomatic of a 
widespread problem of sexual violence perpetrated by private persons against women. 
According to the information received:  
</p>
<p>520. On 1 April 2008, Ms. N., a 16 year old girl, residing in Najam colony, Dadu district, 
Interior Sindh province, was assaulted and gang raped at her home by four men. The four 
perpetrators were Ms. N.&#8217;s neighbours. Ms. N. was admitted at the Civil Hospital until her 
condition improved, after which she returned home. Ms. N.&#8217;s father lodged a complaint against 
the four culprits at the Dadu Town police station. Only one of the perpetrators was arrested, 
Mr. G. H. Allegedly, the police failed to arrest the three other culprits because one of them, 
Mr. M. J., is the brother of a police officer, Mr. G. L. </p>

</p>
<p>521. Ms. R., an 8 year old child, resident of Chah Qasaiwala, Karor Lal Essan, Layyah, Punjab 
province, was sexually assaulted and brutally treated by Mr. M. B. On 13 April 2008, the girl 
and her parents, Mr. Q. A. and his wife Ms. A.W., were invited to a neighbour&#8217;s place to attend a 
ceremony. The girl was playing with other children when Mr. M. B. took her and dispersed the 
other children. Some people arrived so the culprit ran away, and the victim was brought to the 
Tehsil Headquarters Hospital. Mr. Q. A., the victim&#8217;s father, lodged a complaint against 
Mr. M. B., after obtaining the medico-legal certificate from the hospital. The culprit escaped and, 
according to the information received, had not yet been arrested.  
</p>
<p>522. On 15 April 2008, Ms. R., a 10 year old girl living in Layyah village, Punjab province, did 
not return home after school. Her father, Mr. F., worried, was on his way to the school when he 
heard noise from his neighbour&#8217;s house. Mr. M. A., and Mr. F. gathered other neighbours and 
they entered the house, to find Mr. M. A. along with Mr. K. H. raping the girl-child. The culprits 
escaped and the girl was brought to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, where a medico-legal 
certificate was issued. The father lodged a complaint against the two men but, according to the 
information received, no arrest had been made. 
</p>
<p>523. Ms. N. A., an 18 year old woman, residing in Shah Latif Town, Landhi, Karachi district, 
Sindh province, was killed during a robbery. Three men came into her house on 17 April 2008, 
and they tried to rape N. A. But N. A. screamed and the intruders opened fire when N. A. tried to 
run away. She was killed on the spot. The police officers arrived (Mr. A. K. and C. S. A.) and 
shot one of the fleeing culprits. The two others escaped. The dead bodies of N. A. and of the 
culprit were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, where it was said that the woman 
had sustained a bullet wound to her head at close range. The victim&#8217;s father lodged a complaint 
(FIR n&#176; 182/08) at the Shah Latif police station. 
</p>
<p>524. Ms.<b> </b>S., a 28 year old woman, living in Druhar Wahin, Mailsi district, Punjab province, was 
waiting at a bus stop on 17 April 2008 when Mr. N. A. S., a landlord of the same village, came 
on a motorcycle and abducted her. She was brought to a place where an accomplice was present, 
Mr. T. A. S. They raped her the whole night. The day after, they threw her in front of her house, 
unconscious. The Miranpur police lodged a case and started an investigation. Allegedly, there 
had been no arrest. 
</p>
<p>525. Ms. N. M., a 30 year old woman, resident of Basti Naimat Ali, Multan, is the daughter of 
Mr. R. B. On 19 April 2008, seven people (G.. Q., M., M., A., S. and two other people) came to 
her house, stealing cell-phones, jewellery and a large sum of money. They took her to an 
unidentified place where she was gang-raped. She ultimately succeeded in fleeing. As the police 
was allegedly not ready to take legal action on this case, Ms. N. M. filed a petition with the court 
of Additional District and Session Judge M-M.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>526. On <b>18 August 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, sent an 
allegation letter to the Government concerning Ms. S. Y. and her sister Ms. A. Y. from the 
Christian minority community in Chak Sarwar Shaheed, district Muzaffargarh.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1

</p>
<p>527. According to the information received, on 26 June 2008, the two girls S.Y., thirteen years 
old, and A.Y., ten years old, were kidnapped while on their way to their uncle&#8217;s house in Chowk 
Munda. Reportedly, their kidnapper was Mr. M.A.B. who handed the girls over to Mr. F. S.G., 
who then organised a forced conversion to Islam and the marriage of his own son with Ms. S. Y.  
</p>
<p>528. The police refused the father&#8217;s request to file a case against the kidnappers. When the two 
sisters appeared in the Muzaffargarh District and Sessions court, they were given five minutes to 
testify that their conversion was genuine and Ms. S. Y. indicated that she was 17 years old. 
However, her parents were not allowed to submit birth certificates and school records to prove 
the girls&#8217; true ages or to provide evidence of the violation of the Child Marriage Restraint Act 
(1929), which bans child marriage for boys under 18 and girls under 16. On 14 July 2008, the 
Judge in Muzaffargarh ruled that since the two sisters had converted in a legitimate manner to 
Islam they could not be &#8220;handed over to their Christian parents unless they become Muslim, 
too&#8221;. On 6 August 2008, the Lahore High Court Multan Bench ordered a medical examination of 
Ms. S.Y. to ascertain her age and ruled to keep her and her sister A. in a house for destitute 
women until the next hearing on 20 August 2008. 
</p>
<p>529. It was further alleged that the abductors may have been recruiting young girls for the 
purpose of prostitution and sexual exploitation, and that the marriages were a pretence under 
which they gained control over the girls.  
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>530. By letter dated <b>15 October 2008</b>, the Government replied to the letter sent 
on 18 August 2008 regarding the alleged kidnapping, and forced religious conversion and 
marriage of Ms. S. Y. and her sister Ms. A. Z.  
</p>
<p>531. The Government stated that on 7 July 2008, Mr. Y. M., father of Ms. S. Y. and Ms. A. Y., 
filed a petition before District and Sessions Judge, K.A. concerning the abduction of his 
daughters by M. A., A. A. and A. 
</p>
<p>532. It stated that prior to the father&#8217;s petition, Ms. S. Y. and her sister Ms. A. Y. had filed a 
petition before District and Sessions Judge, K.A. on 28 June 2008 stating that: they embraced 
Islam; that their parents were harassing them; and that Ms. S. Y. had changed her name to F., 
claimed to be 17 years and had happily contracted marriage with A. A.. Ms. A. Y. also expressed 
preference to stay with her sister. In view of the statements and expressed desire of the two girls, 
the District and Sessions Judge passed the order that the girls could not be compelled to join their 
parents.  
</p>
<p>533. The Government said that after dismissal of their petition by the District and Sessions 
Judge, the mother of the two girls filed a writ petition before the Lahore High Court, Multan 
Bench. The Lahore High Court had sent the girls to &#8220;Darl Aman&#8221; and directed the local police to 
get them medically examined in order to determine their age. 
</p>
<p>534. The Government further added that based on an agreement between the two parties, the 
High Court later decided that custody of Ms. A. Y. could be given to her real mother/petitioner 
on the condition that the petitioner not interfere in her religious beliefs and practices. Ms. S. Y. 
was allowed to go with her husband A. A.  </p>

<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>535. On <b>8 September 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions<b> </b>sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning the killing of five 
women belonging to the Umrani tribe by burying them while still alive in Baba Kot, a village 
located 80 kilometers from Usta Mohammad City, Jafferabad district, Balochistan province. 
According to the information received:<b> 
</b></p>
<p>536. On 14 July 2008 Ms. F., 45 years old and wife of U.A. U.; J. B., 38 years old and wife of 
Q. K.; and three other persons aged between 16 and 18 years old, named F., H. and R., were in 
the house of Mr. C., at Baba Kot village, with the intention to leave for a civil court at Usta 
Mohammad, district Jafarabad, so that the three girls could marry the men of their choice. Their 
decision to be married in court was the result of several days of discussions with the elders of the 
tribe, who refused them permission to marry. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>537. As the news of their plans leaked out, Mr. A. S. U., the brother of a provincial minister 
Mr. S. U., accompanied by six men, abducted the five women at gun point. In a Land Cruiser 
jeep, bearing a registration number plate of the Balochistan government, they were taken to 
another area, Nau Abadi, in the vicinity of Baba Kot. After reaching the deserted area of 
Nau Abadi, A. S. U. and the six men took the three minors out of the jeep and beat them before 
allegedly opening fire with their guns, leaving them with very serious injuries. A. S. U. and his 
accomplices hurled them into a wide ditch and covered them with earth and stones. When the 
two older women tried to stop the burial of the minors, the attackers pushed them into the ditch 
as well and buried them all alive. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>538. The matter was debated in the Senate, the National Assembly of Pakistan and the 
Provincial Assembly of Sindh. In the Senate, Senator I.Z. tried to defend the burials stating that 
the killings were part of tribal traditions and that the incident should not be mentioned in the 
Upper House. According to information received, no action has been taken to conduct criminal 
investigations into the matter. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>539. On <b>8 September 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions<b> </b>sent an allegation letter<b> </b>concerning a continuing pattern of honour killings in Pakistan 
in which women are killed, usually by a family member, due to suspicions of sexual impropriety 
or because they have married outside their religion. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>540. According to the information received, on 28 January 2008, K. J. beat his wife H., as he 
allegedly often did, accusing her of a relationship with another man. During the quarrel, K. J. 
ordered his son, M. U. R. J., to kill H. Then K. J.&#8217;s cousin, Mr. H., loaded the rifle and gave it to 
M. U. R. J., telling him that his mother was &#8220;kari&#8221; (a black character). M. U. R. J. fired at his 
mother and killed her. H. Mr. K. J.&#8217;s daughter S. rushed into the room and M. U. R. J. shot her as 
well. K. J. told his neighbours that his wife was &#8220;kari,&#8221;, that S. had been supporting her, and that 
mother and daughter were killed in order to protect the honour and dignity of the K. J. family. <b> </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 86 
 
</p>
<p>541. On 30 January 2008, K. J. went to Karimdad Lund Police Station, Khaipur Nathan, and 
reported the matter to the police. M. J., another son of K. J., lodged a First Investigation Report 
(FIR) against his brother M. U. R. J. for the murder of his mother and sister. The police arrested 
M. U. R. J. and Mr. H., but not K. J. Mr. H. was subsequently released on bail, while M.U. R. J. 
remained in detention. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>542. In a related development, K. J., as the head of the J. family in the area, called a tribal 
assembly of elders (<i>jirga)</i> to obtain approval for sanctions against his brother-in-law, A. J., 
whom he accused of having sold his daughter H. in Karachi. The jirga decided that A. J. should 
be killed and all his business confiscated. A.J. escaped from an attack on his house and went into 
hiding, while K. J. took over his two shops and his house. A. J. has written several letters to the 
police and various authorities, including the Sindh provincial ministry of human rights, regarding 
protection for his family members and the &#8220;confiscation&#8221; of his business, but to date no action 
has reportedly been taken.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Acknowledgment receipt 
</b></p>
<p>543. On 11 <b>September 2008</b>, the Government of Pakistan acknowledged receipt of the 
communication. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>544. On <b>6 November 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions<b> </b>sent an allegation letter<b> </b>concerning a recent case of honour killing in Chack, 
Lucky Ghulam Shah, Jahnian, Shikarpur district, Sindh province.  
</p>
<p>545. According to the information received, Mr. S. D. J., a 62 year-old resident of Goth Allah 
Wasayo, Chack, Shikarpur district, Sindh province, killed his second wife in August 2008 on the 
ground that she allegedly had an illicit relationship with a man named S. J., Mr. S. D. J had 
already killed his first wife for similar reasons in 2001, but was never punished for the act.  
</p>
<p>546. During the same month of August, as a result of public protests following the killing of the 
wife of Mr. S. D. J., the police took him into custody, but released him after 15 days without 
pressing any charges.  
</p>
<p>547. On 20 October 2008, a local Jirga led by the chiefs of the Jatoi tribe, at Lucky Ghulam 
Shah, Shikarpur district, Sindh province decided that Mr. S. D. J. was a victim of dishonour, and 
therefore absolved him of the killing of his second wife. The Jirga also ordered Mr. Sh. J. to 
hand over 20 buffaloes, costing more than 100,000 rupees (around USD 1,400) each, as a fine 
for having an illicit relationship with S. D. J.&#8217;s second wife. Mr. Sh. J. was also ordered to 
compensate S. D. J. by handing over three daughters to him to be at his service. Since 
Mr. Sh. J.&#8217;s daughters were grown up and married, the Jirga decided that he should give his 
10 year old grand daughter, A., daughter of R. J., as well as the two grand daughters of his 
brothers, aged 13 and 11 years old.  </p>

<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>548. On <b>1 December</b> <b>2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders sent an urgent appeal<b> </b>regarding ongoing threats and harassment against the Peshawar 
branch of Shirkit Gah and the Strengthening Participatory Organization (SPO). Shirkit Gah is a 
non-governmental organization (NGO) based in Lahore, which works on women&#8217;s rights. The 
SPO is an NGO based in Dera Ismail Khan, which works on development and education. 
</p>
<p>549. According to information received, on 20 December 2007, an unknown man called the 
Peshawar office of Shirkit Gah, threatening that the office would face dire consequences if it 
were not closed. The NGO immediately informed the police. On 9 August 2008, an email, whose 
identity is known, from the extremist group Tehreeke Taliban, Pakistan, was sent to the 
Peshawar office of Shirkit Gah. The email ordered Shirkit Gah to close its office in Peshawar 
criticizing the NGO&#8217;s work on women&#8217;s rights issues and raising objections vis-&#224;-vis female 
employees not wearing their veils and thereby tempting people towards sinful activities. The 
message claimed that there were photographs and videos to support all of these accusations. The 
Peshawar office of Shirkit Gah was then threatened that, if it did not take action based on this 
email, loss of life and of property would ensue. Shirkit Gah was also warned not to share the 
message with Government officials.  
</p>
<p>550. On 4 November 2008, an email signed by Talib bai (Talib brother) was sent to Shirkit Gah 
stating that the NGO mobilized women to participate in processions and warning for the last time 
that the office would have to be closed. The email threatened that, if the office was not closed, 
the consequences would be alarming: the women working for Shirkit Gah would be kidnapped 
and killed.  
</p>
<p>551. On 8 November 2008, another email, signed by Faqat Talib Apko Sedha Rasta Dhekana y 
Wala (Talib - lead you to the right path), was sent stating that Shirkit Gah had not acted on 
previous warnings and had thereby shown no care for the lives of its members. The email 
explained that there would be no more chances for Shirkit Gah and that the office would be 
bombed. It blamed the Shirkit Gah for women divorcing and being able to approach the courts, 
claiming that there would be no pardon for the NGO and that it would have to face the 
consequences. 
</p>
<p>552. Meanwhile, in May 2007, the Dera Ismail Khan office of the SPO began to receive threats 
by phone and mail. On 30 October 2007, the staff hostel of the SPO in Battagram was bombed. 
Twelve staff members were injured, two of them critically. Office equipment worth 
approximately 292,000 rupees was destroyed and the damage to the rented building reportedly 
cost 500,000 rupees. First Information Report (FIR) 422 was lodged at Battagram police station 
on the same day. On 27 September 2008, the offices of the SPO were looted, resulting in a total 
loss of approximately 10 million rupees. FIR no. 549 was lodged at the Cantt police station on 
the same day. </p>

</b></p>
<p>553. On <b>1 December</b> <b>2008</b>, the Government of Pakistan acknowledged receipt of the 
communication. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>554. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Pakistan for its response to two 
communications sent on 12 March 2008 and 18 August 2008 respectively. However, she regrets 
that the Government did not reply to the remainder of the communications sent during the period 
under review. The Special Rapporteur reiterates her interest in receiving responses from the 
Government in regard to these allegations and would be particularly interested to know whether 
these cases have resulted in any prosecutions of alleged perpetrators and whether the victims 
have been granted reparation. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Papua New Guinea 
</b></p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>555. On <b>11 February 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning recent reports of 
sorcery-related killings of women in the highlands provinces of Papua New Guinea. According 
to the information received:  
</p>
<p>556. On 6 January 2009 a woman was stripped naked, gagged, tightly strapped and burned alive 
by a group of men at the Kerebug Dump in Mount Hagen. As of 27 January 2009, the identity of 
the victim was still unknown, and the Provincial police authorities were still investigating. The 
body was reportedly too badly burnt for identification purposes. 
</p>
<p>557. In addition, at least four other similar cases in the highlands area (two resulting in deaths of 
women, one in which a female victim was tortured but survived, and the killing and burning of a 
father and son in Ban village on 8 February 2009) were also reported to the Special Rapporteurs 
after the killing in Mount Hagen on 6 January 2009. Provincial police commanders in two 
highlands provinces, Eastern Highlands and Chimbu, reportedly told journalists that there were 
more than 50 sorcery-related killings in their provinces in 2008. Other independent sources have 
estimated that there have been up to 500 attacks against women accused of practicing witchcraft 
that have resulted in torture and murder. 
</p>
<p>558. The police are reportedly often unable to enforce the law and stop mob killings. In the case 
of the killing and burning of a father and son suspected of sorcery in Ban village on 
8 February 2009, the police were able to visit the crime scene and confirm their deaths, but 
heavily armed locals prevented them from removing the bodies to hospital for autopsies.<b> </b></p>

</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>559. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Papua New Guinea did not reply to 
this communication, and reiterates her interest in receiving responses in regard to the allegations 
submitted. 
</p>
<p><b>People&#8217;s Republic of China 
</b></p>
<p><b>Response from the Government to a communication sent in 2007 
</b></p>
<p>560. On <b>5 November 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning 
Ms. M. H., a reproductive and housing rights activist. Ms. M. H<b>.</b>, had already been the subject of 
previously transmitted communications. 
</p>
<p>561.  According to the information received, on 13 September 2007 prison authorities ordered a 
fellow inmate to beat Ms. M. H., as punishment for revealing that she had been held in solitary 
confinement for a period of 70 days, in violation of the Chinese Prison Law. As a result of the 
beatings, she was badly bruised. On 24 September 2007, prison authorities allegedly sent 
Ms. M. H. to the Nahui Prison Hospital, where her clothes were removed and she was tied to a 
bed where she was force-fed by other inmates. Also, Ms. M. H.&#8217;s husband, Mr. W. X., was 
allegedly prevented from visiting her at the Shanghai Women&#8217;s Prison until 26 October 2007. 
</p>
<p>562. The full details of the allegations submitted were already reflected in the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s previous report on communications sent and received.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>563. By a letter dated <b>15 January 2008</b>, the Government of China responded to the 
communication sent 5 November 2007. It stated that after being taken into custody, Ms. M. H. 
was placed in a cell with two other offenders and was not placed in solitary confinement. The 
Government also asserted that Ms. M. H. has never been beaten by any other female prisoner, 
nor has she been in any fights with other women inmates or suffered any &#8220;cuts and bruises&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>564. The Government of China stated that the results of the physical examinations carried out 
upon Ms. M. H.&#8217;s admission to the detention facility demonstrated that she suffered from high 
blood pressure, but other indications were normal. After undergoing treatment for her condition 
at the hospital, her blood pressure returned to normal. Moreover, it was stated that her most 
recent full medical examination was carried out by the hospital in early December 2007. While 
undergoing treatment, Ms. M. H. was never subjected to any forced medication and that 
allegations in this respect were not supported by the facts. 
</p>
<p> Finally, the Government noted that Ms. M. H. enjoyed her rights on the same footing as 
other prisoners. It added that, since her admission to the detention facility, she had received 
monthly visits from family members, including her husband and daughter. The Government also 
stated that Ms. M. H. had submitted no written complaints, nor had she sought meetings with her 
lawyers.

<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>565. On <b>7 May 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Mandate of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding Ms. J. K., 
a well-known Tibetan writer and musician. Ms. J. K., aged 42, is an internet writer and has 
published articles on women's issues in Tibet. 
</p>
<p>566. According to information received, on 1 April 2008, Ms. J. K. was taken away by 
plainclothed state security officers from her office at the Qinghai Provincial Television Station in 
Xining City. Ms. J. K. was initially held at the Xining City Public Security Office, but on 
4 or 5 April 2008 she was taken to an undisclosed location. No formal charges against her have 
been made public.  
</p>
<p>567. Ms. J. K.<b> </b>kept in contact with her family via mobile phone until 7 April 2008. Since then 
her phone has been turned off. During two searches of her home, police officers are reported to 
have confiscated her personal computer and other personal items. 
</p>
<p>568. Concerns were expressed that the detention of Ms<b>. </b>J. K.<b> </b>might have been solely connected 
to the exercise of her right to freedom of opinion and expression. In view of the reported 
incommunicado detention of Ms<b>. </b>J. K.<b> </b>at an unknown place of detention, further concerns were 
expressed that Ms. J. K.<b> </b>might be at risk of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>569. By letter dated 7 August 2008, the Government replied to the communication sent 
on 7 May 2008. However, at the time this report was completed, the translation of this reply by 
the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China had not yet been finalised. <b>

<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>570. On <b>23 May 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and 
the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression sent an allegation letter 
to the Government concerning the case of Ms. Y. W., wife of Mr. C. G., a well-known human 
rights lawyer who had denounced alleged violations linked to China's one-child policy, including 
forced sterilizations and abortions. 
</p>
<p>571. According to information received, on 24 August 2006, after allegedly taking legal action 
against Linyi city authorities for their practice of forced abortions, Mr. C. G. was sentenced to 
four years and three months imprisonment for &#8220;organising a mob to disrupt traffic.&#8221; Ms. Y. W. 
had been working together with her husband in gathering evidence in the case against the Linyi 
city authorities and was publicly opposing his imprisonment. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 91 
 
</p>
<p>572. Mr. C. G. had already been the subject of six previous communications to the Government 
of China sent by several mandate-holders on: 27 June 2006; 14 July 2006; 7 April 2006; 
31 October 2005; 19 September 2005; and on 21 December 2006.  
</p>
<p>573. According to the new information received, on 14 May 2008, the Beijing Municipal 
Chaoyang District People&#8217;s Court upheld an administrative travel ban against Ms. Y. W. issued 
in August 2007 by the Beijing General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection. The ruling 
followed a lawsuit filed by Ms. Y. W. to challenge the administrative decision. The court closed 
the hearing on grounds that the case involved State secrets. Ms. Y. W. was reportedly unable to 
attend the hearing because she was confined to her home in the city of Linyi by local authorities. 
</p>
<p>574. The administrative decision barred Ms. Y. W. from travelling to the Philippines to receive 
the 2007 Ramon Magsayay Award for Emergent Leadership on behalf of her husband in 
August 2007. On 24 August 2007, she was intercepted by police at the Beijing International 
Airport, her passport revoked, and she was reportedly beaten and forced to return to her home. 
</p>
<p>575. Ms. Y. W. has reportedly been subject to repeated acts of harassment by the authorities 
following the arrest of her husband and was kept under residential surveillance by the police. She 
was reportedly brought in by police for questioning several times. According to the information 
received, she had not been allowed to visit her husband for eight months. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>576. Concern was expressed that the reported harassment against Ms. Y. W. and the decision of 
the Beijing Municipal Chaoyang District People&#8217;s Court to uphold the travel ban may be aimed 
at sanctioning Ms. Y. W. and Mr. C. G. for their non-violent activities in defence of human 
rights.<b>

<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>577. By letter dated 7 July 2008, the Government replied to the communication sent

<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>578. On <b>17 July 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
concerning Ms. M. H., a reproductive and housing rights activist who has petitioned against 
family planning policies and forced evictions since 1989. She had been the subject of six 
previous communications from various mandate-holders, most recently on 5 November 2007.

<p>579. The Special Rapporteur acknowledged receipt of the response from the Government 
dated 15 January 2008, concerning the communication sent on 5 November 2007. 
</p>
<p>580. According to new information received, on 3 June 2008 Ms. M. H. was taken to a prison 
hospital against her will. She was stripped naked by twelve female prisoners chosen by prison 
authorities, tied to a bed and left there until she was returned to Shanghai Women&#8217;s Prison on 
16 June 2008. She was injected with twelve kinds of unknown medication which reportedly gave </p>

</p>
<p>her headaches and burning pains. Blood was extracted from her against her will. In her struggle 
to stop this from happening she lost a large amount of blood. Despite temperatures being very 
high she was covered with a blanket and her mouth and nose were at times covered with clothes 
to stop her from breathing. She was beaten and had her breast, mouth and genitals pinched by 
prisoners and guards. During her time in the prison hospital she was not allowed to wash. After 
she returned to Shanghai Women&#8217;s Prison, a shutter was put up on the only window in her cell to 
block out light. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>581. Concerns were expressed that the arrest and ill-treatment of Ms. M. H. in detention may be 
directly related to her peaceful work in the defence of human rights in China, and may form part 
of an ongoing campaign against human rights defenders in the country. Further concerns were 
expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. M. H. while she remains in 
detention.<b>

<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>582. By letter dated 02 September 2008, the Government replied to the communication sent 
on 17 July 2008. However, at the time this report was completed, the translation of this reply by 
the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China had not yet been finalised. <b>

<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>583. On <b>12 August 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Mandate of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention sent an 
urgent appeal to the Government regarding the case of Ms. Z. J., a Beijing-based human rights 
activist and wife of Mr H. J., an HIV/AIDS activist, co-founder and former director of the 
Beijing Aizhixing Institute for Health Education. Mr H. J. had been the subject of 
communications sent by several mandate holders following his detention on 27 December 2007, 
his sentencing on 3 April 2008 to three years and six months&#8217; imprisonment and one year of 
deprivation of political rights for &#8220;inciting subversion of state power&#8221;, and the denial of legal 
representation, preventing him from discussing the details of a possible appeal.  
</p>
<p>584. The Special Rapporteur acknowledged receipt of the responses of the Government to these 
communications. 
</p>
<p>585. According to the new information received, Ms. Z. J. had reportedly not been seen 
since 7 August 2008, on the eve of the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, and all 
attempts to contact her had failed. It was believed that she had been forcibly taken into custody 
at an unknown location outside the capital by police officers to prevent her from raising concern 
on the case of her husband, Mr H. J., during the Games. 
</p>
<p>586. For two years, Ms. Z. J. had been under intermittent residential surveillance by police from 
the National Security Unit under the Beijing Public Security Bureau. Following the arrest and 
detention of her husband in December 2007, this residential surveillance was tightened. 
</p>
<p>587. Concern was expressed that the reported detention of Ms. Z. J. at an unknown location may 
be linked to her non-violent work in campaigning for the release of her husband. Further concern 
was expressed for her physical and psychological integrity. </p>

<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>590. On<b> 21 February 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, 
the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding Ms. S. C., Ms. K. E. and Mr. M. M. 
</p>
<p>591.  Ms. S. C. is a community organiser with the youth group Anakbayan and works in a 
voluntary capacity for Alyansa ng Magbubukid sa Bulacan (Alliance of Peasants in Bulacan - 
AMB), an organization dedicated to the promotion and protection of peasant rights based in 
Central Luzon. Ms. K. E. is a member of the League of Filipino Students (LFS) and Mr. M. M. 
was a local peasant and a member of the Alyansa ng Magbubukid sa Bulacan. All three 
individuals were the subject of a previous urgent appeal sent on 5 October 2007. 
</p><p>592. According to the allegations received, at the time of the appeal, Ms. S. C. and Ms. K. E. 
were in detention at the Camp Tecson barracks in San Miguel, Bulacan. Ms. S.C., in addition to 
being forced to do the laundry for the camp every day, was sexually assaulted by soldiers named 
M., B., and D. D., a.k.a. Master Sgt. D. C., who is a suspect in the killing of human rights 
defender and community leader, E. G., in April 2003, and is believed to be identifiable by the 
tattoo &#8220;24th IB&#8221; on his shoulder. 
</p>
<p>593. Previously Mr. M. M., Ms. S. C. and Ms. K. E. had been held at the 24th Infantry Battalion 
(IB) camp in Limay, Bataan, where Ms. S. C. was tied to a bench while her feet were raised and 
soldiers poured water over her and electrocuted her. When Ms. S. C. admitted that Ms. K. E. had 
helped her to write a letter to her mother-in-law, the latter was taken outside by soldiers and 
witnesses report hearing her cries. The following day, the witnesses heard the soldiers recount 
that they had raped her with wooden sticks.  
</p>
<p>594. Ms. S. C. and Ms. K. E. were not seen again after June 2007. On 21 November 2007, 
Ms. S. C.&#8217;s mother-in-law testified to receiving death threats from soldiers visiting her home and 
interrogating her.  
</p>
<p>595. Mr. M. M. was killed, reportedly following the order issued by Retired Major General J. 
that Mr. M. M. be burned to death. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 94 
 
</p>
<p>596. In view of the above allegations, grave concern is expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Ms. S. C. and Ms. K. E. Furthermore, concern is expressed that the 
kidnapping and detention of Ms. S. C., Ms. K. E., and Mr. M. M. may have been directly related 
to their activities in defence of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>Acknowledgement receipt  
</b></p>
<p>597. By letter dated 26 February 2008, the Government acknowledged receipt of the urgent 
appeal sent 21 February 2008, and stated that the communication had been forwarded to the 
appropriate authorities in Manila. The letter further stated that information regarding to the case 
would be made available to the Special Rapporteur once received by the Permanent Mission.

Mme T. K., membre de la SOFEPADI et proche collaboratrice de Mme J. L. 
</p>
<p>600. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, dans la nuit du 5 au 6 avril 2008, le domicile de Mme J. L., 
situ&#233; &#224; Bunia, aurait fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;une attaque par des miliciens arm&#233;s qui, de toute &#233;vidence, 
recherchaient Mme J. L. Vers minuit, ces derniers se seraient introduits dans la cour en poussant 
la porte de la cl&#244;ture, puis auraient tent&#233; de forcer la porte de la maison. Ils auraient menac&#233; 
&#171; d&#8217;exterminer Mme J. L. et sa famille &#187; et de tuer les personnes qu&#8217;ils supposaient &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;rieur 
de la maison, si la porte ne leur &#233;tait pas ouverte. Seul, un jeune gar&#231;on, charg&#233; de garder la 
maison en l&#8217;absence de Mme J. L. et de sa famille, aurait &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent. En entendant les menaces 
prof&#233;r&#233;es par les miliciens, il se serait cach&#233;. Les miliciens seraient rest&#233;s de minuit &#224; 5 heures du 
matin autour de la maison. Certains d&#8217;entre eux auraient menac&#233; de tirer sur la maison, mais 
d&#8217;autres les auraient persuad&#233;s de renoncer, de crainte que les coups de feu n&#8217;attirent l&#8217;attention 
du voisinage et notamment des policiers, la maison &#233;tant situ&#233;e non loin d&#8217;un poste de police.

</p><p>602. Par un courrier en date du 1er avril 2008, l&#8217;association SOFEPADI aurait alert&#233; le maire 
afin de lui demander que des mesures de s&#233;curit&#233; soient prises afin de prot&#233;ger Mme J. L. ainsi 
que les autres membres de l&#8217;association. Le 3 avril 2008, l&#8217;Agence Nationale de Renseignements 
(l&#8217;ANR) aurait entendu Mme T. K. sur proc&#232;s verbal. Cependant, les agents de l&#8217;ANR 
demanderaient des coupons de recharge t&#233;l&#233;phonique pour entamer leurs investigations. Hormis

</b></p>
<p>605. <b>On 07 April 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning the case of F. A.-T. and 
M., which had been previously discussed with representatives of the Government in the context 
of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to Saudi Arabia earlier that year.  
</p>
<p>606. According to available information, F. A.-T., a Saudi national, was allegedly forcibly 
divorced from her husband M., also a Saudi national, by a court in 2005 at the request of her half 
brothers, because of the &#8220;husband&#8217;s low tribal background&#8221;. A judgment was allegedly 
pronounced even though the couple had been married with the consent of F. A.-T&#8217;s father for a 
number of years and had two children. While F. A.-T was living in an official institution in 
Dammam with the couple&#8217;s son, M. was residing in Riyad with their daughter. On 
8 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur had previously sent a communication to the 
Government inquiring about the case.<b>7</b>  
</p>
<p>607. During her visit to Saudi Arabia in February 2008, representatives of the Government 
informed the Special Rapporteur that procedures were in progress to reunite the family and 
assured her that the matter would be resolved soon.

<p>608. However, according to information received subsequently, the situation appeared to remain 
unchanged and Ms. F. A.-T. had undertaken a hunger strike on 24 May 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>609. On <b>22 August 2008</b>, the Government replied to the letter sent on 7 April 2008. The 
Government informed that F. A.-T was not on hunger strike and living a normal life in a shelter 
where she was able to communicate with anyone wishing to contact her. It further stated that her 
case was being considered by a competent court.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>610. On <b>19 March 2009</b> the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal to the Government of Saudi Arabia concerning: 
Ms. K.M.S. aged 75 and a Syrian national; Mr. F. aged 24; and Mr. H., the latter two citizens of 
Saudi Arabia.  
</p>
<p>611. According to the allegations received, on 21 April 2008, the Mutawa&#8217;een arrested the three 
above mentioned individuals because Ms. K.M.S. was alone in the company of a member of the 
opposite sex who was not a close relative. Subsequently, on 3 March 2009, Ms. K.M.S. and 
Mr. F were sentenced to 40 lashes and a four month term by a court in al-Shamli, while Mr. H. 
was sentenced to 60 lashes and a six month prison term. 
</p>
<p>612. With regard to the sentences to corporal punishment, concern was expressed for the 
physical integrity of the three persons, with particular attention to the advanced age of 
Ms. K.M.S. and the grave consequences that such a punishment could have on her health and 
well being. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

</p>
<p>614. The Special Rapporteur conducted an official country visit to Saudi Arabia in 
February 2008 and met with the couple separately.

</b></p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>616. On<b> 06 November 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Independent Expert appointed by the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights in Somalia, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning 
Ms. A. I. D., aged 13. 
</p>
<p>617. According to the information received, Ms. A. I. D. was found guilty of adultery, an act 
considered against Islamic law, by the Kismayo Sharia court, and sentenced to death by stoning. 
On 27 October 2008, on one of the main squares of Kismayo, she had her hands and feet tied 
together, was then buried up to her neck and stoned to death by around 50 men, while thousands 
of persons watched. She was pulled out three times to see whether she was dead. When a relative 
and others ran towards her, guards opened fire, killing a child. Since then, Islamist leaders have 
promised to punish the guard who shot the child.  
</p>
<p>618. Allegedly, the accusation of adultery against Ms. A. I. D. was fabricated because she had 
attempted to report to the al-Shabab militia controlling Kismayo that she had been raped by three 
men. None of the men she accused of rape were arrested. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>619. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Somalia did not reply to this 
communication. She considers response to her communications as an important part of the 
cooperation of Governments with her mandate, and urges the Government to respond to the 
concerns raised by her.

<p>620. On<b> 05 August 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning Ms. N. W. K., victim of 
rape. 
</p>
<p>621. According to information received, on 20 June 2008, Ms. N. W. K., a 20-year old female 
tea trader of the Nuer ethnic group, was raped by two soldiers from the<b> </b>Sudan People's 
Liberation Army<b> </b>in Nassir County, Upper Nile State. At the end of June 2008, the Nassir 
Customary Court sentenced one of the rapists to one year of imprisonment and a fine of seven 
cows, while the other perpetrator received a sentence of nine months of imprisonment and a fine 
of seven cows. The victim had filed an appeal against the judgment with the First County Judge 
in Malakal. 
</p>
<p>622. Concern was expressed that the Nassir Customary Court exceeded its jurisdiction 
by adjudicating the case. The Supreme Court of South Sudan had not issued a warrant of </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 98 
 
</p>
<p>establishment that would give the Customary Court jurisdiction over serious crimes such as rape. 
Moreover, the lenient sentences fail to take into account the severe physical and psychological 
injuries caused by rape and fall short of the maximum penalty for rape foreseen by Article 317 of 
the New Sudan Penal Code (14 years of imprisonment and a fine). 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>623. On<b> 22 August 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning the arrest and detention of a group of 
Ugandan women. 
</p>
<p>624. According to the information received, on 23 June 2008, a Criminal Investigation 
Department Officer (CID) accompanied by two Southern Sudan Police Service (SSPS) officers 
arrested five Ugandan female traders at a Ugandan Bar in Malakal (Upper Nile State) and took 
them for interrogation at the Malakal Police Station. Six other Ugandan women were arrested in 
another bar in Malakal. At the time of the arrest, none of the eleven women were informed about 
the reasons for their arrest. 
</p>
<p>625. The eleven Ugandan women were detained at the Malakal police station and only released 
later the same day. While in detention, the women were severely beaten by CID and SSPS 
officers and suffered visible physical injuries, which were seen by UNMIS Human Rights 
Officers. Police officers accused the women of engaging in prostitution, while at the same time 
allegedly trying to force them to have sex with the officers. Before their release, the women were 
threatened and warned not to report this incident to anybody. 
</p>
<p>626. The Director of the CID in Malakal told UNMIS Human Rights officers that the eleven 
women had been arrested, because they were reportedly engaging in immoral activities. He 
denied allegations that police officers had physically abused the women in the process of 
interrogation or tried to force them to have sex with them.  
</p>
<p>627. The allegation letter also refers to the alleged gang rape of four Ugandan nationals, 
namely, Ms. A. N. (40 years old), Ms. I. U. (21 years old), Ms. A. B. (19 years old), Ms. S. L. 
(40 years old), by Southern Sudan Police Service (SSPS) officers in Bor, Jonglei State. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>628. On<b> 7 October 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing (as a component of the 
right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context), the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent an 
allegation letter regarding attacks against the civilian population of the villages of Logurony and 
Iloli in Eastern Equatoria State by the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army (SPLA), which resulted 
in the killing and beating of civilians, the rape of women and the destruction of dwellings and 
livelihoods on 4 June 2008 and in the following days.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 99 
 
</p>
<p>629. According to the information received, on 4 June 2008, SPLA forces surrounded 
Logurony. While it was still completely dark, they started shooting, at first aiming in the air. The 
villagers, who were on high alert due to an expected attack from Iloli, returned fire. Only when it 
became light, did they realize that they had killed SPLA soldiers. Fearing retaliation by the 
SPLA, they fled into the bush. SPLA soldiers shot at Logurony villagers, reportedly killing four. 
They also started burning down the village, killing three elderly people.  
</p>
<p>630. Also on 4 June 2008, SPLA forces (reportedly counting 300 men) surrounded Iloli, took 
the inhabitants outside the village and then started burning down the village, killing one woman, 
A. E. The SPLA also arrested five men and tied their hands behind their backs. The SPLA 
Operational Commander came to Iloli and allegedly ordered the soldiers to execute those 
arrested. Three men were executed on the spot in front of the remaining village community, 
while one was injured but managed to escape. The fifth man was beaten by the soldiers and 
chased away. The population started running towards the bush. The SPLA opened fire on them, 
injuring another man. On 9 June 2008, the bodies of two children, aged 5 and 6 (R. J. and O. L.), 
were found in the bush surrounding the village. Iloli village was burned to the ground. 
</p>
<p>631. Soldiers gathered the remaining Iloli and Logurony villagers, approximately one thousand 
persons, and brought them to the SPLA barracks in Ramshel. There they spent the remainder of 
the day under the trees. Women were reportedly beaten with sticks. Many women were raped by 
SPLA soldiers at the SPLA barracks in Ramshel on 4 June, some of them in front of their 
children. The raped women include M. E. and A. T. as well as K. O. The mortal remains of 
K. O., who suffered from epilepsy, were later found in the bush. In the evening of 4 June 2008, 
the villagers held at the SPLA barracks were released, apparently on orders of the Torit County 
Commissioner.  
</p>
<p>632. Twelve male villagers, five from Logurony and seven from Iloli, however remained in 
SPLA detention until 7 June 2008 (one of them seven days longer). All were beaten on their 
head and stomach with gun barrels and other wooden and iron objects. Two Logurony detainees 
sustained severe head injuries, while another had whipping marks on his buttocks. These men 
did not report the ill-treatment to the police as they feared re-arrest by the SPLA.  
</p>
<p>633. On 10 June 2008, a young man from Hiyala was arrested on suspicion of involvement in 
the shooting that led to the death of SPLA soldiers. He was taken to the SPLA barracks and 
severely beaten. He was released following a meeting between the Hiyala Head Chief and the 
SPLA, and had to be taken to Hiyala Hospital for medical treatment.

<p>634. SPLA retaliation against the civilian population of Logurony, Iloli and Hiyala continued in 
the days following 4 June 2008. On 6 June 2008, SPLA men shot at Hiyala villagers who were 
working in the field. A man and a woman were killed (O. S. and O. S.), another woman injured. 
On 7 June 2008, O. A., a man from Iloli who had returned to the village, was apprehended by 
SPLA soldiers, tied up and executed on the spot. On 10 June 2008, O. O. E. and O. O., two 
Logurony villagers, were found shot dead near the Hiyala village square.  
</p>
<p>635. Government representatives from Eastern Equatoria State visited the area and submitted 
reports to both the President and Vice-President of the Government of Southern Sudan. In the 
immediate aftermath of the incidents, the Eastern Equatoria State authorities and the Ministry of </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 100 
 
</p>
<p>SPLA Affairs announced that a high-level committee would be investigating the incidents, but 
four months later the members of the inquiry had not been appointed, nor any other steps taken. 
The Eastern Equatoria State Government and the Torit County Commissioner took part in peace 
and reconciliation efforts between the two villages. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>636. On<b> 17 February 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding its decision on 5 February 2009, to remove article 13, which would ban 
female genital mutilation as part of customs and traditions harmful to the health of the child, 
from the proposed draft of the Children&#8217;s Act. 
</p>
<p>637. According to the allegations received, the Government took its decision pursuant to an 
advisory opinion of the Islamic Fiqh Academy, which distinguished between infibulation 
(&#8220;Pharaonic&#8221; circumcision), considered harmful by them, and the circumcision of &#8216;sunna&#8217;, a less 
intrusive procedure. The Government reportedly decided that the law should allow for the 
&#8216;sunna&#8217; practice, and prohibit infibulation with its introduction in the Penal Code, which was 
also under preparation/revision. 
</p>
<p>638. While the Rapporteurs welcomed in principle, the draft Children&#8217;s Act, which represents 
an important step forward in the protection of children&#8217;s rights, they expressed their deep 
concern following the decision of the Council of Ministers not to proceed with the complete 
criminalization of the practice of female genital mutilation - cutting (FGM/C), and for making a 
distinction between several forms of FGM. The Rapporteurs noted that in their view, this 
decision constituted a setback following the recent efforts of the Government of Sudan to tackle 
this harmful practice through a series of measures, including the adoption of a national strategy 
to abandon the practice of FGM/C.  
</p>
<p>639. The Rapporteurs expressed their concern that instead of contributing to a gradual ending of 
these harmful practices, the legalization of &#8216;sunna&#8217; practice could open the door for maintaining 
other forms of FGM/C and also render more difficult legal efforts to eradicate FGM/C 
altogether. Information was received that internally displaced persons from South Sudan to 
North Sudan have, for instance, started practicing genital mutilation, and that the custom has 
gradually spread to various ethnic groups in other parts of the country. 
</p>
<p>640. Women and girls can suffer long term heath consequences following FGM/C depending on 
the type and severity of the procedure performed. Recognized gynaecologist and obstetricians 
indicated that the &#8216;sunna&#8217; practice constitutes amputation of parts of the child&#8217;s genital organs 
which would result in the same health hazards as other types of circumcision. Short-term 
difficulties include severe pain, shock, haemorrhage, urine retention, ulceration of the genital 
region, and injury to adjacent tissue. Haemorrhage and infection can cause death. Long-term 
consequences include: psychological trauma; a feeling of incompleteness, anxiety and 
depression; difficulties during childbirth; cysts and abscesses; keloid scar formation; damage to 
the urethra resulting in urinary incontinence; painful sexual intercourse; and sexual dysfunction.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 101 
 
</p>
<p>641. In addition, despite the commonness of FGM/C, health providers (traditional and modern) 
and the women themselves are often poorly equipped to handle the resulting complications, 
especially those associated with pregnancy, and the physical and psychological sexual 
dysfunctions.  
</p>
<p>642. The Rapporteurs urged the Government to reconsider its decision to remove article 13 of 
its draft Children&#8217;s Act, and to criminalize all forms of female genital mutilation in both the 
Children&#8217;s Act and its Criminal Code.  
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>643. On 24 March 2009, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations 
related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, the Special Rapporteur on adequate 
housing, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the right to education, the Special Rapporteur 
on the right to food, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the 
Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard 
of physical and mental health, sent an urgent appeal to the Government of Sudan regarding the 
revocation of the licenses of 16 non-governmental organisations working in the region of Darfur, 
in Northern Sudan and in the Transitional Areas.  
</p>
<p>644. Concern was expressed that such a decision would have devastating consequences on the 
human rights of 4.7 million people affected by the conflict, particularly in the sectors of food, 
health, water, sanitation, adequate housing and education. Of this population, 2.7 million 
concerned internally displaced persons living in camps across the country. According to the 
information received:  
</p>
<p>645. On 5 March 2009, following the issuance of an arrest warrant against President Omar 
Bashir by the International Criminal Court, it was announced that the operations related to 
humanitarian assistance and human rights work of these organisations were suspended. These 
organisations included 13 international non-governmental organisations, namely Action contre la 
Faim, Solidarit&#233;s, Save the Children UK and Save the Children US, M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res 
Holland and M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res France, Care International, Oxfam GB, Mercy Corps, 
International Rescue Committee (IRC), Norwegian Refugee Council, Cooperative Housing 
Foundation and PADCO. In addition, the activities of three national organisations were also 
terminated, namely the Sudan Social Development Organization (SUDO), the Amel Centre for 
Treatment and Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence, and the Khartoum Centre for Human 
Rights.  
</p>
<p>646. These 16 organisations employed nearly 6,500 national and international personnel. 
Eviction orders had reportedly been appealed by relief and humanitarian NGOs according to 
Sudanese law, while the close down of local NGOs could not be appealed according to the 
Humanitarian Act of 2006.  
</p>
<p>647. Incidents of threats against NGO personnel were reported, as well as systematic 
confiscation and seizure of property, including passports computers, cars and confidential items, </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 102 
 
</p>
<p>allegedly on the basis of an agreement signed by NGO personnel with the Humanitarian Aid 
Commission (HAC) stipulating that they had to hand their assets over to the State upon their 
departure.  
</p>
<p>648. Concern was also expressed that the impact would not only be limited to Darfur, but the 
Three Transitional Areas and Eastern Sudan as well. According to estimates, 1.5 million 
beneficiaries no longer had access to health and nutritional services. Host and IDP populations 
were particularly affected. Water supply, sanitation and hygiene services provided by these 
NGOs to 1.16 million people were interrupted (Blue Nile - 102,000; Eastern States - 50,000; and 
Darfur - 1,007,000). Some 1.1 million people had stopped receiving general food distribution 
and the treatment of some 4,000 children for severe and moderate malnutrition over the next 
three months could be interrupted. In the Non-Food Item (NFI) and Emergency Shelter (ES) 
sector, 670,000 individuals were estimated to be affected. Distributions of Non-Food Relief 
Items (which include cooking equipment and other basic household goods) and emergency 
shelter had ceased in 19 camps and locations in Darfur. 
</p>
<p>649. The longer term humanitarian consequences, such as depletion and shortages of food 
stocks and other assets and the upcoming rainy season, will reportedly have a serious impact on 
the ability of the communities concerned to have access to sufficient and adequate food.  
</p>
<p>650. On 8 March 2009 the decision to terminate the activities of the above-mentioned 
organisations had started to show its effects. In some IDP camps in the Zalingei area, for 
example, the fuel for operation of the water pumps had started to run low without an alternative 
option in place for its re-supply. Garbage had also started piling up inside these camps. Absence 
of water and a waste disposal system would have serious consequences on people&#8217;s health and 
nutrition. 
</p>
<p>651. Finally, disturbing reports of censorship, temporary newspaper suspensions, threats and 
arbitrary arrest and detention to prevent human rights defenders, journalists and members of 
opposition parties from freely expressing their opinions, were reported. Privately-owned print 
media reportedly continue to be subjected to daily censorship by officials of the National 
Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) who may allegedly order the removal of any article 
from the following day&#8217;s paper. In response to the censorship there had been a number of 
protests by journalists. 
<b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>652. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Sudan did not reply to any of the 
communications sent during the period under review. She considers response to her 
communications as an important part of the cooperation of Governments with her mandate, and 
urges the Government of Sudan to respond to the concerns raised. 
</p>
<p>653. The Special Rapporteur conducted a visit to the Darfur region of the Sudan in 
September 2004. </p>

<p>658. Par une lettre dat&#233;e du <b>26 janvier 2009</b>, le Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que les pr&#233;venus

de l&#8217;ordre ainsi que l&#8217;installation de barricades sur les voies publiques. 
</p>
<p>659. Il est &#233;tabli que les pr&#233;venus susvis&#233;s avaient pris, dans ce cadre, le 27 juillet 2008, la t&#234;te

de grosses pierres. Les forces de l&#8217;ordre, intervenant pour rouvrir la voie publique &#224; la circulation 
et assurer la s&#233;curit&#233; des personnes et des biens, avaient essuy&#233; des jets de pierres et des coups de

<p>666. By letter dated <b>14 September 2007</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences sent an urgent appeal concerning Ms. C. M., born in 1981 in Marivan 
(Iran).  
</p>
<p>667. According to information received, Ms. C. M. is the daughter of an Iranian refugee 
Mr. A. M., who was recognized as a refugee in Turkey under the mandate of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and resettled to Canada in 2006. When Ms. C. M. 
first arrived in Turkey in 2001, she was registered as a dependent to her father&#8217;s case. During 
their stay in Turkey, Ms. C. M. met Mr. I. Y. who was among the group of Iranian refugees that 
came from Iraq, and the couple married in Turkey in 2003. After their marriage, Ms. C. M. was 
added as a dependant to her husband&#8217;s case. Mr. I. Y. decided to leave Turkey by irregular 
means in September 2006 and managed to arrive safely in Netherlands. 
</p>
<p>668. Ms. C. M. tried to leave by the same means as her husband but she was arrested at the 
Istanbul Airport on 14 February 2007 by the Turkish authorities and detained for a short period. 
Upon her release she was allowed to stay legally in Konya with a temporary residence permit. 
Ms. C. M. remains in Turkey without family support as her husband is now residing in 
Netherlands and her parents are in Canada.<b>8</b>

<p>671. On<b> 20 October 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, 
sent an allegation letter concerning the case of Ms. F. Z. M., a Moroccan national, alleged victim 
of rape in Dubai in July 2007.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  The full summary of the case can be found in last year&#8217;s report, A/HRC/7/6/Add.1. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 106 
 
</p>
<p>672. According to the information received, Ms. F. Z. M. started working in the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE) in 2005, and in Dubai on 17 April 2007. A few days after moving to Dubai from 
Abu Dhabi, Ms. F. Z. M. became acquainted with two Moroccan men who were facing 
economic hardship and to whom she ended up providing shelter at her apartment. In July 2007, 
one of the two men, Mr. Y. A.,<b> </b>raped her. Afterwards, the rapist called Ms. F. Z. M. and 
threatened to kill her if she reported the rape to the police. Later on, two of his friends, 
Mr. S. A. W. and Mr. R. H. also threatened to harm Ms. F. Z. M. and her family in Morocco if 
she ever reported the rape incident to Dubai Police. Ms F. Z. M. had her contract in Dubai 
terminated shortly after. As she received another job offer in Lebanon, she left Dubai on 
26 August 2007, to begin her new work, without reporting the rape to the police out of fear. 
</p>
<p>673. In November 2007, Ms F. Z. M. returned to Dubai and filed a complaint for rape and 
threats at the Qusais police station. The three suspects were arrested on the same day and later 
referred to the Public Prosecutor. The Prosecutor interrogated the three men but eventually 
released them without interrogating the victim or the witnesses. 
</p>
<p>674. In his decision on case 1920312007, the chief of the 1st Deira Prosecutor's Office alleged 
that the fact that the complainant had allowed the perpetrator to live in her apartment and her 
prior loss of virginity made the allegation of rape unlikely. In April 2008, Ms. F. Z. M.'s attorney 
filed a complaint with the Dubai Public Prosecutor requesting him to interrogate witnesses and to 
reconsider the decision not to prosecute the suspects. He also questioned the legal basis for 
considering the fact that Ms F. Z. M. was no longer a virgin at the time of the rape as a grounds 
for not prosecuting the man she identified as her rapist.

<p><b>Reply from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>675. By letter dated 26 January 2009, the Government replied to the communication sent 
on 20 October 2008. At the time this report was finalized, the translation of the Government&#8217;s 
reply had not been finalised. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>676. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of the United Arab Emirates 
for its reply to her communication.

<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>677. On<b> 2 February 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences sent an allegation letter concerning Ms. N. A., a citizen of Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>678. According to information received, Ms. N. A. was born 01 January, 1988, in Musa Qala, 
Helmand province. Her father, A. J., was killed in the crossfire of Hazarah ethnic groups seven 
years ago (in December 2001). On 2 April 2008, Ms. N. A. married Mr. N. K., who worked as a 
tailor and an interpreter for foreign non-governmental organisations based in Afghanistan.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 107 
 
</p>
<p>About 40 days after the marriage, Mr. N. K. received two letters approximately a week apart. 
When Ms. N. A. inquired about the contents of the letters, her husband swore at the Taliban and 
said they wished him not to get on with his life and work. Ms. N. A. believed that they were 
warning letters by the Taliban preceding his arrest in mid June 2008, when eight to ten armed 
people broke into their house in the middle of the night. They blindfolded Mr. K. and took him 
away. Three days later, Mr. N. K.&#8217;s sister came to Ms. N. A.&#8217;s house screaming that her brother 
had been killed by the Taliban. 
</p>
<p>679. Within days of her husband&#8217;s death, Ms. N. A.&#8217;s home was first visited by a 
servant/relative of M. A. S., a Taliban commander, and thereafter by a delegation of four, which 
included M. A. S. They brought a marriage proposal for Ms. N. A. with the brother of M. A. S. 
Ms. N. A. and her mother understood that if they did not agree to the marriage, it would either 
happen by force or they would be killed. Ms. N. A.&#8217;s mother discussed their predicament with a 
neighbour, who introduced them to a friend who assisted Ms. N. A. to leave Afghanistan. 
Ms. N. A.&#8217;s mother sold the house to pay for the journey. Two weeks after the death of Mr. K., 
Ms. N. A. and her mother travelled with the agent to Kandahar by car, from where Ms. N. A. 
continued to Quetta, Pakistan, then to what she believes was Dubai, to finally arrive in the UK 
on the 15th July 2008, where she lodged an asylum application.  
</p>
<p>680. Ms. N. A.&#8217;s application for asylum was rejected by the Home Office, UK Border Agency 
on the 24th November 2008. In their written decision, the Home Office substantiated their 
decision on a number of grounds, including, <i>inter alia</i>: doubts with regard to the fact that 
Ms. N. A.&#8217;s husband was indeed killed by the Taliban; doubts that she herself was pressured to 
enter into a forced marriage; and that she was able to live with her mother for seven years 
following the death of her father. The Home Office also expressed the opinion that Ms. N. A. 
could internally relocate to Kabul where she could seek protection in safe houses for single 
women, and receive sufficient protection from state authorities.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>681. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to receive information on 27 April 2009 that 
Ms. N. A. had been granted refugee status by relevant UK authorities, and was also determined 
to be a person at risk of treatment contrary to article 3 of the European Convention on Human 
Rights.  
</p>
<p>682. In the present case, the Rapporteur had highlighted the findings of her report following her 
visit to Afghanistan in 2005 which showed that women who experienced multiple forms of 
violence in the private and in the public sphere were often re-victimized as the authorities failed 
to protect them. Violence against women is tolerated and perpetrators often enjoy impunity 
because the law enforcement and justice systems are generally dysfunctional and are heavily 
biased against women. Furthermore, while noting the existence of some shelters, women who are 
forced to find shelter in a safe house generally risk finding themselves in a situation where they 
cannot be reunified with their family and have nowhere to go, thus leaving them with no durable 
solution in sight. The information the Rapporteur has continued to receive since her visit to 
Afghanistan indicates that her findings remain valid.  </p>

<p><b>Reply to a communication sent in 2005 
</b></p>
<p>683. In a letter dated 29 December 2008, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 30 September 2005. The letter expressed concerns relating to violence against women and 
girls, women human rights defenders, and political leaders in Iraq. In particular, the letter 
expressed concern over the targeting by extremists of women for their activities in defence of 
women&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>684. The Government, while expressing its sincere apologies for the long delay in responding, 
stressed that the empowerment of women around the world is a top priority for the United States, 
as is the promotion and protection of the human rights of women. It further highlighted that these 
priorities are of particular importance to the United States in Iraq, where the United States has 
worked closely with the Iraqi Government, the international community and non-governmental 
organizations to address gender-based violence and related issues.  
</p>
<p>685. The response contained detailed information about the projects the Government carries out 
to promote women&#8217;s equal participation in society and government; their initiatives through 
cooperation with multilateral organizations; and their support to several projects through various 
NGOs that focus on prevention and response to gender-based violence in Iraq.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>686. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of the United States of America 
for the response provided to the communication sent on 30 September 2005, but regrets that it 
took the Government over three years to respond. She also regrets that the response of the 
Government, while it provides a very detailed account of various programs and projects carried 
out by the United States in Iraq, does not more directly address the specific issues contained in 
the communication regarding the situation of human rights defenders in Iraq.  
</p>
<p><b>Zimbabwe 
</b></p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>687. On<b> 26 February 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the right to education, and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent 
an allegation letter regarding a group of teachers and members of the <i>Progressive Teachers&#8217; 
Union</i> (PTUZ), including, Messrs. T. Z.(president), R. M.(secretary general), H. M , L. Z., 
O. M., B. S. , C. M. , and Ms. L. S., who were involved in a campaign entitled &#8220;Save our 
Education&#8221; which highlights shortcomings in the education system in Zimbabwe. 
</p>
<p>688. According to information received, on 19 February 2008, the aforementioned members of 
the Progressive Teachers&#8217; Union (PTUZ) were reportedly engaged in peaceful protest, 
distributing leaflets in Harare as part of the &#8220;Save our Education&#8221; campaign. While on Fourth St, </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 109 
 
</p>
<p>the protesters were accosted by a number of unidentified youths, who reportedly brought them to 
a building used by the ruling political party, the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic 
Front (ZANU-PF), where they assaulted them. 
</p>
<p>689. The assailants reportedly hit and kicked the protesters with open palms, booted feet and 
iron rods. One female teacher was reportedly stripped naked in front of her male colleagues and 
assailants, and had her genital area repeatedly stepped upon. During the assaults, the victims 
were accused of being activists from the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change. 
</p>
<p>690. Reportedly, police officers arrived and took the teachers to Harare central police station 
where it is believed they may also have been subjected to ill-treatment. Lawyers were allegedly 
initially denied access to the teachers by one Detective Chief Inspector M.; with one lawyer 
being forcibly escorted from the police station. Offers to transfer the teachers to hospital were 
rejected by police despite their need of medical attention. They were eventually transferred to 
Harare Central Hospital in a pick-up truck, from where, after several hours delay awaiting 
medical attention, they were transferred to the Avenues Clinic, where they were admitted for 
treatment.  
</p>
<p>691. On 22 February 2008, all the aforementioned persons were released from hospital, and no 
charges were pressed against them. 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>692. On <b>2 April 2008</b>, the Government replied to the letter sent on 26 February 2008. The 
Government informed that the group of teachers were all members of the Progressive Teachers 
Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ) and were all facing investigations. The Government stated that 
on 19 February 2008, the PTUZ members went to ZANU PF Harare Provincial Headquarters 
where they threw fliers within the party premises. The fliers contained MDC political messages. 
Subsequently, a skirmish ensued between the ZANU PF supporters and members of the PTUZ 
and the police was alerted; they subsequently arrested nine members of the PTUZ and two 
ZANU PF youths. 
</p>
<p>693. The Government underlined that the police noted at the time of the arrest that indeed some 
of the PTUZ had sustained injuries as a result of the clash. It stated that all suspects were taken 
to the Police station and that at no time were the suspects subjected to any form of ill treatment 
by the Police. The suspects were subsequently taken to the Government hospital to get the proper 
medical report that would then be acceptable in Court.  
</p>
<p>694. The Government added that the two youths that assaulted the members of the PTUZ had 
been identified as T. C. (33) and C. G. (26) and were being charged on this account. In addition, 
the Government stated that the injured were not denied access to medical treatment and that the 
police could not be blamed for delays that occurred at the Government hospital. The Government 
finally stated that the members of the PTUZ were charged with contravening Chapter 46 of the 
Criminal Codification Reform Act Chapter 9.23, &#8216;Criminal nuisance&#8217;, and after their hearing 
were released on 50 million Zimbabwe dollars bail each, the same conditions as the two ZANU 
PF youth. All accused were set to appear in Court on the 19 March 2008. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 110 
 
</p>
<p>695. On <b>13 May 2008</b>, the Government sent another memorandum in reply the letter sent 
on 26 February 2008 containing a similar response as the one provided on 2 April 2008. The 
government stated that the matter was still pending in Court.  
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>696. On<b> 22 April 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing (as a component of the right to 
an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context), and the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, sent an urgent appeal regarding reports of intimidation, violence and torture as a 
form of retribution or victimization in the aftermath of recent elections. 
</p>
<p>697.  According to the information received, between 29 March and 14 April 2008, 160 cases of 
injury resulting from organized violence and torture were treated by various doctors with many 
of the patients still remaining in hospital. One third of the patients were women. A fifth of the 
victims were members of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and another 
20% were involved in the elections for the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC). Nine 
patients sustained fractures (broken bones), reportedly typical of &#8220;defence injuries&#8221;, resulting 
from the victim raising his or her hands and arms to protect the face and upper body from 
assault.  
</p>
<p>698. During the same period, there were also reportedly: at least two politically motivated 
murders; 15 abductions of women; 288 cases of homes destroyed through politically motivated 
arson subjecting 175 families and 14 persons to displacement; and 48 cases of assault. The 
majority of persons displaced were said to be women and children. About 70 MDC members 
were arrested in those last few days as well. 
</p>
<p>699. The above-described violence had reportedly been perpetrated by police officers, soldiers 
and members of the ruling Zanu PF party as part of a reprisal campaign mainly in rural areas, 
where people had been voting for opposition candidates. In many instances, victims were told 
that they were being victimized because they support the opposition; they were accused of 
&#8220;celebrating the MDC victory&#8221;, &#8220;of selling the country to the whites&#8221; and/or &#8220;of being 
responsible for the rigging of elections in favour of the MDC&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>700. Reports also indicated that the authorities were targeting the independent local and foreign 
media, attempting to impede reporting on the current situation and the aftermath of the election 
by resorting increasingly to police harassment and the arrest and detention of journalists; the 
deportation of one foreign journalist was reported. 
</p><p>701. In parallel, the State-controlled media was reportedly airing programmes and songs 
encouraging violence, such as &#8220;Mr Government&#8221; by M. S. J., which celebrated the Government&#8217;s 
land seizures and called for the decimation of perceived political sell-outs (the song said: &#8220;We 
are living like squatters in the land of our heritage ... give me my spear so that I can kill the many </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 111 
 
</p>
<p>sell-outs in my forefathers&#8217; country.&#8221;); as well as a well known song encouraging people to take 
up arms and fight for their freedom aired by ZTV. Moreover, there were reports that there were 
plans to entrust the distribution of food aid to the military in order to control the population 
through the politicization of food distribution.  
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>702. On <b>11 June 2008</b>, the Government replied to the communication sent 22 April 2008. It 
stated that some isolated and localised cases of violence had occurred in the country during the 
post-election period. However, it also stated that there was overwhelming evidence pointing to 
the fact that the MDC-T had been premeditating and planning violence well ahead of the 
29 March 2008 elections, while the ZANU-PF&#8217;s actions had largely tended to be reactive, in 
self-defence and retaliatory.  
</p>
<p>703. The Government responded that the President, Cabinet Ministers, Service Chiefs and 
various ruling party functionaries had all repeatedly before, during and after the 29th March 
Harmonised Elections, publicly declared their disapproval of violence and warned all would-be 
perpetrators of the full consequences of the law. The Government also informed that all cases 
that have been reported to the police were the subject of investigations as part of the due process 
of law.  
</p>
<p>704. Where no report has been made to the police, such as in the case regarding the 31 
politically motivated murders claimed by the MDC-T as having occurred since 29th March 2008, 
the Government stated that the Police would find it impossible to take the initial steps to launch a 
due process. 
</p>
<p>705. The Government stated that it was impossible to verify the MDC-T&#8217;s claims, particularly 
because it appeared that the party was complaining to the press before reporting the crimes to the 
police. The Government further stated that of the six murders allegedly committed by ZANU-PF 
supporters, subject to ongoing investigations, at least two did not seem to have been politically 
motivated. One of these was the case of C.D., who MDC-T&#8217;s A. C. claimed to have been 
murdered in Shurugwi by a ZANU-PF supporter on 27 April 2008. According to established 
facts, however, D. died of immuno-suppression and tuberculosis at Mpilo Hospital, in Bulawayo, 
on 27 April 2008. Incidentally, on 11 April 2008, he had fought with a ZANU-PF supporter at a 
local township over money, but eye witnesses said that the two later went their separate ways. 
</p>
<p>706. The government stated that in another case, the alleged victim, a teacher in the Muzarabani 
area, had not been killed and had denounced the MDC-T for using his name to justify &#8216;dubious 
statistics&#8217;. The Government concluded that these two cases proved that the MDC-T was 
fabricating and exaggerating its tally of victims in order to give substance to its claims. It further 
stated that the alleged politically motivated rapes, were completely alien and unheard of in 
Zimbabwe&#8217;s political culture. It reiterated that every complaint received would be investigated 
and pursued, and that it had never been the Government&#8217;s policy to support or condone violence 
or impunity. 
</p>
<p>707. The Government regretted that all &#8216;evidence&#8217; cited by the Rapporteurs were painting the 
MDC-T as the victim and implicating ZANU-PF as the principal perpetrator of violence. It 
recalled that during the &#8216;mass action&#8217; called by the MDC-T on 15th March 2008, &#8220;marauding </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
page 112 
 
</p>
<p>gangs&#8221; of MDC-T DRCs committed a wide range of crimes ranging from disrupting traffic 
through makeshift road blockades, burning vehicles to attempted murder. It said that these events 
led to the police arrests of 76 activists who had all confessed to be hired members of the DRCs. 
</p>
<p>708. The Government further stated that following ongoing investigations pertaining to 
Electoral Fraud, close to 100 arrests had been made. Five of these had already been convicted for 
Contravening Section 87 of the Electoral Act Chapter 2: 13 and sentenced to fines ranging 
between ZW $ 12 billion and ZW$ 30 billion. The remaining cases were at various stages of 
investigation or before the courts. 
</p>
<p>709. Regarding the questions of compensation for alleged victims, the Government stated that 
the victims were receiving the usual basic assistance from the Civil Protection Department and 
the resident humanitarian agencies in the country.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>710. On<b> 6 June 2008</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders sent an allegation letter regarding the situation of: Mr. P. S., member of the human 
rights non-governmental organisation <i>Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition (CZC) </i>and another member 
whose identity had yet to be confirmed; Ms. J. W., national coordinator of <i>Women of Zimbabwe 
Arise</i> (WOZA), a grassroots organization working to promote and protect women&#8217;s activism; 
Ms. M. M., co-leader of WOZA, and 12 other WOZA members, including one male belonging to 
WOZA&#8217;s sub-division, Male of Zimbabwe Arise; members of the Zimbabwe Election Support 
Network (ZESN) whose identities had yet to be confirmed; and Mr. M. S., a Gutu Resident 
Magistrate who had recently presided over several cases of political violence. 
</p>
<p>711. Since 2004, Ms. J. W., Ms. M. M. and several other WOZA members were the subject of 
several communications. According to new information received, on 30 May 2008, Mr. P. S. was 
arrested, together with another member, at the premises of the CZC by law enforcement officers 
and alleged Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) agents. After searching the premises for 
broadcasting equipment, the authorities drove the 2 CZC members around for some time before 
releasing them with no charges. On 2 June 2008, four men allegedly belonging to the CIO urged 
the guard of the CZC office to inform them about the activities of the Coalition. The guard 
refused to open the gate, and the four men warned him that they would come back. 
</p>
<p>712. On 28 May 2008, Ms. J. W., Ms. M. M. and 12 other WOZA members were arrested in 
Harare during a reportedly non-violent demonstration. The police reportedly used force to 
apprehend the demonstrators. They were all charged with distributing materials likely to cause a 
breach of the peace under Section 37 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act. 
Ms. J. W. was further charged with publishing or communicating false statements prejudicial to 
the State under Section 31 of the same Act. On 30 and 31 May 2008, some WOZA members 
appeared in court and were granted bail. However, the State prosecutor appealed the decision 
and the 14 WOZA have since remained in custody: the 13 female WOZA members were being 
held at Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison; the male WOZA member was being held at Harare 
Central Remand Prison. Conditions of detention in both facilities were reportedly difficult. 
The 14 WOZA members were due to appear in court again on 6 June 2008. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 
 page 113 
 
</p>
<p>713. In mid-May 2008, three ZESN members were reportedly assaulted by members of the 
Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front militia in Mt Darwin East, Mutyandaedza 
village. They were later transported to Mt Darwin District Hospital for treating fractured arms, 
fractured fingers, deep cuts and bruises. However, admission to the hospital was reportedly 
denied to them.  
</p>
<p>714. On 21 April 2008, the car of Mr. M. S., parked outside his home in Mupandawana Growth 
Point, was set on fire by three unidentified individuals who ran away when Mr. M. S. came out. 
Mr. M. S. reportedly received a series of death threats prior to this incident. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>715. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its reply to two out of 
three of her communications sent during the period under review. The Special Rapporteur 
reiterates her interest in receiving responses from the Government in regard to the allegations 
submitted and would be particularly interested to know whether these cases have resulted in any 
prosecutions of alleged perpetrators.
