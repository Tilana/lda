stumbled upon once they are gone.
The guy at the crematorium said it would take about three hours. A little less if he was
lean, a little more if he was fat, as fat burns slower. “Which is why it’s so hard to get rid of,”
he added, patting his ample belly. He was a congenial man, of a different congeniality than
the people at the mortuary, who were hushed, respectful, reserved, sedate, watchful, and
preternaturally composed. The sort of people whose every mannerism and facial expression
assured you it was perfectly all right to get emotional, to rend your clothes, pound your fists,
sob till your throat was raw. They were all for showing your grief. And if you didn’t, you felt a
little embarrassed, as if you hadn’t performed up to par. And if you did, you also felt
embarrassed, for making such a fuss. The difference being that in the latter case you felt
you’d done the right thing.
Greg, the crematorium guy, was not reserved at all. He was the opposite, chatty and
matter of fact. Fat burned slower, he explained, because it had more calories than muscle.
You could get it to burn faster by raising the temperature in the oven, but then you ran the risk
of blackening the air with smoke and pollution, which were no-no’s these days. They had a
camera trained on the rooftop chimney that was hooked to a monitor to check what was
coming out, which at the moment was nothing. Or rather, nothing worse than the air itself,
which was hazy from a nearby fire. It was summer, and where I lived, summer meant fires.
“Good day to be inside,” he said.
There was a box in the room. The box, I should say. Six feet long, one foot high, it sat
on a gurney, and without so much as a word of explanation or warning, Greg lifted the lid.
I was determined to be cool. But it didn’t turn out that way. My stomach lurched, and I
choked back emotion.
The box was plain and anonymous, but the bag inside was body shaped. My father’s
name was printed in large letters, once at the foot of the bag and once at the head. There
was a tag with a number that Greg removed for me to check against the number on a form I
had. I was shaken by the sight of the bag and so relieved that he hadn’t opened it and asked
me to identify the body that I barely gave the number a glance. Dad’s name was on the bag,
not once but twice, and that was good enough for me. And even if by some fluke it was
someone else, who would ever know? Ashes were ashes. A little more, weight-wise, if you
were big, a little less if you were small. But quality-wise the same: a kind of gritty mixture of
the soft ash of fully combusted flesh and organs combined with the coarse ash of bone. This
according to Greg, who was free with the info. Gold and silver fillings that might identify a
person vaporized, and personal prosthetic devices like knees and hips and artificial heart
valves were confiscated as potentially biohazardous and not included in the remains. There
was a stainless steel tray where the bones that hadn’t crumbled completely in the heat were
pulverized by hand, then fed, along with the rest, through a funnel-shaped sieve, rather like
sifting flour to get a more homogeneous blend. Attached to the tray was a container
half-filled with blackened metal prosthetic parts. Like jewelry, but scorched. Of everything I
had seen so far, this was the most disturbing. Strange how the mind works.

I didn’t flinch, for example, when he raised the door of the brick-lined oven and, again
without a word, pushed my father in. I didn’t flinch when the door snapped closed. And as the
gas ignited with a soft hiss, I watched the temperature needle slowly rise without emotion.
Perhaps it was this composure of mine that made Greg veer from normal procedure.
Perhaps he admired me for it. Or maybe he thought that something was subtly wrong. At any
rate, after the body was in the oven for a while, he opened the door. The cardboard coffin
was on fire, somber red flames punctuated by bright curlicues of yellow. Centered almost
exactly in the middle was the dark globe of my father’s skull. He’d been bald in life, and I
recognized the shape. It was him, and not only that, he seemed at peace. By which I mean it
comforted me to think that. The flames appeared to be cradling him. They licked at his head
but had not yet set it on fire, as though to honor him—his life, his achievements, his
spirit—by not consuming him too fast.
I left the crematorium at 8 am, called at one (allowing time for the ashes to cool) to
pick up the remains. I was told to call back later. I called again at two, and then at three, and
then four. Greg said it was taking longer than expected. I asked if there was a problem.
“Sometimes the ovens act up. Don’t heat like they’re supposed to.”
“Which means what? That he can’t be cremated?”
“Oh, he’ll be cremated all right. It just takes longer.”
“How much longer?”
“Why don’t you call back in a few hours.”
“Like when? Tonight?”
“No problem. We operate around the clock. Twenty-four/seven.”
“You don’t sleep?”
“Can’t afford to. They don’t.”
In my mind’s eye I saw a line of gray and expressionless men and women, waiting
impassively to be slid in the oven and baked. It was a dreadful image. I wanted this to be
over.
“Are you busy?” I asked.
“Most of the time we are. It’s steady.”
“I mean now.”
“Now? Not too busy.”
“Can you fix it?”
“Fix it?”
“The oven.”

There was a pause, as if this was not exactly the right question. “Sure. We fix them all
the time.”
“So tonight then? I can pick them up tonight?”
“Right. Tonight. Call back. Everything’ll be fine.”
As it turned out, everything wasn’t fine, not by nine that night, when the swing shift guy
suggested I call back in the morning. And not by the morning.
I got Greg again, a guy whom, in the short time I’d known him, I’d come to more or
less trust. He was straight with me, and not unfeeling.
“It’s not the oven. Sorry, man.”
“What do you mean?”
“My boss wants to talk to you.”
“You talk to me. What do you mean, it’s not the oven?”
“He’ll explain.”
“Just tell me.”
There was silence.
“Please.”
He was a decent guy. He cared about his job, and in this case his job meant caring
for me.
My father, it seemed, did not want to burn. His skin and nails and organs, yes. They
were gone. But his bones, no. Somehow they had resisted twenty-four hours of thirteen
hundred degree heat and flame. Greg had never seen anything like it.
His boss, however, had. He’d been in the business more than twenty years and had
seen, in his words, “a little bit of everything.” We met in his office, which adjoined the
crematorium. There was an old-fashioned oak desk piled with papers, a chair behind it and
one in front of it, a dirty window, a concrete floor. By the look of things he wasn’t used to
visitors.
At another time I might have been interested in what he meant by “a little bit of
everything.” He was certainly interested in telling me, as though the existence of other
unusual happenings and odd occurrences would be a comfort. Rather like expecting
someone with a broken bone to be comforted by the news that other people were in pain.
I didn’t want to hear about it. “What’s the problem with my father’s bones?”
He was leaning against the front edge of his desk, his shirt collar open, his thick,
calloused hands on his thighs. He looked like he could have been a fighter at one time. His
face was carefully composed.

“They don’t want to burn,” he said.
“And why is that?”
“I wish I had an answer. We gave it all we got.”
“Greg mentioned something about the oven. Thought maybe it was acting up.”
“Nothing wrong with the oven. We just had it serviced. It’s working fine.”
“But this is what you do, right? You cremate bodies.”
“Twenty-nine years,” he said.
“But not mine.” I meant my father’s, of course.
He rubbed his thighs, as if to clean his hands, or expel something. It reminded me of
my father in his hospital bed, just a few days before he died. Picking at his gown over and
over, at a thread or piece of lint or something that no one else could see, something that
simply wasn’t there, then tossing it over the side of the bed. I took his hand and held it, but
he pulled it away, so I sat beside him and watched, transfixed and disturbed by what he was
doing. There was no purpose to it. He wasn’t himself. Or else he was (who else could he
be?), and the purpose of this repetitive and disconcerting activity was hidden to me.
“I’m fully prepared to give you your money back,” the man said.
“And then what?”
“You can use it to bury him.”
“We don’t want to bury him.”
He didn’t reply.
“No offense, but maybe we should try someone else.”
“Sure. By all means. Do that.”
“Wouldn’t you?”
“I told you what I’d do,” he said.
My father actually had suggested that when the time came, he be buried, but my
mother was opposed. Her mind was set on cremation. She wanted to scatter his ashes and
be done. She didn’t want a grave to have to visit. Her mother and father, whom she adored,
were buried in graves, and she didn’t enjoy the feelings that visiting them stirred up in her.
She didn’t like being tied to her loved ones in that particular way. Ever the gentleman, my
father had agreed.
“You said you’d seen this before.”
He nodded. “One time. Six, seven years ago. We were using higher temperatures

then. Didn’t matter. Same thing.”
“Man or woman?”
“Man.”
“What did he die of ?”
He didn’t even have to think. “Heart attack. What did your dad die of ?”
The strange thing was, no one knew. He went into the hospital complaining of
shortness of breath and twelve days later he was dead. Having lost his mind
completely—also for unknown reasons—in the process.
“Not his heart. His heart was fine. What did you do? The other time?”
“I called around. Talked to some guys in the business. Everyone had had a case or
two. Or if they didn’t, they knew of one.”
“So this is not unheard of.”
“No. It’s not.”
“It happens a lot?”
He shrugged. “It happens.”
Knowing this, that we weren’t alone, did, in fact, help. But only a little.
“So with the other one. The other body. What did you end up doing?”
“Same thing I’m doing now. Talking to you. Letting you know this is not the outcome
we planned. Not the one we wanted. Trying to help you along.”
“Did they have a burial? The other time?”
“Don’t know. They didn’t say what they were going to do. Like you, they were upset.”
If my dad were alive, he would have been embarrassed at having caused a problem,
embarrassed at being the center of attention, embarrassed at the fuss. If you told him he
wasn’t crematable, he wouldn’t have asked why. He’d have said fine, do what you have to.
Or rather, he would have said, don’t upset your mother. Make it easy on her. Do whatever
she wants.
“I’ll have to talk to my mother.”
“Of course.”
I stood.
He said, “Can I get you to sign some papers before you go?”
He produced them, I signed them, he punched a number into his phone. He lifted the

receiver and spoke into it briefly, and a minute later, Greg came through the door. He was
carrying a plain cardboard box about the size of a crate of oranges. It had a fitted top and
cut-outs for handles at either end. He placed it on the desk.
It took me a moment to understand what it contained.
“I packed them real good. Nice and snug. There shouldn’t be any problem with
shifting or rubbing or slippage.” He stared at his feet, hesitating. “The top I wrapped
separate. And I put it in a bag. Just in case, you know, you don’t want to look at it.”
“The top?”
His hand drifted up to his head.
Suddenly, I didn’t feel so well. Weak in the knees, unsteady upstairs. Strangely, or
maybe not so strangely, I wanted to throw up. Or cry. Or both (can a person do that?).
“I made an inventory, just so you know. It’s on a piece of paper. In an envelope.”
I was afraid to ask what he meant by “inventory.”
His boss, however, felt obliged to explain. There were a lot of bones in the body. He
didn’t know how many, but a lot. And they weren’t held together anymore, because whatever
it was that held them was all burned up. The ashes—what there were of them, which wasn’t
much—were in a small plastic bag. The bones, none of them touching, were packed
separately, according to shape and size, not to how they fit together naturally. So I might not
recognize which was which, and unless I happened to know anatomy, which I didn’t, I
certainly wouldn’t be able to say that all the bones were there, that the body was complete.
“Which is why we made the list.”
I nodded, but I barely heard a word he said. I was thinking of my poor mother. I was
thinking of my father’s skull. I was also trembling. I felt like a little boy, being asked to be
brave. My father, I sensed, was watching, not unsympathetically. He more than anyone would
have understood. Inventory? You’ve got to be kidding. There was no way I was opening that
box.
But I did have to take it. At first I put it beside me in the passenger seat, but after a
block or two I moved it to the back. That was still too close, and a few blocks later, I put it in
the trunk.

When it comes to disposing of a person’s ashes, it seems that it’s hard to go wrong.
You can toss them to the wind, spread them around and dig them into the ground, charter a
boat and scatter them at sea. You can do it as soon as you get them from the crematorium.
You can wait a month, or a year, keeping them in an urn or a box, in private or in plain view
on a shelf. You can keep them forever and never dispose of them at all. By some common
decree, ashes are immune to misuse. Just about anything you do is acceptable.
But, aside from burying them or bequeathing them to science, what are you
supposed to do with bones?

I put them in the living room, on a side table. My cat Chester made an exhaustive
study of the box, seeing and smelling things, no doubt, far beyond my pale human senses.
To me it looked gray and smelled like cardboard. The more I studied it, the more I should
have stopped. For where Chester excelled in senses that were grounded in reality, I
excelled in ones that were not. I fantasized, for example, that my father was alive and
trapped inside. I fantasized he was a ghost. I fantasized he was troubled, restless, and was
going to haunt me ... not necessarily because he wanted to but because that’s what people
with unfinished business did.
This was not good. Not good at all. What was I going to tell my mother?
****
That was a Monday. The nearby fire, which was mostly brush, had been contained,
but now there were other fires, and on Tuesday, the forest to the north of us went up in flame,
filling the sky with billows of black smoke. It was the driest summer on record, and by
Wednesday there were a hundred fires, and more igniting every hour. For mile after mile in
every direction the air was thick and gray and nasty. People with respiratory conditions were
advised to stay indoors, then that was amended to include everybody. I watched TV,
transfixed by news of the fires, witness to something that seemed both terrifying and
monumental, historic, apocalyptic, a turning point of some sort. Four hundred fires, eight
hundred, a thousand, all up and down the state. “California Burning,” the headlines read. My
father’s resistance to flame—his unburnability—seemed somehow part and parcel of this.
Sphinx-like, inscrutable, the box sat on the side table as if daring me to understand. What
was I to do?
The doorbell rang, and I nearly jumped. Two men were at the door. For an instant I
feared that I was being evacuated. Like most people, I didn’t want to go.
One was tall, the other stocky and broad. The tall one looked to be in his sixties; the
stocky one, in his late thirties or so, a good ten years older than me. They were dressed
conservatively in suits and ties.
They introduced themselves and said how sorry they were to hear of my father’s
death. I thanked them and asked how they knew him.
“We didn’t know him personally,” the older one, Michaels, said.
“Felt like we did,” said the other one, whose name was Neal. “It was nice what they
said in the paper. Good man.”
“Exceptional,” said Michaels. “Outstanding. I wish I had known him. A fine man all
around.”
The younger one, Neal, handed me a card. “We were wondering if we could have a
minute of your time.”
I looked at it, then him. “Bereavement counselor?”
He frowned. His buddy Michaels snatched the card out of my hand, read it, then
narrowed his eyes.
“Wrong card,” he told Neal, who stammered something and blushed. “He’s only been

doing this a little while,” he explained to me, returning the card to Neal, who pocketed it,
fished out his wallet and withdrew another one. After a moment’s hesitation he offered it to
me, but Michaels took it first. He examined it, gave a little nod, looked me in the eye in a
friendly sort of way, and passed it on. This one read “Department of Public Health.”
“Which one are you?” I asked.
“We’re health officers,” said Michaels. “We received a notice of an irregularity. We’re
following up.”
“Strictly routine,” said Neal. “Nothing to worry about.”
Michaels seemed to tense slightly. “Larry. Why would he worry?”
“He wouldn’t. Like I said...”
“We know it’s a difficult time,” said Michaels, cutting him off, “but we’d like to ask you
a few questions. Do you have a minute? It won’t take long.”
“Is there a problem?”
“No problem.”
“None at all,” added Neal. “Routine visit. We’ll be gone before you know it.”
The two of them stood there for a while, not looming exactly, but not going away. At
length Michaels said, “May we come in?”
There is something gravitational about authority, compelling in an almost physical
way. Without thinking, you find yourself drawn to it. And you want to be, that’s the thing. You
like the feeling. You want a piece of the action, whether or not you believe in it or plan to
obey.
I opened the door wider. Then I remembered the box.
“Hold on a minute.” I hurried to the living room, picked it up and carried it to my
bedroom. But the bedroom seemed too obvious, which was a strange thought to have,
unless, like me, the only thing stronger than your trust in authority is your distrust of it. My
apartment is small, and room-wise, all that was left was the kitchen. The box didn’t fit in the
oven, and hastily, I stowed it under the sink.
“Something cooking?” Michaels asked when I returned.
“Cooking?”
He motioned toward the kitchen. I was caught off-guard.
“You guys want coffee?” I asked.
They didn’t, and I ushered them into the living room. We all sat down, and under
Michaels’ watchful eye, Neal began.
“Again, our condolences.”

“Thank you.”
“We understand your father passed away unexpectedly. And rather fast.”
For some reason that irked me. “He was twelve days in the hospital and eighty-three
years old. Is that fast?”
“And of unknown causes.”
“Like I said, he was eighty-three.”
“But not especially sick before he went into the hospital. Say a day or two before.”
“No. Not especially.”
He nodded in a knowing sort of way, then cleared his throat. “Forgive me for asking,
but did you consider doing an autopsy?”
“No. I didn’t.”
“Any particular reason why not?”
In fact, the thought had crossed my mind, but only briefly. He was eighty-three, after
all.
“I didn’t see how it would have helped.”
“How about your mother? Was she interested?”
I thought of her expression the day she came in and he didn’t recognize her, or
anyone, the day he became delirious. How her face had crumpled, and her eyes had teared
up, and she couldn’t speak, except in little sobs. And how after a minute she gathered
herself and sat beside him, taking his hand in hers and speaking to him in a calm,
reassuring, almost chatty, voice, reminding him who and where he was, affectionately
chiding him for not knowing. The eleven days between his entering the hospital and his
dying were for me a blur, but for my mother, I think, it was the opposite: time slowed to a
crawl. She was not shocked or surprised when he died; she was relieved more than
anything, both for his sake and hers. She had known him for more than forty years, and no
autopsy would have enabled her to know him any better, or changed how she felt.
“No. She wasn’t. Not at all.”
“Interesting.”
“Why is that interesting?”
Michaels was quick to reply. “What Mr. Neal means is, you can understand our
interest. From a public health standpoint. Rapid death. Unknown cause.”
“There is a cause. The cause was old age.”
He regarded me for a few seconds, then inclined his head. “It gets the best of us.

Why don’t we leave it at that.”
“I do have another question,” said Neal.
I was beginning to grow impatient. Neal especially was getting on my nerves.
“What is it?”
“It has to do with his bones.”
“What about them?”
“We understand there was a problem.”
“Is that right?”
He nodded.
“Word gets around.”
Michaels, probably sensing the tension, intervened. “Again, it’s a regulatory matter.
The crematorium is required to inform us of any unusual occurrence.”
I replied that it wasn’t that unusual. It had happened before.
“Has it?”
“That’s what the man said. Not often. But then my father didn’t always do things the
conventional way.”
It was a light-hearted comment. I meant nothing by it, and Michaels let it slide. But
Neal was the sort who saw meaning and motive everywhere.
“How so?”
“I was joking.”
He frowned, then gave a bogus laugh. “Oh. I see. Hah. You mean your father was
conventional?”
“Sometimes. Sometimes not.”
“He was unpredictable?”
“I wouldn’t say that.”
“In the end. How would you describe him then?”
“He was delirious.”
“Yes. That’s what the hospital notes say.”
“He wasn’t himself.”

“Did he talk to you?”
“He was babbling.”
“About?”
“Nothing. It was nonsense.”
“Could you understand it?”
“Sometimes. Most of the time not.”
He wasn’t satisfied with this. “Could you be more specific? You couldn’t understand
the words? Or the words were put together in a way you didn’t understand?”
“I don’t know. Both, I suppose.”
He exchanged a look with Michaels. “Can you remember any of them? The words.”
“Not really.”
“Did you recognize any? Had he said them before?”
“Some of them. Sure.”
“The ones you didn’t know.”
“What’s this have to do with his bones?”
“Bear with us for just a moment,” said Michaels. “We’re almost done. Did any of the
words sound foreign?”
“I don’t remember. He mumbled a lot.”
“Had he ever acted that way before?”
“No. Never.”
“He never behaved unusually? Like, say, someone you didn’t know?”
“A stranger,” said Neal. “Did you ever think of your father like that?”
I’d had enough, especially of him. “Do you have a father?”
“Is that a yes or a no?”
“It’s a question. If you don’t know the answer, maybe I can help.”
“Let’s get back to his bones,” said Michaels. “We’d like to have a look at them.”
“Would you? And why is that?”

“Because we’re public health officials.”
“And it’s the law,” said Neal, although the look he got from Michaels made me
wonder if he’d made that up.
“Why are you so interested? Is there some danger to the public? Some sort of health
risk?”
“We won’t know until we examine them.”
“But what’s the likelihood? Really.”
“I couldn’t say.”
I suspected he could. Moreover, I began to feel the need to defend my father, as
though his honor and integrity were at stake. Which was ironic, because of all his qualities
these were the ones that he, and I, and nearly everyone who knew him, valued most.
“They’ve cooked for a whole day at more than a thousand degrees. Is there anything
you know of that survives that kind of heat for that long? Anything that could possibly harm
anybody?”
There was a pause. Somehow the word “harm” changed the whole tenor of the
conversation. Neal glanced at Michaels, who wore a grave expression, then at me.
“If you don’t mind, we’d like a look.”
“They’re not here.”
“Where are they?”
With nary a moment of hesitation I came up with a brilliant riposte. “Somewhere
else.”
Neal started to reply, but Michaels stopped him.
“Can you arrange for us to see them?” he asked.
“When?”
“Tomorrow, say.”
I was out of snappy rejoinders. “Tomorrow it is.”
“Excellent. We’ll see you in the morning.”
****
What is it about health officials that leaves you feeling anxious, worried, vulnerable,
agoraphobic, headachy, sick to your stomach, tight in the chest, sweaty, itchy, and
insecure? Bacteria in the food supply, pesticides in the water supply, smoke in the air
supply, obesity, cigarettes, heart disease, ADD, depression ... it’s a dangerous world out
there, hazards everywhere, and these functionaries seem to delight in reminding us of this,

bludgeoning us with statistics and sharing, if not manufacturing, the most alarming trends.
But how bad really is it? The people I see look like people I’ve seen all my life, only more of
them, and, I have to say, on the whole they look better. Take my father, for example. He used
to smoke, like nearly everyone his age, then he stopped. Then he got fat, like ex-smokers
do, then he got rid of the fat. He looked good when he was seventy, he looked good when
he was eighty, and he looked pretty darn good for an eighty-three-year-old, all the way up to
the last two weeks of his life. A stranger? Yes, he was, in those final few days. And before?
Who isn’t a stranger to some degree, even to his closest companions? I knew my father as
a son, but what did I know of him as a husband, or a friend, or a son himself ? What secrets
did he have? And what thoughts and experiences that weren’t secrets at all, merely too
pedestrian and numerous to mention, or too far in the past, too dim, to remember? Of
course he was a stranger. On some level, we’re all strangers to each other. But I feared
those men meant something more.
After they left and I calmed down, I called my mother. Some friends were making a
condolence call, so she couldn’t talk long. She asked how I was doing, which is how she
starts every conversation, and I told her everything was fine.
“How about you? How are you?”
“Everyone’s being very nice,” she said.
“Are you sleeping?”
“Not too bad. I’m not eating much. I don’t have much of an appetite.” There was a
pause. “Why is that?”
She sounded puzzled, as if she’d never known anyone who’d lost a loved one and
heard them describe what it was like: the loss of appetite, the sleepless nights, the sudden
and recurrent shock of being alone. In fact, she had paid countless condolence calls of her
own and had many widowed friends.
“Because your husband just died. People lose their appetite. It’s pretty normal.”
“So I shouldn’t worry?”
“Are you eating anything at all?”
“Some soup. I had a piece of toast.”
“Then no. You shouldn’t. You’ll be fine.”
“But everybody’s bringing things. Chicken salad. Meatloaf. Lasagna. The food’s just
piling up.”
“But you like those things.”
“I’m not hungry. But they keep bringing them anyway.”
“You’ll be hungry later. You can freeze them.”
“I’m not helpless. I can cook for myself.”

“You might not feel like cooking.”
I could see the look on her face. “It’s annoying. Just so you know. I didn’t die. Your
father did.”
Grieving, for my mother, was a relatively new condition, but being aggrieved was not.
The latter for her was sometimes an expression of discontent but more often of worry, which
itself was an expression of fear. What she feared most was losing something: her
independence, her self-control, someone she loved. In this case, she had lost all those
things to one degree or another, and I did my best to reassure her. We made a date to see
each other the next day, and I hung up, relieved, temporarily, to have avoided the subject of
my father.
The fire situation worsened that afternoon. At one point there were a reported
fourteen hundred blazes throughout the state. One would get contained, and a score of
others would take its place. Forests were being consumed, homes destroyed, thousands
upon thousands of firefighters mobilized, countless lives imperiled. The closest blaze to us
was a scant twenty miles away, and the air outside my window had to be the epicenter of the
smoke. I could barely see across the street. The sun was a blur, and the light was brown and
eerie.
This is how the world will end, I thought. Maybe it’s ending now. Not with a bang but in
a slow, deepening, sunless shadow.
I stayed inside and watched the news. I made some calls. I searched the Internet on
the subject of bones: bone conditions, bone diseases, skeletons, burials, decomposition,
cremation. I learned that in acromegaly the bones are unusually thick. And in something
called osteogenesis imperfecta, unusually thin and fragile. I learned that the monks of a
certain Catholic sect in Rome collected the bones of their brethren and made sculptures out
of them. I learned many fascinating facts, but nothing that helped me in the matter of my
father.
His bones were still under the kitchen sink, an ignoble hiding place, but the living
room was too exposed, and, call me squeamish, I did not want them in the bedroom. So I
left them where they were and said good night, paused, then said “I’m sorry about this, Dad,”
paused again, then said “I miss you, Dad,” turned, turned back and said “I love you, Dad,”
then went to bed.
In the morning there were ashes everywhere: on the trees, on the cars, in the street.
There was barely a county in the state that wasn’t on fire. The governor had declared a state
of emergency. The president, bless his heart, sent condolences.
I had decided, for the time being, to leave my father’s remains where they were. My
mother, of course, had to be told, and I was thinking about that when the doorbell rang.
It was Neal and Michaels again. I was nonplussed. I had called and left a message to
change our date the night before.
“Didn’t you get it?” I asked.
They frowned and looked at each other.
“Did you get a message?” Michaels asked Neal.

Neal shook his head. “Did you?”
Michaels shook his. “This is a bad time? It’s inconvenient?”
“Yes. It is.”
“I’m sorry.” And he looked it.
A moment passed.
“When did you leave it?” he asked.
“Leave it?”
“The message.”
“Last night.”
“What number?”
The air was burning my eyes. By the looks of things, theirs too. Common courtesy
obliged me to invite them inside, which I did.
“I don’t know. The number you gave me. The one on the card.”
“That’s funny,” said Neal.
Michaels agreed. “Maybe you punched it in wrong.”
“I’ve done that,” said Neal. “Plenty of times.”
“It’s not as easy as it looks. Those little pads. Those tiny little phones.”
“It’s not easy at all. Anyone can make a mistake. Don’t worry about it.”
“Not for a second. Please. Do me that favor.”
“It’s not worth the trouble.”
“That’s what I’m saying. Stuff happens.” He glanced at Neal. “Am I right?”
Neal rolled his eyes. “You got to be kidding. All the time.”
“Like yesterday.”
Neal gave a nod. “Yesterday’s a case in point.”
“You probably thought we were stringing you along.”
“Lying to you.”
“Lying’s strong, Larry.”

“Misinforming you then. Not laying our cards on the table. Maybe you thought that.”
“You didn’t trust us.”
“You weren’t sure who we were or what to do. You suffered a tragedy. You’re trying to
sort things out. You’ve got a lot on your mind. A lot of feelings. Some this way, some that.”
“You didn’t trust yourself,” said Michaels.
“You had the bones, but you didn’t want to tell us. You thought it was disrespectful to
your dad.”
“You weren’t sure what to think. You wanted to help, but you didn’t want to do the
wrong thing.”
“That’s exactly right.” Neal pointed a finger at Michaels, as if to single out his
razor-sharp intellect. “You hit the nail on the head, Mike. He wanted to help, just like he wants
to help now.” He turned the finger on me. “He wants to help, but he doesn’t want to make a
mistake. Doesn’t want to blow it. Like before.”
“With the phone. The wrong number.”
“The phone, the information, the car, whatever.”
“What about the car?” I asked.
He gave me a look.
“The car,” I repeated. “What’s wrong with it?”
He transferred his look to Michaels.
“He’s asking about the car,” said Michaels.
“What about it?”
Michaels shrugged and turned to me. “What’s the deal? Is something wrong?”
“You said car.”
He frowned. “No, sir. I did not.”
“He did.” I pointed at Neal.
Michaels turned to him. “He said it was you.”
Neal looked thoughtful. “Interesting.”
“Maybe he didn’t hear you right.”
“It’s possible. Mistakes happen.” He addressed me. “Can you hear me now?”

“I heard you before.”
“Say it. What you thought you heard. The word.”
I was annoyed. This was ridiculous. “Car.”
“Not this?” He made a sort of gurgling in his throat, very brief and, I have to say,
weird. Like water running over rocks, where sometimes you think you can almost make out
words.
“Larry, behave.”
“Familiar?” he asked.
I felt like it should have been, but I shook my head.
He looked disappointed.
Michaels intervened. “Maybe you said cart. Or Carl.”
“Who’s Carl?” asked Neal.
“Or card. Maybe card.”
He scratched his head. “Coulda been that. Come to think of it, I was thinking about a
card.”
He reached in his pocket, pulled out his wallet and slid a card out. He handed it to
Michaels, who glanced at it before giving it to me. “Now please, don’t take this the wrong
way.”
Advice, naturally, that ensures you will.
I looked at it, and my heart froze.
Embossed on it, in large, no-nonsense, steel blue letters were the three initials no
one ever wants to see. Who among us is not guilty of something?
The two of them watched me, waiting, it seemed, for some reaction.
“You look worried,” said Neal.
Michaels nodded. “He does. I think he’s taking it the wrong way.”
“You said not to.”
“I did. But obviously we’re not communicating well. Do you understand me?”
“Sure.”
“I don’t talk with an accent?”
Neal grinned. “Not to me.”

“And the words, they’re clear?”
“Like crystal.”
“But still there’s a fundamental problem. Like a dog talking to a cat. Like different
languages.”
“But related.”
“Definitely related.”
Neal nodded. “It happens. Between people. Communication difficulties.”
“All the time,” said Michaels, taking the card from me and tearing it in half. “It’s just a
card, for chrissake. Anyone can make a card. What you should be looking at is the deliverer.
Look at me.”
I did, and what I saw was not what I expected. His eyes held a depth I hadn’t seen
before. They were warm, and, dare I say it, friendly.
I was almost taken in. “You want me to trust you? Is that it?”
“Sure I do. Who doesn’t want that?”
“Good cop, bad cop.”
He looked chagrined. “Larry’s not bad.”
I gave Larry a glance. “He’s not exactly reassuring.”
“Vive la difference. And we’re not cops.”
“Excuse me. Federal agents.”
“You have a suspicious mind, my friend.”
“You make me suspicious. With all your questions and innuendoes. And your stupid
cards.”
He considered this for a moment. “The cards, perhaps, were a mistake. I apologize.”
I nodded at the one he held in his hand, torn in half like a losing lottery ticket. “How do
you expect a person to react to that?”
“It’s a problem, I admit.”
“Those letters...”
“We should change them,” said Neal.
Michaels agreed. “We should. They’re not what you think.”

Neal said something in a rapid, fluty voice, like birdsong.
“That’s how it sounds in the native tongue,” said Michaels. “Or how we think it did. It
translates roughly into ‘Friends of our Deceased.’”
The “F” was right, but the “O’s” and the “D” were nowhere on the card. “You’re pulling
my leg.”
He shook his head. “We’re not.”
“Friends of our Deceased.”
“F-O-O-D,” said Neal. “Maybe we should put that.”
And I thought, are you dumb or something?
Neal smiled at me. “Pretty dumb idea, huh?”
I stared at him. “What native tongue?”
Michaels said a word I hadn’t heard. “It’s more or less extinct.”
“What the hell is it? Friends of our Deceased?”
He rattled off some names, two or three I recognized as friends or acquaintances of
my father.
“It’s a group?”
He thought for a second. “Sure. A group. You could call it that.”
“What do you do?”
“Why, this.” He gestured, as though it were obvious.
“What?”
“Visit people.”
“You visit people.”
“Sure. And talk to them. Help out.”
“That’s it?”
“We do other stuff too.”
“Like what?”
He looked apologetic. “We don’t usually talk about that with outsiders.”
“So it’s a secret group.”

“Not secret. Private.”
“And my dad was a member.”
He seemed to understand how this might be troubling to me. “I’m sure he was a
member of other groups, too,” he said gently.
This was true. He was a member of a number of groups. And maybe some, like this
one, I didn’t know about.
“So you’re here on behalf of this group. To help me.”
“That’s right.”
“Fair enough. So tell me this: how is it going to help me for you to see my father’s
bones?”
He hesitated. “We can help you decide what to do with them,” he said at length.
“Do you have a way to cremate him?”
“No. We don’t.”
“Then I don’t think you can.”
He protested, as did Neal, and repeated their request to see the bones.
I had this to say: “The message I left. The one you didn’t get? To change our meeting
today? Maybe it was a bad connection. You didn’t hear it right. The words were garbled.
Maybe you didn’t understand.” I paused, expressing my regret. “I’m so sorry.”
“You’re not.”
“If you give me a number—maybe one that’s more reliable—I’ll call you if anything
new comes up.”
More protests, but I was done. Neal didn’t take it well. He issued various veiled and
not so veiled threats, but he had no power, as it turned out, legal or otherwise, to back them
up. Michaels was more resigned, as though he half expected this. He handed me a new
card, this one with his name on it. He lingered a moment, then suddenly and without warning
reached out and gave me a hug. He said my father would be proud of me. He said to call if I
changed my mind. Then he and Neal left.
I saw my mother later that day. She lived on the other side of town. Ash was in the air
and on the ground, floating like snowflakes and stirring around my feet like dust. The heat
and smoke were insane. Traffic was light, proving that people can, if they put their hearts
and minds and souls to it, use common sense. I would have liked to use common sense too,
but mom and I had some things to discuss, and the phone just wouldn’t cut it. This had to be
face to face.
She had made iced tea, a drink best taken outside, but we stayed in the kitchen. She
wore shorts and a blouse and no makeup. Her cheeks were naturally pink, her eyes naturally
large and dark, her face unnaturally drawn. The first order of business, to show that the world

had not come to a halt with her husband’s death and that she was okay, was to complain
about her hair. This she did more by gesture than by word, grabbing it, scowling, looking
annoyed and exasperated, shaking her head. She hadn’t been to the hairdresser since the
week before he died. Initially, she hadn’t wanted to, and then it didn’t seem proper.
“It looks fine,” I told her, for which I received a look that said “Are you an imbecile?
Who raised you because I know it couldn’t have been me.”
“I made an appointment for Saturday. Do you think that’s all right?”
“Sure.”
“Really?”
“Mom. You’re the widow. You get to do what you want.”
“I don’t want to offend anyone.”
She did have the power to offend, typically with her tongue, and usually without
meaning to, or even knowing. But maybe now that dad was gone and she was alone, things
would be different. The fact that she was concerned enough to mention it was a positive
sign.
“Look how much you’ll offend people if you don’t get it done,” I pointed out.
“Really? It looks that bad?”
“It looks fine. You have beautiful hair.” And she did, salt and pepper and spry, at the
grand old age of seventy. I felt a wave of affection for her and planted a kiss on her head.
“How are you?” she asked, relaxing a little.
I mentioned the fires, which she hadn’t been following. News and current events were
not at the forefront of her mind.
“How awful,” she said. “Are you okay?”
“So far.” It was a thoughtless reply, and I regretted it instantly. “I’m fine.”
“Your father would have left.”
“They’re not advising us to. Not yet.”
“There was a big fire here ... god, it must have been nearly thirty years ago. You were
a baby. They weren’t telling us to leave then either, but he packed us all up and took us to a
motel.”
Playing it safe ... this sounded like Dad.
“Once we were settled in and he was sure we were okay, he drove back and helped
fight it.”
“You’re kidding?”

“I’m not.”
“Dad did that?”
She nodded, and her eyes shone. “Your father was full of surprises.”
“What else?”
“I don’t know. Whatever they do. Hosed things down. Dug things out. He came back
and got us in a couple of days.”
“I mean other surprises. What other ones?”
“Oh, that.” She thought for a moment. “A surprise birthday party for me. A surprise
vacation. He loved planning surprises. And keeping them to himself. He prided himself on
that, and with good reason. I can’t remember a time he gave a secret away.”
She paused, smiling at something.
“What?” I asked.
“Oh, I was thinking about you. You were another surprise your father gave me.
Completely unexpected. I was forty-two. Who would have thought? But what a gift. Really.
What a miracle. The best ever.”
The memory of it lingered on her face. Tenderly, she asked if she could fix me
something to eat. I wasn’t hungry, but she opened the refrigerator anyway. Within seconds,
she was scowling.
“Why do they keep bringing me things? It’s such a waste. All this food. I wish they’d
stop.”
“Mom. Come sit. I have something to tell you.”
Her face became utterly still. “What’s the matter? What’s wrong?
I coaxed her beside me, then told her about the remains. She was puzzled at first, as
if she didn’t understand what I was saying. I had to tell her again, then test her further with the
small detail that no one had an explanation. She wasn’t happy with the news—who could be
happy—but, leave it to her, she wasn’t derailed.
“Call someone else,” she said.
“I did. They won’t take him. Not the way he is.”
“What does that mean?”
It meant that word had gotten around. That no one thought they could do any better.
No one had offered to try.
“It means I want to talk to you about alternatives.”

She folded her arms and pressed her lips together, girding herself.
“I want you to consider burying him.”
In the past two weeks she had lost weight. There were hollows at her temples and in
her cheeks, making her eyes, which were large to begin with, more striking than ever. And
those eyes regarded me, and it was a wonder I didn’t turn to stone.
“Just consider it. Not necessarily do it. But think about it.”
“No, thank you.”
“Why not?”
“We discussed it already. I don’t want your father somewhere in the ground. I don’t
like it. I’ve never liked it. Okay?”
“Things have changed. We have to change too.”
“Not in this.”
“Mom. Please. Be reasonable.”
She looked at me, and slowly her face softened, and I felt the change that every child
feels, or longs to feel, and maybe sometimes fears to feel, as her attention shifted from
herself to me and her motherliness took center stage.
“You’re upset. I’m so sorry, sweetheart. I wish there were something I could do.”
“You’re not upset?”
“It’s your father,” she said, as if this explained everything.
“Is it?”
“He can be difficult. You know that. And stubborn. Lord, I never met a man so
stubborn.”
And I thought, was that what this was? A character trait?
“I learned long ago not to argue with him. It only makes things worse.”
“So what do you suggest we do?”
“Explain to me again why they can’t ... why he won’t...” She couldn’t quite finish the
sentence.
“No one could tell me. No one knew.”
“Well, maybe we should find someone who does. A bone specialist.”
“A doctor?”

“Why not?”
Coming from her, this was a remarkable—really, an extraordinary—suggestion. The
woman had a lifelong distrust of the medical profession, rivaled only by her deification of it.
And sure enough, a moment later she reconsidered.
“Well, some kind of expert.” She paused to think. “Maybe Adolph.”
“Adolph?”
“You know Adolph.”
“Adolph Krantz?”
“Why not? He went to college. He studied chemistry. He’s a smart man. And he was
very fond of your father.”
I hadn’t seen Adolph since I was a boy. He was one of my father’s oldest friends. I
didn’t see how he could help, but if my mother thought he might, it was worth a try.
“If I talk to him, will you listen to what he has to say? Will you take his advice, even if
it’s different from what you think? From what your mind is set on?”
“He wrote a very sweet note.”
“Will you?”
“He’ll get a kick out of seeing you.”
“Mom.”
“You’re pestering me.”
“Will you listen to him?”
She didn’t say no, I’ll give her that. “Talk to him. Let’s see what he says.”
There was one more item, which was apt to upset her, though with mom you never
knew. The smallest thing could cause the biggest reaction, and the biggest, she could take
in stride. As it turned out, she didn’t know either of the men, nor the group that they claimed
to be members of. But she wasn’t particularly alarmed or surprised that they knew my dad.
He and she shared many of the same beliefs and memberships, but not all. And in the
interest of marital peace and harmony, some things were strictly off limits.
I asked if my dad ever seemed strange to her.
She laughed. “Your father? Very odd. But you get used to it. Look, we were married
forty-three years.”
“How?”
“How what?”

“Was he odd.”
“You knew your father. He had his way of doing things. It wasn’t my way. Which, as
you know, is perfect.”
“Did he ever seem different from other people?”
She gave me a look. “You ask the weirdest questions. Of course he was different.
Everybody’s different.”
“I mean different from normal. Different in some other way.”
The look narrowed. “What are you driving at?”
“I’m not sure.”
“Then let me tell you something. Your father was an exceptional man. He had his
quirks ... who doesn’t? But when it counted, he was always there. For both of us. If you have
any doubts about that, my advice to you is, don’t.”
I didn’t have doubts, not about that, and for her the conversation was over. I had some
food, which always made her happy, agreed to take some home, which made her even
happier, kissed her goodbye and left.
****
The men visited me once more, this time in a dream. They were dressed the same,
but they looked different. Their faces were rubbery and their arms and legs were long and
loose. They moved like seaweed underwater, like eels, like smoke. I couldn’t take my eyes
off them ... I think maybe they were hypnotizing me. I wanted to be with them, but they were
underwater and I couldn’t breathe. I tried to go after them, but I could hardly move. And my
chest was starting to hurt. I opened my mouth, but I couldn’t get any air. I tried and tried, but
something was blocking my windpipe. The men were watching, and I was suffocating. My
chest was ready to burst. Which is how it must have felt to my father the night he was
hospitalized. He couldn’t breathe either. It’s a terrifying feeling. Thank god, I awoke.
The person who invents the twistless, tangleless, knotless sheet will be enshrined in
the Sleepless Hall of Fame. Along with the one who invents the sweatless, soakless,
self-cleaning pajamas. What did this dream mean? Aside from the fact that I was afraid to
go back to sleep. That these men were not what they seemed? No surprise there. That I felt
threatened by them? I did feel threatened. My heart was racing. But why?
Eventually, I did get back to sleep, a very light and fitful one, as I tried to strike that
hopeless balance between vigilance and repose. I woke tired and grumpy, with the sense
that something had to be done and the desire that someone would do it for me. After a
strong cup of coffee, I was ready to take action myself.
****
I hadn’t seen Adolph Krantz since I was a child, and I’d never been to his home. He
lived outside a small town a couple of hours north of me in an old ranch house in a quiet
neighborhood of parched fields and beautiful, stately oaks. The air was dry and caustic with
smoke when I arrived. A cinder, or even the thought of a cinder, and the house, and

everything near it, would be toast.
I parked at the curb, passed through a chain link gate and up a cracked concrete
path to the front door. I rang the bell. After a minute I rang it again, and at length the door
opened.
An old man peered out. Day old whiskers, hawk-shaped nose, boxy black-rimmed
glasses that magnified his eyes two or three-fold, a flurry of white hair.
I gave him my name.
A moment passed, and then he offered his hand. “I’m Krantz. Call me Adolph. I was
sorry to hear about your dad. Come in.”
He led me inside, moving slowly but steadily, down a hall and into a small, paneled
room full of books and odds and ends. There were two leather armchairs facing each other
across a chess board. Only a few pieces remained in play.
He took one of the chairs. “Do you play?”
“I know how the pieces move. That’s about it.”
He studied the board for a moment, then leaned forward and advanced one of the
pawns. “Your father never liked the game. Though he’d play if I asked him to, back in the
day. He hated this part. Endgame. Too slow for him. Not enough action.”
He pointed to a pawn on my side of the table and asked me to move it. He studied
the board a minute or two more, and, satisfied, sat back and studied me.
“You look like your father. You have his eyes. People used to say I looked like him
too. To me that was a great compliment. I admired him enormously. There’re not a lot of us
left.”
“Us?”
“That’s right. Hardly any.”
“What do you mean ‘us’?”
“The gang. The tribe.” He paused. “What did we call ourselves?” He couldn’t
remember.
“FOOD?” I ventured.
“What about it?”
“Was that the name?”
He gave me a look. “Food?”
I nodded.
“What kind of name is that?”

I told him what it stood for, at which point, I believe, he ceased to take me seriously.
“You’re needling me.”
“I’m not.”
“Your dad used to needle.”
“I’m only telling you what they said.”
“Such a needler. The King of Needling. The Needlemeister. What an education,
watching him work. A thing of beauty, your father. He had the softest touch.” He fell silent,
and I could see him remembering. The years seemed to melt away. A smile lit his old,
craggy face.
“We did pretty well for ourselves, didn’t we, Mickey? Considering what we had to
work with. Where we came from. What we had to do. Pretty damned well.”
Mickey was my father’s nickname, from the old days. Only a handful of people used
it. Evidently, Adolph was talking to him.
“We’ve got nothing to be ashamed of. You a high school dropout. Me a college bum.”
“Adolph?”
He glanced at me.
“Mickey’s not here.”
He looked lost, but only for a moment. “Why would he be? But you. Listen. Be proud
of your father. He was a good man. A wonderful person. You know how we met? The story.
You know the story?”
Some of it I did, but only bits and pieces, mostly from my mom. Dad didn’t talk much
about the past.
“I came over when I was just a kid. Your father was a year or two older and already
here. My family took a room in a house in the neighborhood. Five of us in a single room. I
didn’t know anybody. I didn’t speak the language. I didn’t know my way from a hole in the
ground. Scared? You bet I was scared. Excited too. Scared and excited at the same time.
Everything was so different, so strange and wrong, and one day I walked out the door, and
there was your father. He was sitting on a fire hydrant, playing with a piece of string. He
smiled when he saw me. ‘I’ve been waiting for you,’ he said.”
“He spoke your language? He spoke German?”
“Your father? German? Never. Not a word.”
“So how’d you understand him?”
“How do you think I understood him? He made himself understood. He took me under
his wing. Became a big brother to me. That’s how they worked it. The buddy system.

Everything in pairs.”
“Who worked it?”
“The ones who sent us. The program. For me, mandatory. Your dad, if I’m not
mistaken, was a volunteer.”
“For what? A volunteer for what?”
He thought for a moment, and a smile spread across his face. “The rest of his life.
And then some. That’s for what. Don’t ask me how long, because I can’t tell you. As you see,
I’m still here.”
Apparently, he found this amusing. To me it was annoyingly obtuse.
“You said you were sent. By whom?”
“The senders.”
“Who are the senders?”
“I was five. What does a kid know when he’s five?” He gave me a look. “Your father
never talked to you about this?”
“No.”
“Never?”
I shook my head.
“Then I assume he didn’t want you to know.”
“Know what?”
“Some do, some don’t. Tell people. It’s an individual decision. It’s not up to me to
decide otherwise. Out of respect for your father, may he rest in peace. Out of respect for
your mother. And for you.”
This wasn’t good enough, not by a long shot. I asked him again what it was I didn’t
know, but he refused to say another word. I wasn’t about to get down on my knees. Not
literally. I did, however, let a certain plaintive, importuning tone enter my voice. But he
wouldn’t budge.
So I tried a different tactic. “The men who visited me. Are they part of this thing? Do
they know?”
He didn’t recognize either of their names, but my description of Michaels seemed to
ring a bell.
“They came to pay their respects?”
“They wanted a look at him. At his bones. Who are they, Adolph?”

“I’d imagine another unit. Another pair. Did you let them see?”
“No. I didn’t trust them.”
“They were secretive?”
“Extremely.”
“And you found that annoying. Distasteful. Unpleasant.”
“Yes.”
He nodded, then fell silent. Nearly a minute passed before he spoke. “I understand. I
do. But imagine for a moment if they weren’t.”
“What do you mean?”
“Imagine if they were completely open and honest. Imagine if everyone was. Now
take that one step further and imagine if everyone shared everything. If there were no
secrets, no hidden thoughts, no privacy. If everyone knew everything about everybody. No
separation between people. No boundaries. No mystery. Imagine a world like that. Every
channel open all the time. Everything revealed. How does that sound to you?”
He didn’t wait for an answer. “We’ve tried it. It fried our little brains. Almost fried our
future too. Better a little privacy. A little ignorance. Trust me, it’s no crime to know a little
less.”
Then I’m in good shape, I thought. I had no idea what he was talking about.
“Why won’t his bones burn, Adolph?”
“Ah, yes. That question. Do you have them?”
As a matter of fact, I did. “They’re in the car.”
He nodded, as if he’d expected no less. “The answer to your question is I don’t know
why. I only know what you know, that they won’t.”
He removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes. He did resemble my father, and the
look he gave me—searching and warm—resembled him too.
“Have you thought of burying him?” he asked.
“My mother won’t allow it.”
“It’s a common custom, you know.”
“I do know. But it ‘s not up to me.”
“Throughout the world. Among a great many groups, as different and diverse as they
can be. To hazard a guess, I’d say the custom is quite universal. And I use that term in the
broadest possible way.”

He replaced his glasses and leveled his eyes at me. “Did it ever occur to you that the
men were there for that?”
“What? To bury my father?”
“Yes. To bury him. Simply that.”
“They didn’t mention it. And it didn’t occur to me. Not once.”
“A failure of communication perhaps. But it doesn’t matter, does it? Your mother
won’t permit it.”
“She has that right.”
“Certainly she does. The right of the survivor. We should do our best to honor her
wishes. Perhaps it’s time you brought him in.”
****
Him was not exactly how I thought of what I had, but I did agree that it was time, and I
left the room and went to the car. By now it was late afternoon, and the sun through all the
smoke and haze was a blurry ball of red. A woman pushing a stroller passed me on the
sidewalk. She smiled, and I smiled back. A brief but warm and very human connection. But
then I asked myself, what did her smile signify, what did it mean? And what did mine mean,
and were our meanings the same? What did it mean to share something? To understand
someone? To be inside another’s skin or their head? And then I thought, us. What did that
mean? And what about them?
The box was in the trunk. I hadn’t opened it, and I didn’t intend to, but I had a feeling
that Adolph did. I was willing to let him, as long as I didn’t have to watch. It was my dad, after
all, not some random bag of bones. And frankly, in my mind he was still living. Though not, I
admit, living very well: the image I had of him was an elderly man who in his last days was
not at all the man he was. That’s the trouble, if you can call it that, of someone living to a ripe
old age: you tend to remember them as old. If they happened to be sick, especially if the
sickness was prolonged, you remember them that way. I’m sure it gets better with time,
easier, that is, to recall earlier days and younger selves, but at the moment what was
freshest in my mind was dad in the hospital, restless and agitated, not recognizing me or my
mother, awake but clearly somewhere, if not someone, else. The word “possession” comes
to mind, but it was more the absence of possession, as if something structured and maybe
even made up, like a facade, were gone. Stripped away, to reveal a deeper—and frankly,
deeply disturbing—inner self. Had I seen this person before? The one with barely a thread of
connection to the real world, the world, that is, that most of us lived in and knew? Maybe I
had. Once when he got so mad while driving he had a near fatal accident. Once when he got
so drunk he started singing in someone else’s voice. Another time, or several times, when
he and my mother fought. Mostly he was not this way, and I loved him, but he did have a
temper, which, when it came, made me think of him as monstrous: those bulging eyes,
usually so mild, that strained and frightening voice, that blood red face.
So yes, I do have memories. But pretty thin evidence for his being other than what he
was. Because that’s what we’re talking about. The A word. No one’s using it ... too scared,
too diplomatic, too worried about what the family might say or do or think, too protective of
us and our feelings. Whatever. But that’s what they mean.

So maybe last night’s dream was a message. Maybe it was the voice of truth. Those
weird, inhuman bodies. Those shifting, watery faces.
Not that I believe in such things.
Not that I necessarily don’t.
It does raise some questions, though. Like, where did you come from, Dad? How
many of you are there? Any special powers? Weaknesses? Does Mom know?
At a certain age—I’m not sure what, but I think pre-teen—if you’d told me my dad was
an alien, I’d have said cool. Go Dad. Part of it bravado, part of it pride, part a confirmation of
how I was feeling anyway about him and the world. Face it, when you’re a kid, everything’s
alien to some degree. But at an older age, like now, it’s different. I want to know what it
means, and what it meant then, and why he didn’t tell me. I want to know who the hell I was
living with, and listening to, and trying to impress. Who was I modeling myself after (and
doing a pretty good job, judging by the result), and what does that make me?
The fact is, my dad did have powers. He was good at business. He was super good
at cards. He was super modest. When it came to sports, he was super slow.
And vulnerabilities? His kryptonite? He didn’t always believe in himself. He had a
weakness for food and drink. He got angry over and over at the same things. He was
stubborn to a fault.
The bones were a perfect example of his stubbornness: their resistance to being
burned really shouldn’t have surprised me at all. When dad didn’t want to do something, he
wouldn’t do it. The more you tried to get him to, the harder he’d dig in. If he does have a
spirit, it’s a good bet that it resides in this: the hard-headed, infuriating, refusal-to-budge
persistence of his damn bones.
They weren’t much heavier than the box they were packed in, but when I removed
them from the trunk, I felt a weight much like what I felt when he and I would square off. The
weight of expectation, but more than anything, the weight, the sheer mass, of that
stubbornness of his, and not knowing how to respond to it: give in, and let him have his way?
Be stubborn back and show my mettle? Should I open the box and force myself to look at
him? Would that prove something? If he were watching, what would he think? If he were in
my place, what would he do?
Adolph was waiting when I returned. He’d cleared the table of the chess board, and I
placed the box there. He looked at it for a long time before speaking.
“You’ve not opened it?”
“No.”
“But you want to.”
I shook my head.
He looked at me and at the same time laid his palm on the box, pressing it there as
though to steady himself, or else to steady and maybe comfort who or what was inside. He
didn’t reply, and at length I said, “I do and I don’t.”

He nodded. “You have an urge.”
“A small one.”
“A sense of obligation.”
I shrugged.
“Have you ever seen a man’s bones?” he asked.
“In books. And museums.”
“Up close?”
“Not so very close.”
“Ever held a skull?”
“No.”
“It’s an interesting business, skulls and bones. But not so interesting that a man
should have to look at his own father. I advise against it. Unless you’re used to such things,
the sight can do a good deal of harm.”
I thanked him. I did feel an obligation, and his words helped relieve it.
“So what do we do? What’s the plan?”
“You’re asking my advice?”
“Yes. Please.”
He folded his hands. “Very well. Leave the box with me.”
“Leave it?”
“Come back tomorrow and I’ll give you his ashes.”
“How are you going to do that?”
“Not by fire,” he said.
“How?”
He didn’t reply, and I recalled that he had been a chemist. Possibly he was going to
use some chemical method. Possibly that method was illegal, and he didn’t want to
implicate me.
“I’d like you to trust me,” he said.
“I’d like to.”

“Good.” A moment passed. He gave a knowing smile. “The question is, will you?”
“If you tell me how you’re going to do it.”
“And if I can’t?”
“Can’t or won’t?”
“Can’t,” he said.
“Then I’d want to know why.”
The smile deepened. “Of course. And I’d say that why is unimportant. Or rather,
secondary. Inessential at this time. Now our job is to honor your father and take care of your
mother. And of you. That’s the business at hand. We can continue our conversation later,
though I’m not sure you’ll end up knowing more than you do now. The older you get, the more
you learn to be satisfied with less. At any rate, now we should do what we have to.”
“Who is he, Adolph?”
“You know who he is.”
“I don’t.”
“Forgive me, but you do.”
This was my father’s oldest friend. My mother trusted him, and I wanted to trust him,
too. I longed to trust him. But I couldn’t, not in this.
I thanked him for everything and left the house, the box in my arms. He watched from
the doorway as I slid it in the trunk, doing nothing to interfere. I pulled away and drove a few
blocks, then stopped and moved the box to the back seat. A few blocks more, and I moved
it to the front.
The sun had set, and the moon was low in the sky, shrouded gray. It looked like a
hole through which all the smoke and soot might pour and disappear, leaving the world, my
world, clean and whole again. In the distance along the edge of a hill was a smudge of red
where another fire raged. My heart was heavy. I stopped the car.
Adolph was right. I did know who he was. And that person wasn’t in the box, or
behind some secret door, or in what people thought or hinted about him. Who he was was
inside me. And knowing this was knowing a lot, and it made the decision of what to do next
easy.
****
The fires continued to ravage the state, until it seemed we had entered an era of
flame. If you didn’t see one, then you saw smoke, and breathed it in and tasted it. But then
one day, miraculously, the sun rose in a sky that was nearly blue. And the air was nearly
fresh. And that was the day we scattered his ashes.
Some, at mom’s insistence, we sprinkled on a pathetic little planting strip beside
Oak Mall, which was all that remained of a park where she and dad had courted. The rest

we scattered on a hilltop overlooking town. Adolph had sealed them in a heavy-duty plastic
bag, which he had thoughtfully placed in a stainless steel urn. My mother, who normally
notices such things, made no comment, but to me the urn looked suspiciously like a large
martini shaker.
Were they my father’s remains? My mom certainly thought they were. And I was
inclined to think so too. If they weren’t, they were doing what they had to. They were fulfilling
their purpose.
It’s a terrible thing to live in a constant state of doubt. It’s hard, sometimes
excruciatingly hard, to always be unsure. Whoever my father was and wherever he came
from, the earth had him now. But we had him before, and without question he had us.
