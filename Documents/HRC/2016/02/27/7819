<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 21/24 concerning human rights and indigenous peoples, adopted on 28 
September 2012, the Human Rights Council requested the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to continue to submit to the Human Rights Council an annual report on the rights of 
indigenous peoples containing information on relevant developments in human rights bodies 
and mechanisms and activities undertaken by the Office of the High Commissioner at 
Headquarters and in the field that contribute to the promotion of, respect for and the full 
application of the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples. 
</p><p>2. The present report focuses on some illustrative examples of the OHCHR activities and 
initiatives undertaken at Headquarters and by field presences that contribute to the full 
application of the rights of indigenous peoples. These do not aim to offer an exhaustive 
overview of the work of OHCHR on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, but rather to provide some 
</p>
<p>examples of the action taken at country, regional and headquarters levels.  The report also 
provides an overview of the recent developments within United Nations human rights 
mechanisms insofar as their work pertains to indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>3. During the period under review, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) continued to work in a wide range of contexts for the promotion and the full 
application of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The rights 
of indigenous peoples have continued to be a priority issue for the High Commissioner and 
indigenous issues figure prominently in the OHCHR Strategic Management Plan for 2012-
</p><p>2013.  
</p>
<p>4. The High Commissioner has regularly addressed indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in her 
communication with authorities and others concerned. OHCHR has also played an active role 
in the efforts to raise the profile of indigenous peoples in the context of the Human Rights 
Council, including through its support to the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples (discussed below) and by organizing, during the twenty-first session of the Human 
Rights Council in September 2012, a Human Rights Council panel on indigenous peoples&#8217; 
issues, devoted to indigenous peoples&#8217; access to justice.  
</p>
<p>5. OHCHR has continued to play an active role in various inter-agency initiatives, 
including in the Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous Issues. IASG met at the Secretariat 
of the Convention on Biological Diversity in Montreal, from 28 to 30 November 2012. 
Twenty-seven participants from the twenty-one agencies participated in the meeting, including 
via video-conferencing. The participants agreed on the need for the continuation of training of 
United Nations country teams, governments and indigenous peoples and emphasized the 
importance of the national and local level implementation of the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Areas for cooperation among agencies were identified to 
maximize coordination and avoid duplication. IASG Agencies also discussed opportunities to 
support indigenous peoples in preparatory processes for the World Conference on Indigenous 
Peoples including through the provision of funding as well as through meetings and 
workshops. The IASG also identified ways to advance indigenous peoples&#8217; inclusion in the 
development of the post-2015 development agenda and sustainable development goals. </p>


<p><b> A. United Nations Indigenous Peoples Partnership Initiative 
</b></p>
<p>6. The United Nations Indigenous Peoples Partnership Initiative (UNIPP) was officially 
launched in New York in May 2011. This joint initiative between OHCHR, the International 
Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the United 
Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) and the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) was launched as a response to a recommendation by the Permanent 
Forum on Indigenous Issues to strengthen partnerships for the promotion and implementation 
of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights through joint country programmes.   
</p>
<p>7. OHCHR has been co-chairing the Policy Board of UNIPP and worked closely with the 
indigenous experts of the Board to ensure that United Nations entities involved not only 
combine their respective efforts and expertise but also work in true partnership with States and, 
crucially, with indigenous peoples. As equal partners, indigenous experts made sure that all 
UNIPP country programmes are not merely about indigenous peoples, but also designed and 
implemented with their participation.  
</p>
<p>8. UNIPP implementation started in 2012 with six United Nations joint programmes in 
Bolivia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Nicaragua and Republic of Congo as well as 
through a regional programme in Southeast Asia. These programmes are firmly rooted in the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, ILO Convention No. 169 
(1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries and other key 
standards and they reflect the findings of the Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, treaty bodies and other human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>9. The Annual Progress Report on the Implementation of the United Nations-Indigenous 
Peoples Partnership (UNIPP) issued in May 2013 shows that, despite its recent launch, UNIPP 
is already having an impact. It has increased cooperation between United Nations partners and 
prompted more inclusive working methods, with indigenous peoples as key partners. UNIPP 
has also contributed to capacity-building and to the establishment of inclusive dialogue and 
consultative mechanisms between governments and indigenous peoples. Moreover, it has 
supported the development of new national legislation to protect the rights of indigenous 
peoples.  UNIPP has also prompted United Nations partners to come together coherently, 
guided by the principles set forth in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples and ILO Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal 
Peoples.   
</p>
<p>10. For example, in the Republic of Congo, UNIPP contributed to the development of seven 
Governmental decrees to facilitate the implementation of the law on indigenous peoples in July 
</p><p>2012. This is the first law in Africa devoted to indigenous peoples, and the decrees aim to 
ensure its full implementation in key thematic areas, such as the protection of traditional 
knowledge, cultural heritage and sacred sites of indigenous communities as well as in access to 
education and health services. In Nicaragua, the UNIPP programme has already created a new 
space for dialogue between indigenous peoples and authorities and enhanced understanding on 
the right of indigenous peoples to consultation through a series of capacity-building activities. 
The strengthening of the participation and the voice of indigenous peoples in matters that 
directly affect them is also at the heart of concrete advances made through the UNIPP 
programme in Bolivia.  
</p>
<p>11. In South-East Asia, UNIPP is implemented through a series of regional activities 
promoting effective strategies to protect indigenous peoples&#8217; right to their forest lands and 
</p>
<p>natural resources. National consultations were held in the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia. 
In November 2012, in collaboration with the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact, UNIPP organized 
the Asia Regional Preparatory meeting in preparation for the upcoming World Conference on 
Indigenous Peoples.  The full progress report on UNIPP status of implementation is available 
at the MPTF Office Gateway. </p>


<p><b> B. Capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>12. During the reporting period, the Office contributed to developing the knowledge and 
capacity of 23 indigenous representatives from Bolivia, Canada, the Democratic Republic of 
Congo, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Mali, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Panama, Peru, the 
Philippines, the Russian Federation, Uganda and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) through 
its extensive annual human rights training programme &#8211; the &#8220;Indigenous Fellowship 
Programme&#8221; &#8211; which took place in Geneva in June-July 2012. Trained beneficiaries learned in 
theory and practice how to make use of human rights instruments and mechanisms to promote 
and protect the rights of their indigenous communities at the international level. In their final 
evaluations the fellows also stated how much they valued the insightful contributions by the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), ILO, the World 
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and UNICEF, as well as by Geneva-based human 
rights non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as the Centre for Civil and Political 
Rights, the International Movement Against All Forms of Discrimination and Racism 
(IMADR), the International Service for Human Rights (ISHR), Universal Periodic Review 
(UPR) information, the Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Center for Documentation, Research and 
Information (doCip), and Mandat International. Furthermore, the Office in Geneva welcomed a 
&#8220;Senior&#8221; Indigenous Fellow from Canada who undertook a four-month on-the-job training 
course through which he contributed to the activities of the Indigenous Peoples and Minorities 
Section. 
</p>
<p>13. Additionally, two indigenous fellows who had already been trained in Geneva were 
given the opportunity to further their knowledge by undertaking national fellowships in 
OHCHR field presences in the Russian Federation and Guatemala. Their active involvement 
and inputs to the activities of the Office in these two countries were very much appreciated and 
their knowledge of indigenous issues was an asset in supporting the Office&#8217;s programmes on 
</p>
<p>indigenous issues. 
</p>
<p>14. The United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations &#8211; managed by OHCHR 
on the basis of advice from a Board of Trustees &#8211; continued to support the participation of 
indigenous organizations in the sessions of the United Nations Permanent Forum on 
Indigenous Issues, the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Human 
Rights Council, including its Universal Periodic Review mechanism, and the treaty bodies. In 
September 2012, the General Assembly adopted resolution 66/296, expanding the mandate of 
the Fund to include support for indigenous peoples to participate in the 2014 World Conference 
on Indigenous Peoples, as well as in the preparatory process for the conference. 
</p>
<p>15. In 2012, 54 travel grants were awarded for representatives of indigenous communities 
and organizations to participate in the sessions of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, 
the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the sessions of the Human Rights 
Council and its UPR process, and in sessions of the Human Rights Committee, the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the Committee against Torture. 
</p>
<p>16. The Fund also organized and funded six human rights training modules in four 
languages, in Geneva and New York, to increase the capacity of grantees and other indigenous 
representatives to effectively participate in human rights mechanisms. Additionally, follow-up 
mechanisms were strengthened to ensure that the participation of indigenous representatives 
contributes to the implementation of recommendations issued by human rights mechanisms 
and the national-level implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>17. At its twenty-sixth session in February 2013, the Board of Trustees selected 27 
representatives of indigenous communities and organizations to attend the twelfth session of 
the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in May 2013, 20 indigenous representatives to 
attend the sixth session of the Expert Mechanism, 3 indigenous representatives to attend the </p>


<p>ninth session of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; four indigenous 
representatives to attend the sixteenth session of the Working Group of the Universal Periodic 
Review, and one indigenous representative to attend the twenty-third session of the Human 
Rights Council. Furthermore, the Board set aside USD 43,600 to allow 15 representatives of 
indigenous communities and organizations &#8211; to be selected at the three inter-sessional meetings 
held in May, August and November 2013 &#8211; to attend the sessions of the Human Rights treaty 
bodies, the Human Rights Council and its UPR process to take place between July 2013 and 
March 2014.  
</p>
<p>18. OHCHR carried out a number of training and briefing sessions as part of its efforts to 
promote the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, including briefings for OHCHR 
staff and for human rights treaty bodies. As part of its work to provide guidance for national 
human rights institutions (NHRIs) on how to advance the principles of the Declaration, 
OHCHR organized a training workshop, held in Swakopmund from 29 to 31 October 2012, for 
the staff of the Ombudsman Office in Namibia and for officials of the Ministries of Justice, 
Education, and Gender Equality and Child Welfare as well as representatives of indigenous 
communities. Participants identified the key human rights challenges severely affecting the San 
and Himba indigenous communities and discussed the relevance of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and in particular its provisions related to the 
right of consultation and participation of indigenous communities in decision-making.  
</p>
<p>19. At the invitation of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights of the Republic of Congo 
and within the framework of the recently launched United Nations Indigenous Peoples&#8217; 
Partnership project in Congo, OHCHR participated in an expert meeting held in Brazzaville 
from 26 to 28 July 2013. The participants discussed follow-up to Law N&#176;5-2011 on the 
Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Indigenous Populations and the development of 
implementing decrees which have been prepared by the Government in response to key 
provisions of the Law. The meeting brought together 42 officials from the different Ministries, 
focal points on indigenous issues from the United Nations Country Team (UNCT), the 
Secretariat of the Human Rights Department of the Ministry of Justice, and 24 indigenous 
representatives from eight provinces. The participants examined seven implementing decrees 
to ensure that the drafts are in line with the principles of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples. OHCHR and members of the UNCT in Brazzaville, including 
UNICEF, UNDP and the United Nations Populations Fund (UNFPA), provided support and 
substantive expertise on the drafts. Decrees were related to the following issues: use of 
traditional knowledge and benefit-sharing; protection of cultural heritage and sacred sites; 
special measures on access to education, health services and protection of traditional medicine; 
procedures of consultation and participation in decision-making concerning development 
programmes; establishment and mandate of the Inter-ministerial Committee on the protection 
of indigenous populations; and citizenship.  
</p>
<p>20. OHCHR organized a seminar entitled &#8220;Strengthening partnership between indigenous 
peoples and States: treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements&#8221;, which took 
place in Geneva from 16 to 17 July 2013. The seminar was chaired by Hon. Justice Williams, 
former Chair of the Waitangi Tribunal in New Zealand, and benefited from the participation of 
experts who introduced various examples of treaties, agreements and other constructive 
arrangements from different regions of the world, demonstrating that this is not an issue that is 
relevant in only a limited number of contexts. They also made a number of recommendations 
aimed at enhancing the implementation of such treaties. Several members of the United 
Nations Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Permanent Forum on 
Indigenous Issues and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination also 
highlighted the critical role of United Nations mechanisms in advancing the issue further and 
promoting implementation of treaties, agreements and other constructive agreements. </p>


<p>21.  OHCHR has also been involved in other United Nations agencies&#8217; policy development 
related to the rights of indigenous peoples, including that undertaken by the Food and 
Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and Global Compact. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Guidance tools 
</b></p>
<p>22. OHCHR continued to support the role of parliamentarians in the protection of the rights 
of indigenous peoples. The Office has jointly authored <i>The United Nations Handbook for 
Parliamentarians: Implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
</i></p>
<p><i>Peoples</i>, together with UNDP, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), 
the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the Secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous 
Issues. The handbook aims to be a practical instrument to enable parliamentarians around the 
world to better understand indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and to provide practical ideas for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>23.  OHCHR further developed its close engagement with NHRIs on indigenous issues. <i>The 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: A Manual for National 
</i></p>
<p><i>Human Rights Institutions</i> was prepared in cooperation with the Asia Pacific Forum, and 
circulated to NHRIs in all regions in 2012. The process of preparing the handbook, which is to 
be issued in 2013, has in itself helped to strengthen NHRI engagement and initiatives focusing 
on the human rights of indigenous peoples. The Manual introduces the background and context 
of the Declaration and focuses on measures which NHRIs can take at the national and 
international level to protect and promote indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. The Guide also presents 
</p>
<p>good practices from different NHRIs to illustrate effective ways of implementing the 
Declaration. 
</p>
<p>24. OHCHR continued to pay special attention to the situation of indigenous peoples in 
voluntary isolation and issued guidelines in May 2012 on indigenous peoples in voluntary 
isolation and initial contact in the Amazon Basin and El Chaco, following a series of 
consultations in the region, aimed at supporting the formulation of national policies rooted in 
non-discrimination and other rights of indigenous peoples. Further to several high-level 
launching events in Peru, Colombia and Paraguay, a number of concrete initiatives are now 
being implemented, with OHCHR field presences and in cooperation with the authorities 
concerned, to promote this new tool and its practical implementation. It has already influenced 
decision-making processes at the national level and helped to ensure that legislation, policies 
and programmes related to indigenous peoples are in line with international human rights 
standards. 
</p>
<p>25.  In 2012, OHCHR published <i>Human Rights Indicators: A Guide to Measurement and 
Implementation</i>, which aims to assist in developing quantitative and qualitative indicators to 
measure progress in the implementation of international human rights norms and principles. 
The Guide refers to the situation of indigenous peoples and provides concrete examples of 
indicators related to the implementation of their human rights. 
</p>
<p>26. In Ecuador, OHCHR published a training of trainers&#8217; guide on the collective rights of 
the peoples and nationalities of Ecuador, tailored to the judiciary, the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, the 
national police and the armed forces. 
</p>
<p>27.  OHCHR is also working on a guidance tool for its field presences on consultation with 
indigenous peoples to ensure a better, shared understanding of the scope, requirements and 
implications of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to consultation. The tool aims to strengthen country-
level capacities for implementation of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to consultation. In May 2013, 
the Office organized a regional seminar in Peru to share and discuss the content of the guidance 
note with indigenous representatives and staff from OHCHR and other relevant United Nations 
agencies. </p>


<p><b> D. Activities of field presences 
</b></p>
<p>28. OHCHR field presences carried out a range of activities on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights at 
the regional and country level, including monitoring, support for legal reform, technical 
cooperation, capacity-building initiatives and awareness-raising. Some of these are highlighted 
above in connection with UNIPP activities, and some selected additional activities are 
described below. OHCHR field presences also consistently supported the work of special 
procedures mandate holders and provided support for the country visits of the High 
Commissioner.  
</p>
<p>29. During the reporting period, OHCHR in Cambodia monitored 72 ongoing and 
unresolved land disputes between affected communities, authorities and businesses in both 
rural and urban areas.  Interventions by OHCHR took the form of facilitation of dialogue, court 
process monitoring, and legal and procedural advice.  OHCHR contributed substantially to 
research and advocacy on the granting and management of economic and other land 
concessions, including those related to agro-industry, mining, hydropower dams and other 
large-scale infrastructure projects, and the human rights impact of concessions, especially in 
recognized protected areas and on indigenous peoples&#8217; land.   
</p>
<p>30. The Office has been working closely with the Ministry of Rural Development and 
Ministry of Interior to promote indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to land in Cambodia. In 
collaboration with ILO and other development partners, OHCHR monitored efforts 
countrywide for indigenous peoples to organize and be recognized as legal entities and apply as 
a community for collective land title, as recognized in the domestic legal framework.   
</p>
<p>31. OHCHR also contributed to advocacy more generally for indigenous peoples&#8217; land 
rights and cultural and linguistic rights with the use of the media (press statements, 
publications and video).  In order to promote more responsible business practices in the land 
sector and to counter inadequate regulation and oversight of businesses operating in Cambodia, 
OHCHR contributed to awareness-raising and capacity-building in the area of business and 
human rights.  OHCHR targeted civil society organizations, government, community 
representatives and business actors to support their increased understanding of concepts in the 
United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and their application in the 
Cambodian context.  OHCHR gave presentations at eight seminars and consultations for civil 
society, reaching over 200 representatives of NGOs and indigenous communities countrywide.  
OHCHR assisted with the development of a picture book on business and human rights for 
indigenous communities, focusing on adequate consultation and compensation.   
</p>
<p>32. With respect to OHCHR work in Africa, the Sub-Regional Centre for Human Rights 
and Democracy in Central Africa (OHCHR Central Africa Regional Office &#8211; CARO) 
organized two sensitization seminars on indigenous peoples for the Government and other 
stakeholders in Cameroon to support the national process towards new legislation on the 
protection of the rights of indigenous peoples in the country 
</p>
<p>33. In 2012, the Regional Office for Central America worked closely with the 
Ombudsperson in Panama on the establishment of an internal mechanism to monitor the human 
rights situation of indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants. The proposal is the result of a 
baseline study of the existing procedures, capabilities and resources of the NHRI to register 
and monitor the human rights situation of indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants. The 
NHRI committed to continuing efforts to further strengthen its capacities in this area with the 
technical support of the Regional Office. It was agreed to draft intervention protocols for cases 
of racial discrimination and human rights violations against indigenous peoples and Afro-
descendant communities in 2013. During the year, NHRI staff awareness of the human rights 
situation of indigenous and Afro-descendant populations was increased.  </p>


<p>34. Under the auspices of the Regional Office, the NHRI organized dialogue sessions with 
indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants. The Office guided the discussions and contributed, 
through these sessions, to building confidence between the indigenous peoples and Afro-
descendant populations on the one hand and the NHRI on the other. These dialogue sessions 
have been a key step in enhancing the credibility of the NHRI and are expected to contribute to 
the improvement of its action and monitoring capacities for the human rights situation of 
indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants in 2013. In addition, the Regional Office encouraged 
the Ombudsperson to appoint the members of the National Commission against Discrimination 
and supported the development of the Operational Annual Plan 2012, the Strategic Plan and the 
Internal Rules of Procedure. In order to develop the Internal Rules of Procedure, the Regional 
Office held several working sessions with the Commission members to clarify key concepts 
and definitions concerning equality and non-discrimination and to highlight how racial 
discrimination occurs in different areas.  
</p>
<p>35. In Bolivia, the Plurinational Constitutional Court (PCC) issued a decision regarding the 
right of indigenous peoples to consultation, specifically of the indigenous communities living 
in the Isiboro Secure National Park and Indigenous Territory (TIPNIS) in June 2012. This 
important decision describes the nature and scope of the right to consultation, the principles 
applicable, the steps to ensuring its enjoyment, and other intertwined rights, such as the right to 
self-determination, according to international standards. OHCHR in Bolivia played a key role 
in assisting the PCC to develop its doctrinal knowledge on the subject matter. The office 
enhanced the awareness of judges and magistrates of these issues by organizing training 
activities, an international seminar and other activities, with the participation of 130 judges and 
judicial officials from the PCC. 
</p>
<p>36. OHCHR in Bolivia also delivered several training sessions on the right to consultation 
and legal pluralism, including for officials from the Ministry of the Interior and 
parliamentarians. These activities improved the knowledge and understanding of elected 
authorities and civil servants of the right of indigenous peoples to consultation, with the aim of 
facilitating the inclusion of international standards in the forthcoming framework law on the 
right of indigenous peoples to consultation. 
</p>
<p>37. The Office in Guatemala provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Energy and 
Mining (MEM). In coordination with the Vice-Ministry of Sustainable Development, the office 
organized two training sessions with the staff of the MEM, on international human rights 
standards and the rights of indigenous peoples, particularly as regards the duty of States to 
consult with indigenous peoples. Following these capacity-building activities and meetings 
with the Vice-Ministry of Sustainable Development, the MEM is leading a discussion with 
other Ministries on a proposal to initiate a dialogue process with indigenous communities that 
would be affected by a project involving a hydroelectric plant and another related to a mining 
operation. The Office is also expecting that this process will open the way for a dialogue 
process in other cases. 
</p>
<p>38. In Ecuador, OHCHR supported the project &#8220;Watching out for racism: critical 
community monitoring of anti-discrimination policies in Ecuador&#8221; carried out by the 
Observatory on Racial Discrimination and Ethnic Exclusion. This important monitoring and 
evaluation mechanism has as its main objective to promote the critical observation of the 
implementation of public policies against racism and racial discrimination, including the 
national action plan against racial discrimination by indigenous and afro-Ecuadorian 
communities. The project generates knowledge about human rights, particularly equality and 
non-discrimination and anti-discriminating public policies in Ecuador among local indigenous 
and afro-Ecuadorian organizations.   
</p>
<p>39. In South America, the Regional Office delivered training on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights 
to the United Nations Country Team in Peru and, in Temuco, Chile, focusing on the rights of 
indigenous children and how to present individual cases to international bodies.  </p>


<p><b> III. Human rights bodies and mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples held its fifth session in July 
</p><p>2012. It discussed the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, including an interactive 
dialogue with a representative from the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the Special 
Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples.  The Expert Mechanism adopted its final report 
on its study on the role of languages and culture in the promotion and protection of the rights 
and identity of indigenous peoples, including its advice No. 3 (2012) on indigenous peoples&#8217; 
cultures and languages and advice No. 4 (2012) on indigenous peoples and the right to 
participate in decision-making, with a focus on extractive industries. The study, together with a 
number of proposals made by the Expert Mechanism, was presented to the Human Rights 
Council at its twenty-first session in September 2012, which included an interactive dialogue 
with representatives of the Expert Mechanism.  
</p>
<p>41. In February 2013, OHCHR organized an expert seminar on access to justice in the 
promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples in cooperation with the Columbia 
University Institute for the Study of Human Rights and the International Center for 
Transitional Justice. The main objective of the seminar was to obtain additional substantive 
input to the thematic study of the Expert Mechanism on access to justice in the promotion and 
protection of the rights of indigenous peoples, to be discussed at the sixth session of the Expert 
Mechanism in July 2013.  
</p>
<p>42. The Expert Mechanism undertook a number of intersessional activities, including 
participation in preparatory meetings on the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, in the 
Forum on Minority Issues and in the twelfth session of the United Nations Permanent Forum 
on Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Issues. The Expert Mechanism also briefed a number of the human 
</p>
<p>rights treaty bodies on its work and especially its studies related to the rights of indigenous 
peoples. 
</p>
<p>43. OHCHR has also played an active role in the efforts to raise the profile of indigenous 
peoples in the context of the Human Rights Council, including through its support to the Expert 
Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and by organizing, during the twenty-first 
session of the Human Rights Council in September 2012, a Human Rights Council panel on 
indigenous peoples&#8217; issues, devoted to indigenous peoples&#8217; access to justice.  
</p>
<p>44. Furthermore, OHCHR provided support to the members of the Expert Mechanism on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in their engagement with activities associated with their work 
throughout the year, including attendance at the African Commission on Human and Peoples 
Rights; the consultation by UNESCO about engagement with indigenous peoples; the Forum 
on Business and Human Rights, and preliminary meetings associated with the organization of 
the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples. Through such contributions, the Expert 
Mechanism helped to enhance the visibility of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in these forums, in 
particular their right to participate in decision-making. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>45. The various activities that the Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
has carried out in the past year fall within four areas of work: promoting good practices, 
thematic studies, country reports, and responding to cases of alleged human rights violations. 
With respect to the development of thematic studies, the Special Rapporteur has made 
continued progress in his ongoing study on the issue of extractive industries affecting 
indigenous peoples. He has attended numerous workshops to gather information and exchange </p>


<p>ideas with indigenous representatives, business enterprises and non-governmental 
organizations about the issue. The Special Rapporteur also launched an online forum for 
gathering inputs regarding specific cases of extractive projects affecting indigenous peoples. 
He will present his final report to the Human Rights Council on this issue in September 2013.  
</p>
<p>46. Between May 2012 and April 2013, the Special Rapporteur carried out country visits to 
the United States, El Salvador, and Namibia. In March 2012, he also held a consultation with 
indigenous representatives from throughout the Asia region in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to 
gather information about concerns of indigenous peoples in Asia. Within this time frame, the 
Special Rapporteur has also sent numerous communications to governments regarding specific 
cases. In many of these cases, the Special Rapporteur has sent follow-up letters to the 
governments concerned with his observations on the case and recommendations for addressing 
the issues involved in accordance with relevant international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur continued to cooperate with the Permanent Forum on 
Indigenous Issues and the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. They met to 
share work agendas, identify the strengths and limitations of their respective mandates, and 
explore methods of channelling their work in the most effective way.  
</p>
<p>48. During the reporting period, other special procedure mandate holders also looked into 
the situation of indigenous peoples within their respective mandates. For example, the report of 
the Special Rapporteur on violence against women on gender-related killings of women 
addressed the extremely high levels of violence experienced by indigenous women 
(A/HRC/20/16). Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water 
and sanitation referred in her thematic report to the Council on the links between stigma and 
the human rights framework (A/HRC/21/42) to the situation of indigenous peoples who are 
disproportionately excluded from access to water and sanitation and are often neglected in 
terms of access to services.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally 
sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes addressed indigenous 
peoples&#8217; issues in the report of his visit to the Marshall Islands and the United States of 
</p>
<p>America (A/HRC/21/48/Add.1) in which he recommended the implementation of mechanisms 
that strengthen the capacity of indigenous peoples to further their own development priorities. 
</p>
<p>50. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food addressed indigenous peoples&#8217; 
issues in a number of contexts, including in the report on his visit to Canada 
(A/HRC/22/50/Add.1), in which he drew attention, inter alia, to the long history of political 
and economic marginalization that has left many indigenous peoples living in poverty with 
considerably lower levels of access to adequate food relative to the general population. 
</p>
<p>51. The United Nations Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises called on States and businesses to address the 
heightened risk of vulnerability of groups, including indigenous peoples, affected by business 
activities. In its first report to the Human Rights Council, the Working Group recognized that 
some groups and individuals, including indigenous peoples, face particularly significant 
obstacles when seeking remedies for business-related human rights grievances. The Working 
Group further noted that indigenous peoples in all regions are profoundly and 
disproportionately affected by business-related activities, such as resource extraction and 
infrastructure development and the fact that they frequently face discrimination in law and 
social practice and are marginalized in the development of policies, laws and regulations that 
have a bearing on business and human rights issues that affect them. The Working Group 
therefore announced that it would specifically address the situation of indigenous peoples as a 
group vulnerable to the impact of business activities. 
</p>
<p>52. The Working Group met with indigenous experts in Copenhagen in November 2012, to 
discuss challenges relating to the implementation of the United Nations Guiding Principles </p>


<p>with regard to indigenous peoples. These challenges were also the topic of a panel discussion 
during the first annual Forum on Business and Human Rights in Geneva in December 2012. At 
its third session (26-30 November 2012), the Working Group decided to submit a thematic 
report to the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly in 2013 that will focus on the 
situation of indigenous peoples with regard to the prevention of negative impacts of business 
activities on the rights of indigenous peoples, and addressing such impacts when they occur. 
The Working Group invited relevant stakeholders to a public consultation on this thematic 
report held in Geneva in February 2013. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination continued to pay particular 
attention to the situation of indigenous peoples in its early warning and urgent action 
procedures and its consideration of the reports by State parties. It raised indigenous peoples&#8217; 
issues in its concluding observations on Belize, Fiji, Finland, Thailand, New Zealand and the 
Russian Federation. In particular, the Committee highlighted the need to establish mechanisms 
for constructive dialogue and participation, and to establish effective consultation processes 
with affected communities, according to international standards, for any project that may affect 
indigenous people&#8217;s territory or have an impact on their livelihood. It further reiterated the 
importance of providing education in indigenous languages, including by training more 
teachers in indigenous languages. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women raised indigenous peoples&#8217; issues in its concluding observations on Indonesia and 
</p>
<p>Mexico and also commented on the situation of indigenous peoples in Chile. 
</p>
<p>54. During the period under review, the Human Rights Committee addressed the situation 
of indigenous peoples in its concluding observations on Kenya, Paraguay, Peru and Belize. It 
recommended, for example, that in planning its development and natural resource conservation 
projects the authorities should respect the rights of indigenous groups to their ancestral land 
and ensure that their traditional livelihood that is inextricably linked to their land is fully 
respected.  
</p>
<p>55. The Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights raised questions concerning 
indigenous peoples in the Congo, Ecuador, New Zealand and Tanzania. In particular, the 
Committee expressed concern about the adverse effects as a result of the extractive industries&#8217; 
activities on the health of indigenous peoples, in particular on the access to safe drinking water. 
It is also concerned that independent impact assessments on water, air and soil conditions are 
not always carried out prior to the granting of licences to companies. The Committee was 
further concerned that effective consultation and prior informed consent of indigenous peoples 
is not systematically sought in decision-making processes relating to the exploitation of natural 
resources in their traditional territories.  
</p>
<p>56. Indigenous peoples in Canada, Peru and Ecuador were addressed also in the concluding 
observations by the Committee against Torture. The Committee on the Rights of the Child 
issued conclusions and recommendations concerning indigenous peoples in Australia, Canada, 
Namibia and Vietnam. The Committee on the Rights of Migrant Workers raised indigenous 
peoples&#8217; issues in its concluding observations on Paraguay. The Committee on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities raised indigenous peoples&#8217; issues in its concluding observations on 
Argentina, Paraguay and Peru. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Universal Periodic Review 
</b></p>
<p>57. Issues concerning indigenous peoples were frequently addressed in the context of the 
Universal Periodic Review. They were raised in many national reports, compilations of United </p>


<p>Nations information, and summaries of stakeholders&#8217; information and recommendations, 
including those made at the three sessions covered by the present report. For example, at the 
thirteenth session of the universal periodic review, from 21 May to 4 June 2012, 
recommendations with reference to indigenous peoples were made in respect of Brazil, 
Ecuador, Finland, Indonesia and the Philippines. During the fourteenth session, from 22 
October to 5 November 2012, recommendations with reference to indigenous peoples were 
made in the context of the reviews of Argentina, Gabon, Guatemala and Peru. At the fifteenth 
session, from 21 January to 1 February 2013, recommendations with reference to indigenous 
peoples were made in respect of Botswana.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>The rights of indigenous peoples have remained a priority for OHCHR. During the 
period under review, OHCHR further strengthened its work to advance the rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous peoples at the country level and increased its efforts to give practical guidance 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the content of the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Indigenous Peoples to various key stakeholders ranging from Parliamentarians to 
</b></p>
<p><b>national human rights institutions.  
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The United Nations Indigenous Peoples Partnership (UNIPP) initiative has also 
prompted United Nations partners to come together coherently, guided by the principles 
</b></p>
<p><b>set forth in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and ILO 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent 
</b></p>
<p><b>Countries. OHCHR has worked closely with the indigenous experts and United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>agencies involved to ensure that all UNIPP country programmes are not merely about 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous peoples, but also designed and implemented with their participation, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implemented in true partnership with indigenous peoples and States. 
</b></p>
