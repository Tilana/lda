<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eleventh 
session from 2 to 13 May 2011. The review of Latvia was held at the 7th meeting on 5 May 
</p><p>2011. The delegation of Latvia was headed by Andris Teikmanis, State Secretary, Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs. At its 11th meeting held on 9 May 2011, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Latvia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Latvia: Hungary, Guatemala, Kyrgyzstan. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Latvia: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/LVA/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/LVA/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/LVA/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Latvia through the troika. These questions 
are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of delegation highlighted the importance of the UPR for human rights 
protection and promotion. He introduced the delegation which included various portfolios 
from the Government, and indicated that various other stakeholders, including the civil 
society, had been involved in preparing the national report. 
</p>
<p>6. Since the restoration of independence, Latvia started its path as a democratic and 
sovereign State and acceded to more than 50 international human rights instruments, 
including the core human rights treaties. Latvia was one of the first states to issue a 
standing invitation to United Nations special procedures and an active promoter of such 
standing invitations. 
</p>
<p>7. Latvia is a member of various European organizations promoting human rights, and 
regularly undergoes scrutiny of its human rights record, including through binding 
judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>8. Latvia has developed modern comprehensive legislation and an institutional system 
for the protection of human rights. Its Constitution includes a chapter on fundamental 
rights, and individuals could file complaints with the Constitutional Court. Based on the 
previous national human rights office, the Office of the Ombudsman was created in 2007 in 
conformity with the Paris Principles. Within its mandate covering human rights and good 
governance, the Ombudsman also has the power to submit an application to the 
Constitutional Court and to a court of general jurisdiction. </p>


<p>9. Latvian society is multi-ethnic and has a long history of interethnic tolerance. Latvia 
guarantees cultural autonomy for all its national minorities and provides significant support 
for strengthening their identities. National minorities actively use their constitutionally 
guaranteed rights and Latvia financially ensures education in eight national minority 
languages.  
</p>
<p>10. Latvia referred to the 2001 State Program for Society Integration and indicated that 
it was currently elaborating new draft policy guidelines on integration. One example of 
successful integration policy, highlighted by the Council of Europe as a good practice, is 
the integration of the Roma into Latvian society with the recent development of a special 
programme of professional training for teacher assistants with Roma background. 
</p>
<p>11. Latvia has devoted much effort and resources to ensuring that persons belonging to 
national minorities and recent immigrants obtain good knowledge of the Latvian language. 
The results are encouraging and knowledge of Latvian is steadily improving in all segments 
of the society. 
</p>
<p>12. Given the specific demographic situation prevailing in the 1990s, Latvia granted the 
special temporary status of non-citizens to former USSR citizens residing in Latvia and 
who did not have any other citizenship. Non-citizens enjoy most of the rights guaranteed to 
Latvian citizens. A new citizenship law was adopted in 1994 and a naturalization procedure 
was introduced. Since then, the number of non-citizens has decreased by more than 50 per 
cent. Latvia remains committed to the process of civic integration. 
</p>
<p>13. Latvia considers cooperation between State and non-State actors essential, and State 
institutions and municipalities closely cooperated with NGOs through consultative 
institutions and mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>14. In response to advance questions, Latvia indicated that it had achieved remarkable 
results on gender equality, although further work was still needed to achieve full de facto 
equality. It continues to promote measures aimed at a better reconciliation of family duties 
and employment and at enhancing women's participation in political and economic 
decision-making. Latvia monitors progress achieved in this respect and is currently revising 
existing policy planning documents to incorporate newly emerging issues. 
</p>
<p>15. The Program for Eliminating Domestic Violence was implemented, notably through 
three priority activities: identification, prevention and institutional cooperation in the 
provision of assistance and rehabilitation services. Training, public information, access to 
psychological assistance and social rehabilitation services for child victims were some 
issues mentioned. Domestic violence is also included in the 2011 State Family Policy 
Guidelines and, since 2011, it is considered an aggravating circumstance in criminal law. 
Criminal procedure law also provides for restraining orders as a safety measure in cases of 
domestic violence. Latvia plans to introduce social rehabilitation for adults, victims of 
domestic violence soon. 
</p>
<p>16. Latvia indicated that the number and percentage of non-citizens continue to decrease 
steadily and currently stands at 14.5 per cent as compared to 29 per cent in 1995. Latvia 
continues to take measures to further facilitate the acquisition of citizenship. 
</p>
<p>17. Latvian Constitution and law prohibit discrimination on various grounds, including 
sexual orientation, and Latvia is in the process of transposing relevant European Union 
(EU) directives on non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p>18. Regarding hate crimes, in addition to specific provisions, the Criminal Law defines 
racial motivation as an aggravating circumstance and due attention is paid to the specifics 
of investigating racist or homophobic crimes. Police personnel, prosecutors and judges are 
trained on issues related to intolerance, racism and anti-Semitism. Topics relating to the 
Holocaust, anti-Semitism and xenophobia are included in school curricula. </p>


<p>19. Latvia is making significant efforts to improve conditions of detention and ensure 
compliance with international standards. Substantial efforts have been made to implement 
the Government policy on resocialization of inmates and efficient functioning of the 
Probation Service is a priority in order to extend the use of alternative sanctions. 
</p>
<p>20. Latvia indicated that the definition of torture was included in the Criminal Law in 
</p><p>2009. A special unit within the State police has been assigned to investigate allegations of 
ill-treatment by the police. Regular steps are also taken to improve the quality of 
investigation and training. 
</p>
<p>21. The procedure to amend the relevant legislation regarding the abolition of the death 
penalty in times of war is underway. 
</p>
<p>22. Children have always been a priority for Latvia. An effective children&#8217;s rights 
protection system is in place and the State Inspectorate for the Protection of Children&#8217;s 
Rights is the main institution for monitoring compliance with children&#8217;s rights. The 
delegation mentioned other institutions, such as the Orphans Courts as well as a hotline 
providing psychological support to children and teenagers. Latvia has developed a specific 
policy planning document to address the problem of juvenile delinquency. Local 
governments address the issue of availability of public kindergartens and the Government 
has made significant efforts to maintain the system of social benefits for families. 
</p>
<p>23. Latvia ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and its Optional Protocol in 2010, and adopted an action plan for its 
implementation. National law already prohibits discrimination based on disability. A 
special working group composed of Government institutions, the Office of the Ombudsman 
and NGOs worked on the draft guidelines for implementing the Convention. In 2011, there 
was a slight increase in the employment of disabled persons. Latvia mentioned various 
ongoing activities relating to environment accessibility for disabled persons. 
</p>
<p>24. Latvia has introduced a strategy and information campaigns for preventing human 
trafficking, including on the risks of marriages of convenience. The police work with the 
representatives of vulnerable groups at risk of being trafficked and border guards are 
trained to identify possible cases of trafficking. Victims of trafficking are provided 
psychological rehabilitation, legal and medical support through good cooperation with 
NGOs.  
</p>
<p>25. The Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (KNAB) is the leading 
specialized anti-corruption authority since 2002. Its aim is to fight corruption in a 
coordinated and comprehensive way. Several proposals to improve its efficiency have been 
recently submitted and a working group had been set up in this respect. 
</p>
<p>26. Although Latvia is determined to continue cooperation with international 
organizations, its current human and institutional capacity is limited. As such, Latvia is 
very cautious about ratifying new instruments. Although Latvia is proud of its human rights 
record and achievements, it understands that there is still room for improvement and 
development, as human rights are not static, but rather reflect the challenges faced by  
society at the given moment in time. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>27. During the interactive dialogue, 43 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>28. The Russian Federation stated that the documents submitted for the UPR testify to 
the continued discriminatory policy directed to Russian-speaking permanent residents in 
Latvia. 327,000 people, or 14 percent of the population, are &#8220;non-citizens&#8221;. Non-citizens </p>


<p>are not recognized as national minorities by the legislation and put beyond the framework 
of the relevant international treaties. Thus, they were deprived of fundamental rights and 
freedoms. It stated that the Russian-language information and cultural-educational space 
was reduced. The Russian Federation expressed concern about the increase in neo-Nazism, 
xenophobia and anti-Semitism. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. Uzbekistan noted with appreciation the recent steps taken by Latvia to protect 
human rights and establish the Office of the Ombudsman. It expressed concerns about 
overcrowding in penitentiary institutions. It also referred to children with minor disabilities 
who were frequently institutionalized due to the lack of child-care capacity. Uzbekistan 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>30. Poland expressed its appreciation for the continued efforts made by Latvia to 
strengthen its national human rights system. It welcomed all the pledges made by Latvia 
while seeking election to the Human Rights Council. It noted that in spite of efforts 
undertaken, including the launch of special programmes, inequalities in the enjoyment of 
human rights in some areas still persisted. Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. The Republic of Moldova noted that Latvia was party to the main international 
human rights instruments. It recalled that the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, 
child prostitution and child pornography had encouraged Latvia to allocate sufficient funds 
to all child protection programs. The Republic of Moldova also referred to the 
recommendations made by the Committee against Torture and the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child to continue adopting measures to prosecute and punish those responsible for 
trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Algeria noted that the economic reforms and efforts undertaken by the Government 
had enabled Latvia to be among the first 50 countries in the Human Development Index. It 
welcomed the actions carried out by Latvia in the fields of social integration and the fight 
against discrimination. Algeria encouraged Latvia to step up its efforts to implement the 
Program for the Elimination of Domestic Violence and ensure wider education on the 
subject. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Estonia commended Latvia for the establishment of the National Human Rights 
Office in 1995 and the ratification of core international human rights instruments. It also 
welcomed the steps taken to combat human trafficking and the ratification of the Palermo 
Protocol, as well as the special attention given to the protection of women&#8217;s rights. Estonia 
commended Latvia for its achievements in the naturalization process. It stated that the 
Government&#8217;s integration strategy has resulted in the protection of ethnic minorities. 
</p>
<p>34. Canada commended Latvia for its initiatives in the field of human rights, such as its 
active engagement in combating human trafficking, labour exploitation and smuggling of 
illegal immigrants. It welcomed Latvia&#8217;s ongoing efforts to improve the integration of 
immigrants and refugees. Canada praised the efforts to establish a system for the 
reintegration of convicts in places of imprisonment and to clients of the State Probation 
Service. Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. France enquired about Latvia&#8217;s intention to amend its Constitution and legislation in 
order to include the principle of gender equality and to strengthen its legislation to prohibit 
and repress all forms of discrimination, particularly on the basis of race and sexual 
orientation. France also requested whether Latvia considered defining new guidelines in its 
integration and national identity policy. France asked about the relevant stakeholders in the 
elaboration of the new programme on society integration. Finally, it stressed the high 
number of &#8220;non citizens and stateless persons&#8221; living in the country and enquired about the 
measures that Latvia intended to take to provide them with citizenship. France made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>36. Morocco highlighted the issue of human trafficking, referring to Latvia as a country 
of origin, and praised Latvia for its achievements in combating this scourge. It recalled the 
importance of international cooperation on this issue. Morocco also raised the issue of 
fictitious marriages that lead in certain cases to human trafficking or labour exploitation. It 
sought further information relating to the measures undertaken by Latvia to address this 
challenge and its expectations for international cooperation. It also enquired whether Latvia 
had included a human rights dimension in school curricula and about the training of judges, 
lawyers, security and police forces.  Morocco made a recommendation.   
</p>
<p>37. Azerbaijan noted with satisfaction Latvia&#8217;s cooperation with United Nations human 
rights mechanisms. It noted the legal protection for the rights of women and the Program 
for Eliminating Domestic Violence 2008-2011. It welcomed the measures taken to promote 
children&#8217;s rights and the efforts to protect the rights of persons with disabilities. Azerbaijan 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Germany acknowledged Latvia&#8217;s efforts to promote a peaceful coexistence of 
groups of different language origin. It asked whether Latvia planned to proceed with the 
ratification of Protocol No. 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms. Germany also enquired about measures taken to address pretrial 
detention and the high risk of ill-treatment it entailed, and human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>39. Bulgaria commended Latvia for the establishment in 2007 of the National Human 
Rights Office in accordance with the Paris Principles and the implementation of the 
National Programme for the Promotion of Tolerance 2005-2009. It asked about the progress 
achieved in implementing the State Language Law and the recommendations of the 
European Commission against Racism and Intolerance on the implementation of this Law.  
</p>
<p>40. Norway was concerned about the capacity of the Ombudsman for human rights. It 
was pleased that Latvia offered protection and rehabilitation programs to victims of human 
trafficking. It expressed concern about the deterioration of children&#8217;s rights as a result of 
the financial crisis. It was concerned about the large number of non-citizens and stressed 
that pro-active measures were needed to address this issue. Norway made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Czech Republic welcomed Latvia&#8217;s voluntary pledge as a candidate to the Human 
Rights Council to consider ratifying human rights treaties and avoiding reservations. Czech 
Republic made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. While encouraged about the reforms undertaken to reduce the number of non-
citizens residing in Latvia, Austria enquired as to how Latvia ensured that these people 
enjoyed equal economic, social and cultural rights. Austria also inquired about the steps 
taken to ensure that all children born in Latvia from eligible non-citizens acquired Latvian 
citizenship. Austria asked about efforts made to reduce overcrowding in prisons and about 
the new model for the reintegration and employment of ex-convicts. Austria made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Spain commended Latvia on its National Programme for the Promotion of 
Tolerance. It noted that Latvia was the only country in Europe that still maintained the 
death penalty in its legislation, though only for cases of murder in times of war. Spain 
welcomed Latvia&#8217;s moratorium on the death penalty established in 2006. Spain made 
recommendations. 
</p>

<p>public sphere and better equal participation in the economic sphere. Argentina made 
recommendations. 
</p>

standing invitation to special procedures. It referred to the concerns expressed by United 
Nations human rights mechanisms and civil society at the persistence of the issue of non-
citizens. It acknowledged Latvia&#8217;s efforts to promote the rights of persons living with 
HIV/AIDS. Brazil asked Latvia to comment on the impact that the financial crisis had on 
the enjoyment of social, economic and cultural rights. Brazil made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Lithuania noted the efforts undertaken by Latvia in guaranteeing human rights 
principles, although it acknowledged that some challenges remained. It welcomed Latvia&#8217;s 
initiative to prepare cross-regional statements at the Human Rights Council concerning

their advance questions, Lithuania made recommendations. 
</p>

made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Chile commended the measures taken by Latvia to promote and protect human

measures aimed at eliminating hate crimes through information and education and early 
detection and definition of these crimes. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Hungary commended Latvia on its steps to combat human trafficking. It welcomed 
the moratorium on the death penalty in addition to the abolition of capital punishment for 
crimes committed in peacetime, but noted that the Criminal Code still contains provisions 
on the death penalty during wartime. Hungary enquired whether strengthening of the 
Ombudsman&#8217;s office would provide additional tools to protect victims of domestic 
violence. Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. The Netherlands noted that Latvia was one of the first states to issue a standing 
invitation to human rights special procedures. It stated that lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender (LGBT) people may suffer discrimination and be subject to hate speech. It also 
highlighted the high number of non-citizens, representing about 15 per cent of the 
population and the concerns raised by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the Committee against Torture, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Special Rapporteur on racism, among 
others, about the integration of non-citizens. The Netherlands made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. Palestine noted with appreciation Latvia&#8217;s close cooperation with United Nations

legal system. Palestine made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Mexico acknowledged Latvia&#8217;s efforts to improve the legal and institutional 
framework by, inter alia, the establishment of the Ombudsman and the adoption of a law to 
combat discrimination against persons with disabilities. It encouraged Latvia to give 
priority to the development and consolidation of the work done by the Ombudsman, as well </p>


<p>as the full enforcement of existing human rights standards to which Latvia is a party. 
Mexico made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>53. Belarus noted with satisfaction a number of measures taken by Latvia to combat 
trafficking in human beings. It asked about Latvia&#8217;s experience in implementing the 
national programme for combating human trafficking, 2004&#8211;2008 and whether Latvia

</p>
<p>54. While expressing its appreciation for the efforts undertaken by Latvia to protect 
human rights, the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concerns about various issues, such as 
racially motivated statements in the media targeting immigrants, asylum-seekers, refugees 
and certain ethnic groups, overcrowding in prisons and the situation of certain minorities, 
especially the Roma. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>55. The United States of America commended Latvia for working to promote tolerance 
and an integrated society. It encouraged Latvia to continue its efforts to promote respect for 
the human rights of all and to continue implementation of the National Program for the 
Promotion of Tolerance. The United States urged Latvia to strengthen its legal framework 
to combat hate crimes and discrimination and to take steps to address the obstacles in 
integrating members of the Russian-speaking minority. It expressed concern about the 
prolonged periods of pretrial detention, ill-treatment and deplorable conditions in detention 
facilities. The United States made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Paraguay highlighted the implementation of the action plan to reduce unregistered 
employment, 2010-2013 aimed at consolidating sustainable and long-term employment.  It 
also expressed interest in the setting-up of a rehabilitation system for inmates that promotes 
parole programmes and the development of specific instruments of rehabilitation for 
inmates. It asked for further information in this regard. Paraguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Latvia thanked all the delegations for their comments and recommendations. The 
delegation recalled that Latvia has experienced a severe economic crisis in recent years and 
the Government has had to take severe measures to cut budget and salaries, while at the 
same time safeguard social protection. Latvian economy has started to recover. Due to 
increased unemployment, a special system of social safety measures was introduced to cope 
with this situation. Various structural reforms have been undertaken in the areas of health 
care and education, such as the reform of the medical-care system, aimed at improving 
operational efficiency and reducing costs. 
</p>
<p>58. Regarding integration, the Latvian delegation stated that the conceptual framework 
for a new integration programme has been put forward for public discussion. The 
programme encompasses several issues relating to civic integration such as civil society 
and democratic participation, the development of Latvian language skills, strengthening the 
sense of belonging to the country and attracting Latvian nationals living abroad. It referred 
to an old diaspora who left Latvia after the Second World War, and a new diaspora who left 
Latvia because of the recent economic crisis. The programme is also aimed at maintaining 
links with these diasporas. 
</p>
<p>59. Latvia pays particular attention to the preservation of the Latvian language, as the 
proportion of Latvians living in Latvia has decreased from 77 per cent in the 1930s to 52 
per cent in 1989. However, translation is provided in specific circumstances. 
</p>
<p>60. The Citizenship Law adopted in 1994 takes into account the figures and was 
designed in collaboration with regional organizations. Further to a referendum held in 1998, 
the law was amended and the naturalization procedure was facilitated. Non-citizens could 
become Latvian citizens by simply passing a language test. Older people are only required </p>


<p>to pass an oral exam and naturalization fees are very low. Information campaigns have been 
organized. However, according to a survey, the economic situation is more important than 
obtaining Latvian citizenship. Non-citizens enjoyed most of the rights of citizen and may 
even travel to the Russian Federation without paying for a visa, unlike Latvian citizens. 
</p>
<p>61. Regarding children of non-citizens, the Ministry of Interior has just proposed new 
provisions to ease their registration as citizens. Such children could already become citizens 
by simple registration; the new measures ease the process even more. 
</p>
<p>62. Latvia condemns in absolute terms all totalitarian ideologies, including Nazism and 
neo-Nazism. The delegation referred to several criminal cases involving expression on the 
Internet. There were no Nazi marches in Latvia.  
</p>
<p>63. Latvia recalled that the Constitution guarantees the principle of non-discrimination, 
and criminal law criminalizes all forms of discrimination and all acts of racial hatred and 
intolerance. Racist motivation was considered as an aggravating circumstance. Marital rape 
was already criminalized.  
</p>
<p>64. Although the death penalty is still applicable in wartime, the four relevant 
commissions in Parliament held a debate in 2011, and all explicitly supported its abolition. 
The Ministry of Justice has initiated the process for the ratification of relevant treaties and 
amendment to the criminal law. 
</p>
<p>65. Since the establishment of the Probation Service, alternative sanctions are 
increasingly used and more crimes can be punished through such sanctions. New major 
criminal law reforms are intended to decrease the use of detention while increasing the use 
of alternative sanctions. Rehabilitation of inmates is also at the forefront of the reforms. A 
new detention centre for juvenile prisoners has been created and about 5 million Euros has 
been allocated for renewing existing prisons. Furthermore, public-private partnerships are 
under consideration to build new prisons. 
</p>
<p>66. The Constitution and a number of laws guarantee gender equality. The Ministry of 
Welfare together with relevant stakeholders, including NGOs, have been working on the 
elaboration of a new planning policy document on gender equality and domestic violence 
for the next two years. 
</p>
<p>67. A large number of women are political leaders or hold managerial positions in 
enterprises. Child development in the family is a national priority. Latvia assists families of 
disabled children through various services. In 2011, Latvia discussed a reform on the legal 
capacity of mentally disabled persons pursuant to a decision of the Constitutional Court. 
</p>
<p>68. Equal access to education is provided for ethnic minorities and Latvia finances 
education in eight minority languages. In response to demographic challenges, a number of 
schools have been closed; more Latvian-language schools than minority schools have been 
closed. The State provides funds on an equal basis for students in minority and Latvian 
schools. Respect for diversity, civic education and ethics, among others, are included in 
school curricula and in continuing education curricula for teachers. 
</p>
<p>69. With regard to human trafficking, since 2000, Latvia has had in place an effective 
system to combat human trafficking. To date, only a few cases have been reported. Latvia 
went beyond the Palermo Protocol in that the use of force against potential victims of 
sexual exploitation is not a precondition for instituting a criminal case against traffickers. 
Latvia has a system to identify victims and a budget is allocated for the identification and 
rehabilitation of victims. 
</p>
<p>70. Regarding society integration, the Ministry of Culture supports ethnic minorities 
through various financial instruments. Latvia engages, at different levels, various 
consultative bodies representing ethnic minorities. Funds are also provided to combat </p>


<p>intolerance. The development of language skills is a tool to enhance employment and 
education. 
</p>
<p>71. Slovenia noted with appreciation that Latvia has ratified the majority of core human 
rights instruments, including the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. It also welcomed the fact that the definition of torture 
has recently been incorporated into the Criminal Code. Slovenia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>72. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was pleased to note the 
establishment of the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office and encouraged strengthening its capacity and 
seeking its accreditation. The United Kingdom enquired about national responses to 
allegations of all forms of discrimination. It welcomed the work to update the State 
programme for society integration and proposed new policy guidelines. It requested further 
details on measures planned and the revised programme to strengthen the integration of 
minority groups. It enquired about the steps taken to prevent human trafficking and
