<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 7/10 of 27 March 2008, on human rights and arbitrary deprivation of 
nationality, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General &#8220;to collect information 
on this question from all relevant sources and to make it available to the Council at its tenth 
session&#8221;. The present report contains a summary of the replies received. 
</p>
<p>2. In response to a note verbale dated 26 May 2008, information was received from the 
Governments of Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, 
Burkina Faso, Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Finland, Georgia, Greece, Guatemala, 
Iraq, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jamaica, Kuwait, Mauritius, Monaco, Montenegro, Qatar, 
Russian Federation, Spain, the Syrian Arab Republic, Ukraine and Venezuela (Bolivarian 
Republic of). In response to letters sent to various intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations on 13 June, 24 September and 6 October 2008, the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and Refugees International provided further 
information. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  REPLIES RECEIVED FROM GOVERNMENTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Algeria 
</b></p>
<p>3.  The Government of Algeria stated that Algerian legislation contains most of the relevant 
provisions of international treaties concerning the right to a nationality. Article 30 of the 
Constitution of Algeria regulates issues related to Algerian citizenship. The Algerian Law on 
Nationality does not contain specific provisions on stateless persons, but it provides sufficient 
guarantees to combat statelessness according to international law and international human rights 
law. The Government indicated that Algerian citizenship is obtained at birth if the mother is an 
Algerian citizen. Children born in Algeria from unknown parents are also considered as Algerian 
citizens. 
</p>
<p>4. Article 18 of the Law on Nationality provides that dual nationality is not recognized by 
Algerian legislation. Algerian citizens who acquire a foreign nationality lose their Algerian 
citizenship. According to articles 20 and 21 of the Law on Nationality, children are not affected 
by the loss of Algerian citizenship of their parents. The Government reported that article 19 of 
the Law on Nationality, which established that persons lost their Algerian citizenship if they 
worked for a foreign country or for an international organization to which Algeria is not a 
member, was abrogated. 
</p>
<p>5. The Law on Nationality establishes the conditions for the loss of Algerian citizenship, 
including situations of persons who are accused of a crime affecting public order and persons 
who are accused in Algeria or abroad of a crime against Algerian interests and is imprisoned for 
more than five years. Naturalized Algerian citizens may be deprived of their Algerian citizenship 
if it was obtained through illegal means or fraud. Persons who have been deprived of their 
Algerian citizenship have the right to judicial remedy within 18 months of the decision to 
deprive them of their citizenship. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Angola 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Government of Angola stated that article 18 of the Constitution of Angola regulates 
the right to a nationality. Angolan nationality can be obtained at birth or by naturalization. Those 
persons whose father or mother is an Angolan national are born Angolans. Also, persons born on 
Angolan territory are presumed to be Angolan nationals. The conditions for the attribution, 
acquisition, loss and reacquisition of Angolan nationality are determined by the law. The 
Constitution also establishes that Angolan nationals may not be deprived of their Angolan 
citizenship if it was obtained at birth. 
</p>
<p><b>Azerbaijan 
</b>7. The Government of Azerbaijan stated that, according to its Constitution, persons born in 
Azerbaijan are considered citizens of Azerbaijan. Persons whose parents are citizens of 
Azerbaijan are also considered citizens of Azerbaijan. According to article 3 of the Law on 
Citizenship all citizens of Azerbaijan are equal, irrespective of how citizenship was obtained. 
Article 53 of the Constitution and article 2 of the Law on Citizenship provide that citizens of 
Azerbaijan shall not be deprived of their citizenship. According to article 5 of the Law on 
Citizenship, citizenship of Azerbaijan is awarded to persons who were not citizens of Azerbaijan 
or of any other State but registered their domicile in Azerbaijan before 1 January 1992. 
Citizenship of Azerbaijan may also be given to refugees who took refuge in Azerbaijan 
between 1 January 1988 and 1 January 1992. 
</p>
<p><b>Belarus 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Government of Belarus stated that issues relating to citizenship are regulated by its 
Constitution and by the Law on Citizenship. The law prescribes that persons shall not be 
arbitrarily deprived of their nationality on any grounds. Citizenship may be terminated by 
voluntary renunciation of citizenship or as a result of acts foreseen in the law. Persons may 
apply to renounce their citizenship of Belarus, except in situations where renunciation of 
citizenship would place the person in a situation of statelessness. Persons may lose their 
citizenship, inter alia, as a result of being recruited to the military, the police, the security 
services, or judicial institutions of another State. Persons may in no case be deprived of their 
nationality if as a result they are placed in a situation of statelessness. 
</p>
<p><b>Bosnia and Herzegovina 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina stated that article 7.1 of its Constitution 
regulates nationality issues. No person may be deprived of Bosnia and Herzegovina or any of its 
constitutive Entities&#8217; citizenship on any ground. All persons who were citizens of the Republic of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina prior to the entry into force of the Constitution are considered citizens 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
</p>
<p>10. According to the Government, citizenship may be withdrawn, inter alia, in the following 
cases: if the regulations in force in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time of the 
naturalization had not been applied; if the citizenship was acquired by means of fraudulent 
conduct; in a case of a lack of a genuine link between Bosnia and Herzegovina and a citizen 
habitually not residing in Bosnia and Herzegovina; if a person concerned did not respond to the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>general call for submission of information on status within the time frame determined in the call; 
when a Bosnian national is sentenced in or outside the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a 
criminal offence including smuggling arms or explosives. 
</p>
<p>11. The Government indicated that article 5 of the Law on Citizenship regulates the acquisition 
of citizenship by descent, by birth on Bosnian territory, by adoption, by naturalization and by 
international agreement. 
</p>
<p><b>Bulgaria 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Government of Bulgaria stated that article 25.3 of the Constitution expressly prohibits 
the arbitrary deprivation of nationality of Bulgarian citizens. In article 25.1 the Constitution 
provides that any person, whereof at least one of the parents is a Bulgarian citizen, or who has 
been born in Bulgaria, shall be a Bulgarian citizen unless acquiring another citizenship by 
descent. Bulgarian citizenship may also be acquired by naturalization. The Bulgarian Citizenship 
Act stipulates that any Bulgarian citizens who are permanently residing abroad may request to be 
released from Bulgarian citizenship if they have acquired another nationality or if there is 
information showing that a procedure of acquisition of a foreign nationality has been initiated. 
</p>
<p>13. According to the Government, the Citizenship Act states that Bulgarian citizenship 
acquired through naturalization may be revoked if persons have supplied false information to 
obtain it. Revocation of the naturalization of one of the spouses shall not revoke the 
naturalization of the other spouse or children, unless citizenship was likewise obtained on the 
grounds of false information. The Government also indicated that the Law provides that any 
person who has acquired Bulgarian citizenship through naturalization may be deprived of it if the 
person has been sentenced for a grave crime committed against Bulgaria, subject to the condition 
that the person is abroad and does not become stateless. 
</p>
<p><b>Burkina Faso 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Government of Burkina Faso stated that article 135 of the Persons and Family Code 
indicates that provisions relating to nationality contained in international treaties ratified by 
Burkina Faso are applicable, even if they are contrary to provisions of internal law. The 
Government stated that, according to Title V of the Persons and Family Code, Burkinabe 
citizenship may be acquired by birth; by marriage, in which case a stateless person cannot 
decline Burkinabe citizenship; and in the case of persons born to foreign parents, who can 
obtain Burkinabe nationality at the legal majority age if they have resided in Burkina Faso for 
the last five years. 
</p>
<p>15. The Government reported that the situations leading to deprivation of nationality are 
limited. Article 170 of the Persons and Family Code states that persons shall not be naturalized if 
they do not have good morals; if they have been convicted to more than one year&#8217;s imprisonment 
and are not subject to rehabilitation or amnesty for a common-law crime; if they are not mentally 
healthy; or in the case of entrepreneurs, if they do not submit proof of important investments. 
According to article 189, loss of nationality can be declared if persons have been convicted of a 
crime against the internal or external security of the State; have been convicted for an act 
qualified as a crime against the institutions of Burkina Faso; have carried out for the benefit of a 
foreign country acts which are incompatible or damaging to Burkina Faso&#8217;s interests; have been </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>convicted in Burkina Faso or in a foreign country to imprisonment of at least five years for an act 
considered as a crime under Burkinabe law; have been convicted to imprisonment of more than 
three months for violations of price regulations or for fiscal fraud. 
</p>
<p><b>Colombia 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Government of Colombia stated that article 96 of the Constitution prohibits the 
deprivation of Colombian nationality. The 1991 Constitution introduced the possibility of 
holding two or more nationalities. In order to avoid situations of statelessness, article 96 of the 
Constitution provides that children of Colombian nationals born abroad acquire Colombian 
nationality at birth provided they are registered with the Colombian consulate, without being 
required to give proof of domicile in Colombian territory. Renunciation of Colombian nationality 
is considered a voluntary act. It is generally requested when persons have or are to acquire 
another nationality and the domestic legislation of that country does not allow for multiple 
nationalities. The Government indicated the law provides for the possibility to recover 
Colombian nationality. 
</p>
<p><b>Congo 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Government of the Congo stated that article 13 of the Constitution indicates that 
Congolese nationality is guaranteed by the law and that Congolese citizens have the right to 
change their nationality or to adopt a second nationality. The Nationality Code provides the 
conditions to acquire Congolese nationality. The law establishes the right of persons born to 
foreign parents in Congolese territory to acquire Congolese nationality. Congolese nationality 
may also be acquired through naturalization and long residence in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Costa Rica 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Government of Costa Rica stated that the Constitution guarantees the right to a 
nationality, also recognized in international instruments to which Costa Rica is party. Article 13 
of the Constitution indicates that persons born on Costa Rican territory or to Costa Rican parents 
have Costa Rican citizenship. Article 14 lists the persons who are entitled to naturalization. 
Article 16 further indicates that Costa Rican citizenship cannot be lost or renounced. The 
Government stated that the Constitutional Court has further clarified that this clause on 
non-renunciation should be interpreted in conformity with international human rights as an 
absolute prohibition on statelessness. 
</p>
<p>19. The Government reported that in 2007 the Foreign Ministry declared a person to be 
stateless in order to issue proper identification documents, in accordance with the provisions of 
the Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons. 
</p>
<p><b>Ecuador 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Government of Ecuador stated that Ecuador respects the right of every person to a 
nationality and that it has not carried out acts depriving persons of such a right. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Finland 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Government of Finland stated that, under section 5 (1) of its Constitution, children 
born in Finland acquire citizenship at birth and through the citizenship of their parents. 
Section 5 (2) indicates that persons cannot be divested or released from their Finnish citizenship 
except on grounds determined by the law and only if they are in possession of or will be granted 
the citizenship of another State. Chapter 5 of the Nationality Act details the conditions under 
which persons may lose their Finnish citizenship, inter alia, as an effect of annulment of 
paternity or if they provided false information. 
</p>
<p>22. The Government stated that the purpose of the Finnish Nationality Act is to regulate the 
acquisition and loss of Finnish citizenship taking into account the interests of individuals and the 
State alike, to prevent and reduce statelessness and to observe and promote the principles of 
good governance and legal protection when processing and making decisions on matters of 
citizenship. According to the Finnish Nationality Act, the provisions on the loss of and release 
from citizenship must not be applied if, as a consequence, a person becomes stateless. 
</p>
<p><b>Georgia 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Government of Georgia stated that, according to article 13 of the Constitution of 
Georgia, persons shall not be arbitrarily deprived of their citizenship. Article 2 of the Organic 
Law of Georgia on Citizenship of Georgia contains a similar provision. Article 32 of the Law 
regulates the loss of Georgian citizenship. According to this provision, persons shall lose their 
Georgian citizenship if they enter into the military service, the police, judicial bodies, or 
government institutions of a foreign State without permission of the competent bodies of 
Georgia; permanently reside on the territory of another State and have not been registered with 
the Georgian consulate without adequate justification during two years; acquire Georgian 
citizenship on the basis of false documents; and accept citizenship of another State. According to 
article 29 (a) of the Organic Law of Georgia on Citizenship of Georgia, Georgian citizenship is 
to be restored for persons whose citizenship has been terminated as a result of an illegal 
deprivation of citizenship. 
</p>
<p><b>Greece 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Government of Greece stated that article 17 of the Hellenic Nationality Code 
enumerates the conditions under which the Greek authorities may deprive persons of their 
nationality. The commitment of serious offenses constitutes the main reason for deprivation of 
Greek citizenship. Deprivation of nationality is permissible, inter alia, if Greek citizens 
undertake public duties in a foreign country, which violates the principle of loyalty to their 
native country; and if persons have committed acts for the benefit of a foreign country which 
contravene the national interests of Greece. Prior to the issuance of the revocation decision by 
the Minister of Home Affairs, the Nationality Council should give its consent. The revocation of 
nationality applies individually and does not affect the nationality of the person&#8217;s spouse and 
children. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Government of Guatemala stated it has ratified the Convention Relating to the Status 
of Stateless Persons and the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. The Government has 
also withdrawn all reservations and declarations to the Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees and its Protocol. Article 144 of the Guatemala Constitution indicates that Guatemalan 
citizens may not be deprived of their nationality. Guatemalan citizens who obtained their 
Guatemalan citizenship at birth may not be deprived of their nationality even when a second 
nationality has been acquired, except when renunciation of Guatemalan nationality is 
compulsory in order to obtain the nationality of the other State. In those cases, persons with a 
legal domicile in Guatemala may request that their Guatemalan nationality be subsequently 
reinstated. 
</p>
<p>26. The Government indicated that during the internal armed conflict certain municipalities&#8217; 
archives were burnt, thus leading to the loss of relevant identification documents. Due to the lack 
of adequate access to certain parts of the country, a number of persons have never registered 
their children, leaving them without any valid identification. The Government stated that more 
than 1 million citizens do not have personal identification documents, a situation that affects the 
exercise of citizens&#8217; rights, particularly the right to a nationality. Efforts have been made to 
include persons on electoral lists, particularly women, to guarantee the exercise of their political 
rights. In 2005, the Government of Guatemala created the National Registry of Persons, which 
began to function in 2007. Its objective is to organize and keep a unified registry of identification 
of all persons. The Government also indicated that another challenge is to convince all persons to 
register, particularly in light of the cost of obtaining personal documentation, including 
transportation to registration offices. 
</p>
<p><b>Iraq 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Government of Iraq stated that, according to its Constitution, every Iraqi citizen has 
the right to a nationality. Article 15 of Law No. 26 of 2006 indicates that persons may be 
deprived of Iraqi citizenship if they carry out acts that are dangerous to the safety and security of 
the State and if, when submitting an application for naturalization, they provide false information 
about themselves or members of their families. 
</p>
<p><b>Islamic Republic of Iran 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran stated that article 41 of the Constitution 
indicates that all Iranians have the right to Iranian citizenship. The Government may not deprive 
Iranians from their citizenship unless persons request it or if they acquire the citizenship of 
another country. Article 42 of the Constitution establishes that foreign nationals may apply to 
acquire Iranian citizenship. These persons may be deprived of their citizenship only if another 
State agrees to accord them its citizenship, or if they voluntarily renounce Iranian citizenship. 
The Government stated that the latest amendment to the State Civil Code of September 2006 
indicates that children born in Iran of a marriage between Iranian women and foreign men may 
apply for Iranian citizenship after reaching 18 years of age. Applicants will be granted Iranian 
citizenship provided that they have no criminal or security record and that they renounce their 
non-Iranian citizenship. From the date of the adoption of the law, those persons who are born in 
Iran of a marriage between an Iranian woman and a foreign man, and when the marriage has </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>been registered in accordance with the Civil Code, after reaching 18 years of age shall be 
accorded Iranian citizenship within one year, irrespective of residence conditions required in the 
Civil Code. 
</p>
<p><b>Jamaica 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Government of Jamaica has not taken any discriminatory measures or enacted any 
discriminatory laws that would arbitrarily deprive persons of their nationality, particularly when 
such laws could render persons stateless. The Government also indicated that the Constitution of 
Jamaica makes express provision for entitlement to citizenship before and after the date of 
independence. Additionally, the Constitution of Jamaica prohibits the deprivation of citizenship 
acquired by birth, descent or marriage to a Jamaican citizen. Persons who acquire citizenship by 
other means may be deprived of such citizenship but in the circumstances prescribed by law and 
not in an arbitrary manner. 
</p>
<p><b>Kuwait 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Government of Kuwait stated that, according to the Constitution of Kuwait, all 
citizens are equal before the law. According to the Government, following the application of the 
Law on Entry of Foreigners, there have been certain groups of persons claiming to be Kuwaiti 
citizens. These persons have not been granted Kuwaiti citizenship because they could not prove 
to be Kuwaiti nationals. According to the Government, many of these persons may have had 
foreign passports and entered Kuwait legally or illegally and subsequently hid their passports and 
claimed to be Kuwaiti nationals. According to the law, they are considered as illegal residents. 
The Government stated that an Executive Committee on Illegal Residents has been created to 
tackle this situation. The Committee has registered 92,667 cases of illegal residents. In any case, 
the Government indicated that health and education services are provided to all residents 
irrespective of their nationality. All persons enjoy the right to work and right to register their 
marriage and to obtain birth certificates, travel documents and driving licences. 
</p>
<p>31. The Government of Kuwait stated that there are no restrictions on the exercise of the right 
to a nationality. The Law on Nationality is based on international law principles. According to 
the Law on Nationality, Kuwaiti citizenship is obtained at birth if the father is a Kuwaiti 
national. Children born to female Kuwaitis married to foreigners are not considered Kuwaiti 
citizens. Nevertheless, permanent residents may consider applying for Kuwaiti citizenship with 
the Ministry of Interior. According to Kuwaiti law, dual nationality is not recognized. Kuwaiti 
citizens that adopt a foreign nationality lose their Kuwaiti citizenship. According to the Law on 
Nationality, Kuwait has adopted the necessary measures to reduce the number of stateless 
persons in Kuwait. In this respect, a number of legal residents are naturalized every year, in 
accordance with an annual quota. The Government informed that on the day of its submission, a 
total of 928 persons had been given Kuwaiti citizenship in 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Mauritius 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Government of Mauritius stated that, according to articles 20 (3) and 23 of the 
Constitution, people may obtain Mauritian citizenship by birth or by descent. They obtain 
Mauritian citizenship if they were born in Mauritius before 1 September 2005 of either Mauritian 
or foreign parents, or if they are were born in Mauritius after September 2005 if either of the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>parents holds Mauritian citizenship by birth. Section 3 of the Mauritius Citizen Act stipulates 
that minors who are not citizens of Mauritius may become citizens if they have been adopted by 
a citizen of Mauritius. Under section 5 of the Mauritius Citizenship Act, a Commonwealth 
citizen may be registered as a citizen of Mauritius. Application for registration shall be 
accompanied by a declaration of renunciation of any other citizenship the applicant may possess. 
Non-Commonwealth citizens may be naturalized as citizens if they fulfil the necessary criteria of 
residency. Application for naturalization shall be accompanied by a declaration of renunciation 
of any citizenship the applicant may possess. 
</p>
<p>33. The Government further stated that, according to section 11 (2) of the Mauritius 
Citizenship Act, the Minister in charge of internal affairs may deprive persons of their 
citizenship acquired by registration or naturalization in cases where such registration or 
naturalization was obtained through fraud. The same situation applies to persons who have been 
disloyal or disaffected towards the State or have been declared suspected international terrorists 
under the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 2002, or have carried out during any war in which 
Mauritius was engaged acts to assist the enemy in that war or have been sentenced to 
imprisonment for a term not less than 12 months. However, the Minister may not deprive 
persons of their citizenship if in doing so the persons become stateless. 
</p>
<p><b>Monaco 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Government of Monaco stated that articles 15 and 18 of the Constitution, as amended 
by Law No. 1.249 of 2 April 2002 provide the modalities of acquisition and loss of nationality. 
According to article 15, the Prince exercises the right to naturalize and to restore Monegasque 
nationality, with no need to motivate his decision to refuse to naturalize or to restore it. 
Article 18 indicates that the law regulates the modes of loss of nationality for naturalized 
persons. The loss of Monegasque nationality in any other case is only possible if the person has 
voluntarily acquired another nationality or has illegitimately served in the armed forces of 
another country. 
</p>
<p><b>Montenegro 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Government of Montenegro stated that, according to article 24 of its Citizenship Law, 
Montenegrin citizens who acquired citizenship of another State shall lose Montenegrin 
citizenship. They shall also lose Montenegrin citizenship if it is established that Montenegrin 
citizenship was acquired on the basis of false statements, except in the case where persons would 
become stateless. Persons shall also lose Montenegrin citizenship if they acquired Montenegrin 
citizenship on the grounds of guarantees given by another State, stating that they shall cease 
present citizenship if Montenegrin citizenship is obtained; if they have been convicted for 
criminal offenses against humanity and other values protected by international law; if they have 
been convicted of planning, organizing, financing or in any way assisting terrorist acts; if they 
are members of an organization whose activities are directed against public order and security; if 
they enter voluntarily in the military forces of another State; and if their behaviour seriously 
damages the vital interests of Montenegro.</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>36. The Government also stated that article 41 of the Citizenship Law indicates that a citizen 
of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with registered residence in Montenegro 
before 3 June 2006 can acquire Montenegrin citizenship through naturalization if they are not 
citizens of a foreign country and if they fulfil the conditions prescribed by the law. 
</p>
<p><b>Qatar 
</b>37. The Government of Qatar stated that, according to the Law on Nationality, Qatari 
citizenship is obtained by descent, by naturalization and by settlement. Article 1 of the Law on 
Nationality indicates that persons who settled in Qatar prior to 1930 and that continue to reside 
in Qatar and their descendants are considered Qatari citizens. The Prince may declare that 
persons who demonstrate that they are of Qatari origin, even if they settled in Qatar after 1930, 
are Qatari citizens. A person whose father is a Qatari citizen is considered Qatari by birth. 
Article 2 of the Law on Nationality provides that foreigners may apply for naturalization if they 
have lived in Qatar for at least 25 continuous years and have not spent more than 2 months every 
year outside Qatar. In order to be naturalized, persons shall demonstrate that they have legal 
employment; that they have a good reputation; that they have not been charged by a court for a 
crime; and that they speak very good Arabic. Priority is given to persons born to a Qatari mother. 
Persons born in Qatar from unknown parents acquire Qatari citizenship. 
</p>
<p>38. Articles 11 and 12 provide the conditions for the loss of Qatari citizenship. The Prince may 
deprive persons of their Qatari citizenship if they have joined armed forces of a foreign country; 
if they have worked in the service of a foreign country that is in a state of war against Qatar; if 
they are members of any association or organization which aims at changing the political regime 
of Qatar; if they have been sentenced by a court of law for crimes affecting their loyalty to Qatar; 
and if they have acquired a foreign nationality. Naturalized Qatari citizens may be deprived of 
their Qatari citizenship if they acquired it by providing false information; if they have been 
sentenced for a crime that affects their honour; and if they have been living abroad for more than 
one year without providing a proper justification. The Ministry of Interior can recommend, under 
certain conditions, depriving nationality from a naturalized citizen for reasons of public interest. 
</p>
<p><b>Russian Federation 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Government of the Russian Federation stated that, in its view, article 1, paragraph 2, 
of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination provides that 
distinctions made by States between citizens and non-citizens do not constitute discrimination, 
thus leaving a protection gap for stateless persons. This situation could lead to situations in 
which States can be selective in their approach to the protection of certain minorities and 
interpret the existing international legal concepts in an arbitrary way. The Government indicated 
that some countries, with the assistance of declarations and reservations to international 
instruments, observe international norms only with regard to their citizens, while stateless 
persons are subjected to substantial discrimination. In some cases, national laws have established 
the status of non-citizens to distinguish their treatment from ordinary citizens. This situation 
creates a situation of inequality for persons who belong to national minorities, even when these 
national groups represent the majority of the population in a given area. 
</p><p>40. Persons arbitrarily deprived of their citizenship are in practice considered as migrants, even 
though these persons lived on the territories of the relevant States for several years. Their rights </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>are subjected to limitations in all spheres and subject to discriminatory practices. Stateless 
persons do not have the possibility of using their native language when addressing the State in 
writing, even in the areas where they constitute a majority of the population. These persons are 
confronted with a situation in which all types of information are provided only in the official 
language. According to the Government, there is also discrimination in the social sphere, 
affecting the provision of pensions, social benefits and medical services. Stateless persons also 
see their right to freedom of movement seriously affected. For example, in many cases they are 
not entitled to travel abroad. 
</p>
<p>41. The Government of the Russian Federation stated that the question of arbitrary deprivation 
of nationality should be considered by the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and 
United Nations agencies, including the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and 
the High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</p>
<p><b>Spain 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Government of Spain stated that article 34.1 of the Law 4/2000 and the Regulations on 
the Recognition of the Status of Stateless Persons No. 865/2001 of 20 July 2001 deal with issues 
relating to stateless persons.

</b></p>
<p>43. The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic stated that the Syrian Constitution provides 
all guarantees to protect all Syrian citizens without discrimination. The Constitution and the law 
provide all guarantees for individuals to enjoy their rights according to international human 
rights law, including providing the necessary means to avoid cases of arbitrary deprivation of 
nationality according to international human rights law, including providing the necessary means 
to avoid cases of arbitrary deprivation of nationality. 
</p>
<p>44. The Syrian Law on Nationality provides that Syrian citizens may be deprived of their 
nationality if they acquire a foreign nationality; if they engage in military service in a foreign 
country without the approval of the Syrian Ministry of Defence; if they work for a foreign 
country, whether inside or outside the Syrian Arab Republic, without authorization by the 
Government; if they support any activity of a foreign country that is in a state of war against 
Syria; if they leave the territory illegally in order to enter the territory of enemy States; and if 
they left Syria to live in a non-Arab country and stayed for more than three years and did not 
return, without providing adequate justification, at the request of the Government. The Syrian 
Minister of the Interior has the authority to award Syrian citizenship to persons who had been 
deprived of it. 
</p>
<p><b>Ukraine 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Government of Ukraine stated that article 25 of the Constitution stipulates that citizens 
of Ukraine cannot be deprived of their citizenship and cannot be deprived of their right to change 
citizenship. The legal framework that regulates questions of citizenship is found in the 
Constitution and the Law on Citizenship. The Law on Citizenship is based on the principle of 
preventing situations of statelessness. Based on this principle, the provisions in articles 18 
and 19, for example, provide that citizenship may be lost if persons renounce their Ukrainian </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>citizenship as a requirement for adopting the nationality of another State. However, no person 
shall be deprived of their citizenship if, as a result, they become stateless. The exception to this 
general principle refers to cases in which some people received Ukrainian citizenship through 
fraud. 
</p>
<p><b>Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) 
</b>46. The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela stated that articles 32 and 42 of 
the Constitution regulated issues of nationality in Venezuela. The Law on Nationality and 
Citizenship established a legal regime that renders statelessness in Venezuela unlikely. The 
Government indicated that Venezuelan nationals do not lose their citizenship when they acquire 
the nationality of another State, except in cases of voluntary renunciation of Venezuelan 
citizenship. It is established that, in order to avoid situations of statelessness, renunciation of 
nationality by Venezuelan nationals by birth is valid only when the persons concerned have 
opted for or wish to adopt a foreign nationality. Persons who have renounced their Venezuelan 
nationality may recover it if they establish legal residency in Venezuela for a period of at least 
two years. Venezuelan nationals by birth may not be deprived of their nationality, nor may their 
nationality be suspended or limited by State authorities. 
</p>
<p>47. The Government stated that naturalized Venezuelans may not be deprived of their 
nationality except on the basis of a judicial decision, in conformity with article 35 of the 
Constitution and article 48 of the Law on Nationality and Citizenship. Such a declaration may 
occur in cases where the relationship of loyalty and fidelity to the State has been broken. The 
Law also provides that naturalized Venezuelans may retain their original nationality.

<p><b>II.  REPLIES RECEIVED FROM INTERGOVERNMENTAL 
ORGANIZATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) stated that it 
is a general principle of international law that State discretion on nationality matters is limited by 
international law and in particular obligations under international human rights law. The General 
Assembly, in its resolution 50/152, specifically recognizes the fundamental nature of the 
prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of nationality. An explicit and general prohibition of arbitrary 
deprivation of nationality can be found in numerous international instruments.<b>1</b> Specific

art. 29 of the 2004 Revised Arab Charter on Human Rights; and art. 24 (2) of the 1995 
Commonwealth of Independent States Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms; art. 16 of the Draft Articles on Nationality of Natural Persons in relation to the 
Succession of States. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality are dealt with by other international treaties, 
specifically those which proscribe the deprivation of nationality on discriminatory grounds<b>2</b> or if 
it results in statelessness.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>49. While deprivation of nationality does not comprise loss of nationality voluntarily requested 
by the individual (renunciation), it comprises all other forms of loss of nationality, including 
those which occur automatically by operation of law and those which result from acts taken by 
administrative authorities. International law allows for deprivation of nationality in some 
circumstances. However, in order not to be arbitrary, deprivation of nationality must be in 
conformity with domestic law and in addition comply with specific procedural and substantive 
standards, in particular the principle of proportionality. Measures leading to deprivation of 
nationality must serve a legitimate purpose that is consistent with international law and in 
particular the objectives of international human rights law. Such measures must be the least 
intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result and they must be 
proportional to the interest to be protected. The notion of arbitrariness applies to all State action, 
legislative, administrative and judicial. An interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the term 
shows that &#8220;arbitrariness&#8221; is not to be equated merely with &#8220;against the law&#8221;, but must be 
interpreted more broadly to include elements of inappropriateness, injustice and lack of 
predictability. 
</p>
<p>50. The Human Rights Committee has further developed what &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; means with regard 
to specific rights recognized under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>51. The avoidance of statelessness is a general principle of international law. Deprivation of 
nationality resulting in statelessness will generally be arbitrary unless it serves a legitimate 
purpose and complies with the principle of proportionality. Thus, article 8 of the Convention on 
the Reduction of Statelessness allows for a limited set of circumstances under which deprivation 
of nationality resulting in statelessness is permissible, but as exceptions to a general principle 
they must be narrowly construed. Deprivation of nationality leads to statelessness where the 
person concerned does not possess or immediately acquire another nationality. Article 8 (1) of 
the Convention therefore states the general rule. The General Assembly in its resolution 50/152 
called upon States &#8220;to adopt nationality legislation with a view to reducing statelessness, 
consistent with the fundamental principles of international law, in particular by preventing 
arbitrary deprivation of nationality&#8221;. Similarly, conclusion No. 106 (LVII) of 2006 UNHCR&#8217;s

</p>
<p>Executive Committee &#8220;encourages States to consider examining their nationality laws &#8230; to 
prevent the occurrence of statelessness which results from arbitrary denial or deprivation of 
nationality&#8221;.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>52. The exceptions allowed for in the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness are set out 
exhaustively in its article 8, paragraphs 2 and 3. Paragraph 2 (a) provides that naturalized persons 
may be rendered stateless by loss of nationality if they have resided abroad for at least 
seven years and failed to declare their intention to retain their nationality. States may also 
deprive persons born abroad of their nationality if, one year after attaining majority, they do not 
reside in the State or register with the appropriate authority. Paragraph 2 (b) provides that 
deprivation of nationality resulting in statelessness is also permissible if the nationality has been 
obtained by misrepresentation or fraud. Certain additional exceptions are provided for in 
paragraph 3, but they may only be applied if the State expressly indicates its intention to retain 
them in its national law at the time of signature, ratification or accession. 
</p>
<p>53. Article 7 (3) of the 1997 European Convention on Nationality allows for deprivation of 
nationality resulting in statelessness only in cases of misrepresentation and fraud. Emphasizing 
the importance of narrowly construing an exception of this nature and also of the principle of 
proportionality, the Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe has issued a recommendation 
that &#8220;a State should not necessarily deprive of its nationality persons who have acquired its 
nationality by fraudulent conduct, false information or concealment of any relevant fact. To this 
effect, the gravity of the facts, as well as other relevant circumstances, such as the genuine and 
effective link of these persons with the State concerned, should be taken into account&#8221;.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>54. Under article 9 of the Convention &#8220;a Contracting State may not deprive any person or 
group of persons of their nationality on racial, ethnic, religious or political grounds&#8221;. Deprivation 
of nationality on discriminatory grounds is arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>55. The prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of nationality is implicit in provisions of human 
rights treaties which proscribe specific forms of discrimination. Article 5 (d) (iii) and 1 (3) of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination prohibit racial 
discrimination in respect of the right to a nationality. The Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination has indicated that States shall &#8220;recognize that deprivation of citizenship on 
the basis of race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin is a breach of States parties&#8217; 
obligations to ensure non-discriminatory enjoyment of the right to nationality&#8221;.<b>7</b> Under article 9 
of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and 
the 1957 Convention on the Nationality of Married Women, women have the right to retain their 
nationality regardless of the celebration or dissolution of a marriage or the change of nationality

<p>by a husband. In its general comment No. 21, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women stated that: &#8220;Nationality should be capable of change by an adult 
woman and should not be arbitrarily removed because of marriage or dissolution of marriage or 
because her husband or father changes his nationality.&#8221;<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>56. In order to fulfil minimum procedural standards, decisions on deprivation of nationality 
must be issued with reasons in writing and be subject to a review by a court or other independent 
body. Procedural safeguards are essential to prevent abuses in the application of the law. As a 
result, the right to a review against deprivation of nationality is guaranteed by article 8, 
paragraph 4, of the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. 
</p>
<p>57. In explaining the scope of the prohibition against arbitrary deprivation of nationality in 
article 16 of the Draft Articles on Nationality of Natural Persons in relation to the Succession of 
States, the commentary of the International Law Commission sets out that the &#8220;purpose of the 
article is to prevent abuses which may occur in the process of the application of any law or treaty 
which, in themselves, are consistent with the present draft articles&#8221;. This is supplemented by 
article 17 of the Draft Articles which requires that &#8220;relevant decisions shall be issued in writing 
and shall be open to effective administrative or judicial review&#8221;. The commentary to article 17 
elaborates: &#8220;The elements spelled out in this provision represent minimum requirements in this 
respect. &#8230; The requirement of giving reasons for any negative decisions concerning nationality 
should be considered as one of the prerequisites of an effective administrative or judicial review 
which is implicitly covered.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>58. The European Convention on Nationality, as a regional treaty dealing comprehensively 
with nationality issues, also contains important procedural standards on deprivation of 
nationality, notably that decisions shall contain reasons in writing (art. 11) and that decisions 
shall be open to an administrative or judicial review in conformity with internal law (art. 12). 
59. Persons who have been arbitrarily deprived of their nationality must have access to an 
effective remedy, in particular restoration of nationality, issuance of documents allowing the 
individual to make nationality effective and registration as a national in relevant registries. 
Article 8, paragraph 2, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, expressly stipulates: 
&#8220;Where a child is illegally deprived of some or all of the elements of his or her identity 
[including nationality], States Parties shall provide appropriate assistance and protection, with a 
view to re-establishing speedily his or her identity.&#8221; The Human Rights Council, in its 
resolution 7/10, calls upon States to ensure that an effective remedy is available to persons who 
have been arbitrarily deprived of their nationality. UNHCR&#8217;s Executive Committee, for its part 
has &#8220;call[ed] on States [&#8230;] to assist stateless persons to access legal remedies to redress 
statelessness, in particular that which results from arbitrary deprivation of nationality&#8221;.<b>9</b> Access 
to effective remedies often relies on providing proof for personal identification, a task frequently

</p>
<p>hampered by the effects of deprivation of nationality. States may therefore be required to adopt 
flexible rules for evidence, which for instance allow the person concerned to provide witness 
testimony or resort to various sources of documentary evidence. 
</p>
<p>60. In the context of the avoidance of statelessness, arbitrary denial of nationality is just as 
grave as arbitrary deprivation of nationality. The Executive Committee of UNHCR has therefore 
encouraged States &#8220;to consider examining their nationality laws and other relevant legislation 
with a view to adopting and implementing safeguards, consistent with fundamental principles of 
international law, to prevent the occurrence of statelessness which <i>results from arbitrary denial 
or deprivation of nationality</i>&#8221; (emphasis added).<b>10</b> 
61. Nationality can be acquired automatically by operation of law, at birth or at a later stage, or 
as a result of an act of the administrative authorities. States enjoy a degree of discretion with 
regard to the criteria governing acquisition of nationality but these criteria must not be arbitrary. 
In order not to be arbitrary, denial of access to a nationality must be in conformity with domestic 
law. It must comply with procedural standards. At a minimum, a decision must be issued with 
reasons in writing and be subject to review by an independent authority. It must comply with 
substantive standards, in particular the principle of proportionality. As with arbitrary deprivation 
of nationality, international law has developed detailed standards governing denial of nationality, 
in particular where it is based on discriminatory grounds or where it results in statelessness. 
</p>
<p>62. In establishing general rules for acquisition of nationality at birth or later in life, it is 
legitimate to differentiate between persons who have specific links with the State such as birth 
on the territory, descent, residence or marriage to a national, and those who do not. However, 
when setting criteria for acquisition of nationality, States must not discriminate against persons 
concerned, in particular on grounds of race, colour, gender, religion, political opinion or national 
or ethnic origin, as such discrimination would constitute arbitrary denial of acquisition of a 
nationality. Article 9 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women prohibits distinctions between men and women with regard to acquisition of 
nationality and in relation to acquisition of nationality by their children. Discrimination on the 
grounds of race, colour or ethnicity falls under the scope of the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  
</p>
<p>63. With regard to the acquisition of nationality, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination recommended that States parties to &#8220;ensure that particular groups of non-citizens 
are not discriminated against with regard to access to citizenship or naturalization, and to pay 
due attention to possible barriers to naturalization that may exist for long-term or permanent 
residents&#8221; and to &#8220;take into consideration that in some cases denial of citizenship for long-term 
or permanent residents could result in creating disadvantage for them in access to employment 
and social benefits, in violation of the Convention&#8217;s anti-discrimination principles&#8221;.<b>11</b> The 
Human Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 24 has stated: &#8220;No discrimination with

</p>
<p>regard to the acquisition of nationality should be admissible under internal law as between 
legitimate children and children born out of wedlock or of stateless parents or based on the 
nationality status of one or both of the parents.&#8221; The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in 
the case of the Yean and Bosico children also underlined the prohibition of discrimination 
regarding access to a nationality.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>64. Regardless of the general rules which govern acquisition of nationality, States should 
ensure that safeguards are in place to ensure that nationality is not denied to persons with 
relevant links to that State who would otherwise be stateless. This is of particular relevance in 
two situations, at birth and upon State succession. As regards the right to acquire a nationality 
under article 24, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
Human Rights Committee stated that &#8220;States are required to adopt every appropriate measure &#8230; 
to ensure that every child has a nationality when he is born&#8221;. In this context, birth on the territory 
of a State and birth to a national are the most important criteria used to establish the legal bond 
of nationality. Where there is only a link with the State on whose territory the child was born, 
this State must grant nationality as the person can rely on no other State to ensure his or her right 
to acquire a nationality and would otherwise be stateless. Indeed, if nationality is not granted in 
such circumstances then article 24, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant as well as article 7 
of the Convention on the Rights of the Child would otherwise be meaningless. In concrete terms, 
the circumstance referred to above may arise, for example, where a child is born on the territory 
of a State to stateless parents or with respect to foundlings. Given the consequences to the 
children concerned, denial of nationality in such instances must be deemed arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>65. A child may have a link to more than one State, for instance where a child is born on the 
territory of one State to parents who are nationals of another State. As States adopt diverging 
rules on the acquisition of nationality, a conflict of laws between the States involved typically 
will leave the child stateless if the State of birth grants nationality <i>jus sanguinis</i> and the State of 
nationality of the parents grants nationality <i>jus soli</i>. The Convention on the Reduction of 
Statelessness resolves such conflicts by providing in its article 1 that Contracting States must 
grant nationality to a person born on their territory who would otherwise be stateless, and in 
article 4 that Contracting States must grant nationality if a person is born to one of their nationals 
outside of a Contracting State and would otherwise be stateless. Similar rules are also contained 
in article 20 (2) of the American Convention on Human Rights and article 6 (4) of the African 
Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. 
</p>
<p>66. Article 1 of the Draft Articles on Nationality of Natural Persons in relation to the 
Succession of States sets out that &#8220;Every individual who, on the date of the succession of States, 
had the nationality of the predecessor State, irrespective of the mode of acquisition of that 
nationality, has the right to the nationality of at least one of the States concerned, in accordance 
with the present draft articles.&#8221; The Draft Articles establish rules for acquisition of nationality 
and in particular stipulate a presumption that persons having their habitual residence in the 
territory affected by succession acquire the nationality of the successor State. 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>12
</b>  Inter-American Court of Human Rights, 8 September 2005, para. 141. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>67. UNHCR recommended that, where national legislation allows for deprivation of 
nationality, States must include safeguards to ensure that such deprivation not be arbitrary. States 
should, in particular: (a) establish procedural standards, notably issue reasons in writing and 
grant the right to a review to a court or an independent body; and (b) establish substantive 
standards, notably prohibit deprivation of nationality based on discriminatory grounds, in 
particular on grounds of race, colour, gender, religion, political opinion or national or ethnic 
origin; and prohibit deprivation of nationality resulting in statelessness on grounds other than 
those foreseen in the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and where such a deprivation 
is not in conformity with the principle of proportionality, taking in particular into account the 
consequences of statelessness and the quality of the link between State and individual. 
</p>
<p>68. Furthermore, UNHCR recommended that States must provide effective remedies for all 
persons who have been arbitrarily deprived of their nationality, in particular restoration of 
nationality, and where applicable, provision of identity documents, correction of registries and 
facilitating proof of identity. 
</p>
<p>69. UNHCR also recommended that States should take all appropriate measures to prevent 
arbitrary denial of acquisition of a nationality. States must not deny acquisition of their 
nationality based on discriminatory grounds, in particular on grounds of race, colour, gender, 
religion, political opinion or national or ethnic origin. States should grant nationality to all 
persons born on their territory who would otherwise be stateless. 
</p>
<p>70. Finally UNHCR urged States, pursuant to resolutions of the General Assembly and Human 
Rights Council as well as conclusions of the Executive Committee of UNHCR, to accede to 
the 1954 Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the 
Reduction of Statelessness which currently have respectively 63 and 35 States parties. States are 
also urged to accede to relevant universal and regional human rights instruments and, where 
applicable, to withdraw reservations to provisions on nationality issues.
