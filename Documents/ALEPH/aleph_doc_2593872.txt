1.5Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(a)
Accounting Terms:  All financial statements required to be furnished by the Borrower to the
Agent hereunder shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each accounting term used in
this Agreement, unless otherwise defined herein, has the meaning assigned to it under GAAP
and, except as otherwise provided herein, reference to any balance sheet item, statement of
income item or statement of cash flows item means such item as computed from the applicable
financial statement prepared in accordance with GAAP.
(b)Change in GAAP or Accounting Policy:  If:
(i)
there occurs a change in GAAP, including as a result of a conversion to International Financial
Reporting Standards; or
(ii)
the Borrower or any of the Material Subsidiaries adopts a change in an accounting policy in
order to more appropriately present events or transactions in its financial statements;
and the above change would cause an amount required to be determined for the purposes of any
financial covenant or any other financial calculation or threshold (each a "Financial Calculation")
to be different than the amount that would be determined without giving effect to such change, the
Borrower shall notify the Agent of such change (an "Accounting Change").  Such notice (an
"Accounting Change Notice") shall describe the nature of the Accounting Change and state
whether the Borrower desires to revise the method of calculating one or more of the Financial
Calculations (including the revision of any of the defined terms used in the determination of such
Financial Calculation) in order that amounts determined after giving effect to such Accounting
Change and the revised method of calculating such Financial Calculation will approximate the
amount that would be determined without giving effect to such Accounting Change and without
giving effect to the revised method of calculating such Financial Calculation.  The Accounting
Change Notice shall be delivered to the Agent  within forty-five (45) days after the end of the
Fiscal Quarter in which the Accounting Change is implemented or, if such Accounting Change is
implemented in the fourth Fiscal Quarter or in respect of an entire Fiscal Year, within ninety (90)
days after the end of such period, provided that, in a situation where an Accounting Change does
not have an immediate impact on the calculations or thresholds then applicable to the Borrower,
the Borrower shall be entitled to deliver an additional Accounting Change Notice once such
change does have an impact (provided that no more than one such additional Accounting
Change Notice may be delivered in any one Fiscal Quarter), and the provisions hereof shall also
apply to such additional Accounting Change Notice.
(c)
Majority Lender Notification:  If, pursuant to the Accounting Change Notice, the Borrower does
not indicate that it desires to revise the method of calculating one or more of the Financial
Calculations, the Majority Lenders may within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Accounting
Change Notice notify the Borrower that they wish to revise the method of calculating one or
more of the Financial Calculations in the manner described above.
36
(d)
Revised Calculations:  If either the Borrower or the Majority Lenders so indicate that they wish
to revise the method of calculating one or more of the Financial Calculations, the Borrower
and the Majority Lenders shall in good faith attempt to agree on a revised method of
calculating such Financial Calculations so as to reflect equitably such Accounting Change
with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating the Borrower's financial condition shall be
substantially the same after such Accounting Change as if such Accounting Change had not
been made.  Until the Borrower and the Majority Lenders have reached agreement in writing
on such revised method of calculation, all amounts to be determined hereunder shall continue
to be determined without giving effect to the Accounting Change.  For greater certainty, if no
notice of a desire to revise the method of calculating the Financial Calculations in respect of
an Accounting Change is given by either the Borrower or the Majority Lenders within the
applicable time period described above, then the method of calculating the Financial
Calculations shall not be revised in response to such Accounting Change and all amounts to
be determined pursuant to the Financial Calculations shall be determined after giving effect to
such Accounting Change.
(e)
Revised Compliance Certificates:  If a Compliance Certificate is delivered in respect of a
Fiscal Quarter or Fiscal Year in which an Accounting Change is implemented without giving
effect to any revised method of calculating any of the Financial Calculations, and
subsequently, as provided above, the method of calculating one or more of the Financial
Calculations is revised in response to such Accounting Change, or the amounts to be
determined pursuant to any of the Financial Calculations are to be determined without giving
effect to such Accounting Change, the Borrower shall deliver a revised Compliance
Certificate.  Any Event of Default which arises as a result of the Accounting Change and which
is cured by this Section 1.5 shall be deemed to have never occurred.
1.6Time
 
Unless otherwise provided herein, all references to a time in this Agreement shall mean local
time in the city of Calgary, Alberta.

same day immediately available funds.

ARTICLE 3
THE CREDIT FACILITIES
 
3.1Amendment and Restatement
 
Relying on each of the representations and warranties set out in Article 2 and subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the Lenders, the Agent and the Borrower agree that, effective
on the Effective Date, the Existing Credit Agreement shall be amended and restated in its entirety
on the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all indebtedness and liability of the Borrower
to the Lenders and the Agent under (and as defined in) the Existing Credit Agreement including,
without limitation, "Borrowings" (as defined under the Existing Credit Agreement) and accrued
and unpaid interest and fees thereon and standby fees accrued thereunder, shall be construed
as indebtedness and liability of the Borrower to the Lenders and the Agent under this Agreement.
 
3.2Obligations of Each Lender
 
Relying on each of the representations and warranties set out in Article 2 and subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each Lender agrees to make Accommodations available to the
Borrower up to the amount of its Commitment commencing on the date of this Agreement and
ending on the Maturity Date of each such Lender, by way of:
(a)
Loans:  the advance of Prime Loans, U.S. Base Rate Loans or Libor Loans by such Lender
and the delivery of the proceeds of such advance for the account of the Borrower through the
Agent at the Agent's Account for Payments;
(b)Bankers' Acceptances:  either
(i)
the acceptance of Bankers' Acceptances (or the making of a BA Equivalent Advance) by such
Lender and the delivery of the discounted proceeds of sale received by such Lender (or the
amount of BA Equivalent Advance) (less the applicable fees payable by the Borrower to such
Lender pursuant to Section 5.4) in respect thereof for the account of the Borrower through the
Agent at the Agent's Account for Payments; or
(ii)
the purchase of Bankers' Acceptances (or the making of a BA Equivalent Advance) by such
Lender and the delivery of the Discount Proceeds in respect of such Bankers' Acceptances (or
BA Equivalent Advance) (less the applicable fees payable by the Borrower to such Lender
pursuant to Section 5.4) for the account of the Borrower through the Agent at the Agent's
Account for Payments; and
(c)
Letters of Credit:  the issuance of Letters of Credit by a Fronting Lender on behalf of the
Lenders up to the amount of its Fronted LC Commitment; provided that the Equivalent Amount
in U.S. Dollars of all Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder shall not, at the time of the
issuance of any such Letter of Credit and after giving effect to the issuance thereof, exceed
U.S. $200,000,000.
43
The credit facility established above (the "Credit Facility") is a revolving credit facility and the
Borrower may increase or decrease Borrowings from each such Lender by obtaining Loans,
Bankers' Acceptances and BA Equivalent Advances, as applicable, and Letters of Credit, as
applicable, and by making repayments in respect thereof.
 
A Lender shall not have any obligation to make any Accommodations available at any time if,
after giving effect thereto, the Equivalent Amount in U.S. Dollars of Borrowings from such Lender
would exceed the Commitment of such Lender.
 
3.3Extension of Maturity Date
(a)
Request for Extension:  The Borrower may, from time to time, request an extension from each
Lender (each, a "Requested Lender") of the then current Maturity Date of each such
Requested Lender (each, a "Subject Maturity Date") by sending to the Agent at the Agent's
Branch of Account a Request for Extension once in each Fiscal Year and the Agent shall
forthwith notify the Requested Lenders of such request.  Any such request must provide that
the requested Maturity Date of all Requested Lenders be the same and that the requested
Maturity Date not exceed five years from the date of any such extension request.  Each
Requested Lender shall advise the Agent as to whether it agrees with such request within
thirty (30) days of being so notified, provided that in the event such Requested Lender does
not so advise the Agent within such thirty (30) day period, such Requested Lender shall be
deemed to have advised the Agent that it does not agree with such request.
(b)
Payment or Replacement by Borrower:  Subject to Section 3.3(a), if a Requested Lender does
not agree to extend the Subject Maturity Date (such Requested Lender being a "Non-
Extending Lender" and any Requested Lender agreeing to extend the Subject Maturity Date
being an "Extending Lender"), the Borrower may, provided that it treats each Non-Extending
Lender rateably:
(i)
so long as there exists no Default or Event of Default and subject to Section 11.5, repay all
Borrowings and other amounts owing hereunder to all Non-Extending Lenders, on or prior to
the Maturity Date of such Non-Extending  Lenders and upon such payment each Non-
Extending Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder and each such Non-Extending
Lender's Commitment shall be terminated and the Total Commitment reduced accordingly; or
(ii)
arrange for a replacement lender or lenders (which may be one or more of the Lenders) to
replace all Non-Extending Lenders' Borrowings and Commitments provided that any such
replacement lender or lenders (if it is not a Lender) shall have been approved by the Agent
and each Fronting Lender (each such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) and shall be
novated into the Loan Documents in the place and stead of the Non-Extending Lenders by
execution of all necessary documentation on or prior to the Maturity Date of such Non-
Extending Lenders and in respect of which the Lenders shall do all things and make all such
adjustments as are reasonably necessary to give effect to any such replacement.
Non-Extension:  The Subject Maturity Date shall not be extended in accordance with
Section 3.3(a) if Requested Lenders holding more than thirty-three and one third percent (33-
1/3%) of the aggregate of the Commitments of all Requested Lenders do not agree or are
(c)deemed not to agree to extend the Subject Maturity Date pursuant to the Request for
Extension.  In any such case, the Subject Maturity Date of each Requested Lender shall not be
extended, provided, however, the Borrower shall be entitled to request further extensions of
the Maturity Date as provided for in Section 3.3(a).
44
(d)
Extension for all Requested Lenders:  If all Requested Lenders agree to extend the Subject
Maturity Date pursuant to a Request for Extension, then the Subject Maturity Date of each
Requested Lender shall be extended to the date agreed by each such Requested Lender.
(e)
Partial Extension:  If, with respect to any Request for Extension, the provisions of
Section 3.3(c) or 3.3(d) are not applicable and there are Non-Extending Lenders under
Section 3.3(b), then:
(i)
the Subject Maturity Date for all Extending Lenders shall be extended to the date agreed to by
each such Requested Lender; and
(ii)
the Subject Maturity Date for each such Non-Extending Lender shall not be extended,
provided, however, the Borrower shall be entitled to request further extensions of the Maturity
Date from such Non-Extending Lenders as provided for in Section 3.3(a).
(f)
Independent Decision:  The Borrower understands that consideration of any Request for
Extension constitutes an independent credit decision which each Requested Lender retains
the absolute and unfettered discretion to make and that no commitment in this regard is hereby
given by any Requested Lender and that any extension of the Subject Maturity Date may be on
such terms and conditions in addition to those set out herein as the Lenders may stipulate.
(g)
Default or Event of Default:  If a Default or an Event of Default exists at the time the Borrower
makes a Request for Extension or on the Subject Maturity Date, the Subject Maturity Date of
the Extending Lenders will not be extended.
3.4Increase of Total Commitment
 
The Borrower may at any time and from time to time add additional financial institutions
hereunder as Lenders or, with the consent of the applicable Lender, increase the Commitment of
such Lender and thereby increase the Total Commitment, provided that at the time of any such
addition:
 
(a)no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
(b)
the Total Commitment as so increased (after taking into account any prior reductions of the
Total Commitment pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(i) or Section 11.7) does not exceed
U.S. $800,000,000;
(c)
the Agent and each Fronting Lender has consented to such financial institution becoming a
Lender, if it is not already a Lender, each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld;
(d)
concurrently with the addition of a financial institution as an additional Lender or the increase
of a Lender's Commitment, such financial institution or Lender, as the case may be, shall
purchase from each Lender such portion of the Borrowings of each such Lender as is
necessary to ensure that all Borrowings of all Lenders and including therein such additional
financial institution, are in accordance with the Lender's Proportion of all such Lenders
(including the new financial institution) and such financial institution shall execute such
documentation as is required by the Agent, acting reasonably, to novate such financial
institution as a Lender hereunder; and
(e)
the Borrower has provided to the Agent a certified copy of a directors' resolution of the
Borrower authorizing any such increase in the Total Commitment (which may be the original
directors' resolution authorizing this Credit Facility) together with a legal opinion with respect 
thereto in substantially the same form as the opinions delivered in connection with the closing
of this Agreement.
45
3.5Purpose
 
Borrowings under the Credit Facility shall be used by the Borrower for general corporate
purposes of the Loan Parties.
 
3.6Takeover Notification
 
In the event the Borrower wishes to utilize Accommodations to, or to provide funds to any
Subsidiary to, offer to acquire (which shall include an offer to purchase securities, solicitation of
an offer to sell securities, an acceptance of an offer to sell securities, whether or not the offer to
sell was solicited, or any combination of the foregoing) outstanding securities of any Person
(other than a private issuer as defined under the Securities Act (Alberta) or a corporation whose
shares are directly or indirectly held by one Person) (the "Target") where, as of the date of the
offer to acquire, the securities that are subject to the offer to acquire, together with the securities
of such Person that are beneficially owned, or over which control or direction is exercised, by the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries and any Person acting jointly or in concert with any thereof on the
date that the offer to acquire is made, constitute in the aggregate ten percent (10%) or more of all
of the outstanding securities of that class of securities of the relevant Person (a "Takeover"), then
either:
(a)
Agreement of the Target Entity:  the Borrower shall provide to the Agent evidence satisfactory
to the Agent of the agreement of the board of directors or like body of the Target approving the
Takeover; or
(b)Consent from Lenders:  the following steps shall be followed:
at least five (5) Business Days prior to the delivery of any notice to the Agent pursuant to
Section 3.7 requesting Accommodations intended to be utilized for such Takeover, a senior
officer of the Borrower shall advise the Agent who shall promptly ensure that a Vice President
of each Lender (or such other senior officer of such Lender as may be designated by such
Lender from time to time) is advised of the particulars of such Takeover in sufficient detail to
(i)
enable such Lender to determine whether it will consent to Accommodations from such Lender
being utilized by the Borrower for such Takeover (which consent may be withheld in its sole
and unfettered discretion);
(ii)
within three (3) Business Days of being so advised, each Lender shall notify the Agent as to
whether it will provide its consent, provided that in the event such Lender does not so notify the
Agent within such three (3) Business Day period, such Lender shall be deemed to have
notified the Agent that it does not provide its consent; and
(iii)the Agent shall promptly notify the senior officer of the Borrower of such Lender's decision;
 
and in the event that any Lender does not provide its consent or is deemed to have not provided
its consent, then upon the Agent so notifying the Borrower, such Lender shall have no obligation
to provide Accommodations for such Takeover notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary; provided, however, that each other Lender, as applicable (a
"Consenting Lender") which has provided its consent shall have an obligation, up to the amount
of its Commitment, to provide Accommodations for such Takeover, and Accommodations for
such Takeover shall be provided by each Consenting Lender in accordance with the ratio that its
Lender's Proportion bears to the aggregate of the Lender's Proportions of all the Consenting
Lenders.
46
(c)
Adjustment:  If Accommodations are utilized for the purposes of a Takeover (a "Takeover
Loan") and there are Lenders other than Consenting Lenders (the "Non-Consenting Lenders"),
the Lender's Proportion of each Consenting Lender shall be temporarily adjusted in
accordance with Section 3.13 and subsequent Accommodations shall be funded firstly by
Non-Consenting Lenders and subsequent repayments shall be applied firstly to Consenting
Lenders, in each case, until such time as the Lender's Proportion of each Consenting Lender
and Non-Consenting Lender is equal to such Lender's Proportion in effect immediately prior to
the advance of the Takeover Loan.

Account for Payments;
(ii)

Acceptances, as applicable, and the Borrower shall on the maturity date of the maturing
Bankers' Acceptances pay to each such Lender, through the Agent at the Agent's Account for

payment to each Lender of the Loan or the principal amount of the Bankers' Acceptance being
converted and may use the discounted proceeds of sale of such Bankers' Acceptances or the

applicable, less any acceptance fees to which such Lender is entitled, to purchase Cdn.
Dollars or U.S. Dollars, as applicable, in order to make such payment; and

obligation of the Borrower to each such Lender as a Borrowing of the type into which the
maturing Bankers' Acceptance has been converted.
(d)
Waiver of Presentment and Other Conditions:  The Borrower waives presentment for payment
and, except to the extent of the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of a Lender referred to in
Section 3.9(h), any other defence to payment of any amounts due to a Lender in respect of a
Bankers' Acceptance accepted and, if applicable, purchased by it pursuant to this Agreement
which might exist solely by reason of such Bankers' Acceptance being held, at the maturity
thereof, by such Lender in its own right and the Borrower agrees not to claim any days of grace
if such Lender as holder sues the Borrower on the Bankers' Acceptance for payment of the
amount payable by the Borrower thereunder.  On the specified maturity date of a Bankers'
Acceptance, or such earlier date as may be required or permitted pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement, the Borrower shall, subject to Section 3.9(g), pay the Agent on behalf of the
Lender that has accepted such Bankers' Acceptance, the full face amount of such Bankers'
Acceptance either through payment to the Agent or conversion of such Bankers' Acceptance

of a "depository bill" (as defined in the DBNA), deposited with, and made payable to a "clearing
house" (as defined in the DBNA) including, without limitation, The Canadian Depository for

(B)any reference to authentication of the Bankers' Acceptance will be removed; and
 
(C)any reference to "bearer" will be removed.
(f)
Power of Attorney ‑ Bankers' Acceptances:  As a condition precedent to each Lender's
obligation to accept and, if applicable, purchase Bankers' Acceptances hereunder and, subject
to the DBNA compliance requirements set forth in Section 3.9(e), the Borrower agrees to the
Power of Attorney Terms ‑ Bankers' Acceptances set out in Schedule I and hereby grants to
each Lender a power of attorney on the terms set out in Schedule I, provided that if the
Borrower revokes such power of attorney, a Lender shall not be obliged to accept and
purchase Bankers' Acceptances (and a Non-Acceptance Lender shall not be obligated to
provide BA Equivalent Advances) unless the Borrower, the Agent and all of the Lenders (other
than any Non-Acceptance Lenders) have agreed on amendments to this Agreement which the
Lenders may require to again accept and, if applicable,  purchase Bankers' Acceptances.
(g)
Failure to Give Notice of Repayment:  If the Borrower fails to give notice to the Agent of the
method of repayment of a Bankers' Acceptance prior to the date of maturity of such Bankers'
Acceptance in accordance with the same period of notice required for the original acceptance
of such Bankers' Acceptance as set forth in Section 3.7, the face amount of such Bankers'
Acceptance shall be converted on its maturity to a Prime Loan from the Lender pursuant to
Section 3.14.
(h)
Unlawful Issue or Use:  The Borrower shall pay on demand to the Agent on behalf of each
Lender the face amount of any bankers' acceptance form presented to such Lender for
payment and paid by such Lender that has been unlawfully issued or used or put into
circulation fraudulently or without authority, and shall indemnify such Lender against any loss,
cost, damage, expense or claim regardless of by whomsoever made that such Lender may
suffer or incur by reason of any fraudulent, unauthorized or unlawful issue or use of any such
bankers' acceptance form, other than as is caused by the gross negligence or wilful act or
omission of such Lender or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives failing to
use the same standard of care in the custody of such bankers' acceptance forms as it uses in
the custody of its own property of a similar nature.
(i)
Marketing of Bankers' Acceptances:  The Borrower shall be entitled to elect to market all
Bankers' Acceptances accepted by the Lenders and forming a part of the same issue of
Bankers' Acceptances on any Drawdown Date, Conversion Date or Rollover Date by advising
the Lenders of such election in any Borrowing Notice, Conversion Notice or Rollover Notice.  If
the Borrower fails to advise the Lenders of any such election in any such notice, it shall be
deemed to have required to have such Lenders purchase such Bankers' Acceptances.
50
BA Equivalent Advances:  Notwithstanding Section 3.7(c), the foregoing provisions of this
Section 3.9, and any other provision hereof to the contrary, a Non-Acceptance Lender shall, in
lieu of accepting and, if applicable, purchasing Bankers' Acceptances, make a BA Equivalent
Advance. The amount of each BA Equivalent Advance shall be equal to the Discount
(j)
Proceeds which would be realized from a hypothetical sale of those Bankers' Acceptances
which, but for this Section 3.9(j), such Lender would otherwise be required to accept as part of
such a Borrowing by way of Bankers' Acceptances. To determine the amount of such Discount
Proceeds, the hypothetical sale shall be deemed to take place at the Discount Rate.  Any BA
Equivalent Advance shall be made on the relevant Drawdown Date, Conversion Date or
Rollover Date, as the case may be, and shall remain outstanding for the term of the Bankers'
Acceptances issued concurrently therewith. Concurrently with the making of a BA Equivalent
Advance, a Non-Acceptance Lender shall be entitled to deduct therefrom an amount equal to
the BA Acceptance Fee which, but for this Section 3.9(j), such Lender would otherwise be
entitled to receive as part of such issue of Bankers' Acceptances.  The BA Equivalent Advance
shall accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to the Discount Rate for such Bankers'
Acceptance for the term of such BA Equivalent Advance. Upon the maturity date for such
Bankers' Acceptances, the Borrower shall pay to each Non-Acceptance Lender, in satisfaction
of the BA Equivalent Advance and interest accrued thereon, an amount equal to the face
amount of the Bankers' Acceptance which, but for this Section 3.9(j), such Lender would
otherwise have been required to accept as part of such Borrowing by way of Bankers'
Acceptance, failing which such amount shall be converted to a Prime Loan.
All BA Equivalent Advances made by a Non-Acceptance Lender shall, if requested by such
Lender, be evidenced by promissory notes of the Borrower in form and substance satisfactory to
such Lender, acting reasonably.
 
All references herein to "Bankers' Acceptances" shall, unless otherwise expressly provided
herein or unless the context otherwise requires, be deemed to include BA Equivalent Advances
made by a Non-Acceptance Lender as part of a Borrowing by way of Bankers' Acceptances.
 
As a condition precedent to each Non-Acceptance Lender's obligation to make a BA Equivalent
Advance hereunder, the Borrower agrees to the Power of Attorney Terms – BA Equivalent
Advances set out in Schedule J and hereby grants to each Non-Acceptance Lender a power of
attorney on the terms set out in Schedule J, provided that if the Borrower revokes such power of
attorney, it shall not be entitled to obtain BA Equivalent Advances (or issue Bankers'
Acceptances) unless the Borrower, the Agent and all of the Non-Acceptance Lenders have
agreed on amendments to this Agreement which would again allow the Borrower to obtain BA
Equivalent Advances.

3.11Letters of Credit
Aggregate Amount:  The aggregate face amount of Letters of Credit issued and outstanding
under the Credit Facility at any one time shall not exceed U.S. $200,000,000 or the Equivalent
Amount in Cdn. Dollars.  The aggregate face amount of Fronted Letters of Credit (determined
in U.S. Dollars with the face amount of any Letter of Credit issued in Cdn. Dollars being
converted to the Equivalent Amount thereof in U.S. Dollars) issued by a Fronting Lender shall
not exceed its Fronted LC Commitment.  Any Letter of Credit issued under the Credit Facility
(a)
shall be issued by a Fronting Lender (to the extent it has a Fronted LC Commitment for the
type of Letter of Credit being issued) on behalf of the Lenders, and the Borrower shall have the
right to select which Fronting Lender shall issue any particular Letter of Credit.
52
(b)
Term:  No Letter of Credit shall be issued for which any Lender has liability where the expiry
date of any such requested Letter of Credit extends past the Maturity Date of such Lender.
(c)
Issuance:  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Fronting Lender, on behalf of the
Lenders and in reliance on the agreements of the Lenders set forth in Section 3.11(d), agrees
to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower in Canadian Dollars or U.S. Dollars
from time to time on any Business Day.  The Borrower and Lenders acknowledge that it may
be necessary when issuing Letters of Credit for a correspondent bank or an affiliate of a
Fronting Lender to issue such Letters of Credit and agree that, in any such circumstance, such
Fronting Lender (and not the correspondent bank or the affiliate) shall continue to be entitled to
all the rights and remedies hereunder of a Fronting Lender and continue to be liable for all
obligations of a Fronting Lender, in each case in respect of any such Letter of Credit
notwithstanding it did not issue such Letter of Credit.  Letters of Credit issued by a Fronting
Lender hereunder shall be in a form satisfactory to such Fronting Lender acting reasonably
and in accordance with its usual and customary practices and shall, in all cases with respect to
letters of credit, be issued subject to Uniform Customs & Practice for Documentary Credits,
International Chamber of Commerce, Publication No. 600 or International Standby Practices
(ISP98), International Chamber of Commerce, Publication No. 590, as applicable, and shall, in
all cases with respect to letters of guarantee, be issued subject to Uniform Customs & Practice
of Demand Guarantees, International Chamber of Commerce, Publication No. 758.  A Letter of
Credit shall not be issued by a Fronting Lender if any Lender would be prohibited, if it were
issuing such Letter of Credit, from issuing such Letter of Credit by any applicable law,
regulation, treaty, official directive or regulatory requirement now or hereafter in effect (whether
or not having the force of law).
Letter of Credit Participations:  Each Fronting Lender irrevocably grants, and in order to induce
such Fronting Lender to issue its Letters of Credit hereunder, each Lender irrevocably accepts
and hereby purchases from such Fronting Lender on the terms and conditions hereinafter
stated, for its own account and risk, an undivided interest equal to such Lender's Proportion in
such Fronting Lender's obligations and rights under each Letter of Credit issued by it
hereunder and the amount of each draft paid by such Fronting Lender thereunder.  Each
Lender unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with each Fronting Lender that, on or before
the close of business of such Fronting Lender on each day on which a draft is paid under a
Letter of Credit for which such Fronting Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, pursuant to
Section 3.11(j) (a "Participation Date"), such Lender will pay to the Agent for the account of
such Fronting Lender at the Agent's Branch of Account such Lender's Proportion of any such
unpaid amount.  Such Fronting Lender shall notify the Agent who shall notify each Lender of
the occurrence of a Participation Date, and the amount payable by it to the Agent based on
such Lender's Lender's Proportion.  If any Lender fails to make any such payment on or prior to
the first Business Day after such Lender receives notice as provided above, then interest shall
accrue on such Lender's obligation to make such payment during the period from such
(d)
Business Day to the day such Lender makes such payment (or, if earlier, the date on which the
Borrower reimburses such Fronting Lender as required pursuant to Section 3.11(j)), at the rate
specified in Section 5.6.
53
(e)
Repayment of Lenders:  Upon and only upon receipt by a Fronting Lender of funds from the
Borrower in full or partial reimbursement of any draft paid under a Letter of Credit issued by
such Fronting Lender with respect to which any Lender has theretofore paid the Agent for the
account of such Fronting Lender in full for such Lender's participation pursuant to
Section 3.11(d) and in full or partial payment of interest, commissions or fees on such draft
paid under such Letter of Credit, such Fronting Lender will pay to such Lender, in the same
funds as those received by such Fronting Lender or net against any then due obligation of
such Lender under Section 3.11(d) to make any payment to such Fronting Lender such
Lender's Proportion of such funds.
(f)
Role of each Fronting Lender:  Each Fronting Lender shall endeavour to ensure that any
drawing under a Letter of Credit complies with the terms of such Letter of Credit, and in doing
so, and in connection with all of its other activities regarding a Letter of Credit, will exercise and
give the same care and attention to each Letter of Credit issued by it as it gives to its other
letters of credit and similar obligations.  A Fronting Lender's sole liability to each Lender shall
be to promptly return to the Agent for the account of the Lenders the Lender's Proportion of
each Lender of any payments made to such Fronting Lender by the Borrower, as applicable,
pursuant to Section 3.11(d) where the Borrower has made a payment to such Fronting Lender
pursuant to Section 3.11(e).  Each Lender agrees that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of
Credit issued by a Fronting Lender, such Fronting Lender shall not have any responsibility to
obtain any document (other than as required by such Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire
as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of any person delivering
any such document.  No Fronting Lender nor any of its representatives, officers, employees or
agents shall be liable to any Lender for:
(i)
any action taken or omitted to be taken in connection herewith at the request or with the
approval of the Majority Lenders;
(ii)
any action taken or omitted to be taken in connection with any Letter of Credit in the absence
of gross negligence or wilful misconduct; or
(iii)
the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, or
any other document contemplated thereby.
A Fronting Lender shall not incur any liability by acting in reliance upon any notice, consent,
certificate, statement or other writing (which may be a bank wire or similar writing) believed by it
to be genuine or to be signed by the proper party or parties.
Lenders' Obligations Absolute:  Each Lender acknowledges that its obligations to a Fronting
Lender under this Section 3.11, including the obligation to purchase and fund a participation in
the obligations and rights of such Fronting Lender under each Letter of Credit issued by it and
any drafts paid by it for which it has not been fully reimbursed by the Borrower, are absolute
(g)
and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including,
without limitation:
(i)the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default;
(ii)
any failure or inability of any other Lender to purchase or fund such a participation hereunder;
or
(iii)any other failure by any other Lender to fulfil its obligations hereunder.
54
Each payment by a Lender to a Fronting Lender for its own account shall be made without any
offset, compensation, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
(h)
Reinstatement and Survival:  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a Fronting
Lender is required at any time whether before or after the Maturity Date to make any payment
under a Letter of Credit which was outstanding on or before the Maturity Date, each Lender
shall pay over to the Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.11 and for the
account of such Fronting Lender the amount of such Lender's Lender's Proportion of such
amount.  If such Fronting Lender is required at any time (whether before or after the Maturity
Date) to return to the Borrower or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar
official any portion of the payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower to such Fronting
Lender in reimbursement of the Borrower's obligations in respect of such Letter of Credit and
interest thereon, each Lender shall, on demand of such Fronting Lender forthwith pay over to
the Agent for the account of such Fronting Lender such Lender's Lender's Proportion of such
amount, plus interest thereon from the day such demand is made to the day such amount is
returned by such Lender to such Fronting Lender at the rate specified in Section 5.6.
(i)Procedure for Issuance and Renewal of Letters of Credit:
(i)
The Borrower may request that a Fronting Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering a notice
to the Agent pursuant to Section 3.7(e) and by delivering to such Fronting Lender at such
Fronting Lender's Branch of Account a letter of credit application on such Fronting Lender's
then customary form with appropriate changes to be consistent with the terms of this
Agreement (as such form may be modified from time to time, the "Letter of Credit Application"),
completed to the satisfaction of such Fronting Lender, acting reasonably, together with the
proposed form of such Letter of Credit (which shall comply with the applicable requirements set
forth herein) and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as such
Fronting Lender may reasonably request; provided that in the event of a conflict between this
Agreement and the Letter of Credit Application, this Agreement shall govern with respect to
such conflict.
Within three (3) Business Days following the date on which the Agent shall have received the
notice pursuant to Section 3.7(e) and a Fronting Lender shall have received the Letter of Credit
Application including the proposed form of the Letter of Credit and such additional certificates,
documents and other papers and information as such Fronting Lender may have reasonably
requested in satisfaction of all conditions to the issuance thereof, such Fronting Lender shall,
(ii)
provided the conditions precedent in Section 8.2 have been complied with, issue such Letter
of Credit.
(iii)
The Borrower may request the extension or renewal of a Letter of Credit issued hereunder by
giving written notice to the Agent at least two (2) Business Days prior to the then current expiry
date of such Letter of Credit (provided that a Fronting Lender may accommodate notices on
shorter notice in its sole discretion).  If the conditions precedent in Section 8.2 shall have been
fulfilled as required thereby, the applicable Fronting Lender shall promptly issue such
extension or renewal.
(j)
Reimbursement of a Fronting Lender:  In the event that any drawing shall be made under any
Letter of Credit issued by a Fronting Lender:
(i)
such Fronting Lender shall promptly notify the Agent who shall promptly notify the Borrower of
such payment and of the amount thereof;
55
(ii)the Borrower shall pay to such Fronting Lender the amount of any such drawing, failing which:
(A)
the payment by such Fronting Lender of such drawing shall, if the Letter of Credit was in U.S.
Dollars, constitute the making of a U.S. Base Rate Loan to the Borrower by each Lender
according to its Lender's Proportion; and
(B)
the payment by such Fronting Lender of such drawing shall, if the Letter of Credit was in Cdn.
Dollars, constitute the making of a Prime Loan to the Borrower by each Lender according to its
Lender's Proportion;
(iii)
such Fronting Lender shall notify the Agent who shall notify each Lender by telecopier, by
email or by telephone (confirmed by telecopier or by email) of such drawing; and
(iv)
immediately upon receipt of such notice, each Lender shall make its Lender's Proportion, in
U.S. Dollars or Cdn. Dollars, as applicable, available to the Agent for the account of such
Fronting Lender by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Agent's Account for
Payments for the account of such Fronting Lender.
(k)Designation and Termination of Fronting Lenders:
(i)
The term of the Fronted LC Commitment of each Fronting Lender shall expire on June 3,
2019 and shall be subject to extension pursuant to Section 3.11(k)(ii).
(ii)In connection with its response to any Request for Extension, a Fronting Lender shall either:
(A)
extend its Fronted LC Commitment for a further one (1) year period (or such other period as
may be acceptable to such Fronting Lender in its sole discretion) at the same amount, a lower
amount or, with the consent of the Agent and the Borrower, a higher amount; or
(B)terminate its Fronted LC Commitment effective on the expiration of its then current term.
(iii)The Borrower shall be entitled from time to time to:
(A)
with the consent of the Agent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, designate a
Lender as a Fronting Lender by providing a written notice to the Agent designating such
Lender to be a Fronting Lender and which notice shall include the consent to such
designation of such Lender; and
(B)
subject to Section 3.11(k)(iv), terminate a Fronting Lender as a Fronting Lender by providing a
written notice of such termination to the Agent and such Fronting Lender;
provided that at any one time there shall be no more than four (4) Fronting Lenders without the
consent of the Agent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.
(iv)
In the event that the Borrower exercises its right to terminate a Fronting Lender as a Fronting
Lender pursuant to Section 3.11(k)(iii)(B) or a Fronting Lender elects to terminate its Fronted
LC Commitment pursuant to Section 3.11(k)(ii)(B) and there are Letters of Credit outstanding
which were issued by such Fronting Lender, the Borrower shall use its reasonable
commercial efforts to replace all such Letters of Credit with Letters of Credit issued by another
Fronting Lender and, upon such replacement, such Fronting Lender shall cease to be a
Fronting Lender.
56
(v)
In the event that a Fronting Lender has notified the Borrower in writing that, pursuant to
Section 11.3, it is no longer able to issue Letters of Credit on behalf of the Lenders, then such
Fronting Lender shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit except for any Letter
of Credit which specifically replaces (which shall for the purposes hereof include the automatic
renewal of a Letter of Credit which by its terms is automatically renewed unless the beneficiary
thereof is advised otherwise) in whole or in part a Letter of Credit which has a maturity date
less than ninety (90) days after any such notice is given and provided that in any such case
such issue would not contravene any applicable law, statutory regulation or treaty and if such
Fronting Lender requests in writing, the Borrower shall use its reasonable commercial efforts
to replace any such Letters of Credit issued by such Fronting Lender as soon as practicable
with a Letter of Credit issued by another Fronting Lender.
(vi)
Without limiting its obligations under Section 3.11(k)(iv)  and Section 3.11(k)(v), the Borrower
shall be entitled to replace any Letter of Credit issued by a Fronting Lender which has
terminated its Fronted LC Commitment under Section 3.11(k)(ii)(B) or provided a notice
pursuant to Section 11.3, with a Letter of Credit issued by another Fronting Lender who
agrees to issue such replacement Letter of Credit and, upon the replacement of all Letters of
Credit issued by such Fronting Lender, such Fronting Lender shall cease to be a Fronting
Lender.
Where, pursuant to Section 3.11(k)(iii)(B), the Borrower terminates a Fronting Lender as a
Fronting Lender or, pursuant to Section 3.11(k)(ii)(B), a Fronting Lender terminates its
Fronted LC Commitment, or, pursuant to Section 11.3, a Fronting Lender provides a notice to
the Borrower that it is no longer able to issue Letters of Credit on behalf of the Lenders, such
(vii)
Fronting Lender shall remain a Fronting Lender under all Letters of Credit issued by it until all
such Letters of Credit have been either replaced, expired or been presented for payment and
all payments required to be made to such Fronting Lender by the Borrower and/or the
applicable Lenders pursuant to this Section 3.11 as a result of any payment made under any
Letter of Credit issued by such Fronting Lender have been made. Upon the replacement,
expiry, termination or presentment for payment (and all payments required to be made to such
Fronting Lender having been paid), of any outstanding Letters of Credit issued by such
Fronting Lender, such Fronting Lender's Fronted LC Commitment shall be terminated.
(l)Cash-Collateralization of Letters of Credit:
 
If:
(i)
the Agent delivers an Acceleration Notice or an Event of Default occurs under Section 10.1(f)
or 10.1(g);
(ii)
any Letter of Credit is the subject matter of any order, judgement, injunction or other such
determination (a "Judicial Order") restricting payment under and in accordance with such
Letter of Credit or extending a Fronting Lender's liability beyond the expiration date stated in
such Letter of Credit; or
57
(iii)the Borrower shall repay Borrowings to a Lender pursuant to Section 4.1 or Section 4.2;
 
then the Borrower shall pay to the Agent an amount, in the currency in which the Letter of Credit
is denominated, equal to (A) the maximum amount available to be drawn under all unexpired
Letters of Credit in the case of paragraph (i); (B) the maximum amount available to be drawn
under the Letter of Credit subject to the Judicial Order in the case of paragraph (ii); and (C) an
amount equal to the applicable Lender's Proportion of the maximum amount available to be
drawn under any unexpired Letters of Credit in respect of each Lender whose Borrowings are
required to be repaid in the case of paragraph (iii).  Any such amounts paid by the Borrower to
the Agent shall be held by the Agent in a Cash Collateral Account as continuing collateral
security for the obligations of the Borrower to reimburse the Lenders for amounts paid by a
Fronting Lender (and, if applicable, by a Lender in respect of its obligations under Section 3.11(d)
(collectively, the "LC Disbursements") in respect of any such Letter of Credit.  Such cash
collateral shall be applied to satisfy the obligations of the Borrower for such Letters of Credit as
LC Disbursements are made thereunder.
 
Unless an Event of Default shall then have occurred and be continuing, the Agent shall release
to the Borrower any amount remaining in the Cash Collateral Accounts (after applying the
amounts necessary to discharge all obligations of the Borrower relating to such Letters of Credit)
on the date on which either the original Letter of Credit has been returned for cancellation or the
Letter of Credit has expired, provided in either case such Fronting Lender is released to the
reasonable satisfaction of such Fronting Lender by the beneficiary thereof from any other
obligation in respect of such Letter of Credit, or, in the case of a Judicial Order, the date on which
any final and non-appealable order, judgement or other determination has been rendered or
issued either terminating such Judicial Order or permanently enjoining the applicable Fronting
Lender from paying under such Letter of Credit.
 
3.12Notice of Repayment
 
The Borrower shall give the Agent prior written notice substantially in the form of Schedule B of
each repayment of Borrowings in accordance with the same period of notice required pursuant to
Section 3.7 for the initial drawdown of the basis of Borrowing being repaid. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a Bankers' Acceptance shall only be repaid on its maturity date and a Libor Loan may
only be repaid prior to the last day of the Libor Interest Period applicable to such Libor Loan upon
payment by the Borrower of amounts payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 11.5.
 
3.13Pro‑Rata Treatment of Borrowings
(a)
Pro-Rata Borrowings:  Subject to Section 3.13(c), each Borrowing and each basis of
Borrowing shall be made available by each Lender and all repayments and reductions in
respect thereof shall be made and applied in a manner so that the Borrowings and each basis
of Borrowing outstanding hereunder to each Lender will, to the extent possible, thereafter be in
the same proportion as the Lender's Proportion of such Lender. The Agent is authorized by the
Borrower and each Lender to determine, in its sole and unfettered discretion, the amount of
Borrowings and each basis of Borrowing to be made available by each Lender and the
application of repayments and reductions of Borrowings to give effect to the provisions of this
Section 3.13(a) and Section 7.2; provided that, subject to Section 3.13(c), no Lender shall, as
a result of any such determination, have Borrowings outstanding in an amount which is in
excess of the amount of its Commitment.
58
(b)
Where Different Maturity Dates:  If, at any time there are Lenders with different Maturity Dates,
all Lenders will share in Accommodations based on their Lender's Proportion except to the
extent the particular Accommodation requested has a maturity date after the Maturity Date of a
Lender, in which case only those Lenders with a Maturity Date later than the maturity date of
the requested Accommodation will be required to participate in providing such
Accommodation and the Borrower may request a similar Accommodation, to the extent
permitted hereunder, from the other Lenders with a maturity date occurring on or before the
Maturity Date of such Lenders.  Each determination by the Agent of a Lender's Lender's
Proportion shall be prima facie evidence thereof.
Agent's Discretion on Allocation:  If it is not practicable to allocate Bankers' Acceptances to
each Lender such that the aggregate amount of Bankers' Acceptances required to be
purchased by such Lender hereunder is in a whole multiple of Cdn. $100,000, the Agent is
authorized by the Borrower and each Lender to make such allocation as the Agent determines
in its sole and unfettered discretion may be equitable in the circumstances.  In no event shall
the outstanding Borrowings of a Lender exceed its Lender's Proportion by more than
Cdn. $100,000 as a result of such exercise of discretion by the Agent.  In the event it is not
practicable to allocate each basis of Borrowing in accordance with Section 3.13(a) by reason
of the occurrence of circumstances described in Sections 11.2, 11.3 or 11.4, the Agent is
authorized by the Borrower and each Lender to make such allocation as the Agent determines
in its sole and unfettered discretion may be equitable in the circumstances, but no Lender
(c)
shall, as a result of any such allocation, have any Borrowings outstanding in an amount which
is in excess of the amount of its Commitment.
(d)
Further Assurances by Borrower:  To the extent reasonably possible, the Borrower and each
Lender agrees to be bound by and to do all things necessary or appropriate to give effect to
the provisions of this Section 3.13.
3.14Conversion Option
 
The Borrower may, during the term of this Agreement, convert any basis of Borrowing (other than
a Letter of Credit) to another basis of Borrowing (other than a Letter of Credit) upon giving the
Agent a Conversion Notice in accordance with the period of notice and other requirements set
out in Section 3.7 applicable to the basis of Borrowing to which any Borrowing is being
converted (other than delivery of a Borrowing Notice), provided that:
(a)
Bankers' Acceptances:  a Bankers' Acceptance may only be converted on its maturity date;
and
(b)
Libor Loans:  a Libor Loan may be converted on the last day of the Libor Interest Period
applicable to such Libor Loan or on any other day if the Borrower pays all amounts payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 11.5.
On each Conversion Date, the Borrower shall be required to repay to the Agent for the account of
the Lenders the basis of Borrowing which is being converted and, subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, the Lenders shall be required to make available to the Borrower the Borrowings into
which such basis of Borrowing is being converted; provided that the Borrower shall be entitled to
direct the Agent to use the proceeds of all or any part of a new Borrowing to repay the Borrowing
being converted.
59
3.15Rollovers
 
The Borrower may effect a Rollover of all or, subject to the minimum aggregate amount specified
in Section 3.7, a part of a Borrowing outstanding by way of a Libor Loan or Bankers' Acceptance
upon giving the Agent a Rollover Notice in accordance with the period of notice and other
requirements set out in Section 3.7 applicable to a Borrowing of the same type unless
immediately prior to the commencement of any subsequent Libor Interest Period or the term of
any subsequent Bankers' Acceptance, a Default (in respect of which the Agent has advised the
Borrower that no Rollovers will be permitted) or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, in which event the Borrower shall be deemed to have converted, in the case of a
Libor Loan, to a U.S. Base Rate Loan pursuant to Section 3.14 or, in the case of a Bankers'
Acceptance, to a Prime Loan pursuant to Section 3.14 and the Borrower shall not be entitled to
continue such Libor Loan subsequent to the existing Libor Interest Period or, in the case of a
Bankers' Acceptance, subsequent to its maturity date. In the event notice of a Rollover of an
existing Libor Loan is not given pursuant to this Section 3.15 or notice of a conversion of such
existing Libor Loan is not given pursuant to Section 3.14, such Libor Loan shall be converted to a
U.S. Base Rate Loan on the last day of the Libor Interest Period applicable to such existing Libor
Loan.
 
3.16Notices Irrevocable
 
All notices delivered or deemed to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Article 3 shall be
irrevocable and shall oblige the Borrower to take the action contemplated on the date specified
therein.
 
3.17Lender Swaps
Each of the Lenders (or an Affiliate of such Lender) may from time to time enter into Swaps with
any Loan Party during the term of this Agreement. The parties agree that all Swap Indebtedness
shall be guaranteed under the Loan Party Guarantee and secured by the Security and shall, as to
the Security, rank pari passu with the Obligations, the Cash Management Facility Indebtedness
and the Operating Facility Indebtedness.
 
3.18Cash Management Facilities
 
The parties acknowledge that all Cash Management Facility Indebtedness under all Cash
Management Facilities shall be guaranteed under the Loan Party Guarantee and secured by the

Indebtedness and the Operating Facility Indebtedness.
 
3.19Operating Facilities
 
The parties agree that all Operating Facility Indebtedness under all Operating Facilities shall be

ARTICLE 4
REPAYMENT AND PREPAYMENT
 
4.1Repayment of Borrowings
 
On the Maturity Date of each Lender, the Borrower shall repay all Borrowings and other
Obligations then outstanding to such Lender, and such Lender's Commitment shall be reduced to
zero and the Total Commitment shall be reduced by a corresponding amount.  The Borrower
shall ensure that Libor Loans, Bankers' Acceptances and Letters of Credit made by or accepted
by each Lender either mature or expire on or before the Maturity Date of such Lender.
 
4.2Repayment of Borrowings In Excess of Commitments
 
If, due to exchange rate fluctuations, Borrowings (determined in U.S. Dollars with all Borrowings
denominated in Cdn. Dollars being converted to the Equivalent Amount of U.S. Dollars) to any
Lender are:
(a)
in excess of its Commitment by any amount on a Drawdown Date, Conversion Date or
Rollover Date, the Borrower shall, as part of such Drawdown, Conversion or Rollover reduce
or eliminate such excess on such date; and
(b)
in a situation where subsection (a) above does not apply, in excess of its Commitment by more
than five percent (5%) for more than two (2) consecutive Business Days, the Borrower shall
within five (5) Business Days thereafter (if such excess is still continuing) repay, provide funds
to the Agent for deposit into a Cash Collateral Account in accordance with Section 10.4 or
Section 3.11(l), as applicable or otherwise reduce a portion of such Borrowings to the extent of
the amount of any excess so remaining.
4.3Breakage Costs
 
If, on any day on which payments or prepayments are required to be made under Section 4.1 or
Section 4.2, the Borrowings then outstanding include Libor Loans, Bankers' Acceptances or
Letters of Credit in an amount such that the prepayment would require the Borrower to be liable
under the funding indemnity contained in Section 11.5 or to pay a Bankers' Acceptance prior to
its maturity date, or to pay a Letter of Credit prior to its expiry date, that portion of the prepayment
which would otherwise be applied against any such Libor Loan, Bankers' Acceptance or Letter of
Credit may, at the option of the Borrower, be paid to the Agent for deposit into a Cash Collateral
Account in accordance with Section 10.4 or Section 3.11(l), as applicable and be applied against
such Libor Loan on the expiration of the Libor Interest Period applicable thereto, to such Bankers'
Acceptance on its maturity date or to such Letter of Credit on its expiry date or the date of drawing
thereunder.  Interest earned on such amounts while on deposit in a Cash Collateral Account
shall be paid to the Borrower if no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing after
the payment of any other amounts then due and owing by the Borrower hereunder.
 
4.4Cancellation of Total Commitment
 
The Borrower may, without penalty or premium, at any time during the term of this Agreement,
upon at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent, cancel all of the Total
Commitment or any portion thereof in minimum amounts of U.S. $5,000,000 and whole multiples
of U.S. $1,000,000 thereafter by cancelling the Commitment of each Lender in an amount equal
to such Lender's Lender's Proportion of the amount of the Total Commitment being so cancelled;
provided that on or prior to the last day of such notice period the Borrower has:
61
(a)
Prepaid Borrowings:  prepaid or otherwise reduced Borrowings outstanding to each Lender in
an amount equal to the amount by which Borrowings outstanding to such Lender would
otherwise be in excess of its Lender's Proportion immediately after the reduction of the
Commitments provided for in such notice; and
(b)
Paid Interest:  paid all accrued interest and other charges and fees in respect of the
Borrowings being repaid or reduced as aforesaid.
Any such notice of cancellation is irrevocable and the amount of the Commitment of each Lender
so cancelled and reduced may not be reinstated hereunder.
4.5Early Repayment of Libor Loans, Letters of Credit and Bankers' Acceptances
 
The Borrower shall not cancel all or any portion of the Commitment of any Lender pursuant to
Section 4.4 if the Borrowings required to be repaid to such Lender as a result thereof include
Letters of Credit with an expiry date falling subsequent to the date of such cancellation, Libor
Loans with a Libor Interest Period falling subsequent to the date of such cancellation or Bankers'
Acceptances accepted by such Lender with a maturity date falling subsequent to the date of such
cancellation unless, on the date of such cancellation, the Borrower has paid to the Agent at the
Agent's Account for Payments, for the account of such Lender: (i) in respect of Libor Loans, the
amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 11.5, (ii) in respect of Letters of Credit, the
undrawn amount thereof, and (iii)  in respect of Bankers' Acceptances, the face amount thereof, in
each case to be held in a Cash Collateral Account.
 
4.6Evidence of Indebtedness
 
The Agent shall open and maintain accounts and records on its books at the Agent's Branch of
Account evidencing the Borrowings and other amounts owing by the Borrower to the Lenders
under this Agreement.  The Agent shall debit therefrom the amount of such Borrowings and shall
enter therein each payment of principal of and interest on the Borrowings and fees and other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement and shall record the Bankers' Acceptances
accepted, and if applicable, purchased by the Lenders and the Letters of Credit issued by the
Fronting Lender and all other amounts becoming due to the Agent and each Lender under this
Agreement.  The accounts and records of the Agent so kept shall constitute, in the absence of
manifest error, prima facie evidence of the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Agent and each
Lender pursuant to this Agreement, the date each such Lender made each Borrowing available
to the Borrower and the amounts the Borrower has paid from time to time on account of the
principal and interest on the Borrowings, fees payable pursuant to this Agreement and other
amounts owing hereunder.
 
ARTICLE 5
PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND FEES
 
5.1Interest on Prime Loans
 
The Borrower shall pay interest in Canadian Dollars on each Prime Loan made by each Lender
at the Agent's Account for Payments at a rate per three hundred and sixty-five (365) days equal to
the Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin applicable to such Prime Loan. A change in the Prime
Rate or the Applicable Margin will simultaneously cause a corresponding change in the interest
payable on each Prime Loan.  Such interest shall accrue daily based on the Prime Rate and
Applicable Margin in effect on each day and is payable quarterly in arrears on each Interest Date
for the period commencing on and including the immediately prior Interest Date up to but not
including the Interest Date on which such interest is to be paid and shall be calculated on a daily
basis and on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of three hundred sixty-five
(365) days. The annual rates of interest to which the rates determined in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this Section 5.1 are equivalent are the rates so determined multiplied by
the actual number of days in the relevant calendar year and divided by three hundred sixty-five
(365).
62
5.2Interest on U.S. Base Rate Loans
 
The Borrower shall pay interest in U.S. Dollars on each U.S. Base Rate Loan made by each
Lender at the Agent's Account for Payments at a rate per three hundred sixty-five (365) day
period equal to the U.S. Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin applicable to such U.S. Base
Rate Loan.  A change in the U.S. Base Rate or the Applicable Margin will simultaneously cause
a corresponding change in the interest payable on each U.S. Base Rate Loan.  Such interest
shall accrue daily based on the U.S. Base Rate and Applicable Margin in effect on each day and
is payable quarterly in arrears on each Interest Date for the period commencing on and including
the immediately prior Interest Date up to but not including the Interest Date on which such interest
is to be paid and shall be calculated on a daily basis and on the basis of the actual number of
days elapsed in a year of three hundred sixty-five (365) days.  The annual rates of interest to
which the rates determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.2 are
equivalent are the rates so determined multiplied by the actual number of days in the relevant
calendar year and divided by three hundred sixty-five (365).
 
5.3Interest on Libor Loans
 
The Borrower shall pay interest in U.S. Dollars on each Libor Loan made by each Lender at the
Agent's Account for Payments for the period commencing on and including the first day of the
Libor Interest Period applicable to such Libor Loan up to but not including the last day of such
Libor Interest Period at a rate equal to the sum of Libor plus the Applicable Margin applicable to
such Libor Loan and which is in effect on the first day of the Libor Interest Period applicable to
such Libor Loan. A change in the Applicable Margin will simultaneously cause a corresponding
change in the interest payable on each Libor Loan. Such interest shall accrue daily based on
Libor and the Applicable Margin in effect on each day and is payable on each Libor Interest Date
applicable to such Libor Interest Period and shall be calculated on a daily basis and on the basis
of the actual number of days elapsed in the period for which such interest is payable (including
the first day of such period but excluding the date on which such interest is payable) divided by
three hundred sixty (360). The annual rates of interest to which the rates determined in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.3 are equivalent are the rates so
determined multiplied by the actual number of days in the relevant calendar year and divided by
three hundred sixty (360).
 
5.4Bankers' Acceptance Fees
 
The Borrower shall pay acceptance fees in Canadian Dollars at the Agent's Account for
Payments forthwith upon the acceptance by each Lender of each Bankers' Acceptance issued by
the Borrower at a rate per three hundred sixty-five (365) day period equal to the BA Acceptance
Fee applicable to and in effect on the date of acceptance of such Bankers' Acceptance
calculated on the face amount of such Bankers' Acceptance and on the basis of the number of
days in the term of such Bankers' Acceptance divided by three hundred sixty-five (365). 
Acceptance fees payable to the Agent pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be paid in the manner
specified in Section 3.9.  All fees payable pursuant to this Section 5.4 on any date in respect of
any issuance of Bankers' Acceptances shall be calculated by the Agent and payable by the
Borrower based on the BA Acceptance Fee in effect on such date, provided that if during the term
of any such Bankers' Acceptance a change in the BA Acceptance Fee occurs, the fees paid by
the Borrower in respect of such Bankers' Acceptance shall be adjusted, effective upon the
change in the BA Acceptance Fee occurring, to reflect the BA Acceptance Fee for the remaining
term (if any) of the Bankers' Acceptance, and the Borrower, in the case of an increase in the
BA Acceptance Fee, shall no later than three (3) Business Days after receipt of a notice from the
Agent make such payments to the Agent at the Agent's Account for Payments for the account of
each Lender as are necessary to reflect such change, and each Lender, in the case of a
decrease in the BA Acceptance Fee, shall credit any amount which would otherwise be
refundable to the Borrower against amounts in respect of interest or fees accruing hereunder in
relation to the Borrower.  The annual rates of fees to which the rates determined in accordance
with the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.4 are equivalent, are the rates so determined
multiplied by the actual number of days in a period of one year commencing on the first day of the
period for which such interest is payable and divided by three hundred and sixty-five (365).
63
5.5Letter of Credit Fees
(a)
Issue Fee:  The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the benefit of each Lender an issue fee in
the same currency as the Letter of Credit is denominated, such fee to be equal to the Letter of
Credit Fee.  Such issue fee shall be payable by the Borrower quarterly in arrears on the first
Business Day of each calendar quarter for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, and
shall, for each Lender, be calculated daily based on the Letter of Credit Fee in effect, the face
amount of such Letter of Credit and a year of three hundred sixty-five (365) days.  A change in
the Applicable Margin will simultaneously cause a corresponding change in the Letter of
Credit Fee payable under any outstanding Letter of Credit.
(b)
Fronting Fee:  The Borrower shall pay to the Agent (solely for the account of any Fronting
Lender):
(i)
a fronting fee as agreed to in writing by the Borrower and such Fronting Lender at or prior to
issuing any Letter of Credit, such fee to be paid in the same currency as the issue fee for such
Letter of Credit; and
(ii)
such costs and expenses as are charged by such Fronting Lender and agreed to by the
Borrower at or prior to the time of issuing any Letter of Credit.
(c)Other Costs:  The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, each Fronting Lender and each Lender its:
(i)
set-up fees, cable charges and other customary miscellaneous charges in respect of the issue
of Letters of Credit and upon the amendment or transfer of each Letter of Credit and each
drawing made thereunder; and
(ii)
customary documentary and administrative charges for amending, transferring or drawing
under, as the case may be, Letters of Credit of a similar amount, term and risks.
5.6Interest on Overdue Amounts
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in the event that any amount due hereunder
(including, without limitation, any interest payment) is not paid when due (whether by
acceleration or otherwise), the Borrower shall and hereby agrees to pay to the Agent on behalf of
each Lender interest on such unpaid amount (including, without limitation, interest on interest), if
and to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, from the date that such amount is due until
the date that such amount is paid in full (but excluding the date of such payment if the payment is
made before noon (Toronto time), and such interest shall accrue daily, be calculated and
compounded on the last Business Day of each calendar month and be payable in the currency of
the relevant Borrowing on demand, as well after as before maturity, default and judgment, at a
rate per annum that is equal to:
64
(a)
if such amount is payable in Canadian Dollars, the interest rate applicable to Prime Loans
outstanding from time to time hereunder whether or not any Prime Loans are then outstanding
plus the Applicable Margin plus two percent (2%) per annum; and
(b)
if such amount is payable in U.S. Dollars, the interest applicable to U.S. Base Rate Loans
outstanding from time to time hereunder whether or not any U.S. Base Rate Loans are then
outstanding plus the Applicable Margin plus two percent (2%) per annum.
The Borrower hereby waives, to the fullest extent it may do so under Applicable Law, any
provisions of Applicable Law, including specifically the Interest Act (Canada) and the Judgment
Interest Act (Alberta), which may be inconsistent with this Agreement.
 
5.7Agent's Fees
 
The Borrower shall pay an agency fee to the Agent (for the Agent's sole account) at the Agent's
Account for Payments, in an amount as agreed from time to time between the Agent and the
Borrower, payable on November 20, 2016 and on each annual anniversary thereof and such fees
shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be deemed to be an amount payable pursuant to this
Agreement.
 
5.8Maximum Rate Permitted by Law
 
No interest or fee to be paid hereunder shall be paid at a rate exceeding the maximum rate
permitted by Applicable Law. In the event any such interest or fee exceeds such maximum rate,
such interest or fee shall be reduced or refunded, as the case may be, so as to be payable at the
highest rate recoverable under Applicable Law.
 
5.9Interest Generally
 
The theory of deemed reinvestment shall not apply to the calculation of interest or payment of
fees or other amounts hereunder, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or in any
other Loan Document now or hereafter granted to or taken by the Agent or any Lender and all
interest and fees payable by the Borrower to a Lender shall accrue from day to day and be
computed as described herein in accordance with the "nominal rate" method of interest
calculation.
 
5.10Standby Fees
 
Prior to the Maturity Date of each Lender, the Borrower shall pay to the Agent on behalf of such
Lender standby fees in U.S. Dollars payable quarterly in arrears on the first Business Day of
each calendar quarter and on the applicable Maturity Date.  Each payment of standby fees shall
be calculated for the period commencing on and including the first day of the immediately prior
calendar quarter (or the date of this Agreement, as the case may be), up to and including the last
day of such immediately prior calendar quarter or such Maturity Date, as applicable, and shall be
in an amount equal to the Standby Fee Rate from time to time in effect during such calendar
quarter or other period and shall be calculated on the amount, if any, of the difference obtained by
subtracting the Borrowings outstanding from each Lender during such period from the amount of
such Lender's Commitment during such period.  Such standby fees shall be calculated on a daily
basis and on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of three hundred sixty-five
(365) days.  For purposes of calculating standby fees payable pursuant to this Section 5.10, the
amount of the Borrowings outstanding from time to time in Cdn. Dollars on each day during the
period for which such standby fees are payable shall be notionally converted to the Equivalent
Amount in U.S. Dollars at the rate of exchange in effect for purposes of determining an
Equivalent Amount on such day.
65
5.11Interest and Fee Adjustment
 
In the event of a change in the Applicable Margin and Standby Fee Rate as a result of a change
in the Consolidated Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, such change shall become effective
on the day falling three (3) Business Days after the day on which the Borrower delivers a
Compliance Certificate in accordance with the requirements hereof evidencing such change in
the Consolidated Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, or, if the Borrower has not delivered a
Compliance Certificate as required by the terms hereof within the time permitted by Section 9.1(f),
then such change in the Applicable Margin and Standby Fee Rate shall become effective on the
day falling three (3) Business Days after the latest date permitted hereunder for delivery of such
Compliance Certificate and the Applicable Margin and Standby Fee Rate shall be based on the
highest rate in the tables in the definitions of Applicable Margin and Standby Fee Rate for the
period from such day until the date of delivery thereof.
 
ARTICLE 6
LOAN PARTY GUARANTEE AND SECURITY
 
6.1Loan Party Guarantee and Security
 
To secure the payment and performance of all Obligations, Swap Indebtedness, Operating
Facility Indebtedness and Cash Management Facility Indebtedness (collectively, the "Secured
Obligations") the Borrower shall, to the extent not previously delivered, execute and deliver or
cause to be executed and delivered to the Agent the Loan Party Guarantee from each Loan

a security agreement governed by the laws of New York from each Canadian Loan Party and
U.S. Loan Party granting a first priority security interest over all present and after-acquired
personal property;
(c)

to the extent available (as determined by the Agent in consultation with Lenders' counsel),
over the assets of such Acceptable Foreign Material Subsidiary as contemplated by

(d)any Deposit Account Control Agreement; and
 
(e)any additional security then required by Section 9.1(t) or any other provision hereof;
 
in each case subject to such exclusions as may be specified in the agreement providing such

where such registration is necessary or desirable to perfect or otherwise protect the Security
Interest granted thereunder, provided that, (i) except to the extent contemplated by subsection (s)
of the definition of Permitted Encumbrances and by Section 9.1(t)(ii), no serial number
registrations shall be required for service rigs or other motor vehicles and no deliveries of
certificates of title shall be required for Certificated Service Rigs or other motor vehicles and
(ii) except to the extent contemplated by Section 9.1(t)(i), no fixed mortgages on real property
shall be required, in each case prior to the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default hereunder. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall not be required to cause a Material Subsidiary
to deliver any such Security to the extent that the cost of providing such Security is excessive in
relation to the benefit to be afforded to the Lenders thereby, as determined by the Agent, acting
reasonably.
66
6.2Form of Loan Party Guarantee and Security
 
Without limiting the foregoing, the Loan Party Guarantee and the Security will be in such form or
forms as will be required by the Agent, acting reasonably.  Should the Agent determine at any
time and from time to time that the form and nature of the then existing Loan Party Guarantee or
Security is deficient in any way or does not fully provide the Secured Lenders with the
guarantees and Security Interests and priority to which each is entitled hereunder, the Borrower
will forthwith execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered to the Agent, at the
Borrower's expense, such amendments to the Loan Party Guarantee or Security or provide such
new guarantees or security as the Agent may reasonably request, in a form satisfactory to the
Agent, acting reasonably.
 
6.3Registrations and Renewals
The Borrower shall and shall cause each other Loan Party to, at the Borrower's sole cost and
expense, do all such commercially reasonable acts, execute all such instruments and provide
such further assurances as the Agent may reasonably request to ensure that all of the Security
remains legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Loan Parties which are a party
thereto, and that the priority of the Security Interests created by all of the Security executed and
delivered to the Agent as contemplated hereby is duly protected and perfected by registration,
delivery, filing or recordation of such Security or a caution, caveat, security notice or other
appropriate instrument at all offices where necessary to the protection or perfection thereof and to
cooperate with the Agent and the Agent's counsel in renewing or refiling any registration, filing or
recordation required hereby in order to preserve, protect and maintain the priority of such Security
Interests, from time to time.
 
6.4Security Effective Notwithstanding Date of Advance
 
The Security Interests constituted by any of the Security or required to be created hereby or
thereby shall be effective, and the undertakings as to Security Interests herein or in any Security
shall be continuing, whether the monies hereby or thereby secured or any part thereof shall be
advanced before or after or at the same time as the creation of any such Security Interest or
before or after or upon the date of execution of this Agreement, and shall not be affected by any
fluctuation in the amount of Secured Obligations from time to time or the accounts established by
any Secured Lender ceasing to be in debit balance
.
6.5Extensions, Etc.
 
Each Secured Lender may directly, or through the Agent or other duly authorized representatives,
grant extensions, take and give up securities, accept compositions, grant releases and
discharges and otherwise deal with any Loan Party or any other Persons, sureties or securities
as such Secured Lender, in its sole discretion, may see fit, all without prejudice to the liability of
any Loan Party under the Secured Documents or the rights of any Secured Lender under the
Secured Documents.
67
6.6No Merger
 
The taking of the Loan Party Guarantee or any Security as provided under this Agreement or any
Secured Document shall not operate by way of merger of any of the obligations of any Loan Party
or any successor of any Loan Party under any Secured Document, or of any Security Interest,
guarantee, contract, promissory note, bill of exchange or security in any other form, whether or
not similar to the foregoing, and no judgment recovered by the Agent on behalf of the Secured
Lenders shall operate by way of merger or in any way affect the obligations and security provided
for in this Agreement, which shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other security
now or hereafter held by the Agent or any other Secured Lender whether for indebtedness
hereunder or under any Security.  For greater certainty, no judgment recovered by the Agent or
any other Secured Lender shall operate by way of merger or in any way affect the obligation of
the Borrower to pay interest at the rates, times and manner as provided in this Agreement or any
other Secured Document.
6.7Material Subsidiary Designation
(a)
Provision of Guarantee and Security:  Any Person which is required to be, or which the
Borrower designates to be, a Material Subsidiary shall, within the timeframe required by
Section 9.1(u), provide the Loan Party Guarantee and Security required to be provided
pursuant to Section 6.1, together with such supporting resolutions, corporate certificates and
legal opinions as the Agent may reasonably request, all in form and substance satisfactory to
the Agent, acting reasonably.
(b)
Optional Designation:  Subject to Section 9.1(u), the Borrower may from time to time by notice
in writing to the Agent be entitled to designate a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Borrower
(whether direct or indirect) to be a Material Subsidiary; provided that the Borrower shall not be
entitled to make any such designation if immediately after giving effect to any such designation
a Default or Event of Default would occur or be continuing.
(c)
Redesignation as Subsidiary:  The Borrower may from time to time by notice in writing to the
Agent be entitled to designate that a Material Subsidiary will no longer be a Material
Subsidiary; provided that the Borrower shall not be entitled to make any such designation if
immediately after giving effect to any such designation a Default or Event of Default would
occur or be continuing.
(d)
Release of Guarantee and Security:  If the Borrower requests that a Material Subsidiary no
longer be designated as a Material Subsidiary and the conditions in Sections 6.7(c) have been
or will be satisfied, the Agent shall confirm in writing the redesignation of such Material
Subsidiary as a Subsidiary and shall release such Subsidiary from the Loan Party Guarantee
and cancel and release the Security of such Subsidiary.
6.8Release of Loan Party Guarantee or Security
 
The Agent is instructed by the Lenders to release a Material Subsidiary from the Loan Party
Guarantee and release and discharge the Security provided by it if required under Section 6.7(d),
and to release and discharge Security if required pursuant to Section 6.9.  The Agent is
authorized by the Lenders to provide postponements of the Security at the reasonable discretion
of the Agent with respect to Permitted Encumbrances.  In the event of a Disposition permitted by
Section 9.2(b) (if the Disposition is to a Person other than a Loan Party), the Agent is instructed
by the Lenders (i) to release and discharge the Security with respect to the Collateral included in
such Disposition and (ii) if all the capital stock of a Material Subsidiary is included in such
Disposition, to release and discharge such Material Subsidiary from its obligations under the
Loan Party Guarantee and the Security.
68
The Lenders hereby authorize the Agent, and the Agent hereby agrees, to release the Loan Party
Guarantee and the Security and discharge the Security Interests constituted by the Security at the
Borrower's sole cost and expense forthwith after all of the Secured Obligations have been
unconditionally and irrevocably paid or performed in full and the Credit Facility, all Lender Swaps
(except where the Lender Swaps provide for alternate credit support if the Credit Facility is
terminated and the applicable Swap Lenders have confirmed receipt of such alternate credit
support), all Operating Facilities and all Cash Management Facilities have been terminated.
 
6.9Fall-away of Security
 
The Collateral shall be released from the Security Interests created by the Security and the
Security shall be discharged at the Borrower's request if: (a) the Borrower shall have received
and at that time shall maintain corporate family ratings of at least BBB- from S&P and at least
Baa3 from Moody's and (b) prior thereto or concurrent therewith, all Security Interests securing
the Second Lien Debt are also discharged (the date of such release, the "Release Date").  If,
following the Release Date, the Borrower's corporate family ratings shall cease to be at least
BBB- by S&P and at least Baa3 by Moody's, the Loan Parties shall promptly, and in any event
within 60 days, enter into documentation reasonably requested by the Agent so as to cause the
Secured Obligations to be secured on the same basis as the Security Obligations were secured
prior to the Release Date.
 
6.10Permitted Encumbrances
 
None of:
 
(a)the fact that any Person is permitted to create or suffer to exist any Permitted Encumbrance;
(b)
the fact that any representation, warranty or covenant herein may make an exception for the
existence of Permitted Encumbrances; or
(c)
the fact that the Security Interests created pursuant to the Loan Documents are stated to be
subject to, or are not required to rank in priority to, Permitted Encumbrances;
shall in any manner, nor in any cause or proceeding, directly or indirectly, be taken to constitute a
subordination of any Security Interest created pursuant to the Loan Documents to any Permitted
Encumbrance or to any other Security Interest or other obligation whatsoever, it being the
intention of the parties that all Security Interests created pursuant to the Loan Documents shall at
all times, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, rank as first priority Security
Interests in priority to Permitted Encumbrances (except in relation to those Permitted
Encumbrances listed in subsections (j), (k) and (p) of the definition of Permitted Encumbrances)
and all other Security Interests or other obligations whatsoever.
 
6.11Consent to Appointment of Collateral Agent
 
Prior to or concurrent with the issuance of any Second Lien Debt, the Borrower and the Lenders
each hereby authorize the Agent to appoint an independent collateral agent, satisfactory to the
Agent and the Second Lien Creditors (the "Collateral Agent") to hold common security
documents for the common benefit of holders of the Secured Obligations and the Second Lien
Creditors on terms substantially similar to the terms of the existing Security and otherwise on
terms satisfactory to the Agent.  At such time, the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders agree to
enter into an amendment to, or an amendment and restatement of, the Credit Agreement, as may
be required to reflect the issuance of such common security, such amendment or amendment
and restatement to be in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent and the Lenders, acting
reasonably.

interest pursuant to Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, fees pursuant to Sections 5.4 and 5.5, and
interest on overdue amounts pursuant to Section 5.6; and

that the Borrowings outstanding hereunder to each Lender will to the extent possible, be in the
same proportion as its Lender's Proportion.
70
7.3Taxes
(a)
Payments Clear of Taxes:  Any and all payments any Loan Party to the Agent or any Lender
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made without set-off or
counterclaim, free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any
Tax.
(b)
Payments Subject to Taxes:  If any Loan Party determines in good faith that it is required by
Applicable Law to deduct, withhold or pay any Taxes, or if any liability for Taxes shall be
imposed on the Agent or a Lender or shall arise against the Agent or a Lender from or in
respect of any payment by or on account of any obligation of a Loan Party hereunder or under
any other Loan Document, then:
(i)
if such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable shall be increased by that Loan Party
(and, in the case of a Material Subsidiary, the Borrower shall cause such Material Subsidiary to
do so) by an amount (and, in the case of interest, the interest increased) when payable as
necessary so that after making or allowing for all required deductions, withholdings and
payments (including deductions, withholdings and payments applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section) the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or payments been required;
(ii)
the Borrower shall, and shall cause any Material Subsidiary to, make any such deductions or
withholdings required to be made by it under Applicable Law; and
(iii)
the Borrower shall, and shall cause any Material Subsidiary to, timely pay the full amount of
Taxes required to be deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with Applicable Law.
(c)
Tax Refunds:  In the event the Borrower has made a payment pursuant to Section 7.3(b), then
(i) the relevant Lender shall take reasonable steps to make such applications or other filings
(including for greater certainty, the filing of a Canadian income tax return) so as to obtain a
reduction or refund of any such withheld or deducted amounts, and (ii) where the relevant
Lender is thereafter granted or receives a credit, refund or remission in respect of the Taxes for
which the relevant deduction or withholding was made, such Lender shall refund to the
Borrower such amount (if any) as such Lender determines in good faith will leave such Lender
in no worse position than would have been the case if there had never been any obligation to
make such deduction or withholding in the first place.
Indemnification by Borrower: The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and each Lender, within
10 Business Days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes
(including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under
this Section 7.3) paid in good faith by the Agent or such Lender and any penalties, interest and
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower
(d)
by a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a
Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(e)
Indemnification by Lender:  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within 10
Business Days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender
(but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Agent for such
Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), and (ii) any
Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to provide written notice of an assignment of all or a
portion of a Loan and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to
any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby
authorizes the Agent to set-off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such
Lender under this Agreement or otherwise payable by the Agent to the Lender from any other
source against any amount due to the Agent under this Section 7.3(e).
71
(f)
Evidence of Payments:  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by a
Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Agent the original or a
certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a
copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Agent.
(g)
FATCA:  If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S.
federal withholding Taxes imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the
applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or
1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent
at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law and at such time or times reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law
(including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional
documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for
the Borrower and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine
that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine
the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this Section
7.3(g) "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this
Agreement.
(h)
Survival.  The provisions of this Section 7.3  shall survive the repayment of the Obligations
and cancellation of the Credit Facility.

The Borrower authorizes and directs the Agent, in its discretion, to automatically debit, by
mechanical, electronic or manual means, the bank accounts of the Borrower maintained with the
Agent for all amounts payable under the Loan Documents including, without limitation, in respect
of principal, interest and fees payable under this Agreement and recoverable expenses due and
payable hereunder or under any Loan Document.

(w)
Most Favoured Lenders:  if at any time the Second Lien Financing Agreement or any other

default that are more onerous or restrictive, taken as a whole, than the covenants or events of
default provided in the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents taking into account the
different relevant circumstances between the Second Lien Financing Agreement and the
Second Lien Creditors and the Loan Documents and the Lenders, then: (i) such more
restrictive covenants or events of default shall upon notice from the Agent be incorporated by
reference in this Agreement as if set forth fully herein, mutatis mutandis, and no such provision
may thereafter be waived, amended or modified under this Agreement except pursuant to the
provisions of Section 12.12 of the Credit Agreement, and (ii) the Borrower shall promptly, and
in any event within 10 Business Days after entering into any such more restrictive covenants
or events of default so advise the Agent in writing.  Thereafter, upon the request of the Majority
Lenders, the Majority Lenders shall enter into an amendment to the Credit Agreement
evidencing the incorporation of such more restrictive covenants or events of default, it being
agreed that any failure to make such request or to enter into any such amendment shall in no

Transaction") unless:
(i)
other than in the case of a Reorganization Transaction involving only Loan Parties or involving
only one or more Loan Parties and one or more Permitted Reorganization Subsidiaries, S&P
and Moody's have each confirmed that the rating applicable to the Successor would not be less

without limiting or restricting other remedies or rights under contract, at law or in equity:
(a)
Terminate Commitment:  cease to make or continue any Borrowings hereunder,
notwithstanding any prior receipt by the Agent of a Borrowing Notice, Conversion Notice or
Rollover Notice or any other event and the Agent may, by written notice to the Borrower,
declare the Total Commitment and the right of the Borrower to apply for further
Accommodations to be terminated; and
(b)
Acceleration Notice:  by written notice to the Borrower (an "Acceleration Notice"), declare all
Borrowings (including the face amount of all Bankers' Acceptances and the undrawn amount
of all outstanding Letters of Credit) and other liabilities and indebtedness (whether matured or
unmatured) of the Borrower to the Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents to be immediately due and payable (or to be due and payable at such later time as
may be stated in such notice) without further demand, presentation, protest or other notice of
any kind, all of which are expressly waived by the Borrower;
provided that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in Section 10.1(f) or 10.1(g)
the Total Commitment shall automatically terminate and all Borrowings (including the face
amount of all Bankers' Acceptances and the undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit)
and other indebtedness and liabilities hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall

the Agent on behalf of the Lenders all amounts owing or payable in respect of all Borrowings
(including the face amount of all Bankers' Acceptances and the undrawn amount of all
outstanding Letters of Credit) and other indebtedness and liabilities hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents, failing which all rights and remedies of the Agent and the Lenders under
the Loan Documents shall thereupon become enforceable.
 
10.3Demands for Repayment of other Secured Obligations
(a)
Ability to Deliver Other Secured Lender Demands:  If the Agent, on behalf of the Majority
Lenders, delivers an Acceleration Notice:
(i)
each Swap Lender may, within three (3) Business Days, deliver (to the extent applicable to it) a
Swap Demand for Payment;
(ii)
each Operating Facility Lender may, within three (3) Business Days, deliver (to the extent
applicable to it) an Operating Facility Demand for Repayment; and
(iii)
each Cash Management Facility Provider may within three (3) Business Days, deliver (to the
extent applicable to it) a Cash Management Facility Demand for Repayment.
(b)
Termination Event:  If a Termination Event has occurred and all Secured Obligations are not
thereafter due and payable, each Secured Lender shall, within three (3) Business Days,
deliver such Demands for Repayment as may be necessary to ensure that all Secured
Obligations are thereafter due and payable under all Secured Documents.
87
Notification by other Secured Lenders:  If any Secured Lender (other than the Agent and the
Lenders) proposes to deliver a Demand for Repayment, such Secured Lender shall notify the
Agent of its determination (who shall thereupon promptly notify each Lender), and the Agent,
within a further five (5) Business Days after receipt of the aforesaid notice, shall notify all such
Secured Lenders whether the Agent, on behalf of the Majority Lenders, proposes to deliver an
Acceleration Notice hereunder. If the Agent does not so advise such Secured Lenders within
such five (5) Business Day period it shall be deemed to have advised that the Majority Lenders
do not propose to deliver an Acceleration Notice. If the Agent does notify such Secured
Lenders that the Majority Lenders propose to deliver an Acceleration Notice, all Demands for
Repayment shall, to the extent not already delivered and to the extent practicable, be delivered
concurrently by the Agent and the other Secured Lenders.  If the Agent does notify such
Secured Lenders that the Majority Lenders do not propose, or the Agent is deemed to have
advised that the Majority Lenders do not propose, to deliver an Acceleration Notice, the
Secured Lender which delivered the notice to the Agent may, if it has not already delivered its
Demand for Repayment, at any time within thirty (30) days thereafter deliver the Demand for
Repayment under its Secured Document. If the Secured Lender delivering any such Demand
for Repayment does not receive the amount so demanded on or prior to the time stated in such
Demand for Repayment, such Secured Lender shall so notify the Agent, and the Agent and
each other Secured Lender shall forthwith concurrently deliver such Demands for Repayment
(c)
as may be necessary to ensure that all Secured Obligations are thereafter due and payable
under all Secured Documents.
(d)
No Sharing:  Any amounts which are lawfully received by any Secured Lender under its
Secured Document prior to the earlier of the delivery by the Agent of an Acceleration Notice or
the occurrence of a Termination Event hereunder are not required to be shared pursuant to the
provisions of Section 10.7.
(e)
Lender Affiliates:  If a Secured Document is entered into with an Affiliate of a Lender, that
Lender shall cause such Affiliate to be bound by this Agreement, including for certainty, any
requirements to deliver a Demand for Repayment as required by this Section 10.3 and such
obligations shall survive such Lender ceasing to be a Lender hereunder.
10.4Cash Collateral Accounts
 
Upon the occurrence of:
 
(a)a Termination Event or delivery of an Acceleration Notice; or
(b)
an event where the Borrower makes payment to a Cash Collateral Account of the required
amount;
the Borrower shall forthwith pay to the Agent, for deposit into a Cash Collateral Account, an
amount (which, in the case of (b) above, shall not be in excess of the required amount referred to
therein) equal to the Lender's maximum potential liability under then outstanding Bankers'
Acceptances, and (unless the Borrower makes payment of the amount required pursuant to
Section 11.5) Libor Loans (collectively, the "Escrow Funds").  The Escrow Funds shall be held
by the Agent for set-off against future indebtedness owing by the Borrower to the Lenders in
respect of such Bankers' Acceptances, and (unless the Borrower makes payment of the amount
required pursuant to Section 11.5) Libor Loans, or, in the case of (b) above, be applied as
required by Section 4.3.
88
 
10.5Remedies on Default
 
After an Event of Default:
Majority Lenders Instructions:  if the Majority Lenders provide directions or instructions to the
Agent, the Agent on behalf of all Secured Lenders shall take such actions and commence
such proceedings as the Majority Lenders in their sole discretion may determine and may
enforce or otherwise realize upon any Security, all without any obligation to marshal any
Security Interests and without additional notice, presentation, demand or protest, all of which
the Borrower hereby expressly waives (to the extent such rights may be waived under
Applicable Law).  If, from time to time, there are no Secured Lenders other than Swap Lenders,
Operating Facility Lenders or Cash Management Facility Providers, the Majority Lenders for
(a)
the purposes of this Agreement shall be calculated by revising paragraph (b) of the definition
of Majority Lenders to read: "during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default when
there are any Secured Obligations outstanding, those Secured Lenders to whom there is
owing 50.1% or more of the aggregate Secured Obligations under all Secured Documents;" ;
and
(b)
General Remedies:  the rights and remedies of the Agent and each Secured Lender under the
Loan Documents are cumulative and are in addition to and not in substitution for any rights or
remedies provided by law. The Agent may, on behalf of all Secured Lenders, and shall, if so
required by the Majority Lenders, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, bring suit at law,
in equity or otherwise for any available relief or purpose including but not limited to:
(i)
Specific Performance:  the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in the
Loan Documents;
(ii)Injunction:  enjoining a violation of any of the terms of the Loan Documents;
 
(iii)Assistance:  aiding in the exercise of any power granted by the Loan Documents or by law; or
(iv)

Borrowings or amounts otherwise due hereunder or under the Loan Documents.
10.6Right of Set-Off
 
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, and in addition to any
rights now or hereafter granted under Applicable Law and not by way of limitation of any such
rights, the Agent and each Secured Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time
thereafter, without notice to the Borrower or to any other Person (any such notice being expressly
waived by the Borrower), to combine, consolidate or merge all or any of the Borrower's accounts
with and liabilities to it and to set-off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general
or special, time or demand, provisional or final) and any other indebtedness at any time held by
or owing by it to or for the credit of or the account of the Borrower against and on account of any
Secured Obligations (including the face amount of all Bankers' Acceptances and the undrawn
amount of all Letters of Credit) and other liabilities and indebtedness of the Borrower to the Agent
or such Secured Lender under this Agreement and the other Secured Documents, including,
without limitation, all claims of the Agent or any Secured Lender of any nature or description
arising out of or connected with this Agreement and the other Secured Documents, irrespective of
whether or not the Agent or any Secured Lender has made any demand under this Agreement or
any of the other Secured Documents and although such obligations, liabilities or claims of the
Borrower or any of them are contingent or unmatured.
89
 
10.7Application and Sharing of Payments Following Acceleration
 
Except as otherwise agreed to by all the Secured Lenders in their sole discretion, all monies and
property received by the Secured Lenders for application in respect of the Secured Obligations
subsequent to the delivery of an Acceleration Notice or the occurrence of an Event of Default
specified in Sections 10.1(f) or 10.1(g) and all monies received as a result of a realization upon
the Loan Party Guarantee and the Security shall be applied and distributed to the Secured
Lenders in the manner set forth below, each such application to be made in the following order
with any balance remaining after application in respect of each category to be applied to the next
succeeding category:
(a)
firstly, in or towards payment of any fees or expenses then due and payable to the Agent
hereunder or under any other Loan Document;
(b)
secondly, pro rata among the Secured Lenders in respect of amounts due and payable to such
Secured Lenders as and by way of recoverable expenses under its Secured Documents or
under any of the Security;
(c)
thirdly, pro rata among the Secured Lenders (other than the Swap Lenders) in respect of
amounts due and payable to such Secured Lenders by way of interest, acceptance fees, letter
of credit fees, interest on overdue amounts and standby fees; and
(d)
fourthly, pro rata among the Secured Lenders in or towards repayment of the Secured
Obligations.
To the extent that a Secured Document is entered into by an Affiliate of a Lender, that Lender
shall cause such Affiliate to comply with the provisions of this Section 10.7 and such obligation
shall survive such Lender ceasing to be a Lender hereunder.
 
10.8Adjustments
 
In the event that:
(a)
Contingent Liabilities:  at the Adjustment Time, a portion of the Secured Obligations are
outstanding as letters of credit or letters of guarantee and it is subsequently determined that
the applicable Secured Lenders are not required to make payment under any one or more
such instruments; or
(b)
Notice Periods:  any of the Secured Lenders are required by Applicable Law to continue to
make advances or other amounts available to the Borrower subsequent to the Adjustment
Time by reason of a requirement in Applicable Law to give the Borrower a reasonable period
of notice prior to terminating such Lender's obligation to make such advances or other
amounts available;
then, whenever and so often as that occurs, Secured Obligations shall be redetermined by
excluding from the determination of the amount of Secured Obligations any payments not
required to be made as a result of the occurrence of an event described in Section 10.8(a) and by
including in the determination of Secured Obligations any amount required to be made available
pursuant to Section 10.8(b), and the Secured Lenders shall thereupon make all such payments
and adjustments as may be necessary to ensure amounts outstanding to the Secured Lenders
are thereafter outstanding in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.11.
90
 
10.9Lender May Perform Covenants
 
If any Loan Party shall fail to perform any of its obligations under any covenant contained in any
of the Loan Documents or any other Secured Document within the time permitted for the
performance of any such covenant or for the cure of any default thereof, the Agent may, on behalf
of the Secured Lenders and with the approval of the Majority Lenders and with prior notification to
the Borrower, perform any such covenant capable of being performed by it and, if any such
covenant requires the payment or expenditure of money, it may make such payment or
expenditure with its own funds on behalf of the Secured Lenders. If the Agent elects to effect such
observance or performance, neither the Agent nor any Secured Lender shall be liable for any
failure or deficiency in effecting such observance or performance, nor for the payment of any bills,
invoices or accounts incurred or rendered in connection therewith, except to the extent the Agent
or such Secured Lender is grossly negligent or acts with wilful misconduct. All amounts so paid
by the Agent hereunder shall be repaid by the Borrower on demand therefor, and shall bear
interest at the rate set forth in Section 5.6 from and including the date paid by the Agent
hereunder to but excluding the date such amounts are repaid in full by the Borrower and shall be
guaranteed by the Loan Party Guarantee and secured by the Security.
 
10.10Waiver of Default
 
Any single or partial exercise by any Secured Lender, the Agent or by the Agent on behalf of any
Secured Lender of any right or remedy for a default or breach of any term, covenant, condition or
agreement contained in the Loan Documents or any other Secured Document shall not be
deemed to be a waiver of or to alter, affect or prejudice any other right or remedy to which the
Agent or such Secured Lender may be lawfully entitled for the same default or breach, and any
waiver by any Secured Lender, the Agent or by the Agent on behalf of any Lender or Swap
Lender of the strict observance, performance or compliance with any term, covenant, condition or
agreement contained in the Loan Documents or any other Secured Document, and any
indulgence granted thereby, shall be deemed not to be a waiver of any subsequent default. To
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Borrower hereby waives any rights now or hereafter
conferred by statute or otherwise which are inconsistent with the Agent's or a Secured Lender's
rights or remedies under the Loan Documents and any other Secured Document.

All statements, reports, certificates, opinions and other documents or information required to be
furnished to the Agent or the Lenders by any Loan Party under this Agreement shall be supplied
by the Borrower without cost to the Agent or any Lender.  The Borrower agrees:
(a)
to pay or reimburse the Agent for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the development, preparation and execution of, and any amendment,
supplement or modification to, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other
documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation and
administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the reasonable
fees and disbursements of one Canadian counsel, one U.S. counsel and one local counsel in
each relevant jurisdiction and filing and recording fees and expenses, with statements with
respect to the foregoing to be submitted to the Borrower prior to the Effective Date (in the case
of amounts to be paid on the Effective Date) and from time to time thereafter on a periodic
basis as the Agent shall deem appropriate;
91
(b)
to pay or reimburse each Lender and the Agent for all its out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the enforcement, preservation of any rights under, or the
restructuring or workout of, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other
documents, including the fees and disbursements of its counsel; and
(c)
to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and the Agent harmless from, any and all recording
and filing fees and any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay in paying,
stamp, excise and other taxes, if any, that may be payable or determined to be payable in
connection with the execution and delivery of, or consummation or administration of any of the
transactions contemplated by, or any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any waiver
or consent under or in respect of, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such
other documents.
All amounts due under this Section 11.1 shall be payable not later than 10 days after written
demand therefor.
 
11.2Increased Cost
 
If, after the date hereof, the introduction of, any change in, or the implementation of, any
Applicable Law (including any capital adequacy requirement) (other than any taxes on the
overall net income of a Lender or upon the overall capital of a Lender), regulation, treaty or official
directive now or hereafter in effect (whether or not having the force of law) or any change in the
interpretation or application thereof by any court or by any judicial or Governmental Authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or if compliance by any Lender with any
request from any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority (whether or not having
the force of law) (individually, a "Circumstance"):
(a)
subjects a Lender to any Tax, changes the basis of taxation of payments due to a Lender or
increases any existing Tax, on payments of principal, interest or other amounts payable by the
Borrower to a Lender under this Agreement;
imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special deposit, capital adequacy,
regulatory or similar requirement against assets or liabilities held by a Lender, or deposits of or
for the account of a Lender, or loans by a Lender, or any other acquisition of funds for loans by
(b)a Lender or commitments by a Lender to fund loans or obligations of a Lender in respect of
bankers' acceptances accepted by such Lender or letters of credit or letters of guarantee
issued by such Lender; or
(c)imposes on a Lender any other condition with respect to this Agreement;
 
and the result of (a), (b) or (c) is, in the sole determination of such Lender acting reasonably and
in good faith, to increase the cost to such Lender or to reduce the income receivable by such
Lender in respect of a Borrowing, such Lender shall promptly notify the Agent.  Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, (i) the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith
and (ii) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International
Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority)
or the United States, Canadian or other regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III
((i) and (ii) being, the "New Rules"), shall in each case be deemed to be a "change in law" for the
purposes of this Section 11.2, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued, in each case (i)
to the extent materially different from that in effect on the date hereof and (ii) to the extent that
such New Rules have general application to substantially all of the banks within the jurisdiction
in which such Lender operates.  The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Borrower
shall pay to the Agent for the benefit of such Lender from time to time that amount which
compensates such Lender for such additional cost or reduction in income from time to time
("Additional Compensation") on the next Libor Interest Date in the case of a Libor Loan, on the
next date of issuance of any Bankers' Acceptances or Letters of Credit or on the next Interest
Date in any other case (and each successive Libor Interest Date, date of issuance or Interest
Date, if applicable), provided that the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any such Additional
Compensation unless such Lender is generally claiming similar compensation from other
customers in similar circumstances, and the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any portion of
such Additional Compensation accruing under this Section 11.2 for any period prior to the date
which is three (3) months prior to the date on which the Agent, on behalf of such Lender, gives
notice to the Borrower that such Additional Compensation is so accruing, provided that, if the
circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such three (3) month
period shall be extended to involve the period of such retroactive effect.  A photocopy of the
relevant law, regulation, treaty, official directive or regulatory requirement (or, if it is impracticable
to provide a photocopy, a written summary of the same) and a certificate by a duly authorized
officer of such Lender (prepared in good faith) setting forth the amount of the Additional
Compensation and the basis for it must be submitted by the Agent to the Borrower and is prima
facie evidence of the amount of the Additional Compensation.  If the Agent notifies the Borrower
that Additional Compensation is owed, the Borrower shall pay such Additional Compensation to
the Agent for the account of such Lender and the Borrower shall have the right, upon written
irrevocable prior notice of at least three (3) Business Days to the Agent to make payment in full to
the Agent for the account of such Lender in respect of the applicable Borrowing on the date
specified in such notice together with accrued but unpaid interest and fees in respect of such
Borrowing or to convert such Borrowing into another basis of Borrowing available under this
Agreement.
92
11.3Illegality
 
If the introduction of or any change in applicable law, regulation, treaty, official directive or
regulatory requirement now or hereafter in effect (whether or not having the force of law) or any
change in the interpretation or application thereof by any court or by any judicial or governmental
authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, makes it unlawful or prohibited
for a Lender (in its sole opinion acting reasonably and in good faith) to make, fund or maintain the
Borrowings or a portion of the Borrowings or to perform its obligations under this Agreement,
such Lender may by written notice to the Borrower through the Agent terminate its obligations
under this Agreement to make such Borrowings or perform such obligations and the Borrower
shall either (i) prepay such Borrowings within fifteen (15) Business Days together with all
accrued but unpaid interest and fees as may be applicable to the date of payment, or (ii) convert
by notice to the Agent such Borrowings forthwith into another basis of Borrowing available under
this Agreement.  If any Lender determines, acting reasonably, that any Applicable Law has made
it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender to
hold or benefit from a Security Interest over real property pursuant to any law of Canada or the
United States (or any province, state or territory thereof) or otherwise, such Lender may notify the
Agent and disclaim any benefit of such Security Interest to the extent of such illegality; provided,
that such determination or disclaimer shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such Security
Interest for the benefit of the Agent or any other Lender.
93
 
11.4Market Disruption
(a)
Libor Loans:  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, if at any time
subsequent to the Borrower giving a Borrowing Notice, a Conversion Notice or a Rollover
Notice to the Agent with regard to any requested Libor Loan:
(i)
the Agent, acting reasonably, determines that by reason of circumstances affecting the London
Interbank Eurodollar Market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the rate of
interest with respect to, or deposits are not available in sufficient amounts in the ordinary
course of business at the rate determined hereunder to fund, a requested Libor Loan during the
ensuing Libor Interest Period selected;
(ii)
the Agent, acting reasonably, determines  that the making or continuing of the requested Libor
Loan by the Lenders has been made impracticable by the occurrence of an event which
materially adversely affects the London Interbank Eurodollar Market generally; or
(iii)
the Agent is advised by Lenders, acting reasonably, holding at least 35% of the Total
Commitment and being not less than 35% in number of Lenders by written notice (each, a
"Lender Libor Suspension Notice"), such notice to be received by the Agent no later than 2
p.m. (Toronto time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the requested Drawdown,
Rollover or Conversion, as applicable, that such Lenders have determined, acting reasonably,
that Libor will not or does not represent the effective cost to such Lenders of U.S. Dollar
deposits in the London Interbank Eurodollar Market for the relevant Libor Interest Period,
then the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower as soon as possible
after such determination or receipt of such Lender Libor Suspension Notice, as applicable, and
the Borrower shall, within one (1) Business Day after receipt of such notice and in replacement of
the Borrowing Notice, Conversion Notice or Rollover Notice previously given by the Borrower,
give the Agent a Borrowing Notice or a Conversion Notice, as applicable, which specifies the
Drawdown of any other Accommodation or the Conversion of the relevant Libor Loan on the last
day of the applicable Libor Interest Period into any other Accommodation which would not be
affected by the notice from the Agent pursuant to this Section 11.4.
 
In the event the Borrower fails to give, if applicable, a valid replacement Conversion Notice with
respect to the maturing Libor Loans which were the subject of a Conversion Notice or Rollover
Notice, such maturing Libor Loans shall be converted on the last day of the applicable Libor
Interest Period into U.S. Base Rate Loans from the Lender as if a valid replacement Conversion
Notice had been given by the Borrower pursuant to the provisions hereof. In the event the
Borrower fails to give, if applicable, a valid replacement Borrowing Notice with respect to a
Drawdown originally requested by way of a Libor Loan, then the Borrower shall be deemed to
have requested a Drawdown by way of a U.S. Base Rate Loan in the amount specified in the
original Borrowing Notice and, on the originally requested Drawdown Date, the Lenders (subject
to the other provisions hereof) shall make available the requested amount by way of a U.S. Base
Rate Loan.
 
(b)Bankers' Acceptances:  If:
(i)
the Agent, acting reasonably, makes a determination, which determination shall be conclusive
and binding upon the Borrower, and notifies the Borrower, that there no longer exists an active
market for bankers' acceptances accepted by the Lenders; or
94
(ii)
the Agent is advised by Lenders holding at least 35% of the Total Commitment and being not
less than 35% in number of Lenders by written notice (each, a "Lender BA Suspension
Notice") that such Lenders have determined, acting reasonably, that the Discount Rate will not
or does not accurately reflect the cost of funds of such Lenders or the discount rate which
would be applicable to a sale of Bankers' Acceptances accepted by such Lenders in the
market;
then:
(iii)
the right of the Borrower to request Bankers' Acceptances or BA Equivalent Advances from
any Lender shall be suspended until the Agent determines, acting reasonably, that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and the Agent so notifies the
Borrower and the Lenders;
(iv)
any outstanding Borrowing Notice requesting an Accommodation by way of Bankers'
Acceptances shall be deemed to be a Borrowing Notice requesting a Prime Loan in the
amount specified in the original Borrowing Notice;
any outstanding Conversion Notice requesting a Conversion of a U.S. Base Rate Loan or
(v)Libor Loan into a Bankers' Acceptance shall be deemed to be a Conversion Notice requesting
a Conversion of such Loan into a Prime Loan; and
(vi)
any outstanding Rollover Notice requesting a Rollover of a Bankers' Acceptance shall be
deemed to be a Conversion Notice requesting a Conversion of such Bankers' Acceptances
into a Prime Loan.
The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any suspension of the
Borrower's right to request Bankers' Acceptances and of any termination of any such suspension.
A Lender BA Suspension Notice shall be effective upon receipt of the same by the Agent if
received prior to 2 p.m. (Toronto time) on a Business Day and if not, then on the next following
Business Day, except in connection with a Borrowing Notice, Conversion Notice or Rollover
Notice previously received by the Agent, in which case the applicable Lender BA Suspension
Notice shall only be effective with respect to such previously received Borrowing Notice,
Conversion Notice or Rollover Notice if received by the Agent prior to 2 p.m. (Toronto time) two
(2) Business Days prior to the proposed Drawdown Date, Conversion Date or Rollover Date (as
applicable) applicable to such previously received Borrowing Notice, Conversion Notice or
Rollover Notice, as applicable.
 
11.5Funding Indemnity
 
If, for any reason whatsoever and whether or not required or permitted pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement, the Borrower repays, prepays, converts or cancels a Libor Loan other than on
the last day of a Libor Interest Period applicable to such Libor Loan, or fails for any reason to
borrow, convert, rollover or otherwise act in accordance with a notice given hereunder pursuant
to Schedule B, Schedule C, Schedule D or Schedule E, the Borrower shall indemnify each
Lender for any loss or expense incurred by such Lender as a direct result thereof including,
without limitation, any loss of profit or expenses such Lender incurs by reason of the liquidation
or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to maintain the Libor Loan
or other Borrowing or any increased interest or other charges payable to lenders of funds
borrowed in order to maintain such Libor Loan or other Borrowing together with any other out-of-
pocket charges, costs or expenses incurred by such Lender relative thereto. If, for any reason
whatsoever and whether or not required or permitted pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement, the Agent or any Lender provides the Borrower with the anticipated discounted
proceeds of sale of a Bankers' Acceptance (less any fees payable to such Lender in respect
thereof) on any day prior to the receipt by the Agent or such Lender of such proceeds and the
Agent or such Lender does not receive such proceeds from the Person designated to purchase
such Bankers' Acceptance on the date such proceeds are payable hereunder, the Borrower shall
indemnify the Agent and each applicable Lender for any resulting loss, cost or expense incurred
by the Agent or such Lender by reason of or arising as a result of the non-receipt or delayed
receipt by the Agent or such Lender of such proceeds, including without limitation, any losses
which the Agent or such Lender may incur if it arranges for any further sale of such Bankers'
Acceptance in replacement thereof and any costs which the Agent or such Lender may incur in
connection with any action against the Person designated to purchase such Bankers'
Acceptance, together with any other out-of-pocket charges, costs or expenses incurred by the
Agent or such Lender relative thereto.  In each case, a certificate of such Lender (acting
reasonably and prepared in good faith) submitted by such Lender setting out the basis for the
determination of the amount necessary to indemnify such Lender shall be prima facie evidence
thereof.
95
 
11.6General and Environmental Indemnity
 
The Borrower hereby agrees to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and the Agent and their
respective officers, directors, employees, affiliates, agents, advisors and controlling persons
(each, an "Indemnitee") harmless from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever, including the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel, with respect to
the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement, the
other Loan Documents and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith,
including any of the foregoing relating to, arising out of, or in connection with:
 
(a)the use of proceeds of the Credit Facility;
(b)
any actual, alleged or threatened Release in respect of any assets or properties of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, whether now owned or hereafter acquired;
(c)
any remedial action required to be taken under any Environmental Laws by an Indemnitee in
respect of any Release or in respect of the environmental condition of any assets or properties
of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries;
(d)
any non-compliance by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor in title
under any Environmental Laws, in respect of actions of any Governmental Authority under any
Environmental Laws or in respect of the environmental condition of any assets or properties of
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; or
(e)
any Environmental Liability arising directly or indirectly from the provision by any Lender of
credit to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or the provision or granting of any Security
Interest to the Agent or any Lender or any realization of, against or upon any of the assets or
properties of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries;
(all the foregoing in this Section 11.6, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), provided that the
Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee with respect to Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities are found by a final and nonappealable
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of such Indemnitee or from a Release at, on, under or from assets or properties of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that occurs entirely following an Indemnitee's taking
possession of such assets or property by foreclosure, power of sale or similar transfer and that
did not exist on or at such asset or property prior to such Indemnitee's possession thereof. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, no
Indemnitee shall be liable for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages in
connection with its activities related to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any of the
transactions in connection herewith or therewith.  Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the Borrower agrees not to assert and to cause its Subsidiaries not
to assert, and hereby waives and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to waive, all rights for
contribution or any other rights of recovery with respect to all claims, demands, penalties, fines,
liabilities, settlements, damages, costs and expenses of whatever kind or nature, under or related
to Environmental Laws, that any of them might have by statute or otherwise against any
Indemnitee except in the case of gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitees.  The
agreements in this Section 11.6 shall survive repayment of the Credit Facility and all other
amounts payable hereunder.
96
 
11.7Replacement Lender
 
If:
 
(a)a Lender exercises its rights under Section 11.2, Section 11.3 or Section 11.4;
(b)
the Borrower is required under Section 7.3 to deduct any withholding Taxes in respect of
amounts owing to any Lender;
(c)
any Lender withholds its consent to any amendment, consent or determination requested by
the Borrower which requires the approval of the Lenders and as a consequence thereof such
amendment, consent or determination cannot be obtained;
(d)
a Fronting Lender has terminated its Fronted LC Commitment pursuant to Section 3.11(k)(ii)
(B); or
(e)a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender;
 
the Borrower may, treating each affected Lender rateably and in the same manner as other
Lenders subject to similar circumstances (all such Lenders being the "Affected Lenders"):
(i)
replace all Affected Lenders by reaching satisfactory arrangements with one or more existing
Lenders or new Lenders that are acceptable to the Agent and each Fronting Lender, each
acting reasonably, for the purchase of all of such Affected Lenders' Commitments as long as:
(A)
such purchasing Lender(s) unconditionally offers in writing (with copy to the Agent) to
purchase all of the rights and obligations of the Affected Lender(s) including all outstanding
Borrowings owed to such Affected Lender(s) for a purchase price equal to the aggregate
Borrowings owed to the Affected Lender(s) (payable in immediately available funds);
(B)
the obligations of the Borrower owing pursuant to Section 7.3 and Section 11.1 to the Affected
Lender(s) are paid in full to the Affected Lender(s) concurrently with such replacement; and
(C)
all requirements set forth in Section 13.1 with respect to such assignment are complied with,
including entering into of a Lender Transfer Agreement and the payment by the purchasing
Lender to the Agent (for the Agent's own account) of the assignment fee contemplated in
Section 13.1, unless waived by the Agent; or
97
(ii)
so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and without regard to
Section 4.4, irrevocably cancel all but not part of the Affected Lenders' Commitments if the
Borrower has prepaid or otherwise reduced (or will concurrently prepay or otherwise reduce)
all Borrowings outstanding to such Affected Lenders, and paid all accrued interest and other
charges and fees in respect of such Borrowings.
11.8Defaulting Lenders
(a)
Consequences:  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as
such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(i)
the standby fees payable pursuant to Section 5.10 shall cease to accrue on the unused portion
of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender;
(ii)
a Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether, and the Commitment and
the Lender's Proportion of the Obligations or Borrowings of such Defaulting Lender shall not
be included in determining whether, all Lenders or the Majority Lenders have taken or may
take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to
Section 12.12), provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of
all Lenders or each affected Lender that (A) materially and adversely affects such Defaulting
Lender differently than other affected Lenders, (B) increases the Commitment or extends the
Maturity Date of such Defaulting Lender, or (C) relates to the matters set forth in Sections
12.12(a)(i), (v) and (vii), shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender; and
(iii)
for the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall retain and reserve its other rights and remedies
respecting each Defaulting Lender.
(b)
Funding:  If the Agent has actual knowledge that a Lender is a Defaulting Lender at the time
that the Agent receives (i) a Borrowing Notice or (ii) a Conversion Notice that will result in a
currency conversion, then each other Lender shall fund its Lender's Proportion of such
affected Accommodation (and, in calculating such Lender's Proportion, the Agent shall ignore
the Commitments of each such Defaulting Lender); provided that, for certainty, no Lender shall
be obligated by this Section 11.8(b) to make or provide Accommodations in excess of its
Commitment.  If the Agent acquires actual knowledge that a Lender is a Defaulting Lender at
any time after the Agent receives (i) a Borrowing Notice or (ii) a Conversion Notice that will
result in a currency conversion, then the Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower that such
Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and such Lender shall be deemed to have consented to such
disclosure).  Each Defaulting Lender agrees to indemnify each other Lender for any amounts
paid by such Lender under this Section 11.8(b) and which would otherwise have been paid by
the Defaulting Lender if its Commitment had been included in determining the Lender's
Proportion of such affected Accommodations.
Fronting Lender Requirements:  Any Fronting Lender may require a Defaulting Lender to pay
(c)to the Agent for deposit into an escrow account maintained by and in the name of the Agent an
amount equal to such Defaulting Lenders' maximum contingent obligations hereunder to such
Fronting Lender.
98
(d)
Letters of Credit:  If any Letters of Credit are outstanding (with the Equivalent Amount in U.S.
Dollars of the undrawn amount of such Letters of Credit being referred to as the "Defaulting
Lender Exposure") at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then:
(i)
to the extent the Defaulting Lender has not provided cash collateral for its Defaulting Lender
Exposure pursuant to Section 11.8(c) above, such Defaulting Lender Exposure shall be
reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders for the purposes of Section 3.11(d) in
accordance with their respective Lender's Proportions (disregarding any Defaulting Lender's
Commitment) but only to the extent that the sum of (A) the aggregate Equivalent Amount in U.S.
Dollars of the Borrowings made by any non-Defaulting Lender and outstanding at such time,
plus (B) such non-Defaulting Lender's rateable share (after giving effect to the reallocation
contemplated herein) of the Defaulting Lender Exposure, does not exceed such non-Defaulting
Lender's Commitment; and
(ii)
if the reallocation described in Section 11.8(d)(i) above cannot, or can only partially, be
effected, the Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by any Fronting Lender
provide cash collateral in accordance with Section 3.11(l) for any portion for which the
reallocation could not be effected, and the provisions of such Section shall apply thereto as if a
demand has been made pursuant thereto by each Fronting Lender in respect of each
outstanding Letter of Credit.
(e)
Fronting Lender Exposure:  So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, a Fronting Lender
shall not be required to issue any Letters of Credit unless it is satisfied that the related
exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitment of non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance
with Section 11.8(d) and participating interests in any such newly issued Letter of Credit shall
be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 11.8(d)(i).
(f)
Ceasing to be Defaulting Lender:  If any Lender shall cease to be a Defaulting Lender, then,
upon becoming aware of the same, the Agent shall notify the other Lenders and (in accordance
with the written direction of the Agent) such Lender (which has ceased to be a Defaulting
Lender) shall purchase, and the other Lenders shall on a rateable basis sell and assign to such
Lender, portions of such Obligations equal in total to such Lender's Lender's Proportion thereof
without regard to Section 11.8(b).
ARTICLE 12
THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS
 
12.1Authorization of Agent
 
Each Secured Lender irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to exercise such powers,
perform such duties, take such actions, make such decisions and determinations and give such
consents under the Loan Documents as are required to be exercised, performed, taken, made,
given or otherwise carried out by the Agent hereunder or under any other agreement between the
Lenders (including, if applicable, other Secured Lenders), together with all powers reasonably
incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly required by this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents or by any other agreement between the Lenders (including, if applicable, other
Secured Lenders) to be carried out by the Agent, the Agent is not required to exercise any
discretion or take or to refrain from taking any action except upon the written instructions of the
Majority Lenders.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Agent shall not
be required to exercise any discretion or to take or to refrain from taking any action in any manner
which is contrary to the Loan Documents, to any other agreement between the Lenders
(including, if applicable, other Secured Lenders) or to Applicable Law.
99
 
12.2Responsibility of Agent
 
The Agent makes no representation or warranty and accepts no responsibility with respect to the
due execution, legality, validity, sufficiency, enforceability or priority of any of the Loan
Documents or any other Secured Document nor with respect to the due execution, legality,
validity, sufficiency, enforceability, accuracy or authenticity of any documents, papers, materials
or other information furnished by the Borrower (or any other Person, including the Agent or any
Loan Party) in connection with the Loan Documents or any other Secured Document, whether
provided before or after the date of this Agreement. The Agent shall incur no liability to the
Secured Lenders under or in respect of the Loan Documents or any other Secured Document
with respect to anything which it may do or refrain from doing in the reasonable exercise of its
judgment or which may seem to it to be necessary or desirable in the circumstances, except for
its gross negligence or wilful misconduct.  The Agent assumes no responsibility for the payment
of any of the Obligations or other Secured Obligations by any Loan Party.
 
12.3Acknowledgment of Secured Lenders
 
Each Secured Lender acknowledges to the Agent that it has been, and will continue to be, solely
responsible for making its own independent appraisal of and investigation into the financial
condition, creditworthiness, environmental soundness, affairs, status and nature of the Loan
Parties and accordingly each Secured Lender confirms to the Agent that it has not relied, and will
not hereafter rely on the Agent:
(a)
Information:  to check or inquire on its behalf into the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of
any information provided by any Loan Party or provided in connection with the Loan
Documents or any other Secured Document (whether or not such information has been or is
hereafter circulated to such Secured Lender by the Agent);
(b)
Performance:  to inquire as to the performance by any Loan Party of its obligations under the
Loan Documents or any other Secured Document; or
(c)
Credit Review:  to assess or keep under review on its behalf the financial condition,
creditworthiness, environmental soundness, affairs, status or nature of any Loan Party.
12.4Rights and Obligations of Each Secured Lender
 
The rights and obligations of each Secured Lender under this Agreement are several and no
Lender shall be obligated to make Borrowings available to the Borrower in excess of the amount
of such Lender's Commitment. The failure of a Secured Lender to perform its obligations under
this Agreement shall neither:
(a)
No Liability to Other Secured Lenders:  result in any other Secured Lender incurring any
liability whatsoever, provided however that a Lender shall remain liable at all times for the
performance of the obligations hereunder of its Affiliate that is a Secured Lender; nor
(b)
No Relief from Obligations:  relieve any Loan Party or any other Secured Lender from its
respective obligations under any Loan Document or other Secured Document.
100
 
Nothing contained herein or in any other Loan Document or Secured Document nor any action
taken pursuant hereto or thereto shall be deemed to constitute the Secured Lenders a
partnership, joint venture or any other similar entity.
 
Each of the Secured Lenders hereby acknowledge that, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, the remedies provided hereunder to the Secured Lenders are for their benefit collectively
and acting together and not severally, and further acknowledge that its rights hereunder are to be
exercised not severally but collectively by the Agent upon the decision of the Majority Lenders
regardless of whether an Acceleration Notice has been delivered or an Event of Default under
Sections 10.1(f) or 10.1(g) has occurred.  Notwithstanding any of the provisions contained herein
each of the Secured Lenders hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not be entitled to
individually take any action with respect to the Loan Documents including, without limitation,
taking (including in respect of its Commitment or any indebtedness or liability owed to it) any
action contemplated in Sections 10.2 and 10.5, but that any such action shall be taken only by
the Agent with the prior written agreement or instructions of the Majority Lenders; provided that
notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Agent, having been adequately indemnified against costs
and expenses of doing so by the Lenders, shall fail to carry out any such instructions of the
Majority Lenders, any Secured Lender may do so on behalf of all Secured Lenders and shall, in
so doing, be entitled to the benefit of all protection give the Agent hereunder or elsewhere.  If it
becomes illegal for any Lender to hold or benefit from the Security over the assets or shares of
the Borrower or a Material Subsidiary pursuant to any law of the United States of America, such
Lender shall notify the Agent and disclaim any benefit of such Security over the assets or shares
of such Borrower or Material Subsidiary to the extent of such illegality, but such illegality shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such Security or the Security Interest granted thereunder for
the benefit of each of the other Lenders.
 
12.5Notice to Secured Lenders
 
Unless otherwise specifically dealt with in this Agreement, in the event the Agent delivers a
written notice to a Secured Lender requesting advice from such Secured Lender as to whether it
consents or objects to any matter in connection with the Loan Documents, then, except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, if such Secured Lender does not deliver to the Agent its
written consent or objection to such matter:
(a)
where a time period is specified hereunder for the Agent or the Majority Lenders to provide any
response, notice or other communication prior to the end of such period; or
(b)
where no such time period is specified hereunder, then within fifteen (15) Business Days of
the delivery of such written notice by the Agent to such Secured Lender;
such Secured Lender shall be deemed not to have consented thereto.
 
12.6Notices between the Secured Lenders, the Agent and the Borrower
 
All notices by the Secured Lenders to the Agent shall be through the Agent's Branch of Account
and all notices by the Agent to a Secured Lender shall be through such Secured Lender's Branch
of Account.  All notices or communications between the Borrower and the Secured Lenders
which are required or contemplated pursuant to the Loan Documents shall be given or made
through the Agent at the Agent's Branch of Account.
101
 
12.7Agent's Duty to Deliver Documents Obtained from the Borrower
 
The Agent shall promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business Days, deliver to each Lender,
at its Branch of Account in hard copy or electronic form, such documents, papers, materials and
other information as are furnished by the Borrower to the Agent on behalf of such Lender
pursuant to this Agreement, and the Borrower shall provide the Agent with sufficient copies of all
such information for such purpose.
 
12.8Arrangements for Borrowings
 
The Agent shall promptly give written notice to each Lender at its Branch of Account upon receipt
by the Agent of any notice given pursuant to Article 3 or Section 4.3.  The Agent shall advise
each Lender of the amount, date and details of each Borrowing and of such Lender's share in
each Borrowing.  At or before 1 p.m. (Toronto time) on each Drawdown Date, Conversion Date or
Rollover Date:
(a)
Loans:  each Lender will make available to the Borrower its share of Borrowings by way of
Loans by forwarding to the Agent at the Agent's Account for Payments the amount of Loans
required to be made available by such Lender; and
(b)
Bankers' Acceptances:  each Lender will make available to the Borrower its share of
Borrowings by way of Bankers' Acceptances by forwarding to the Agent at the Agent's Account
for Payments:
if such Lender is to purchase its Bankers' Acceptances, the amount of the Discount Proceeds
(i)in respect of such Bankers' Acceptances (less the amount of applicable fees payable by the
Borrower to such Lender pursuant to Section 5.4); or
(ii)
if such Lender is not to purchase its Bankers' Acceptances, the discounted proceeds of sale of
such Bankers' Acceptances received by such Lender (less the amount of applicable fees
payable by the Borrower to such Lender pursuant to Section 5.4).
12.9Arrangements for Repayment of Borrowings
(a)
Prior to Demand or Acceleration:  Prior to the delivery of an Acceleration Notice or the
occurrence of an Event of Default specified in Section 10.1(f) or 10.1(g), upon receipt by the
Agent of payments from the Borrower on account of principal, interest, fees or any other
payment made to the Agent on behalf of the Lenders hereunder, the Agent shall pay over to
each Lender at its Branch of Account the amount to which it is entitled under this Agreement
and shall use its best efforts to make such payment to such Lender on the same Business Day
on which such payment is received by the Agent.  If the Agent does not remit any such
payment to a Lender on the same Business Day as such payment is received by the Agent,
the Agent shall pay interest thereon to such Lender until the date of payment at a rate
determined by the Agent (such rate to be conclusive and binding on such Lender) in
accordance with the Agent's usual banking practice in respect of deposits of amounts
comparable to the amount of such payment which are received by the Agent at a time similar
to the time at which such payment is received by the Agent.
(b)
Subsequent to Acceleration:  Following delivery of an Acceleration Notice or the occurrence of
an Event of Default specified in Section 10.1(f) or 10.1(g), the Secured Lenders shall share
any payments subsequently received in accordance with Section 10.7.
102
 
12.10Repayment by Lenders to Agent
(a)
Where the Borrower Fails to Pay:  Unless the Agent has been notified in writing by the
Borrower at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date on which any payment to be made by
such Borrower hereunder is due that such Borrower does not intend to remit such payment,
the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), in its discretion, assume that the Borrower has
remitted such payment when so due and the Agent may, in its discretion and in reliance upon
such assumption, make available to each Lender on such payment date an amount equal to
the amount of such payment which is due to such Lender pursuant to this Agreement.  If the
Borrower does not in fact remit such payment to the Agent, the Agent shall promptly notify
each Lender and each such Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Agent the amount
of such assumed payment made available to such Lender, together with interest thereon until
the date of repayment thereof at a rate determined by the Agent (such rate to be conclusive
and binding on such Lender) in accordance with the Agent's usual banking practice for similar
advances to financial institutions of like standing to such Lender.
Where a Lender Fails to Pay:  Unless the Agent has been notified in writing by a Lender at
(b)
least one (1) Business Day prior to a Drawdown Date, Conversion Date or Rollover Date that
such Lender does not intend to make available the amount required to be made available by
such Lender pursuant to this Agreement on such Drawdown Date, Conversion Date or
Rollover Date, the Agent may, in its discretion, assume that such Lender has remitted funds to
the Agent in an amount equal to the amount required to be made available by such Lender
pursuant to this Agreement and the Agent may, in its discretion and in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrower on such Drawdown Date, Conversion Date or
Rollover Date an amount equal to the amount required to be made available by such Lender
pursuant to this Agreement.  If a Lender does not in fact remit such funds to the Agent and, if
the Agent has provided funds to the Borrower on behalf of such Lender, the Agent shall
promptly notify such Lender and such Lender shall forthwith remit such funds to the Agent,
failing which the Borrower shall within two (2) Business Days repay to the Agent (without
prejudice to the Borrower' rights against such Lender) the amount made available by the
Agent on behalf of such Lender, in each case together with interest thereon until the date of
repayment thereof at a rate determined by the Agent (such rate to be conclusive and binding
on such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be) in accordance with the Agent's usual
banking practice for similar advances to financial institutions of like standing to such Lender.
12.11Adjustments Among Lenders
(a)
Adjustments to Outstanding Borrowings:  Each Lender agrees that, on and after the
Adjustment Time, it will at any time and from time to time upon the request of the Agent as
required by any other Lender purchase portions of the Borrowings and make any other
adjustments which may be necessary or appropriate, in order that amounts which remain
outstanding under this Agreement to each Lender are thereafter outstanding, as adjusted
pursuant to this Section 12.11, in the same proportion as the Lender's Proportion of the Total
Commitment.
(b)
Application of Payments:  The Secured Lenders agree that, on and after the Adjustment Time,
the amount of any repayment made by the Borrower under, and the amount of any proceeds
from the exercise of any rights or remedies of the Agent and the Secured Lenders under the
Loan Documents or any other Secured Document will, subject to Section 10.7, be applied in a
manner so that to the extent possible the amount of Secured Obligations of each Secured
Lender which remain outstanding after giving effect to such application will be in the same
proportion as its Lender's Proportion of the aggregate Secured Obligations of all Secured
Lenders.
103
Receipt of Payments other than Secured Obligations:  Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Section 12.11, there shall not be taken into account for the purposes of computing any
amount payable to a Secured Lender pursuant to this Section 12.11, any amount which such
Secured Lender receives as a result of any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through
the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of any monies owing by a Loan
Party to such Secured Lender other than on account of Secured Obligations; provided that, if at
any time a Secured Lender receives any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the
exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of monies owing or payable to it by a
(c)
Loan Party on account of Secured Obligations, such payments will be applied in accordance
with Section 10.7; and provided further that the provisions of this Section 12.11(c) shall not
apply to a Swap Lender which sets off amounts owing by a Loan Party to such Swap Lender
under a Lender Swap against amounts owing by such Swap Lender (including, for clarity, its
Affiliates) to a Loan Party under any Lender Swap entered into between such parties.
To the extent that a Secured Document is entered into by an Affiliate of a Lender, that Lender
shall cause such Affiliate to comply with the provisions of this Section 12.11, and such obligation
shall survive such Lender ceasing to be a Lender hereunder.
(d)
Further Assurances:  The Borrower agrees to be bound by and, at the request of the Agent, to
do all things necessary or appropriate to give effect to any and all purchases and other
adjustments made by and between the Secured Lenders pursuant to this Section 12.11 but
shall incur no increased indebtedness, in aggregate, by reason thereof.
12.12Lenders' Consents to Waivers, Amendments, etc.
(a)
Unanimous Consent of Lenders:  Any waiver of or any amendment to a provision of the Loan
Documents which relates to:
(i)
a change in the types of Borrowings or interest periods relating thereto, a decrease in the
Applicable Margin or the Standby Fee Rate, a change in pro rata Lender provisions relating to
advances or repayments of Borrowings, or a change in notice periods or the amount of any
payments payable by the Borrower to any Lender under this Agreement including any waiver of
the time of payment thereof;
(ii)an increase or decrease in the Commitment of any Lender other than as provided for herein;
 
(iii)a change in the definition of "Majority Lenders" or "Maturity Date";
(iv)
any matter which, pursuant to the Loan Documents, specifically requires the consent or
agreement of all of the Lenders, rather than the consent or agreement of "the Lenders" or the
"Majority Lenders" or the "Agent";
(v)the provisions of this Section 12.12;
 
(vi)an Event of Default under Section 10.1(a); or
(vii)
any release or material modification of the Loan Party Guarantee or the Security, except as
provided by Section 6.8, Section 6.9 or the applicable provisions of the Loan Party Guarantee
or the Security;
104
 
shall bind the Secured Lenders if such waiver or amendment is agreed to in writing by all of the
Lenders.
(b)
Majority Consent:  Subject to Section 12.12(a), Section 12.12(c) and Section 12.12(d) and
except as otherwise provided in the Loan Documents, any waiver, consent to or amendment to
any provision of the Loan Documents and any action, consent or other determination in
connection with the Loan Documents shall bind all of the Secured Lenders if such waiver,
amendment, action, consent or other determination is agreed to in writing by the Majority
Lenders.
(c)
Agent's Consent:  Any waiver, consent to or amendment to any provision of the Loan
Documents which relates to the rights or obligations of the Agent shall require the agreement
of the Agent thereto.
(d)
Fronting Lender's Consent:  Any waiver, consent to or amendment to any provision of the Loan
Documents which relates to the rights or obligations of a Fronting Lender shall require the
agreement of such Fronting Lender thereto.
12.13Reimbursement of Agent's Expenses or Lender's Costs
 
Each Secured Lender agrees that it will indemnify the Agent for its Lender's Proportion of any
and all costs, expenses and disbursements (including, without limitation, those costs and
expenses referred to in Section 11.1) which may be incurred or made by the Agent in good faith
in connection with the Loan Documents, and agrees that it will, on written demand detailing such
costs, expenses and disbursements, reimburse the Agent for any such costs, expenses or
disbursements for which the Agent is not promptly reimbursed at any time by the Borrower. The
Agent may refrain from exercising any right, power or discretion or taking any action to protect or
enforce the rights of any Secured Lender under the Loan Documents or any other Secured
Document until it has been so reimbursed.
 
12.14Reliance by Agent on Notices, etc.
 
The Agent shall be entitled:
(a)
Reliance on Written Documents:  to rely upon any writing, letter, written notice, certificate,
telex, facsimile copy, cable, statement, order or other document believed by the Agent to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons;
and
(b)
Reliance on Legal Advice:  with respect to legal matters, to act upon advice of legal advisors
selected by the Agent concerning all matters pertaining to the Loan Documents and any other
Secured Document and the Agent's duties thereunder;
and the Agent shall assume no responsibility and shall incur no liability to the Borrower or any
Secured Lender by reason of relying on any such document or acting on any such advice.
 
12.15Relations with Borrower
 
Except for the transactions provided for in this Agreement, each Secured Lender may deal with
the Borrower and any other Loan Party in all transactions and generally do any banking business
with or provide any financial services to the Borrower and any other Loan Party without having
any liability to account to the other Secured Lenders therefor.  Where any Secured Lender is the
Agent, with respect to its Commitment and Lender's Proportion, such Lender shall have the same
rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as
though it were not the Agent.
105
 
12.16Successor Agent
 
The Agent shall resign if at any time it is no longer a Lender hereunder by reason of an
assignment of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Loan Documents pursuant
to Section 13.1 and, in such event, it shall provide thirty (30) days prior written notice of any such
intended assignment to each of the Lenders and the Borrower.  The Agent may resign at any time
by giving thirty (30) days prior written notice thereof to each of the Lenders and the Borrower. 
Upon any such resignation, the remaining Lenders, or other Secured Lenders if there are then no
Lenders (the "Remaining Lenders"), shall have the right to appoint a successor agent, subject to
the approval of the Borrower, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.  Any successor
agent appointed under this Section 12.16 shall be a Lender which has offices in Calgary, Alberta
or Toronto, Ontario.  If no successor agent shall have been appointed by the Remaining Lenders
and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring agent's giving
of notice of resignation, then the retiring agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, or other Secured
Lenders if there are then no Lenders, appoint a successor agent, subject to the approval of the
Borrower, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.  Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Agent by a successor agent, such successor agent shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring agent as
Agent, and the retiring agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this
Agreement as Agent.  After any retiring agent's resignation or removal hereunder as the Agent,
the provisions of this Agreement shall continue in effect for its benefit and for the benefit of the
Lenders, or other Secured Lenders if there are then no Lenders, in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by the retiring agent while it was acting as the Agent.
 
12.17Indemnity of Agent
 
Each Secured Lender hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the
Borrower) as to its Lender's Proportion from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in any
way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or the other Secured Documents or any
action taken or omitted by the Agent under or in respect thereof; provided that the Secured
Lenders shall not be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agent's
gross negligence or wilful misconduct.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Secured Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its Lender's Proportion
of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in connection with
the preservation of any rights of the Agent or the Secured Lenders under, or the enforcement of,
or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, the Loan Documents and other
Secured Documents, but only to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by
the Borrower.
 
12.18Sharing of Information
 
The Borrower authorizes the Agent and each other Secured Lender to share among each other
and with any successor, assignee, or any potential assignee, any information possessed by it
regarding a Loan Party or the Loan Documents or the other Secured Documents.
106
 
12.19Amendment to this Article 12
 
Save and except for the provisions of Sections 12.16 and 12.17, the provisions of this Article 12
may be amended or added to, from time to time, without the agreement of the Borrower provided
such amendment or addition does not adversely affect the rights of the Borrower hereunder or
increase, in the aggregate, the liabilities of the Borrower hereunder.  A copy of the instrument
evidencing such amendment or addition shall be forwarded by the Agent to the Borrower as soon
as practicable following the execution thereof; provided that after an Event of Default a failure to
do so by the Agent shall not render it liable in damages to the Borrower.
 
12.20The Agent and Defaulting Lenders
(a)
Cash Collateral:  Each Defaulting Lender shall be required to provide to the Agent cash in an
amount, as shall be determined from time to time by the Agent in its discretion, equal to all
obligations of such Defaulting Lender to the Agent that are owing or may become owing
pursuant to this Agreement, including such Defaulting Lender's obligation to pay its Lender's
Proportion of any indemnification, reimbursement or expense reimbursement amounts not
paid by the Borrower. Such cash shall be held by the Agent in one or more cash collateral
accounts, which accounts shall be in the name of the Agent and shall not be required to be
interest bearing.  The Agent shall be entitled to apply the foregoing cash in accordance with
Section 12.17, in the case of amounts owing to the Agent.
(b)
Indemnity:  In addition to the indemnity and reimbursement obligations noted in Section 12.17,
the Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and
without limiting the obligations of the Borrower hereunder) rateably according to their
respective Lender's Proportion (and in calculating the Lender's Proportion of a Lender,
ignoring the Commitments of Defaulting Lenders) any amount that a Defaulting Lender fails to
pay the Agent and which is due and owing to the Agent pursuant to Section 12.17.  Each
Defaulting Lender agrees to indemnify each other Lender for any amounts paid by such
Lender and which would otherwise be payable by the Defaulting Lender.
Set Off:  The Agent shall be entitled to set off any Defaulting Lender's Proportion of all
payments received from the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender's obligations to make
payments and fund Accommodations required to be made by it and to purchase participations
required to be purchased by it in each case under this Agreement and the other Loan
(c)Documents.  To the extent permitted by law, the Agent shall be entitled to withhold and deposit
in one or more non-interest bearing cash collateral accounts in the name of the Agent all
amounts (whether principal, interest, fees or otherwise) received by the Agent and due to a
Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Agreement, for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting
Lender, which amounts shall be used by the Agent:
(i)
first, to reimburse the Agent for any amounts owing to it, in its capacity as Agent, by such
Defaulting Lender pursuant to any Loan Document;
(ii)
second, to repay on a pro rata basis the incremental portion of any Accommodations made by
a Lender pursuant to Section 11.8 in order to fund a shortfall created by a Defaulting Lender
and, upon receipt of such repayment, each such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned to
the Defaulting Lender such incremental portion of such Accommodations;
107
(iii)
third, to cash collateralize all other obligations of such Defaulting Lender to the Agent owing
pursuant to this Agreement in such amount as shall be determined from time to time by the
Agent in its discretion, including such Defaulting Lender's obligation to pay its Lender's
Proportion of any indemnification, reimbursement or expense reimbursement amounts not
paid by the Borrower; and
(iv)fourth, to fund from time to time the Defaulting Lender's Proportion of Secured Obligations.
(d)
No Liability:  For greater certainty and in addition to the foregoing, neither the Agent nor any of
its Affiliates nor any of their respective shareholders, officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives shall be liable to any Secured Lender (including a Defaulting Lender) for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it in connection with amounts payable by the Borrower
to a Defaulting Lender and received and deposited by the Agent in a cash collateral account
and applied in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, save and except for the
gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Agent as determined by a final non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
ARTICLE 13
SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, JUDGMENT CURRENCY AND CONFIDENTIAL 
INFORMATION
 
13.1Successors and Assigns
Assignments:  The Borrower may not assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of all of the Lenders.  If an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, a Lender may, at the Borrower's cost and expense, with the prior consent of the
Agent and each Fronting Lender (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld) and upon
payment to the Agent by the assigning Lender of U.S. $3,500 but without the Borrower's
consent, assign in whole or in part their rights and obligations under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents to any assignee.  If no Event of Default has occurred, a Lender may, at
(a)
its sole cost and expense, with the prior consent of the Agent, the Borrower and each Fronting
Lender (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and upon payment to the
Agent by the assigning Lender of U.S. $3,500, assign in whole or in part their rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to a lending institution
provided any increased cost arising solely as a result of the residency of such lending
institution will be an obligation of such Lender.  Assignments must be in a minimum amount of
U.S. $5,000,000 and in increments of U.S. $1,000,000 thereafter except in the case of an
assignment of a Lender's entire Commitment  and, if an assignment is not of a Lender's entire
Commitment, such Lender must thereafter retain for its own account a minimum Commitment
of U.S. $5,000,000.  Notwithstanding the foregoing and without the consent of the Borrower or
the Agent or the payment of the aforementioned U.S. $3,500, a Lender may, at any time,
assign all or any part of its Commitment to an affiliate of the Lender or to an Approved Fund
provided that any increased cost arising solely as a result of the residency of such affiliate or
Approved Fund will be an obligation of such Lender and provided that, in the case of an
assignment to an Approved Fund, the Lender remains responsible for, and is not released
from, any and all funding obligations hereunder of such Lender.  Upon any assignment by a
Lender to an assignee permitted by this Section 13.1(a) (a "Permitted Assignee") in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.1(a), such Lender shall cause such
Permitted Assignee to be substituted for such Lender in respect of the whole or any part of its
rights and obligations under the Loan Documents which are so assigned by the execution of a
Lender Transfer Agreement and such Lender shall, as of the effective date thereof but subject
to the provisions of the immediately prior sentence with respect to an assignment to an
Approved Fund, be released from their obligations to the Borrower hereunder arising
subsequent to such date to the extent thereof.  Any such assignment prior to the occurrence of
an Event of Default which is continuing shall not increase, in aggregate, the liabilities of the
Borrower hereunder including without limitation under Section 7.3.
108
(b)
Participations:  The Borrower agrees that a Lender may, with the prior consent of the Agent
and the Borrower (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), sell or agree to
sell a participation (a "Participation") to a third party (a "Participant") in all or any part of any
Borrowings made or Accommodations to be made by it; provided that upon the sale of any
such Participation, the Participant purchasing such Participation shall not have any rights
under any of the Loan Documents and the Borrower shall not have any obligations to such
Participant, and all amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be
determined pursuant to this Agreement solely as between such Lender and the Borrower as if
such Lender had not sold or agreed to sell such Participation and the assigning Lender and
such Participant shall be solely responsible for any increased cost arising as a result of the
residency of such Participant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing and without the consent of the
Borrower or the Agent, a Lender may, at any time, sell a participation in all or any part of any
Borrowings made or Accommodations to be made by it to an affiliate of the Lender; provided
any increased cost arising solely as a result of the residency of such affiliate will be an
obligation of such Lender.
Rights and Obligations of a Lender on a Participation:  Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the sale by a Lender of a Participation to a Participant shall not affect the Lender's
(c)
Proportion of such Lender nor otherwise alter the obligations of such Lender to the Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement and such Lender shall continue to perform fully all of their
obligations to the Borrower under this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, regardless of
any failure to perform by any Participant or any other term, condition or event relating to any
Participation.  Any Participant's rights against such Lender and obligations in favour of such
Lender in respect of such Participation shall be those set forth in any agreement executed by
such Lender in favour of any such Participant relating thereto.
13.2Judgment Currency
 
If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court in any jurisdiction with respect to this
Agreement it becomes necessary to convert into the currency of such jurisdiction (herein called
the "Judgment Currency") any amount due hereunder in any currency other than the Judgment
Currency, then such conversion shall be made at the rate of exchange prevailing on the
Business Day before the day on which judgment is given.  For such purpose, "rate of exchange"
means the spot rate at which the Agent, on the relevant date at or about noon (Toronto time),
would be prepared to sell a similar amount of such currency in Toronto, Ontario against the
Judgment Currency. In the event that there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing
between the Business Day before the day on which the judgment is given and the date of
payment of the amount due, the Borrower shall, on the date of payment, pay such additional
amounts (if any) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid on such date is the amount
in the Judgment Currency which when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of
payment is the amount then due under this Agreement in such other currency. Any additional
amount due from the Borrower under this Section 13.2 shall be due as a separate debt and shall
not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other sums due under or in respect of this
Agreement.
109
 
13.3Secured Lenders
 
If any Secured Lender (or its Affiliate, if such Secured Lender is not a Lender) for any reason
ceases to be a Lender, such Secured Lender shall continue to be bound by and entitled to the
benefit of the terms and conditions hereof in such capacity and entitled to the benefit of the Loan
Party Guarantee and the Security until such time as it receives payment of all Secured
Obligations owing to it by any Loan Party at the time it (or such Affiliate, if applicable) ceased to
be a Lender, with the exception of any indemnities of, or in favour of, such Secured Lender
hereunder existing at that time and which shall survive such termination, provided that for greater
certainty, it shall not be entitled to the benefit of this Agreement, the Loan Party Guarantee or the
Security in respect of any amounts advanced by it or transactions entered into after it ceased to
be a Lender.
 
13.4Exchange and Confidentiality of Information
 
Each of the Secured Lenders and the Agent acknowledge the confidential nature of the financial,
operational and other information, reports and data provided and to be provided to them by the
Loan Parties pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (the "Information") and
agrees to hold the Information in confidence and shall not discuss or disclose or allow access to,
or transfer or transmit the Information to any Person, provided however that:
(a)
each of the Secured Lenders and the Agent may disclose all or any part of the Information if, in
its reasonable opinion, such disclosure is required by any Applicable Law, to the extent of
such requirement, or is required in connection with any actual or threatened judicial,
administrative or governmental proceeding, including, without limitation, proceedings initiated
under or in respect of this Agreement, provided that in any such circumstance the Secured
Lenders and Agent, as soon as reasonably practicable and unless prohibited by Applicable
Law, shall advise the Borrower of their obligation to disclose such Information in order to
enable the Borrower, if it so chooses, to attempt to ensure that any such disclosure is made on
a confidential basis;
(b)
each of the Secured Lenders and the Agent may disclose all or any part of the Information to
any regulatory body to which it is subject, to the extent such disclosure is, in the reasonable
opinion of such Lender or Agent, required including without limitation to the Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions or similar body;
(c)
each of the Secured Lenders and the Agent may disclose Information to each other and to any
Permitted Assignees or participants or any actual or prospective counterparty to any
securitization, swap or derivative transaction relating to the Loan Parties and the Borrowings
and, in each case, to their respective counsel, agents, employees and advisors; provided that
in the case of a participant or any counterparty, the participant or counterparty, as applicable,
has provided the Agent or the applicable Lender, in the case of a participant, or the Borrower
and the Agent, in the case of a counterparty, with the written agreement referred to in
Section 13.4(d) and, in the case of any such counsel, agents, employees and advisors, the
Agent or the applicable Lender shall advise such Person of the confidential nature of the
Information;
(d)
each of the Lenders and the Agent may disclose and discuss the Information with credit
officers of any potential Permitted Assignees for the purposes of assignment pursuant to
Section 13.1 or any participant for the purposes of a participation or any actual or prospective
counterparty for the purposes of any securitization, swap or derivative transaction as described
in (c) above; provided that such potential Permitted Assignee or participant or counterparty
shall have, for the benefit of the Borrower, previously provided to the Agent or such Lender, in
the case of a participant, or the Borrower and the Agent, in the case of a counterparty, as the
case may be, its written agreement to hold the Information under the same obligations of
confidentiality as set forth in this Section 13.4 at all times prior to and, if applicable, after
becoming a Permitted Assignee or participant or counterparty;
110
each of the Secured Lenders and the Agent may disclose all or any part of the Information so

Agreement shall prevail to the extent of such conflict or inconsistency; provided, however, that for
the purposes of this Section 14.13 there shall not be considered to be a conflict or inconsistency
