<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The independent expert on minority issues, Ms. Gay McDougall, visited Guyana 
between 28 July and 1 August 2008. During her visit, she travelled to Georgetown and 
surrounding communities. She held consultations with the State President, ministers and other 
senior government representatives, NGOs, civil society groups, political parties, religious 
leaders, academics and others working in the field of minority issues and anti-discrimination. 
The independent expert visited communities, including Buxton, and talked to community 
members about their lives and issues.  
</p>
<p> In July 2003, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance highlighted that he found that every level 
of Guyanese society is permeated by a profound moral, emotional and political fatigue, arising 
out of the individual and collective impact of ethnic polarization.<b>1</b> In 2008, the independent 
expert witnessed a continuing societal malaise that shows evidence of having deepened and 
transformed in some instances into despair, anger and resistance. This is particularly evident 
among Afro-Guyanese individuals and communities that reported feeling excluded, 
discriminated against and criminalized.  
</p>
<p> Ethnically divided political and administrative structures and failed political processes 
have created deep frustrations and distrust in the institution of government. A climate of 
suspicion, rumour and conspiracy theory exists in Guyana which has been fuelled by 
exceptionally violent incidents in 2008. Two separate and conflicting narratives and perceptions 
of reality have emerged among Afro- and Indo-Guyanese, which threaten to undermine shared 
values and common goals that are essential to a united, prosperous Guyana.  
</p>
<p> The independent expert recognizes commendable steps on the part of the Government to 
date to address issues of ethnic tensions, criminal activities and economic underdevelopment. 
However, further effective action is required urgently to restore confidence in good governance 
and the rule of law among all communities, and prevent an inexorable slide into further 
polarization and possible violence. A new era of political will and strong, visionary leadership is 
required to realize change and reverse the economic and social stagnation that is evident in a 
divided Guyana.  
</p>
<p> Afro-Guyanese with whom the independent expert met described feeling excluded from 
having a full voice and stake in the national polity and equal enjoyment of rights in many fields 
of life including employment and economic participation. They reported stigmatization of young 
Afro-Guyanese males and entire African communities. Derogatory stereotypes of criminality 
colour wider societal perceptions of Afro-Guyanese individuals and communities.  
</p>
<p> Particular challenges affect women from minority communities, including a scarcity of 
employment opportunities for women from Afro-Guyanese communities, the extremely heavy 
burden of care shouldered by single mothers, and a disturbing culture of domestic violence, often 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>fuelled by poverty and unemployment in their communities. Women feel that domestic violence 
cases are not treated seriously by the criminal justice system. Additionally, women&#8217;s 
participation in political processes remains well below levels of equality. 
</p>
<p> Current anti-discrimination legislation and policies are insufficient to address 
discrimination, exclusion and ethnically based bias. A new and robust anti-discrimination and 
equality plan of action is required to be applied across all sectors of society to break down the 
barriers that have become ingrained in Guyana. 
</p>
<p> A bitter and destructive political environment has infected the wider society and is failing 
the people of Guyana. It must give way to a climate of truth, reconciliation and compromise. 
Reforms must be far-reaching and highly consultative. However, consultation and process must 
be time-bound and action-oriented, and must lead to concrete, achievable outputs that ensure 
non-discrimination and equality. 
</p>
<p> Promises must be delivered upon, including the urgent creation of five credible human 
rights commissions, to deliver change to the lives of individuals, families and communities and 
put in place new foundations upon which to build. An open and constructive dialogue on 
inclusive governance remains an essential component of this process. The Government of 
Guyana is urged to take the lead in initiating such a dialogue, however, political will must be 
demonstrated by all parties. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The independent expert on minority issues visited Guyana between 28 July 
and 1 August 2008, inter alia to promote implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of 
Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. She conducted 
extensive consultations with senior government representatives, including the State President, 
numerous ministers responsible for issues related to her mandate, and other senior public 
officials. She consulted civil society organizations, political parties, religious leaders, academics, 
and media representatives. The independent expert visited Georgetown and its environs, where 
she consulted community members, and held open forums in order to gain their views and hear 
their issues. She held a forum for women in order to allow them to speak about their lives and 
raise issues important to women. 
</p>
<p>2. The independent expert thanks the Government of Guyana for its cooperation throughout 
the preparation and conduct of her mission. She thanks the numerous non-governmental 
organizations and civil society groups that met with her, provided valuable information, and 
facilitated additional aspects of her visit. 
</p>
<p>3. The independent expert&#8217;s evaluation of minority issues in Guyana is based on the 1992 
Declaration on Minorities and other relevant international standards, from which she has 
identified four broad areas of concern relating to minorities globally. These are: (a) the 
protection of a minority&#8217;s survival, through combating violence against them and preventing 
genocide; (b) the protection and promotion of the cultural identity of minority groups and the 
right of national, ethnic, religious or linguistic groups to enjoy their collective identity and to 
reject forced assimilation; (c) the guarantee of the rights to non-discrimination and equality, 
including ending structural or systemic discrimination and the promotion of affirmative action 
when required; and (d) the guarantee of the right to effective participation of members of 
minorities in public life, especially with regard to decisions that affect them.  
</p>
<p>4. According to the 2002 census, Guyana has a population of 751,000 in 182,615 households. 
Indo-Guyanese make up 43.5 per cent of the population and Afro-Guyanese 30.2 per cent. 
Some 16.7 per cent of the population identify as being of mixed race. There are nine indigenous 
peoples in Guyana (known as Amerindians in Guyanese legislation since the 1950s),<b>2</b> and 
approximately 130 indigenous communities occupying the forests and savannahs of the interior, 
constituting 9.2 per cent of the population. Whites, Chinese, Portuguese and others make up 
slightly under 0.5 per cent of the population. Georgetown with a population of 134,231 
represents 17.7 per cent of the entire population, and Region 4 within which it is located 
represents one quarter of the population. The Government officially promotes the multicultural 
nature of the country and national unity - hence the slogan &#8220;Guyana, land of six peoples&#8221; and the 
country&#8217;s motto &#8220;One People, One Nation, One Destiny&#8221;. A relatively large proportion of the 
adult population, including large numbers of the skilled workforce, emigrates every year, 
primarily to the United States, Canada, Britain and the Caribbean.

</p>
<p>5. The Co-operative Republic of Guyana is a multi-party democracy. President 
Bharat Jagdeo, representing the People&#8217;s Progressive Party Civic (PPP/C), has served as 
President since 1999 and was re-elected to a second full five year term in August 2006. This 
election was considered generally free and fair by international observers. The PPP/C has been 
the majority party in Parliament since 1992. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President, as 
is the Cabinet. Guyana has a unicameral 65-member National Assembly, of which 40 members 
are elected directly by proportional representation (PR) at the national level. The other 25 
members are elected by proportional representation at the regional level. 
</p>
<p>6. Guyana is a party to six of the seven major international human rights instruments 
(Convention against Torture, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and Convention on the Rights of the Child). It has signed 
but not ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families. Guyana has ratified the first Optional Protocol to 
ICCPR (accession). Guyana is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Organization of 
American States (OAS) and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). 
</p>
<p>7. In Guyana, the independent expert focused her attention on the relations between, and 
comparative situations of Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese. The Government encouraged the 
independent expert to also consider issues facing indigenous peoples which would highlight 
recently instituted good practices by the Government. She noted the important efforts made by 
the Government to improve the situation of indigenous communities in regard to health care and 
education. Since matters relating to indigenous peoples fall within the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples, 
they will not be covered in this report. 
</p>
<p>8. The following sections review the relevant history of Guyana and then consider in greater 
detail the four principal areas of concern of the independent expert in relation to her mandate. 
Each section begins with a summary of issues raised by civil society actors and community 
members and then concludes with the responses and views expressed by senior governmental 
sources on that topic. The report concludes with the analysis and recommendations of the 
independent expert. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  HISTORICAL CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p>9. An appreciation of Guyana&#8217;s history is essential to understand fully the modern country 
and the relative economic, social and political status of its inhabitants. However, consistent with 
the ethnic divisions and rivalries which are a feature of Guyanese society, ethnic groups perceive 
its history and historical events differently and may have distinct readings and interpretations of 
them. Space does not allow for a sufficiently comprehensive analysis here. However, the 
following historical overview is based upon historical accounts, including those available on the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.2 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>Government of Guyana website,<b>3</b> and the websites of the People&#8217;s Progressive Party (PPP)<b>4</b> and 
People&#8217;s National Congress (PNC)<b>5</b> political parties. It is also consistent with personal interviews 
conducted by the independent expert. 
</p>
<p>10. Colonization, first by the Dutch (1598-1803) and then by the British (1803-1966), has had 
a profound influence on modern-day Guyana. Plantation farming of sugar, coffee and cotton was 
established during the early colonial period and developed into the mainstay of the Guyanese 
economy. The labour-intensive plantation economy was initially fed by the slave trade, which 
began in 1640 and introduced a sizeable African population in excess of 80,000 by the time 
slavery was finally abolished in 1838. &#8220;Freed&#8221; slaves had to endure an &#8220;apprenticeship&#8221; period 
prior to their full emancipation and received no compensation for their years of servitude. When 
this period ended they began to demand higher wages and better working conditions, demands 
which were generally not met. Former slaves began to leave the plantations, often pooling their 
capital to purchase abandoned cotton plantations, and establish villages and small holdings. By 
1852, Africans had established 25 villages on lands that they purchased.<b>6</b> The subsequent need 
for new labour sources by expanding plantations led to the shipment of initially Portuguese 
labourers and subsequently thousands of &#8220;indentured&#8221; Indian labourers, often working under 
slave-like conditions, during the period from 1835 until 1917<b>7</b> when the practice ceased. Labour 
migration later included significant numbers of West Africans and Chinese. Interviews reveal 
that the influx of low-paid workers created early tensions between emancipated African 
communities and indentured communities blamed for reduced employment opportunities for 
Africans, artificially low plantation wages and increased taxes to fund new shipments of 
workers. 
</p>
<p>11. The colonial era thus radically altered the demographic characteristics of pre-independence 
British Guyana. By structuring society along ethnic lines and employing &#8220;divide and rule&#8221; 
policies between Indians and Africans the colonialists sowed the seeds of future ethnic division. 
Indo-Guyanese sources noted that Indian indentured labourers largely remained in rural areas 
and closely tied to the estates and plantation economy even after their indenture period had 
ended. While some Africans remained on sugar estates and in rural areas, many moved to towns 
where they became the majority of the urban working class. They took on roles as unskilled and 
semi-skilled workers, teachers, low-level public administrators and in the police service and 
military, professions in which they remain disproportionately represented today. With the

<p><b>7
</b>  It is estimated that approximately 239,000 Indian indentured labourers were transported to 
</p>
<p>British Guyana between 1838 and 1917. </p>

</p>
<p>discovery of gold and bauxite, Africans also moved into the growing prospecting and mining 
sectors in Guyana&#8217;s interior, establishing new towns of predominantly African population such 
as Linden. 
</p>
<p>12. Indian communities grew quickly and accumulated substantial &#8220;primitive&#8221; capital, which 
they used to educate their children in Guyana and abroad, and to acquire land. A new, educated 
and politically active Indian generation emerged, increasingly in urban areas that had previously 
been predominantly Afro-Guyanese. Indian capital was also used to buy and establish small 
businesses and property, while many educated Indo-Guyanese also began to practise law. 
Approaching the end of the colonial era, Guyana was a multi-ethnic society, albeit one already 
demonstrating ethnic fault lines based on the divisions of the past and developing inequalities. 
</p>
<p>13. Opposition to British colonial rule, however, gave them reason to unite politically. Leaders 
from both Indian and African ethnic groups, including Forbes Burnham and Dr. Cheddi Jagan, 
aligned to create the People&#8217;s Progressive Party (PPP) in January 1950. In 1953, under the 
leadership of Cheddi Jagan, the PPP claimed power in the first general elections under universal 
adult suffrage permitted by the colonial British government. However, according to numerous 
commentators, in the cold war climate Jagan&#8217;s Marxist/Leninist views caused suspicion in 
Britain and Washington.<b>8</b> Five months after it was elected, the British suspended the constitution 
of Guyana, and deposed the PPP government, enforcing the move with British troops and 
appointing an interim government.  
</p>
<p>14. The PPP was denied the opportunity to function as a government of national unity 
representing working class, urban and rural, Indo- and Afro-Guyanese communities. Influenced 
and manipulated by internal and external forces and colonial interests, the PPP split along ethnic 
lines with respective sides each appealing directly to their ethnic support base. Burnham founded 
what eventually became the People&#8217;s National Congress (PNC). Indo- and Afro-Guyanese now 
became deeply politically divided as the struggle for political power became ever more salient 
with the prospect of independence. In 1957, the Guyanese Constitution was partially restored. 
Both pre-independence elections in 1957 and 1961 were won by the PPP under Dr. Jagan. 
</p>
<p>15. The early 1960s saw a period of unprecedented social unrest and rioting and the increasing 
entrenchment of political and ethnic polarization. Amid external manipulation by the 
United States and Britain, including accusations of CIA activities against the PPP government, 
in 1963 an 80-day general strike was instigated by the predominantly Afro-Guyanese Trades 
Union Congress and the PNC. The PPP and PNC largely blame each other for the violence of the 
time, the PPP noting coordinated agitation and attacks against its supporters, and the PNC 
describing a PPP sponsored &#8220;terror campaign&#8221;. Several hundred people are thought to have died 
during this period of social unrest, one of the darkest periods of modern Guyanese history, in 
which much of Georgetown&#8217;s commercial district was burned. The current Government notes 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  The PPP&#8217;s legislative programme included repeal of the Undesirable Publications Ordinance 
</p>
<p>and passage of a Labour Relations Bill, both seen by the British as part of a wider communist 
agenda. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.2

</p>
<p>that it is a result of this violence that thousands of people were forced to abandon their homes 
and possessions and migrated internally, leaving what were ethnically mixed villages, and 
migrated to those with the majority of their own racial group. 
</p><p>16. In 1964, despite PPP claims of electoral fraud, the PNC under Forbes Burnham joined 
forces with the Portuguese-led United Force to form a coalition government. Guyana achieved 
independence on 26 May 1966, and became the Co-operative Republic of Guyana 
on 23 February 1970. The PNC held power until 1992, amid allegations of vote rigging. 
Forbes Burnham died in 1985, enabling the accession of Desmond Hoyte to the office of 
President. International pressure for the re-establishment of free and fair elections increased. In 
October 1992, in an internationally monitored election again marred by violence, the PPP-Civic 
alliance was returned to government, with Dr. Jagan as president once again, reversing the long 
political domination of the Afro-Guyanese PNC party. The PPP-Civic has retained power to the 
present day despite counter-accusations by the PNC of rigging of elections and subsequent 
political protests and boycotts. The 2006 election was documented by independent monitors to 
have been the most peaceful in decades and State and non-State actors were acknowledged for 
their contribution to its success. 
</p>
<p>17. The present Government asserts that Guyana emerged from a 28-year dictatorship by the 
PNC which carried out institutionalized discrimination on the basis of ethnicity and political 
affiliation. It claims that the PNC government discriminated against all other races, but 
especially Indo-Guyanese, and all supporters of the then opposition parties. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  POLITICAL PARTICIPATION OF MINORITIES 
</b></p>
<p>18. According to the vast majority of those consulted by the independent expert, political 
polarization and ethnically based political parties in Guyana are corrosive forces in Guyanese 
society. Criticism of Guyana&#8217;s electoral system and calls for the establishment of a 
constitutionally based shared government were widely expressed. Since Guyana&#8217;s political 
parties are highly ethnicized, the current proportional representation system inevitably creates 
government dominated by one ethnic group. Most within the Afro-Guyanese community 
(around 30.2 per cent) felt that the numerical advantage of the Indo-Guyanese, which 
represent 43.5 per cent of the population with a favourable demographic trend for the near future, 
effectively excludes the largely Afro-Guyanese PNC from regaining government through the 
ballot box. 
</p>
<p>19. Additionally, women in all parties are grossly underrepresented. Notwithstanding 
constitutional provisions and legislation setting quotas for the number of women on electoral 
lists<b>9</b> women&#8217;s participation in political processes remains generally well below acceptable levels 
despite notable senior government appointments of women. 
</p>
<p>20. Several commentators noted that they have made consistent calls for consideration of 
shared governance arrangements as an essential component of a more representative government 
and as an important conflict prevention measure. However, they consider that little progress has 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  There is a requirement for 30 per cent of those on electoral lists to be women. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/11/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>been made in this respect and government claims that the Cabinet is multi-ethnic are countered 
with charges of tokenism in the appointment of Afro- and Indigenous members who lack a 
political base of support or respect within their own ethnic communities. </p>
<p>21. Five parliamentary commissions with responsibilities in the field of human rights and 
equality have been authorized in the revised Constitution of Guyana. All communities and 
political parties agree that the establishment of all five commissions is an essential step towards 
rebuilding trust among communities. 
</p>
<p>22. However, to date, only the Ethnic Relations Commission is functioning.<b>10</b> The Indigenous 
Peoples&#8217; Commission, the Women&#8217;s and Gender Equality Commission, the Human Rights 
Commission, and the Rights of the Child Commission have not yet been created. The National 
Stakeholder Forum convened by President Jagdeo in February and March 2008 identified the 
creation of these commissions as a priority for implementation by Parliament by 28 May 2008. 
</p>
<p>23. A number of reasons have been cited by government and opposition sources as a reason for 
these delays, including failure to agree on the appointment of membership and charges of bad 
faith or lack of political will by each party against the other. The Government notes that 
constitutional and parliamentary provisions, agreed to by all the parliamentary political parties in 
the 1999-2003 period, require a two-thirds majority to appoint members to the human rights 
commissions. The constitutionally provided Parliamentary Standing Committee of Appointments 
of Members to Commissions failed to receive the two-thirds majority in 2005 (8th Parliament) to 
establish the Women and Gender Equality Commission and in 2007 (9th Parliament) to establish 
the Ethnic Relations Commission because the PNC withdrew its votes, despite unanimity in the 
Committee. Civil society commentators, while strongly encouraging the creation of the 
commissions, have noted a number of problems in their design, strategy, and principle. 
</p>
<p>24. Each of Guyana&#8217;s 10 administrative regions is administered by a Regional Democratic 
Council (RDC) headed by a Chairman.<b>11</b> Opposition groups emphasized that although all regions 
theoretically maintain a degree of autonomy and some are under the control of opposition 
parties, decisions cannot be made without the authorization of the Minister for the Regions who 
is appointed by the Government. Accusations of discrimination arise when ministerial decisions, 
particularly regarding resource allocations, are favourable toward regions with ethnic 
characteristics that match that of the PPP. 
</p>
<p>25. The Government rejects descriptions of Guyana as &#8220;ethnically polarized&#8221;, and states that 
this flies in the face of observable and documented occasions such as Guyana&#8217;s hosting of the 
ICC WI World Cup Cricket in 2007 and the Caribbean Festival of Arts in 2008. It asserts that 
from the first free and fair elections in 1992, the Guyana Government has been striving, despite 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  However, at the time of the independent expert&#8217;s visit, there were issues about whether the 
</p>
<p>Ethnic Relations Commission was constituted and functioning in compliance with the 
Constitution. 
<b>11
</b></p>
<p>  In addition there are Neighbourhood Democratic Councils (NDC) within each region. These 
operate at the local or village council level. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.2

</p>
<p>politically motivated violence, to build trust and confidence. One of the approaches has been to 
create various bilateral forums for dialogue between the two major parties which has been a 
hallmark of the political environment since 1998 to the present at different levels. The 
Government highlights that it signed the Herdsmarsten Accord (1998) and CARICOM St. Lucia 
Accord (1999), effectively giving up two years of government in order to restore peace and 
normalcy and return the opposition to the discussion table and Parliament. 
</p>
<p>26. The Government notes that Guyana has a decentralized system which gives powers and 
some administrative autonomy to the 10 regions. It notes progress in regard to ensuring 
participation of all communities and highlights the multi-ethnic character of the Cabinet, which 
includes an Afro-Guyanese Prime Minister and Cabinet Secretary, three Amerindian ministers 
and six female ministers. The Government states that from 1992 it has held democratically 
recognized and elections accredited by international observer missions, which have resulted in 
ethnic, gender, geographic and political representation in the 10 regional administrations, 
the 65 neighbourhood councils, the 6 municipal councils. The 100 Amerindian councils and the 
National Toshaos Council are also elected under the new Amerindian Act and have been 
democratically run. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  NON-DISCRIMINATION AND EQUALITY 
</b>27. Guyana has constitutional and legislative provisions in place relating to anti-racism and 
non-discrimination. Article 149 of the Constitution of Guyana establishes that: (a) no law shall 
make any provision that is discriminatory either of itself or in its effect; and (b) no person shall 
be treated in a discriminatory manner by any person acting by virtue of any written law or in the 
performance of the functions of any public office or any public authority. The Constitution 
specifically prohibits discrimination based on race, place of origin, political openness, or colour. 
</p>
<p>28. The Prevention of Discrimination Act (1997) prohibits discrimination in employment, 
recruitment, training and membership of professional bodies and promotes equal remuneration 
for men and women in employment. It also applies to the provision of goods and services. The 
Act establishes the grounds for discrimination, and is applicable to both the public and private 
sector. It bans discrimination on the grounds of &#8220;any characteristic which appertains generally or 
is in general imputed to persons of a particular race, sex, religion colour, ethnic origin, 
indigenous population, national extraction, social origin, political opinion ...&#8221;. Employers may 
introduce affirmative action or special measures of a temporary nature to promote equality of 
opportunity in employment. The Racial Hostility Act prohibits acts which promote hostility or 
ill-will based on race. 
</p>
<p>29. The rights provisions of the Constitution and the legislative framework are enforced 
through the courts, and article 153 empowers the High Court to grant redress of proven 
allegations of rights denials. The Constitution also establishes an ombudsman office to 
investigate complaints of discrimination made by individuals. Article 212 of the revised </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/11/Add.2 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>Constitution also establishes five human rights commissions:<b>12</b> the Human Rights Commission, 
Women and Gender Commission, Rights of the Child Commission, Indigenous Peoples 
Commission and the Ethnic Relations Commission. At the time of the visit of the independent 
expert, only the Ethnic Relations Commission had been fully established and was functioning. 
</p>
<p>30. The independent expert met with senior representatives of the Ethnic Relations 
Commission of Guyana. Under the law, it is to be comprised of seven representatives of religious 
bodies, labour movement, private business sector, youth and women&#8217;s groups, nominated from 
civil society organizations by a parliamentary consensual mechanism agreed to by the political 
parties in 2003.<b>13</b> However, at the time of the independent expert&#8217;s visit, there were issues about 
whether the Ethnic Relations Commission was constituted and functioning in compliance with 
the Constitution. Article 212 (D) of the Constitution of Guyana provides the functions of the 
Ethnic Relations Commission.<b>14</b> The Commission is required, inter alia, to promote elimination 
of racial discrimination and equality of opportunity; promote good relations between people of 
different racial backgrounds; and monitor the way the race relations law is functioning and make 
recommendations for its improvements. 
</p>
<p>31. The Commission can provide legal advice and assistance to people who think they have 
been the victims of discrimination and can rule on whether or not discrimination has occurred. It 
can investigate companies and organizations where there is evidence of possible discrimination 
and encourage them to make changes to their policies and practices. It has primarily functioned 
by holding public hearings and issuing reports. 
</p>
<p>32. The Government notes that the Ethnic Relations Commission has submitted numerous 
special and annual reports to the National Assembly from its establishment in 2003 to date. It 
also draws attention to numerous peace meetings held by the Commission, with support from the 
UNDP Social Cohesion Programme. Additionally, there have been a series of cross-country 
multi-stakeholder forums over a six-week period prior to the 2006 elections. The Ethnic 
Relations Commission held a special series of public consultations on the perceived needs of the 
Afro-Guyanese community from 13 to 16 November 2007. The Government notes that, while 
documenting a number of criticisms and weaknesses, no significant issues of discrimination 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  The Human Rights Commissions: &#8220;&#8230; shall promote the observance and respect for, and 
</p>
<p>protect and investigate violations of the rights recognized in this Constitution and any other law 
relating to equality of opportunity and treatment.&#8221; The National Assembly passed the Rights 
Commissions Tribunals Act (Act No. 9 of 2004) for the establishment of a corresponding 
quasi-judicial Tribunal for each of these Rights Commissions to which appeals may be made. 
<b>13
</b></p>
<p>  Whilst they are not selected by civil society based on ethnicity, at present there are three 
Afro-Guyanese, one person of mixed race, one Portuguese and one Indo-Guyanese.

</p>
<p>emerged from such processes.<b>15</b> It notes that the Ethnic Relations Commission has investigated 
claims of discrimination but that none have been substantiated. The Department of Labour also 
has the authority to investigate such claims and to take corrective actions. There have been no 
such cases reported in the last five years. 
</p>
<p>33. The Government emphasizes that the constitutional reform process of 1999 to 2003 
engaged thousands of people in cross-country consultations, led by the multiparty parliamentary 
Constitutional Reform Commission. Guyana prides itself on the process and the comprehensive 
nature of the constitutional reform as being the most distinct in the Caribbean region. Of note is 
that the human rights section of the Constitution is entrenched and any person can go to the 
courts on a constitutional motion on any perceived or real violation of their human rights. 
</p>
<p>34. However, the independent expert encountered claims of widespread and institutionalized 
discrimination against members of the Afro-Guyanese community and indigenous peoples. Some 
described the &#8220;victimization&#8221; of poor Afro-Guyanese and an informal system of rights and 
privileges in society to which they lack access. Others believe that long-term and deeply 
entrenched exclusion has resulted in the significant degeneration of sectors of Afro-Guyanese 
communities. The manifestations of that exclusion are increasing poverty and the attendant 
social problems such acts as robberies, assaults and killings, domestic violence, rape and 
substance abuse. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Employment and economic activity 
</b></p>
<p>35. Discrimination in employment and economic activities are considered to be endemic 
problems by numerous Afro-Guyanese who spoke with the independent expert. Public sector 
employment has historically been predominantly Afro-Guyanese while the private sector is 
owned by and employs a significantly higher proportion of Indo-Guyanese. Economic reforms 
since the late 1980s resulted in the privatization of previously public-sector industries, reducing 
the public-sector workforce,<b>16</b> with a disproportionate impact on Afro-Guyanese jobs. Wages in 
the public sector are low in comparison to the private sector. Interviews reflected a perception 
that more Indo-Guyanese have been recruited or appointed to senior and influential positions in 
the public sector, police and military than Africans, fueling perceptions among Afro-Guyanese 
of Indo-Guyanese control of national public institutions. 
</p>
<p>36. There is a widely held belief among Afro-Guyanese that a &#8220;criminal economy&#8221; exists that 
is manifested in corrupt practices, unregulated activities and collusion with criminal elements. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>15
</b>  The Government has attached a list of ERC reports which are publicly available and which 
</p>
<p>also posted on the Ethnic Relations Commission website; http://www.ethnicrelations.org.gy;

<b>16
</b></p>
<p>  The Economist Country Profile for Guyana in 2007 notes that the number of employees in 
central government and the State-run enterprises fell from over 55,000 in 1993 to around 35,000 
by 1999 and continues to decline. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/11/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>Many consider that economic policies have been formulated to benefit the Indian population at 
the expense of Afro-Guyanese jobs and income. Union representatives noted a trend of State 
support for Indian-dominated industries such as the sugar industry, while allowing the 
predominantly Afro-Guyanese bauxite mining industry to decline and be privatized resulting in 
the loss of thousands of Afro-Guyanese jobs. One union representative described a &#8220;policy to 
economically destroy the African people&#8221;. Another commentator stated: &#8220;Now all the public 
entities are being privatized, such as banks. They are going to PPP people and supporters with 
&#8216;sweetheart deals&#8217;. Previously they were owned by the people. By and large they don&#8217;t employ 
Afro-Guyanese now.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>37. Afro-Guyanese expressed frustration at being unable to obtain employment in Indian 
owned or managed firms due to their African names, their colour, or their addresses in 
Afro-Guyanese villages. Those with Indian surnames might be invited for interview but rejected 
when they are seen to be African or of mixed heritage. Discrimination is said to be manifested in 
negative stereotyping of Afro-Guyanese as lazy, dishonest, dirty or criminal. Afro-Guyanese 
experience difficulty accessing bank loans and credit, due to perceptions that they do not repay 
loans. Without access to credit they are unable to establish small businesses. 
</p>
<p>38. The scarcity of employment opportunities for women, particularly from Afro-Guyanese 
and indigenous communities, is a major concern. Women, both young and older, are being 
forced by poverty into crime, drug use, trafficking, and prostitution. Afro-Guyanese women 
spoke of the failure of many men within their community to fulfil family responsibilities. High 
numbers of single mothers subsequently face an extremely heavy burden of care. Child neglect is 
a problem within Afro-Guyanese communities. 
</p>
<p>39. Serious allegations were raised of discrimination and corruption in government 
procurement of goods, services and public works contracts. There is a widely held belief that 
government contracts are systematically awarded to companies supporting the Government, 
Indo-Guyanese companies, and those in which government officials have personal interests.<b>17</b> In 
lieu of a functioning and independent public procurement commission, the tender process is the 
sole responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. Sources indicated to the independent expert that it 
lacks adequate regulation, accountability and transparency, leaving it open to substantial abuse. 
</p>
<p>40. A Public Procurement Bill was passed in 2003 establishing a National Procurement and 
Tender Administration Board and with a view to creating a public procurement commission, as 
provided in the Constitution. This commission should monitor public procurements and 
procedures to ensure that the procurement of goods and services and the execution of works 
(projects) are fair, transparent, competitive and cost-effective. A stakeholder process initiated by 
the President on 12 March 2008 had additionally agreed that the delayed commission should be 
expedited within 90 days. To date, no progress has been made resulting in allegations by 
opposition that the Government is actively delaying the process. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>17
</b>  Transparency International&#8217;s 2008 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranked Guyana 126 
</p>
<p>out of 180 countries surveyed, assigning the country a score of 2.6 (with 10 being least corrupt 
and 1 being most corrupt). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.2 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>41. Representatives of the Indian community, the Government and PPP party acknowledge 
that disparities exist between Indian and Afro-Guyanese. However, they reject allegations of 
discrimination, stating that causes of inequality lie in socio-economic, cultural and historical 
factors. A history of entrepreneurship within the Indo-Guyanese community and via the 
exploitation of Indian capital, labour and skills, reflects not discrimination, but relative success. 
Divisive allegations of discrimination and exclusion are sometimes politically motivated and 
exploited by the opposition they claim. The Government and the PPP reject allegations of 
impropriety and discrimination and note their desire for a speedy enactment of legislation and 
establishment of the commissions. Indo-Guyanese sources point to a lack of Afro-Guyanese 
firms with the capacity to compete for government contracts. 
</p>
<p>42. In contradiction to Afro-Guyanese sources, Indo-Guyanese non-governmental sources 
painted a more positive picture of ethnic relations and social cohesion. They noted that beyond 
the urban areas where divisions may appear more pronounced, many villages are ethnically 
mixed and that relations are harmonious, with interracial relationships being &#8220;quite common&#8221;. 
Public holidays and celebrations are shared events, they suggest, which all ethnic groups 
participate in and welcome. 
</p>
<p>43. Afro-Guyanese trade union sources consider that the Government has been actively 
pursuing a discriminatory policy and programmes against Afro-Guyanese. They claim that the 
Government is working to undermine and divide the union movement, with the aim of 
weakening the primarily African Guyana Trades Union Congress (GTUC). They suggest that the 
Government orchestrated a split in the union movement by initiating and supporting a parallel 
union body, the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Guyana (FITUG). Union 
representatives believe that government actions are discriminatory, politically and racially 
motivated and an attempt to curtail the legitimate powers of the unions that have previously led 
to strike action over labour rights and government activities. 
</p>
<p>44. Considerable anger was expressed regarding the termination of the annual State subsidy 
awarded to Critchlow Labor College, which had been in place over the previous four decades. 
Critchlow Labor College provides &#8220;second chance&#8221; educational opportunities meeting the needs 
of predominantly Afro-Guyanese students, and has been seriously restricted in its activities and 
student intake. The annual subsidy reportedly amounted to some 48 per cent of the College&#8217;s 
operating costs. Its withdrawal has resulted in a dramatic fall in student intake, reportedly from 
about 2,600 (98 per cent of whom were Afro-Guyanese) to only about 200 students, and 
a 90 per cent reduction in staffing. Civil society groups expressed the opinion that termination of 
the grant is politically and racially motivated.  
</p>
<p>45. Funding for Critchlow Labor College was reportedly approved by the National Assembly 
but subsequently blocked by the Government, initially on the grounds of failure to submit 
audited accounts. Reportedly, when accounting issues had been satisfactorily addressed, the 
continuing refusal to release funds was claimed by the Government to be due to the split in the 
union movement that it is accused of orchestrating. 
</p>
<p>46. Union representatives raised further concerns regarding the Government&#8217;s alleged 
misappropriation of the bauxite industry pension fund, considered to be the largest pool of 
capital owned by Africans in Guyana. They consider the fund to have been &#8220;dismantled&#8221; to the </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/11/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>extent that former workers will not receive an adequate pension. In contrast they point out that 
the Government injected G$ 1.1 billion into the Guysuco pension fund to ensure the pensions of 
predominantly Indo-Guyanese sugar industry workers. 
</p>
<p>47. The Government refutes any accusation of discrimination in employment practices and 
economic activity. It asserts that Guyana&#8217;s challenges relate to it still being a poor country with 
scarce resources. Guyana&#8217;s debt in 1992 was over US$ 2 billion, and it had one of the highest 
per capita debt ratios in the developing world. The Government says it has advocated and 
practised a pro-people pro-poor policy and instituted programmes to reflect this policy in health, 
education, water, housing, social safety nets, etc. 
</p>
<p>48. The Government affirms that unemployment is not specific to Afro-Guyanese but results 
from a combination of various factors, such as the state of the economy and investments, 
continued reliance on primary products for export, educational levels and cultural norms. Labour 
force participation among the 15- to 64-year-old population is only 60 per cent. One of the 
reasons contributing to this has been the low participation of women in the formal labour force 
(only 37 per cent women versus 84 per cent men); however, this has not been found to be 
specific to any ethnic group. The Government notes that regarding the ethnic composition of the 
public service, the representation of Afro-Guyanese has reduced from 90 per cent to 70 per cent. 
In the Disciplined Forces other ethnic groups have always been in a minority, from the 1960s 
until present. It notes significant investment in education as well as in two major programmes 
fully financed for second chance opportunities for youth up to the age of 29, run by the Ministry 
of Culture, Youth and Sport, and the Ministry of Labour as well offers training and job 
placements for youth and youth at risk. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Land and housing 
</b></p>
<p>49. Concerns were expressed regarding the issue of ownership of lands by Afro-Guyanese. In 
the post-slavery era many Africans pooled their capital to collectively buy lands. Issues 
including lack of title documents, complexities related to shared ownership and lands 
subsequently leased to others (non-African) have created a complex situation in regard to 
proving and regaining ownership. Some who have leased lands now claim ownership rights over 
them. The PNC supported a motion in Parliament to establish a commission to address 
Afro-Guyanese ancestral land rights, which however was defeated by the PPP Parliamentary 
majority,<b>18</b> and the issue has faced continued neglect. 
50. Neighbourhoods and villages such as Lusignan and Buxton are virtually ethnically 
homogeneous and clearly identified as Afro- or Indo-Guyanese. Commentators noted that 
historically there had been a greater ethnic mix but that distinct ethnic enclaves had emerged 
from the social unrest of the 1960s onwards. Visits to Buxton and a tour of the Georgetown area 
revealed visibly poorer Afro-Guyanese neighbourhoods, some of which lacked basic facilities 
such as adequate toilet facilities. Allegations persist of discrimination in allocation of housing 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>18
</b>  The Government notes that the motion was amended and passed in the National Assembly in 
</p>
<p>July 2007. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.2 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>and the maintenance and provision of infrastructure to African areas vis-&#224;-vis those of 
Indo-Guyanese. Low wages, high unemployment levels and lack of credit among Afro-Guyanese 
communities contribute to poor housing quality and maintenance. 
</p>
<p>51. In response, the Government asserts that no part of Georgetown is ethnically homogenous. 
Further, it explains that between 2002 and 2008, the Buxton community was occupied by 
criminal gangs who made it virtually impossible for any government upgrade programmes to be 
undertaken in the community as the workers were being attacked. Many families abandoned 
their houses in terror of the gang. It points to a policy of providing housing lots for members of 
all communities without discrimination under new government housing programmes 
(commenced in 1994 and continuing to the present) which are multi-ethnic and geographically 
diverse. It notes that over 80,000 new housing plots have been allocated with 50,000 given to 
lowest income families from all communities. It reports that the major ethnic groups have 
received fair proportions on the basis of their respective demographics in each region, as 
evidenced by housing statistics. It also noted that the housing policy is based on a fundamental 
aim to provide improved circumstances and better living conditions to those in need irrespective 
of ethnicity. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Access to justice 
</b>52. Articles 123 to 133 and 198 to 199 of the Constitution of Guyana and the Administration 
of Justice Act provide the legislative basis for Guyana&#8217;s judicial system. Guyana has a three-tier 
judicial system consisting of the Magistrates Court, High Court and Court of Appeal. The 
Caribbean Court of Justice is the final court of appeal. 
</p>
<p>53. The justice system and security services are considered inefficient and ineffective. Sources 
described a consistent failure of due process; enquiries not begun or never finished; extreme 
delays in judicial proceedings leading to long-term detention without trial; cases that do not go to 
court or that are stymied by lack of evidence; and unwillingness of victims to engage with the 
legal system out of fear of recriminations. 
</p>
<p>54. Women spoke of a disturbing culture of domestic violence, often fuelled by poverty and 
unemployment and exacerbated by alcohol. One woman stated that: &#8220;It is simply true that as a 
society we believe in beating women and children.&#8221; They called for greater attention to tackling 
root causes and to long-term initiatives rather than simply devoting funding to policing and a 
justice sector which they felt consistently fails women. Participants described the courtroom as 
&#8220;a hostile environment for women&#8221; in which domestic violence and abuse cases are not treated 
seriously if they come to court at all. Some women noted a lack of consistency and focus in 
policies to address access to justice for women generally, in spite of the Domestic Violence Act. 
The Government notes a number of initiatives taken to reduce violence against women and 
children. It consulted countrywide and passed the Domestic Violence Act in 1997. A new 
comprehensive policy document &#8220;Stamp it out&#8221; on violence against women and children has also 
been taken throughout the country for examination and improvement. 
</p>
<p>55. Concerns were raised about appointments to senior judicial posts and regarding alleged 
discrimination. It was stated that, having failed to reach the required political agreement, the use 
of a number of &#8220;acting&#8221; positions effectively enables the Government to appoint its preferred 
candidates for senior magistrates and judges despite opposition objections. It was also alleged </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/11/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>that the Chief Magistrate of Guyana, Afro-Guyanese Juliet Holder-Allen, was removed from 
office due to ethnic prejudices and her treatment of politically sensitive cases including 
investigations into police killings and illegal government activities. 
</p>
<p>56. Court of Appeal Amendment Bill No. 12 of 2008, debated by Guyana&#8217;s National 
Assembly during the independent expert&#8217;s visit,<b>19</b> provides the Director of Public Prosecutions 
with the possibility to appeal an acquittal handed down by a judge and jury of Guyana&#8217;s High 
Court. Some expressed the concern that if passed, it would allow a government appeal process to 
ultimately be taken up to the Caribbean Court of Justice. The accused would be liable to remain 
in custody despite previous lower court and jury acquittal. Opponents claim a serious attack on 
the judicial system and civil liberties targeted at Afro-Guyanese and political opposition. 
57. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination notes that only a few 
complaints of racial discrimination have been brought before Guyana&#8217;s Ethnic Relations 
Commission and none before the courts. In its concluding observations the Committee 
(CERD/C/GUY/CO/14) noted the lack of information on the practical application of criminal 
and other legislation aimed at eliminating racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>58. The Government notes that failure to bring discrimination cases before the courts is partly 
attributed to the high standard of proof required in judicial proceedings and to the difficulties to 
secure witnesses. It asserts that Guyana&#8217;s judiciary reflects the ethnic and gender make-up of 
wider Guyanese society. The Government notes that it has made significant efforts to address 
ethnic imbalance in the police and security services with limited success, but that there continues 
to be reluctance on the part of Indo-Guyanese to join such services due to historical issues. 
Problems in regard to senior appointments are considered to be largely due to the failure of 
political negotiations with the opposition PNC in regard to appropriate candidates. The 
Government notes that it has contributed financially to the Guyana Legal Aid Clinic to assist it in 
expanding the provision of legal services to the poor in 7 of the 10 regions. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Media 
</b></p>
<p>59. The independent expert was informed of problems in regard of equal access to the media 
and suppression of media freedoms. Issues raised include that restrictions are imposed on issuing 
licences for Afro-Guyanese broadcasters; that the Government maintains a monopoly over radio 
broadcasts; bias in reporting of violent events which has exacerbated ethnic tensions; unequal 
provision of cultural programming; and that media time allocation for political opposition to 
raise their issues is restricted, especially prior to elections. 
</p>
<p>60. The Government owns and operates two radio stations broadcasting on several frequencies, 
reportedly the only media that reaches the entire country. Criticism is levelled at the Government 
for its failure to approve longstanding requests for private radio frequency authorizations. The 
President&#8217;s dual role as Minister of Communications provides him with ultimate authority over 
media access and licensing, which is considered inappropriate. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>19
</b>  The bill in question was in July 2008 sent to a parliamentary special select committee for 
</p>
<p>review prior to its resubmission to the National Assembly where it remains. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.2 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>61. A frequently mentioned incident is the suspension of broadcasting of CNS Channel Six 
television for infringing its licence after an outside caller to the programme &#8220;Voice of the 
People&#8221; referred to killing the President. The suspension is considered by many in the 
Afro-Guyanese community as an example of excessive media censorship. In another incident, a 
journalist with the privately owned Capitol News was allegedly banned from access to the office 
of the President following his critical coverage of an event attended by the President. <i>Stabroek</i> 
<i>News</i>, an independent daily newspaper in Guyana, has claimed that the Government Information 
Agency (GINA) has withdrawn State advertising with the newspaper due to its often critical 
stance. The PNC has called for the enactment of broadcast legislation to end political control 
over the media and to establish an independent national broadcasting authority; equitable access 
by the parliamentary opposition parties to the State-owned media; and an end to the State 
monopoly on radio broadcasts. 
</p>
<p>62. The Government asserts that a free and independent media exists and is vocal in its 
criticism of the Government; 18 privately owned television stations operate across 7 of 
the 10 administrative regions.<b>20</b> It states that the majority give no or limited coverage to the 
ruling parliamentary party, while State-owned media equally does not provide preferential 
coverage. The Government emphasizes that a number of television stations tailor their 
programme content to specific ethnic communities, without restriction. 
</p>
<p>63. The Government characterizes the media as &#8220;a potent source of racial incitement&#8221;<b>21</b> and 
justifies some restrictions to media freedoms on these grounds. The Racial Hostility Act 1997 
and its subsequent amendment in 2002 was a direct result of unbridled racial incitements 
surrounding the 1997 and 2001 national elections. Subsequently this led to the adoption of a 
Code of Conduct for the media houses and the establishment of the Media Monitoring Unit run 
by a team of Caribbean media observers leading up to and during the 2006 elections.<b>22</b> The 
Government notes that when it attempts to enforce legitimate legal restrictions, it faces racial 
indignation and charges of discrimination. It rejects allegations that it unfairly allocates access to 
the media and points instead to the commercial nature of media transactions including coverage 
of political parties. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>20
</b>  Of these the ethnic ownership of 14 are known; 7 are owned by Afro-Guyanese, 5 by 
</p>
<p>Indo-Guyanese and 2 by Portuguese Guyanese.

</b></p>
<p>  CERD/C/472/Add.1. 
<b>22
</b></p>
<p>  The Racial Hostility Act (1997), Chapter 23:01 makes provision for preventing conduct 
tending to excite hostility or ill-will against persons by reason of their race. The Racial Hostility 
Amendment Act No. 9 of 2002 provides for increased penalties for the commission of offences 
and evidential issues. In addition, the Representation of the People (Amendment) Act No. 1 
of 2001 also states that it is a criminal offence for any person to make or publish or cause to be 
made or published any statement or take any action that results in or can result in racial or ethnic 
violence or hatred among people.  </p>

<p><b>IV.  PROTECTION AGAINST VIOLENCE 
</b></p>
<p>64. In every meeting held by the independent expert with members of the Afro-Guyanese 
community she was told of a climate of fear based on recent violent events. The distrust of 
government security forces is palpable and there is what seems to be a fairly consistent narrative 
of use of excessive force and impunity. The distrust is enhanced by the fact that communities are 
highly segregated along ethnic lines, economically and socially unequal and politically polarized. 
Guyana&#8217;s history of violent protest, particularly associated with elections, is significant amid 
claims that current tensions have created a significantly higher risk of ethnically based violence. 
</p>
<p>65. Concerns were expressed by Afro-Guyanese and others regarding numerous killings of 
young Afro-Guyanese men from 2002 to the present day, and the existence of what has been 
described as a &#8220;phantom death squad&#8221;. A wide array of people within the community put the 
number of deaths at between 200 and 400. The reports note execution style killings, 
disappearances and failure to adequately record or investigate the murders. The perception is of a 
collusion of Government and law enforcement with known criminals to facilitate the targeting 
and killing of young African males known to the security services. Civil society groups have 
described a history and culture of violent policing in Guyana and have catalogued fatal police 
shootings.<b>23</b> Between 1980 and 2001, out of a total of 239 fatal shootings, 78 per cent were of 
Afro-Guyanese individuals.  
</p>
<p>66. An extreme climate of suspicion and conspiracy theory persists within the Afro-Guyanese 
community and threatens to undermine social stability. There is a widespread sense that there is 
a systematic effort to exclude them as an ethnic group from positions of influence, power or 
economic status. They described a growing &#8220;resistance movement&#8221; among Afro-Guyanese in 
response to exclusion and discrimination, which is labelled by the Government as simply 
criminal activity. One commentator stated: &#8220;Moderate voices are increasingly being drowned out 
by more radical elements and racially divisive opinions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>67. In January 2008, ethnic tensions were heightened considerably by the massacre 
of 11 Indo-Guyanese, including several children, in the Indian village of Lusignan. The Lusignan 
massacre reportedly fuelled anti-African sentiment, as the blame was assigned to Afro-Guyanese 
gangs. In February 2008, 12 police and community members of various ethnicities were killed in 
the town of Bartica. The killing of Afro-Guyanese miners at Lindo Creek in June served to 
further deepen tensions and concerns among all communities regarding security. Lack of 
adequate and transparent investigation into these atrocities has resulted in a high level of 
speculation as to the identity of perpetrators and the possible racial motivation for these killings. 
</p>
<p>68. The joint security services operations in villages such as the predominantly African Buxton 
have caused anger and resentment among community members who feel targeted and feel that 
their entire community is treated as a population of criminals. They described being &#8220;besieged&#8221; 
by the &#8220;joint services&#8221; (made up of members of the Guyana Defence Force and the police) 
during operations such as &#8220;Restore Order&#8221;. They voiced anger at the ransacking of homes and

</p>
<p>wholesale destruction of village farmland, which were purportedly sheltering criminals. The joint 
services are widely blamed within the community for exchanges of gunfire resulting in deaths of 
innocent civilians. 
</p>
<p>69. The security services have been severely criticized by all groups. Indo-Guyanese staged 
protests following the Lusignan massacre, claiming that the predominantly Afro-Guyanese 
forces were failing in their duty to protect the Indian community or bring perpetrators to justice. 
</p><p>70. NGOs and community members raised concerns regarding serious rights violations against 
Afro-Guyanese including arbitrary detention without trial, torture, deaths and mistreatment in 
custody, and killings of innocent civilians during operations by the joint services. Restrictions on 
media access and freedom of expression were also highlighted. It is claimed that, taken as a 
whole, these evidence a wider pattern and practice of gross rights violations against 
Afro-Guyanese and a failure of due process and the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>71. The Government acknowledges that periods of electoral and criminal violence have 
terrified people of all ethnic, class, religious and political persuasion. Violent crime and violent 
gangs which terrorized the country from 2002-2008 were sparked by a 2002 prison break and 
were the cause of fear and terror.<b>24</b> Notorious gangs killed and maimed over 500 people within a 
six-year period. The gangs were to a majority, but not exclusively, Afro-Guyanese,<b>25</b> and 
terrorized communities. It notes that an overwhelming and broad-based appeal for the 
Government to stop the violence, especially after the Lusignan and Bartica massacres, led to the 
birth of the National Stakeholders Forum in February 2008, led by the President himself. 
</p>
<p>72. The Government asserts that the Joint Services acted on the urging of the National 
Stakeholders Forum convened by the President in March 2008, to rout the criminals out from 
their safe havens. Machines were brought in to legitimately clear land in Buxton used as a refuge 
for criminals. A farmers&#8217; committee in Buxton was formed which worked with the Ministry of 
Agriculture where they received compensation, fertilizers and seeds to allow them to return to 
their farming area. 
</p>
<p>73. The Government totally rejects all accusations of torture, of operating covert death squads 
and of collusion with criminal elements to kill Afro-Guyanese individuals. It highlights the 
legitimate need to conduct security operations against criminal elements such as the &#8220;Fineman&#8221; 
gang, believed to be implicated in the Lusignan and Bartica massacres. It emphasizes that certain 
Afro-Guyanese gangs are embedded in communities such as Buxton, and that this is what 
necessitates concerted joint services operations in such localities. The Government 
acknowledges civilian deaths but lays the blame on gang members operating out of civilian 
areas. It notes that two persons were apprehended in connection with the Lusignan massacre and

report tabled in the National Assembly in 2004 was put before a Parliamentary Special Select 
Committee in the 8th and now the 9th Parliament. 
<b>25
</b></p>
<p>  The Government notes that it has never referred to gangs as &#8220;Afro-Guyanese&#8221;. </p>

<p>two in the Bartica massacre. Both are in prison on remand and they are Afro-Guyanese, known 
criminals with previous convictions. Significantly, on 29 August 2008 the media reported that 
Rondell &#8220;Fineman&#8221; Rawlins and key gang members were shot and killed in a joint services 
operation. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  IDENTITY, LANGUAGE, CULTURE AND RELIGION 
</b></p>
<p>74. Guyana&#8217;s different ethnic and religious groups are free to practise, promote and enjoy 
aspects of their cultural identity and religion. Civil society organizations representing the 
Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese communities are extremely active in this respect. They 
promote cultural activities, inspire youth and community action and engage in a wide range of 
projects and programmes of a cultural, educational and community development nature. 
</p><p>75. Poverty, unemployment and poor living conditions undoubtedly impact on the full 
enjoyment of cultural life for some communities from all ethnic groups. However conditions of 
economic hardship appear to be disproportionately experienced by Afro-Guyanese communities. 
Inevitably, daily subsistence issues take priority over aspects of cultural life that may require 
individual, family and community resources. Concerns related to security have also evidently 
impacted on cultural life. It was noted that the Afro-Guyanese Buxton village did not hold a 
torchlight parade in the community to celebrate Emancipation Day on 1 August 2008, for the 
first time in many years. Buxton community members expressed considerable trauma relating to 
joint services operations, curfews, deaths of some individuals, the ransacking of dwellings, and 
general fear of further violence. 
</p>
<p>76. Claims were made that media restrictions exist that limit the amount of African-oriented 
television and radio programming available and the amount of media coverage available to 
political opposition groups. It is claimed that this is a deliberate policy on the part of the 
Government. In some regions, only Government-controlled radio is available. 
</p>
<p>77. The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and this is generally considered to be 
well respected in practice. The Inter-Religious Organization of Guyana including senior 
representatives of Guyana&#8217;s Christian, Hindu, Islamic and Baha&#8217;i faith groups, expressed 
satisfaction with the degree of protection and promotion of religious freedom. Members noted 
that in Guyana there is a high degree of religious affiliation and that religious institutions and 
leaders have considerable influence among members of their respective faith groups. 
</p>
<p>78. The Government highlights that religious festivals and holidays of all main religious 
groups are recognized. The celebration of Arrival Day in May recognizes all those hundreds of 
thousands who were brought over the centuries as slaves and as indentured labourers. In 
October, there is a celebration of Emancipation Day and Amerindian Heritage Month. 
</p>
<p>79. The Government notes the impact of criminal activity on cultural life and highlights that 
since the village of Buxton was under siege by the criminal gang (majority not Buxtonians) the 
traditional August celebrations to mark Emancipation Day had been severely curtailed by this 
reality. It rejects any accusations of discrimination in relation to the awarding of grants for such 
things as cultural activities and institutions. </p>

<p><b>VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF  
THE INDEPENDENT EXPERT 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The current Government of Guyana must be commended on the steps it has taken to 
date to address issues of ethnic tensions, criminal activities and economic 
underdevelopment. Those efforts, while substantial, have been far from sufficient to 
generate trust and a sense of cooperation across ethnic groups. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>All groups in Guyana, Afro-Guyanese, Indo-Guyanese, indigenous peoples and 
others, have contributed immensely to the economic development and cultural wealth of 
Guyana. While the histories of these communities have been different, most have suffered 
hardships, historical injustices and gross human rights violations that must be 
acknowledged. All have suffered from the destructive impact and legacy of colonial rule, 
while contributing their labour and their lives to building the modern Guyana. 
Additionally, it should be acknowledged that injustices have been done in the post-colonial 
era, sometimes under short-sighted or misguided leadership and often in the interests of 
achieving and maintaining power. Ethnicity has been grossly manipulated as a political 
tool. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>As identified by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism in 2003, 
the harsh reality is one of ethnic polarization among Guyanese of African, Indian and 
indigenous descent. This polarization, starkly reflected in the ethnic composition of the 
political parties, is reproduced in State institutions, particularly in the army and the police. 
Yet the people of Guyana desire a different future of security, prosperity and shared 
development. They acknowledge that all communities deserve and must have a stake in 
that future. For reconciliation to take place, a climate of trust must be established. The 
challenges that exist, both historic and current, must be confronted collectively. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Ethnically based divisions and politics have created two separate and conflicting 
narratives and perceptions of reality in Guyana. On the part of the Afro-Guyanese, there is 
a widely held belief that they are discriminated against by an Indian-dominated and 
supported Government that puts Indian interests to the fore, particularly in resource 
allocation, government contracts and employment. On the part of the Indian-Guyanese, 
there is a belief that an Afro-centric political opposition, if in power, would settle political 
scores and work solely in the interests of Afro-Guyanese. On the basis of recent atrocities 
and ongoing killings, both ethnic groups currently perceive a heightened threat of violence 
from the other. Many believe this threat to be sanctioned or supported to some extent by 
the opposite political party. Rumours and conspiracy theory are rife and are being 
exploited by those who might seek to fuel ethnic tensions for their own ends. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>In July 2003, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism highlighted 
that he found that every level of Guyanese society is permeated by a profound moral, 
emotional and political fatigue, arising out of the individual and collective impact of ethnic 
polarization. Five years later, the independent expert visited communities that are moving 
from malaise, in some instances, into despair, anger and resistance. This is particularly 
evident in Afro-Guyanese communities. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/10/11/Add.2 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>85. <b>The stigmatization of young Afro-Guyanese males and entire African communities is 
a serious concern. Derogatory stereotypes of criminality colour wider societal perceptions 
of Afro-Guyanese individuals and communities. Operations such as &#8220;Restore Order&#8221; 
focused on Buxton and other Afro-Guyanese communities add to the perception that they 
constitute a &#8220;problem&#8221; to be solved by security and law enforcement means. Buxtonians 
believe there is a presumption of criminality used to justify subsequent excessive force in 
the conduct of joint services operations in their community and that illegal covert 
&#8220;security&#8221; forces have been sanctioned to operate in Guyana. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Guyana must take immediate steps towards healing the wounds of history and those 
inflicted by recent events. It must close the widening fault lines that exist between 
communities and take all necessary steps to avoid a decline into lawlessness, impunity and 
ethnically based conflict. Short and long-term strategies, developed in consultation with all 
communities, must be put in place to address immediate concerns and the root causes of 
tensions that threaten to break out into violence. It is vital in the current climate of 
suspicion in Guyana to build trust between communities and faith in public institutions and 
in government. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>For Guyana to progress, it cannot be acceptable for there to be an understanding, 
real or perceived, that the Government is an Indian administration working in the interest 
of Indians and that the opposition is African; that an Indian employer will recruit only an 
Indian worker; that public contracts will be granted on the basis of ethnicity; that the 
police and military are African institutions; that crime is a problem centred in the African 
community; or that certain villages are exclusively African or Indian. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>A period of democratic dialogue under which the main political parties had agreed, 
on the basis of a joint communiqu&#233; on 6 May 2003, to work together to find solutions in the 
interests of all Guyanese people failed to achieve tangible results. Despite the initiation of 
numerous such political processes, little meaningful impact has been achieved. This has 
undermined confidence in political processes, particularly among Afro-Guyanese 
communities that feel politically disenfranchised. Reforms must be far reaching and highly 
consultative. However processes must be time-bound, action-oriented, and must lead to 
concrete, achievable outcomes. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The independent expert considers that previous conclusions and recommendations, 
including those of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism and the 
concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination of 
April 2006, remain highly relevant and she fully endorses them. However, with few 
exceptions, they have not been implemented. The Government of Guyana, all political 
parties, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders are urged to fully 
implement those recommendations as a roadmap for equality, non-discrimination and 
respect for human rights which these collective recommendations provide. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Government, all political parties, and religious, cultural and civil society groups 
representing different communities should take responsibility to reach out beyond the 
ethnic divide and to build bridges between communities. Moderate and conciliatory voices 
among all communities must come to the fore.</b> </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.2 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>91. <b>The Government should take steps to respond convincingly to perceptions that the 
Afro-Guyanese community as a whole has been targeted during actions by the joint 
services resulting in arbitrary detention without trial, torture, deaths and mistreatment in 
custody, and other extrajudicial killings. Numerous specific cases brought to the attention 
of the independent expert reveal issues with respect to thorough and transparent conduct 
of investigations, due process and the rule of law. Urgent independent review of Guyana&#8217;s 
security and law enforcement services and justice system is required. 
</b>92. <b>The Government and both political parties should take full responsibility to ensure 
that decisions taken to resolve conflicts are fully implemented. In February and 
March 2008, the National Stakeholder Forum was convened and brought together all the 
parliamentary parties and a broad cross-section of civil society organizations. To date, this 
process and the positive consultation and dialogue that it established, has not materialized 
into concrete, institutionalized forms of cooperation and conflict resolution. The 
independent expert recommends that the following decisions of the national stakeholder 
process be implemented as a matter of urgency: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Establish as a matter of urgency a new Parliamentary Standing Committee on 
National Security with ministerial representation26 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Expedite the appointment of those constitutional commissions which are key 
features of the governance framework and still have not been established. 
Guarantee that those who are appointed as commissioners have credibility with all 
communities 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Convene and activate the Parliamentary Constitutional Reform Committee to 
address issues presently before it and to examine further areas for constitutional 
reform 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure the meaningful and effective participation of civil society in these 
parliamentary processes 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Explore an agreed mechanism for the continuation of the National Stakeholders&#8217; 
Forum 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>An open and constructive dialogue on inclusive governance, as envisaged in 
the 6 May 2003 communiqu&#233; and the follow-up agreement of 18 June, remains an essential 
component of a new political climate of cooperation. The Government should demonstrate 
leadership by meeting the preconditions set in those agreements and initiating such a 
dialogue with all stakeholders at the earliest opportunity. Included in the agenda should be 
models used in other countries with deeply divided ethnic communities to encourage the 
formation of multi-ethnic political parties. 
</b>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>26
</b>  In a memorandum to the independent expert, the Government advises that the National

Government and two of the three opposition parties (the AFC and GAP). </p>

</p>
<p>94. <b>The Government should demonstrate support for educational and cultural projects 
established by institutions and organizations within the Afro-Guyanese community and 
facilitate funding for those projects. 
</b>95. <b>Restrictions on the media and freedom of expression should be lifted and legal 
definitions of the offences of &#8220;treason&#8221; should be evaluated as against international 
standards of freedom of expression. The Government should consider whether having the 
President also holding the portfolio of Minister of Communication has a chilling effect on 
freedom of expression in the current highly polarized context of Guyana.</b> 
</p>
<p>96. <b>A lack of disaggregated statistical data in all sectors hampers detailed and rigorous 
analysis of the relative situations of different ethnic groups in Guyana. Disaggregated data 
should be collected on a voluntary and confidential basis, and analysed to reveal the extent 
of inequality and to enable informed policy decisions. Such data should be used to fashion 
aggressive targeted affirmative action programmes to address the economic, educational 
and social inequalities that exist in the Afro-Guyanese communities comparative to those in 
the Indo-Guyanese communities. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>There is a lack of information on the impact of the anti-discrimination provisions of 
the Constitution and legislation. The Government should establish a programme to 
monitor the extent to which these provisions have been used as the basis for criminal or 
other legal proceedings and what the outcomes have been. There should also be a 
data-driven evaluation of the Office of the Ombudsman and the Ethnic Relations 
Commission. That should lead to a re-evaluation of whether additional, more effective 
mechanisms should be created to tackle aggressively ethnic discrimination. This should be 
part of a national plan of action as called for in the Durban Programme of Action.
