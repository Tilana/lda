</p>
<p><b> C. Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>8. Antti Korkeakivi, Chief of the Indigenous Peoples and Minorities Section, OHCHR, 
opened the fifth session of the Expert Mechanism and introduced the Director of the 
Research and Right to Development Division, OHCHR, Marcia Kran, for opening remarks. 
</p>
<p>9. Ms. Kran noted that in resolution 18/8, the Human Rights Council requested the 
Expert Mechanism to conduct a survey on States&#8217; best practices regarding appropriate 
measures and implementation strategies to attain the goals of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. While Ms. Kran expressed her 
appreciation for the quality of the responses that had been received, she also noted her 
disappointment that too few responses had been received to date. She also commented on 
the ways in which OHCHR assisted in the implementation of the rights of indigenous 
peoples. 
</p>
<p>10. In her opening statement, the President of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador 
Laura Dupuy Lasserre, noted that the sessions of the Expert Mechanism provided a space 
for dialogue between indigenous peoples and States. She emphasized the importance of the 
participation of indigenous peoples in the Human Rights Council and noted that the Council 
had requested a detailed document from the Secretary-General examining the methods of 
promoting the participation of indigenous peoples at the United Nations, which will be 
presented at its twenty-first session. She also noted that the implementation of the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was a central focus of the Council. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Election of officers 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Chief of the Indigenous Peoples and Minorities Section of OHCHR invited the 
members of the Expert Mechanism to nominate a Chairperson-Rapporteur and Vice-
Chairperson-Rapporteur for its fifth session. Mr. Morales Morales nominated International 
Chief Littlechild and Ms. Lasimbang as Chairperson-Rapporteur and Vice-Chairperson-
Rapporteur, respectively, who were then appointed by acclamation. 
</p>
<p>12. The new Chairperson-Rapporteur thanked the other members of the Expert 
Mechanism for his election and also thanked the outgoing Chairperson of the Expert 
Mechanism, Vital Bambanze, for his contribution. The Chairperson-Rapporteur welcomed 
the new member of the Expert Mechanism, Mr. Titus. 
</p>
<p>13. The Chairperson-Rapporteur highlighted the importance of developing concrete 
national strategies to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, noting that one of the objectives of the Expert Mechanism was to more </p>


<p>proactively engage with States and indigenous peoples at the national level to achieve that 
goal, and emphasized the need for full implementation of the Declaration. He noted the 
valuable contributions of the observers to the work of the Expert Mechanism. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples reflected on his work 
relating to extractive industries, and noted that concerns about extractive industries were 
repeatedly raised in his engagement with indigenous peoples. He stressed the need to focus 
more attention on the protection of the primary substantive rights of indigenous peoples that 
may be implicated in natural resource extraction, such as the right to self-determination, 
and stated that he would elaborate further in his report to the Human Rights Council at its 
twenty-first session. 
</p>
<p>15. Grand Chief Edward John, Chairperson of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous 
Issues, noted the coordination between the three United Nations mechanisms on indigenous 
peoples and emphasized the overarching goal of implementing the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. He discussed the importance of 
recognizing and protecting indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and cultures in the context of the 
implementation of the human rights of indigenous peoples and expressed particular concern 
relating to the continued violence against indigenous women. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Adoption of the agenda 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Expert Mechanism adopted the agenda2 and the programme of work of the fifth 
session.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. The World Conference on Indigenous Peoples  
</b></p>
<p>17. John Henriksen, indigenous co-facilitator of the World Conference on Indigenous 
Peoples, provided an update on consultations relating to the World Conference. He 
explained that there were two points of broad agreement, including the need for indigenous 
peoples&#8217; full and effective participation in the World Conference, and that the outcomes of 
the conference should be action-oriented, focusing on the realization of the implementation 
of the human rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>18. The indigenous peoples&#8217; global coordinating group related to the World Conference 
on Indigenous Peoples noted that it had undertaken consultations with States to seek 
support and had worked closely with the indigenous co-facilitator, Mr. Henriksen. The 
group also provided the Expert Mechanism with recommendations concerning the 
modalities of the World Conference, including an independent and preliminary thematic 
hearing to facilitate the development of a concise action-oriented outcome document. It 
further recommended that documentation resulting from relevant preparatory processes be 
recognized as official documents at the World Conference. 
</p>
<p>19. Observers made recommendations concerning the duration, location, dates, 
procedures, agenda items and themes of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, 
frequently articulating the need for the full, effective and equal participation of indigenous 
peoples in the planning, follow-up and implementation of the outcomes of the World 
Conference. Various observers recommended that the World Conference take place over 
three days, voicing the importance of ensuring the availability of sufficient financial 
resources to enable the participation of indigenous peoples at all stages.  
</p>
<p>  
 2 A/HRC/EMRIP/2012/1 and A/HRC/EMRIP/2012/1/Add.1. </p>


<p>20. Grand Chief John, Chairperson of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, 
outlined the recommendations of the Permanent Forum relating to the World Conference 
contained in the report on its eleventh session.3 
</p>
<p>21. Ms. Lasimbang and the Chairperson-Rapporteur expressed concern that State 
representatives from Asia or Africa did not make statements concerning the agenda item.    
</p>
<p>22. Mr. Morales Morales noted that 2014 would also mark the end of the Second 
International Decade of the World&#8217;s Indigenous People, and the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
called for the establishment of a Third International Decade. In Mr. Morales&#8217; view, the 
World Conference should take place over three days. 
</p>
<p>23. Mr. Henriksen expressed his gratitude for observers&#8217; and experts&#8217; views and 
suggestions, noting that they would be considered in future consultations. He assured 
observers that he and his co-facilitator, Ambassador Lu&#237;s Alfonso de Alba of the Permanent 
Mission of Mexico to the United Nations in New York, were open to further 
communications. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Follow-up to thematic studies and advice 
</b></p>
<p>24. Mr. Morales Morales, in introducing the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s follow-up report on 
indigenous peoples and the right to participate in decision-making, with a focus on 
extractive industries, highlighted the duty to ensure free, prior and informed consent and the 
permanent sovereignty of indigenous peoples over natural resources. 
</p>
<p>25. The Chairperson-Rapporteur provided a brief summary of the conference room 
paper prepared by the Expert Mechanism entitled, &#8220;Comment on the Human Rights 
Council&#8217;s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as related to indigenous 
peoples and the right to participate in decision-making with a focus on extractive 
Industries&#8221; (A/HRC/EMRIP/2012/CRP.1). The Chairperson-Rapporteur noted the 
importance of ongoing and future collaboration between the Working Group on the issue of 
human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, the Special 
Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues 
and the Expert Mechanism to promote the effective implementation of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in relation to the Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>26. Observers noted that the follow-up report on indigenous peoples and the right to 
participate in decision-making, with a focus on extractive industries provided an important 
opportunity for engagement on one of the most pressing issues facing indigenous peoples 
around the world. Observers also raised concerns that reliance on voluntary compliance by 
corporate interests failed to address the power imbalance that typically existed between 
indigenous peoples and the proponents of extractive development. Respect for indigenous 
peoples&#8217; right to free, prior and informed consent was emphasized as a key component in 
the development of improved relations among indigenous peoples, States and extractive 
industries, including the right of indigenous peoples to decide not to proceed with resource 
development if they so choose. 
</p>
<p>27. Some States noted that agreements between indigenous peoples and extractive 
companies had been reached in relation to extractive projects, and described different 
</p>
<p>  
 3 See <i>Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 2012, Supplement No. 23 </i>(E/2012/43-
</p>
<p>E/C.19/2012/13). </p>


<p>measures, plans and programmes that existed to engage indigenous peoples in resource 
development. 
</p>
<p>28. Mr. Morales Morales noted specific measures taken by States to engage with 
indigenous peoples regarding resource extraction processes, and offered examples of 
difficulties experienced by indigenous peoples in Latin American countries in the context 
of resource development. He noted the opportunity for collaborative efforts among the 
Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, the Permanent Forum on 
Indigenous Issues and the Expert Mechanism to address concerns associated with the 
exploitation of natural resources. 
</p>
<p>29. Ms. Lasimbang expressed her appreciation for interventions relating to free, prior 
and informed consent, as well as her concern about the lack of mechanisms available to 
address conflicts between indigenous peoples and States or industries in relation to 
extractive projects. She further expressed concern about the lack of extractive industry 
engagement in the United Nations bodies addressing indigenous peoples&#8217; issues and the 
</p>
<p>practice of some States of leaving consultation with indigenous peoples to industry rather 
than engaging in, and taking responsibility for, direct consultations. Ms. Lasimbang also 
stated that the Expert Mechanism continued to be deeply concerned about the serious 
impacts that resulted from the lack of recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in relation 
to extractive industries, particularly mining. 
</p>
<p>30. Ms. Lasimbang made reference to the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s study on lessons learned 
and challenges to achieving the right of indigenous peoples to education (A/HRC/12/33) 
and noted the ongoing need for sustained funding to develop culturally appropriate 
curricula and to support the realization of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to education. 
</p>
<p>31. Regarding the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s study on lessons learned and challenges to 
achieve the right of indigenous peoples to education, the Chairperson-Rapporteur made 
reference to a report entitled: <i>Nurturing the Learning Spirit of First Nation Students: The 
Report of the National Panel on First Nation Elementary and Secondary Education for 
</i></p>
<p><i>Students on Reserve</i>, an outcome of collaboration between the Government of Canada and 
the Assembly of First Nations. He submitted the full report for the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s 
consideration.  
</p>
<p>32. Some observers also spoke to the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s study on lessons learned and 
challenges to achieve the right of indigenous peoples to education, outlining challenges and 
good practices.   
</p>
<p><b> VI. Study on the role of languages and culture in the promotion 
and protection of the rights and identity of indigenous 
peoples 
</b></p>
<p>33. Former member and Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Expert Mechanism Mr. 
Bambanze presented the final report of the Expert Mechanism on the study on the role of 
languages and culture in the promotion and protection of the rights and identity of 
indigenous peoples (A/HRC/EMRIP/2012/3 and Corr.1). 
</p>
<p>34. Mr. Bambanze noted that the right of indigenous peoples to languages and cultures 
was a facet of the right to self-determination and mentioned positive examples of the 
promotion and revitalization of indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and cultures. He also 
reflected on indigenous peoples&#8217; negative experiences of assimilationist policies, which, in 
</p>
<p>some cases, were carried over to the present day. Mr. Bambanze encouraged active efforts 
to revitalize languages and cultural practices and to recognize that cultures were alive. </p>


<p>35. Observers consistently emphasized the importance of indigenous languages and 
cultures to the identities and well-being of indigenous nations and communities. Various 
observers noted the importance of indigenous peoples&#8217; control over the development of 
programmes, policies and laws designed to promote and protect indigenous peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>languages and cultures, and shared strategies for protecting and revitalizing indigenous 
peoples&#8217; languages and cultures.    
</p>
<p>36. Observers discussed concerns relating to the loss of indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures and 
languages, including, in some cases, their extinction, especially when threatened by 
dominant majority cultures and the negative impact of discriminatory laws. Observers 
shared challenges arising from the lack of recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; languages in 
national laws and raised concerns relating to the continued repression of the use of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; languages by indigenous children in state custody. Observers 
</p>
<p>emphasized the strong connection between indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to languages and 
cultures and their rights relating to lands, territories and resources, noting that indigenous 
peoples&#8217; cultures and languages were indivisible from their relationship to their lands, 
territories and resources. One observer highlighted the relationship between culture and 
sovereignty, noting that, for his people, culture was sovereignty and sovereignty was 
culture, a perspective that was met with agreement from other observers. 
</p>
<p>37. Ms. Lasimbang emphasized the need for recognition and acceptance of the positive 
value of indigenous languages and cultures to ensure cultural flexibility in local governing 
structures, and to provide means to communities for protecting languages and cultures. She 
also noted that programmes and measures to address the promotion and protection of 
indigenous languages and culture should not be implemented without adequate reflection 
and the participation of indigenous peoples themselves. Ms. Lasimbang also expressed 
concern about existing patriarchal systems that discriminated against women, thus 
hampering their roles in transmitting linguistic and cultural values and norms. 
</p>
<p>38. Mr. Morales Morales expressed his appreciation for the open dialogue on the issue 
of cultures and languages of indigenous peoples, and echoed concerns expressed about the 
disappearance of languages and cultures. He offered his congratulations to those indigenous 
youth who had sought to learn their indigenous languages, and urged States to work with 
indigenous peoples who were seeking to revitalize their languages and cultures. 
</p>
<p>39. Mr. Bambanze discussed the role of indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and cultures in 
the preservation of indigenous identity and urged States to promote and protect indigenous 
languages and cultures, including by implementing the recommendations of the Expert 
Mechanism. 
</p>
<p>40. The Chairperson-Rapporteur acknowledged the importance of the State 
contributions to the protection of the languages and cultures of indigenous peoples and 
thanked the observers for their valuable input. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>41. Prior to opening discussion on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, the Chairperson-Rapporteur invited Shankar Limbu, a member of the 
Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations, to 
address the participants of the session. 
</p>
<p>42. Mr. Limbu welcomed the 16 beneficiaries of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for 
Indigenous Populations and noted the significant impact of past beneficiaries of the Fund. 
He also acknowledged recommendations received from observers to the fifth session of the </p>


<p>Expert Mechanism to expand the scope of the Fund to support indigenous peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>participation in the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples. Mr. Limbu noted that 
sufficient funding would have to accompany any such expansion to the mandate of the 
Fund. 
</p>
<p>43. Mr. Limbu expressed gratitude to the contributors to the Voluntary Fund for 
Indigenous Populations. However, he expressed concern that there had been a significant 
decrease in contributions to the Fund and stressed the importance of ensuring the 
participation of those directly affected by the work of the United Nations mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>44. The Chairperson-Rapporteur noted that the General Assembly had adopted the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples on 13 September 2007. He 
further noted that the Human Rights Council had requested the Expert Mechanism to 
prepare a questionnaire to seek the views of States on best practices regarding possible 
appropriate measures and implementation strategies in order to attain the goals of the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in Council resolution 18/8.   
</p>
<p>45. Ms. Lasimbang welcomed the responses received from States to the questionnaire 
but expressed regret that only 14 responses had been received. She reviewed the 
submissions received from States and shared many specific examples of laws and 
programmes cited by States as examples of implementation of the Declaration. Ms. 
Lasimbang also noted that, according to the results of the questionnaire, no State had yet 
passed explicit laws requiring the Declaration to be considered when devising new laws, 
policies or other measures relating to indigenous peoples, and stressed that lack of 
awareness of the Declaration remained one of the biggest challenges to implementing the 
rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>46. Ms. Lasimbang explained that some of the best practices identified were 
partnerships between States and indigenous peoples, which facilitated the participation of 
indigenous peoples in decision-making, and noted that the responses to the questionnaire 
had provided important insights. She further noted that, in view of the small number of 
States that had responded, the Expert Mechanism would submit a proposal to the Human 
Rights Council to extend the time frame for responses. 
</p>
<p>47. Observers underlined the importance of the Declaration, noting that it was a 
cornerstone for the promotion and protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, and offered 
their support for the work of the Expert Mechanism in its promotion of the effective 
implementation of the Declaration. Many observers raised urgent concerns relating to the 
human rights of indigenous peoples. Observers also noted that a wide gap continued to exist 
between the promises of the Declaration and its application on the ground, noting 
specifically the lack of access to justice and the failure to ensure protection of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights to their lands, territories and resources.   
</p>
<p>48. Observers emphasized that indigenous peoples continued to face challenges in 
exercising the right to self-determination and noted the need for States to be willing to share 
power with indigenous peoples as a precondition to the effective implementation of the 
Declaration. Many observers called for dialogue between States and indigenous peoples to 
identify and address the barriers to the full implementation of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>49. State observers described the Declaration as an important symbolic and practical 
step in addressing the historical injustices faced by indigenous peoples around the world. 
State observers shared many examples of the programmes and laws developed to 
implement the Declaration and highlighted efforts to enhance access to the Declaration 
through its translation into indigenous peoples&#8217; languages. Various State observers 
</p>
<p>identified consultation and participation as areas of focus in their efforts to implement the 
Declaration. </p>


<p>50. Observers noted that the Declaration was an essential tool in the protection and 
promotion of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, and stressed that implementation of the 
Declaration remained a challenge and may require new laws. Observers also recommended 
that follow-up to implementation of the Declaration should be carried out in coordination 
with the United Nations system. 
</p>
<p>51. Numerous observers and experts raised concerns about the militarization of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; lands, territories and resources. Observers and experts recommended 
</p>
<p>that States abandon any policies that denied indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to lands, territories 
and resources or unjustly placed the burden of proof on indigenous peoples to establish 
territorial rights based on original occupation. Observers raised concerns about the delay 
and high cost of seeking legal remedies to secure recognition and protection of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; human rights. 
</p>
<p>52. Observers raised concerns about national laws that impaired the operation of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; judicial systems through the imposition of conditions foreign to 
indigenous peoples. Some observers expressed regret that some States continued to deny 
the presence of indigenous peoples within their borders. Observers shared concerns about 
the impact of discriminatory education laws and lack of funding for the protection of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and cultures. 
</p>
<p>53. One observer expressed concern about the processes in place to designate World 
Heritage sites and, in particular, the lack of consultation with indigenous peoples living on 
or near such sites. 
</p>
<p>54. Saul Vicente Vazquez, a member of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, 
noted that a great deal of work remained to be done to realize the objectives of the 
Declaration, and cited many examples of continued violations of the human rights of 
indigenous peoples. He highlighted concerns about violations relating to the impact of 
extractive industries, including the criminalization of protest activities and the assassination 
of indigenous peoples&#8217; leaders. He also mentioned the Permanent Forum&#8217;s recommendation 
</p>
<p>at its eleventh session that he prepare a consolidated report on extractive industries and 
their impact on indigenous peoples in coordination with the Expert Mechanism, the Special 
Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples and the Permanent Forum on Indigenous 
Issues.  
</p>
<p>55. Mr. Morales Morales emphasized the need for improved relations between 
indigenous peoples and States through the effective implementation of the Declaration. He 
encouraged engagement from United Nations bodies in the Expert Mechanism. He also 
stressed the importance of the role of indigenous peoples&#8217; media in the promotion of the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Mr. Morales welcomed the initiative to 
hold a conference for indigenous peoples&#8217; media in Oaxaca in 2013, to be associated with 
the preparations for the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>56. Ms. Lasimbang expressed her appreciation for the interactive dialogue. She noted 
that many indigenous peoples had shared examples of their efforts to implement the 
Declaration and made reference to submissions concerning the militarization of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; lands and territories. She also highlighted the submissions received relating to 
free, prior and informed consent and calls for States to conduct reviews of national 
legislation and constitutional provisions to ensure conformity with the Declaration. Ms. 
Lasimbang also noted that indigenous peoples&#8217; access to justice should be taken seriously 
</p>
<p>as it related not only to their livelihoods, personal security and liberty, but also to the 
recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; customary legal systems. Denial of such access has 
</p>
<p>severe consequences. She also expressed concern that the drafting of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations Human Rights Declaration had been conducted without adequate 
consultations with indigenous peoples. Ms. Lasimbang referred to the observers&#8217; comments </p>


<p>made in relation to the designation of World Heritage sites without the free, prior and 
informed consent of indigenous peoples living on or near such sites.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Interactive dialogue with the United Nations mechanisms on 
indigenous peoples   
</b></p>
<p>57. Ms. Lasimbang, in her opening statement as the Chair of the interactive dialogue, 
said it was the first time the Expert Mechanism was holding such a dialogue, and she 
expressed hope that it would prove useful not only to States, indigenous peoples and other 
observers but also to the panel consisting of the three mandates dealing with indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights. 
</p>
<p>58. International Chief Littlechild discussed the implementation of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples at the international and national levels. He 
explained that the Declaration was the framework for the work of the Expert Mechanism, 
including its reports and studies. He noted that the foundation of each of the studies and 
reports of the Expert Mechanism was the right to self-determination. He also described an 
initiative of numerous international agencies, namely, a handbook for parliamentarians on 
implementing the Declaration into the work of Parliaments<i>.</i> He outlined national steps 
towards implementation that could be considered by States and indigenous peoples, such as 
the adoption of the Declaration by indigenous peoples as part of their governance and their 
constitutions and the adoption by States of implementation acts on the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples described the 
Declaration as a testament to the sacrifices and tireless efforts of indigenous peoples. He 
noted that States and the international community must do more to transform the standards 
articulated in the Declaration from an aspiration to a reality and stated that all international 
standard-setting processes that affected indigenous peoples should conform fully to the 
standards of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>60. Grand Chief John noted the cooperative efforts of the three mechanisms to work 
towards the implementation of the Declaration, and encouraged those States which had not 
yet endorsed the Declaration to take positive and constructive steps to do so. He stressed 
that the right to self-determination is a fundamental baseline right which is indispensible to 
the survival, dignity and well-being of indigenous peoples.   
</p>
<p>61. Observers raised questions regarding good practices in relation to indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights to their lands, territories and resources, as well as on strategies for securing 
responses to the questionnaire seeking the views of States on best practices regarding 
possible appropriate measures and implementation strategies in order to attain the goals of 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Processes for 
implementing the Declaration within indigenous peoples&#8217; communities and within the 
universal periodic review were also raised. 
</p>
<p>62. International Chief Littlechild noted that responses to the questionnaire continued to 
be received, and explained that the Expert Mechanism was considering both the issue of the 
low number of responses and the expansion of the questionnaire to address the 
implementation of the Declaration by indigenous peoples. He also noted examples of good 
practices by indigenous peoples to implement the Declaration, including its endorsement by 
indigenous peoples at the community, regional and national levels. He suggested that those 
States which were home to indigenous peoples should be asked about the implementation 
during the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur noted legal and constitutional recognition of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights to lands, territories and resources as good practices. He also highlighted as a </p>


<p>point of concern conflicts between resource extraction laws and those laws which 
recognized indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, and noted that more attention needed to be paid to 
the Declaration in the universal periodic review process. 
</p>
<p>64. Grand Chief John cited strategic plans developed by indigenous peoples as an 
effective means of supporting indigenous peoples&#8217; efforts to secure the recognition and 
protection of their rights relating to lands, territories and resources. 
</p>
<p>65. Observers raised concerns about the militarization of indigenous peoples&#8217; lands, 
territories and resources. Questions were also posed concerning urban indigenous peoples, 
practical steps that may be taken by States to implement the Declaration, the advice that 
might be offered to those indigenous peoples living in States where the State asserted that 
they were in conformity with the Declaration despite failing to implement the Declaration, 
and whether the mechanisms would be able to aid in the development of educational tools 
to assist in raising the awareness and knowledge of indigenous peoples about the 
Declaration. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur emphasized that dialogue between indigenous peoples and 
States should be the basis for the implementation of the Declaration, and noted that it came 
into existence to address the failure of existing legal arrangements to secure the full 
enjoyment of human rights by indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>67. International Chief Littlechild noted the global focus of the Declaration and 
emphasized that the text included significant areas of agreement which may guide 
implementation. He noted that work was being done to develop plain language versions of 
the Declaration and that the translation of the Declaration into indigenous languages served 
as an effective tool for enhancing its understanding. International Chief Littlechild asked 
those States that had asserted that they had met the standards of the Declaration to offer 
research-based evidence of that achievement. The evidence could serve as the basis for 
further dialogue. 
</p>
<p>68. Grand Chief John requested continued focus on the development of knowledge and 
understanding of the Declaration and encouraged academic centres to incorporate the 
Declaration into their curricula. He discussed concerns that the taking of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; lands, territories and resources had forced indigenous peoples into judicial forums 
that were not cognizant of international laws, norms and standards applicable to indigenous 
peoples, and he was critical of continued references to and application of the doctrine of 
discovery.  
</p>
<p>69. Observers inquired as to what steps might be taken to resolve issues relating to the 
violation of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights when domestic and diplomatic avenues had been 
exhausted and whether a new mechanism could be recommended by the Expert 
Mechanism, outside the context of the universal periodic review, to enhance monitoring 
and evaluation of the implementation of indigenous peoples&#8217; human rights. Observers also 
asked what steps might be taken to convince States to implement an instrument which 
many States considered to be aspirational and whether it was necessary to move beyond the 
State context to the development of international mechanisms focused on the effective 
implementation of indigenous peoples&#8217; human rights. The value and approach of 
collaboration between the three mandates as demonstrated through the recent work on 
extractive industries was also raised for discussion. 
</p>
<p>70. International Chief Littlechild explained that there were provisions within the 
Declaration which supported the development of a mechanism to monitor it. 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur stated that cooperation between the three mechanisms on the 
issue of extractive industries was essential and noted that biannual coordination meetings 
were held between the three mechanisms in this regard. He also emphasized the value of </p>


<p>moving beyond discussions concerning the legal status of the Declaration, to its use by 
States as an authoritative statement to take decisive action to ensure that indigenous peoples 
benefit from the full protection of the standards established in the Declaration. He 
emphasized that the Declaration did not create new rights, rather, it took basic human rights 
laws and principles and contextualized those rights as they applied to indigenous peoples.   
</p>
<p>72. Grand Chief John noted that article 38 of the Declaration provided an impetus for 
dialogue to achieve the full and effective implementation of the Declaration. He described 
the Declaration as a substantive compilation of the human rights of indigenous peoples, 
noting that human rights could not be aspirational. He stressed that the quality of life of 
indigenous peoples remained a foremost concern. 
</p>
<p>73. Many State observers indicated that the interactive panel was a valuable opportunity 
for States to learn more about the Declaration and emphasized the importance of dialogue. 
State observers also offered their support for extending the time period for the questionnaire 
and asked that those States which had provided responses be offered the opportunity to 
provide updates. 
</p>
<p>74. In closing, International Chief Littlechild noted that the interactive dialogue was a 
historic event. The Special Rapporteur explained that he used the Declaration as the 
primary point of reference for his work. He noted that, in his work, he had not encountered 
a single State which contested the application of the Declaration, and noted that in practice 
the Declaration stood as a common point of reference for addressing the challenges faced 
by indigenous peoples. Grand Chief John expressed his appreciation of the format of the 
interactive dialogue and noted the value of collaborative efforts to address the challenges 
faced by indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Proposals to be submitted to the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Chairperson-Rapporteur invited observers to share their recommendations 
regarding the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s proposals to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>76. Observers recommended that the Expert Mechanism conduct studies on, inter alia: 
access to justice; the militarization of indigenous peoples; indigenous peoples&#8217; tribal 
governance; the right to self-determination; climate change; best practices on women and 
economic development; and, as a follow-up, on indigenous peoples&#8217; permanent sovereignty 
over land and natural resources. 
</p>
<p><b>77. </b>Observers also recommended further interactive dialogues, further involvement of 
the Expert Mechanism in the preparatory process for the World Conference on Indigenous 
Peoples and engagement of the Expert Mechanism with the Working Group on the issue of 
human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> X. Adoption of the reports, studies and proposals 
</b></p>
<p>78. At the last meeting of its fifth session, the Expert Mechanism adopted its follow-up 
report on indigenous peoples and the right to participate in decision-making, with a focus 
on extractive industries; its study on the role of languages and culture in the promotion and 
protection of the rights and identity of indigenous peoples; and its report on the summary of 
responses from the questionnaire to seek the views of States on best practices regarding 
possible appropriate measures and implementation strategies in order to attain the goals of 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. All proposals set out 
in the fifth session report were adopted by consensus by the members of the Expert 
Mechanism.  </p>


<p>79. The members of the Expert Mechanism also adopted a provisional agenda for the 
sixth session of the Expert Mechanism (see annex II). </p>
