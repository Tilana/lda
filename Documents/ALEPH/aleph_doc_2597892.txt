Significant  information  relating  to  the  entity’s  financial  performance  and  financial 
position.
The  main  activities  of  the  Company  remain  focused  in  the  acquisition  of  the  entire  issued 
capital  of  Centre  Energy  Petroleum  Limited  (“CEP”)  which  would  on  completion  own  an 
economic interest in the Wailawi Oil & Gas Project in Indonesia.
On  or  about  23  September  2015,  the  Company  executed  a  Share  Purchase  Agreement  to 
acquire  100%  of  CEP.    The  agreement  is  subject  to  certain  conditions  precedent  including 
approval of shareholders at a general meeting and the Company’s compliance to chapters 1 
and 2 of the ASX listing rules to complete its business transition to the oil and gas resources 
(Energy) sector.
- 5 -
However, the continuing development of the proposed CEP acquisition was interrupted by a 
requisition for a general meeting by four shareholders of the Company holding more than five 
(5)  percent  of  the  ordinary  shares  of  the  Company  pursuant  to  Section  249D  of  the 
Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).  The proposed resolutions called for the removal of certain key 
person and directors of the Company.
Following  further  discussions  and  consultations  with  those 
interested  requisitioning 
shareholders,  the  terms  for  the  consideration  provided  for  the  acquisition  of  CEP  was 
amended  in  the  aggregate  of  $12.8  million  to  $5.0  million  on  7  December  2015.    In  the 
consideration, the Company shall issue shares to the shareholders of CEP calculated on the 
basis of AUD0.02 per existing EOR share.
On or about 30 July 2015, the Company issued 30,000,000 fully paid ordinary shares at $0.012 
per share having raised $300,000 from a sophisticated investor. At the 2015 Annual General 
Meeting,  shareholders  approved  the  conversion  of  all  outstanding  converting  notes  into 
28,250,001 fully paid ordinary shares of the Company.  The shares were issued on 2 December 
2015.
On or before 12 April 2016, the Company issued 28,000,000 new fully paid ordinary shares via 
a  placement  at  a  price  of  $0.005  per  share  to  sophisticated  investors,  raising  a  total  of 
$140,000.
Towards  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  the  Company  raised  a  further  $178,000  at  a 
placement price of $0.005 per share.  Consequently, 35,600,000 new fully paid ordinary shares 
in the Company were issued on or about 14 July 2016.
As part of a restructuring plan to reduce the overall debts, the Company secured a new funding 
arrangement  by  way  of  issue  of  Converting  Notes  to  a  syndicate  of  professional  and 
sophisticated  investors  to  raise  $400,000.    The  converting  notes  were  unsecured  and 
redeemable with a face value of $25,000 each converting into fully paid ordinary shares in the 
Company at $0.005 per  share and entitling the noteholder to be  issued two (2) free  share 
options for every three (3) shares issued on conversion of those notes.  The converting notes 
were issued on 18 July 2016.
It  was  also  resolved  on  or  about  21  July  2016  to  enter  into  a  Deed  of  Settlement  with 
“Consultant” creditors of the Company whereby 19,808,215 fully paid ordinary shares were 
issued (at $0.012 per share) in lieu of a portion of services fees owed to consultant creditors 
of the Company.  The issue of shares as a debt reduction plan would assist the Company in 
preserving its cash resource for application in other areas.
The Company will progress to issue a prospectus and re-listing the Company compliant to ASX 
chapters 1 and 2 of the listing rules.
The Company will undertake a public offering through the prospectus to raise a subscription 
amount of between $3.0 – $4.0 million.
The financial information provided in the Appendix 4E is based on the annual financial 
report, which has been prepared in accordance with Australian accounting standards.
