<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children 
</b></p>
<p>1. The following are the comments and clarification of the Government of Belize on 
the advanced draft of the report of the Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons, Joy 
Ngozi Ezeilo  regarding her mission to Belize which occurred December 12 to 16th , 2013 . 
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 6:   
</b></p>
<p>2. While &#8220;fichera&#8221; is more common among females of Hispanic descent, the 
commercial sexual exploitation of children is not limited to one ethnic group.   
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 10: </b> 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur was provided with information on the number of arrests 
made, interviews conducted, cases prosecuted and the disposition of the prosecuted cases   
for the period 2010-2012 in an email of 16 December 2014. The information was 
transmitted by email as this was the agreed mode of communication regarding supporting 
documentation following the mission.  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 27:</b> 
</p>
<p>4. Within the Belizean context national plans of action are not submitted to Parliament, 
but rather to Cabinet (the Executive). It is then the prerogative of the Executive whether the 
plans will be submitted to Parliament. The fact that since 2006 there has been a specific 
allocation in the national budget for human trafficking, which is separate and apart from 
allocations in the budgets of line Ministries which are used for this purpose underscores 
that the lack of Parliamentary approval does not endanger  budgetary allocations for the 
Plan.  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 30:  
</b></p>
<p>5. The Anti-trafficking in Persons Taskforce was not established by the 2003 Act, but 
rather by executive sanction.  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 35: </b> 
</p>
<p>6. There is a national referral system and it is outlined in the Standard Operating 
Procedures a copy of which was provided to the Special Rapporteur. Pages 15 and 16 of 
that document states:   
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;The general public, all non-governmental organizations, governmental 
departments and agencies, educational institutions, and the media must be 
sensitized about trafficking in persons.  They can all be excellent sources and 
resources for intelligence gathering, but importantly, they are front-line 
agencies which can be the eyes and ears of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons 
Council.They must know that if any of them encounters a situation that 
seems to have elements of trafficking, they can contact the nearest Police or 
the Human Services Departments.  For this purpose, the Police Department 
and the Human Services Department shall each appoint a district focal point.  
The names of these officers and their contact information shall be informed 
to all district officers.  All district officers must be informed that whenever a 
case that appears to have trafficking elements comes before them, they must 
immediately refer same to their district focal points.  The district focal points 
shall, in turn, immediately refer any suspected case of trafficking in persons </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.11 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>to the National focal point, who, for the purposes of the present Operating 
Procedures, shall be the Head of the National Crimes Investigation Branch 
(&#8220;Head CIB&#8221;). &#8220;    
</p>
<p>7. This is repeated in public service announcements as the general public is asked to 
contact either the Police or Department of Human Services in their area to report suspected 
cases. This message is likewise transmitted in community information sessions delivered by 
Youth Enhancement Services, one of the NGO members of the ATIP Council. NGOs 
working on related issues are involved in the victim identification and do make referrals to 
both the Police and Department of Human Services as underscored by the case study 
presented in Paragraph 38.  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 38:  
</b></p>
<p>8. Based on the information shared by the Special Rapporteur at the debriefing meeting 
at the end of her mission, both 17 year old girls were removed from the prison and 
repatriated. The protocols between Immigration  Department, the Department of Human 
Services and the Belize Central Prison for the transmission of information on 
unaccompanied minors were reviewed and strengthened. The placement of these children in 
the prison for immigration violations was contrary to existing protocols.  In 2013 for 
instance the Department of Human Services provided protective services for 28 
unaccompanied minors referred by the Immigration Department. This breach has been 
documented. 
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 39:  
</b></p>
<p>9. The Standard Operating Procedures have been developed for all government 
stakeholders involved in human trafficking matters so the above identification and referral 
protocols apply to the Immigration Department. In 2012 the ATIP Council completed the 
training of 100% of immigration and labour officers in their roles and responsibilities in the 
identification and referral of suspected human trafficking victims. Another round of 
training on the new law and a refresher on roles and responsibilities will commence in 
August 2014.  
</p>
<p>10. Regarding the presence of social workers during screening of victims, social 
workers always collaborate with Police on rescue operations as these are planned by the 
Operations Subcommittee, which is chaired by Human Services. These rescue operations 
usually includes multiple interviews being conducted by a number of police officers and 
Social workers are there interviews. The screening and interviews with persons who are 
referred otherwise is done by one police officer, as has been acknowledged by this Report. 
Social Workers are always present at these interviews.  
</p>
<p>11. A distinction needs to be made between rescue operations conducted by the ATIPS 
and other operations conducted by immigration and labour. Indeed social workers are not 
present on those operations hence the reason labour and immigration officers have been 
trained on identification of potential victims and the referral process as outlined in the SOP. 
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 43:  
</b></p>
<p>12. The assistance to victims provided is NOT conditional.  It is the overall policy of the 
Ministry of Human Development to provide protection services to all victims of violence, 
irrespective of their immigration status and nationality.  In the case of human trafficking 
victims, it is a also a legal responsibility.  Services are provided to both victims and 
suspected victims. Suspected victims are placed in care until, a determination of their case 
is made and provided with the same services, including special immigration permits .  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.11 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>13. It is unclear how the conclusion that individual assessment and case management is 
not occurring has been drawn. There is case management for victims and treatment plans 
are developed according to their individualised needs. Case management and treatment 
planning is the core of the work done by the Department of Human Services for all victims 
of violence , not only human trafficking victims. 
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 44: 
</b></p>
<p>14. Clarification is sought on what evidence is being used to characterise the victim 
assistance system as &#8220;extremely ad-hoc and weak.&#8221;  There is case management for victims 
and treatment plans are developed according to their individualised needs. The system does 
not conform to those in other countries but it is what is realistic within in the Belizean 
context. The small number of victims does not make one stop shelters staffed with medical 
professionals, psychologists, lawyers and the like feasible. Also, as noted in paragraph 45, 
having one centralised shelter poses risks for victims in a small country with a population 
of less than half a million people. Housing for adult victims is provided in a number of 
ways according to the risk level and needs of the victim, including shelters, rented houses 
for independent or semi- independent living for adult victims, placements with families, 
Children are cared for within the framework of the child abuse protection system and 
placed within the substitute care system.    
</p>
<p>15. The 2013 US State Department Global Trafficking in Persons Report states:   
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;The Belizean government sustained its efforts to protect trafficking victims 
during the reporting period.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;The government provided  victim care and assistance through placements in 
safe houses including shelters in the Cayo and Belize districts, or with 
families around the country. There were no reports that victims were detained 
involuntarily in these shelters. The government placed child victims in foster 
care or with relatives.&#8221; (p.95) 
</p>
<p>16. The fact that since 2008, 16 victims, who represent the majority of victims, remain 
in care for an average of 2 years is a demonstration that there is a level of care within the 
victim assistance system. Victims have the option of being repatriated, they are aware of 
this option and some have chosen this option. There are some who chose to remain in the 
country even after their case is completed and they are assisted in making the transition. 
There are 3 Nepali and 2 Indian nationals, who have been assisted in making this transition 
and are now working on their citizenship.    
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 44:  
</b></p>
<p>17. There is only one civil society organisation that provides adult victim services and 
the government collaborates with that organisation as the Report notes in paragraph 46. 
There is collaboration with civil society organisations that manage care facilities for child 
victims of violence. Civil society organisations just do not have sufficient capacity to 
establish shelters. The history of residential care facilities for children and domestic 
violence shelters managed by civil society is that despite assistance from the Government 
they still struggle. They would need to be fully funded by government to survive. Given the 
need to provide a range of placement/housing options for victims due to the issues already 
raised, Government would be hard pressed to fund shelters at the levels that would be 
required by civil society.   
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 46:  
</b></p>
<p>18. The agreement between Help for Progress and Government of Belize when human 
trafficking victims are placed includes resources being provided for the recurrent costs of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.11 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>running the shelter which is separate and apart from the stipends provided to the adult 
victims themselves. These victims are also assigned a social worker who provides case 
management  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraphs 50 and 51:  
</b></p>
<p>19. The following points of clarification are made with regards to the case study 
discussed in these two paragraphs:  
</p>
<p>(a) Counselling services were provided for this victim at the institution where 
she was initially placed and later in the foster home when it was clear that she still 
continued to struggle to deal with the traumatic effects of her experience. It has 
been difficult to provide this victim with these services because after giving her 
initial statement to the Police, she has not wanted to speak of her experience to 
anyone, except her foster mother who has been instrumental in getting her to 
accept these services. The fact that she was willing to speak to the Special 
Rapporteur is actually seen as a very positive sign of the progress she has made 
and she was encouraged to do so as a part of her psychological rehabilitation.  
</p>
<p>(b) Regarding the matter of her expressing having suicidal thoughts two years 
after being rescued, rehabilitation from traumatic events is a very individual 
experience and cannot be time lined. The healing process and the time the process 
takes for each individual is different irrespective of the quality of psychological 
care received.  
</p>
<p>(c) There are no formal English as a second language classes available, except at 
University level. The hiring of a private tutor to provide language classes to the 
victim is the only viable option to assist her with language acquisition.  
</p>
<p>(d) The victim was fearful of leaving the confines of her foster family&#8217;s home to 
attend any sort of training, language issues not withstanding.  
</p>
<p>(e) The victim was removed from the institution and placed in foster care 
because based on her assessment, it was determined that such a placement would 
better meet her needs as she was extremely fearful, distrusting and not adjusting 
well to the institution.  Although the foster family was not trained in specifically 
caring for human trafficking victims, they were chosen because of their record of 
success with traumatised and special needs children.   
</p>
<p>(f) Regarding the efforts to acquire a passport for the victim. Two formal, 
written requests have been made, but there has been a series of communications 
with the consulate of the country to follow up.  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 68:  
</b></p>
<p>20. The ATIP Council has an on going national, multilingual, (English, Spanish, Hindi, 
and Mandarin), multimedia public information and education campaign on human 
trafficking that includes radio and TV public service announcements. There are also anti 
trafficking posters at all border points and billboards nationally whose maintenance are paid 
for by the ATIPS Council. Please also note that the efforts of the Special Envoy are 
conducted in collaboration with the ATIPS Council and the Belize Tourism Board is a part 
of the ATIPS Council so its public awareness efforts occur within the rubric of the 
Council&#8217;s plan. The posters produced by IOM were not widely distributed at the time of the 
mission as they were developed in the middle of 2013 and where therefore earmarked to be 
used on continuing public awareness work of the Council in 2014.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.11 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraphs 55 and 56:  
</b></p>
<p>21. The ATIPS Committee, now Council has been working with embassies and 
consulates on the repatriation of victims, suspected victims of trafficking and 
unaccompanied minors  even prior to the 2013 legislation to ensure the repatriation of 
persons. Since 2008 77 persons have been repatriated through the cooperation of embassies, 
consulates and other government officials in countries of origin. This number includes 60 
Nepali nationals that were a part of a case of labour exploitation by a Chinese company. 
Five persons involved in the case opted to remain in Belize and assist with the prosecution 
of the case.  
</p>
<p>22. In view of the above comments, it is respectfully recommended that the related 
recommendations  be reviewed.
