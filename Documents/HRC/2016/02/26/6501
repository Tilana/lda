</b></p>
<p><b>6/1.  Protection of cultural rights and property in situations of armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the purposes, principles and provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided also</i> by the principles relating to economic, social and cultural rights enshrined in 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (A/CONF.157/23), the 
2005 World Summit Outcome (General Assembly resolution 60/1 of 16 September 2005) and 
Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 that established the Human Rights Council all 
affirm that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and mutually reinforcing 
and must be treated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>that the General Assembly acknowledged in its resolution 60/251 that peace 
and security, development and human rights are the pillars of the United Nations system and the 
foundations for the collective security and well-being, and recognized that development, peace 
and security and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> that human rights law and international humanitarian law are 
complementary and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p> <i>Gravely concerned</i> about serious violations of international humanitarian law and human 
rights law during armed conflicts, in all parts of the world, and their detrimental impact on 
cultural rights and property, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed 
Conflict and its Protocols, and stressing the importance of their implementation to protect 
cultural property, </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/L.11 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>that the destruction of or any other form of damage to cultural property may 
impair the enjoyment of cultural rights, in particular of article 15 of the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to respect human rights law and strongly urges all parties to an

requested by the concerned States; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all 
Governments, the competent United Nations bodies, the specialized agencies, regional

<p><b>6/2.  Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> all previous resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the 
Commission on Human Rights on the issue of the right to food, including General Assembly 
resolution 61/163 of 19 December 2006 and Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/18 
of 14 April 2005, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006,

<p> <i>Recalling</i> the resolutions 5/1 &#8220;Institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights 
Council&#8221; and 5/2 &#8220;Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of the Human 
Rights Council&#8221; of 18 June 2007 and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge his/her 
duties in accordance with these resolutions and their annexes,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also </i>commitments taken by the international community to fully implement the 
Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the problems of hunger and food insecurity have global dimensions and 
that they are likely to persist and even increase dramatically in some regions of the world unless 
urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the valuable work and commitment of Mr. Jean Ziegler during his tenure 
as the first mandate-holder to achieving the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food for a 
period of three years: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To promote the full realization of the right to food and the adoption of measures at 
the national, regional and international levels for the realization of the right of everyone to 
adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully 
to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities; </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/L.11 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To examine ways and means of overcoming existing and emerging obstacles to the 
realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To continue mainstreaming a gender perspective and taking into account an age 
dimension in the fulfilment of the mandate, considering that women and children are 
disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To submit proposals that could help the realization of Millennium Development Goal 
No. 1 to halve by the year 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, as well as to 
realize the right to food, in particular, taking into account the role of international assistance and 
cooperation in reinforcing national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To present recommendations on possible steps with a view to achieving 
progressively the full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the conditions 
for everyone to be free from hunger and as soon as possible enjoy fully the right to food, taking 
into account lessons learnt in the implementation of national plans to combat hunger; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To work in close cooperation with all States, intergovernmental and 
non-governmental organizations, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as 
well as with other relevant actors representing the broadest possible range of interests and 
experiences, within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the 
effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different 
fields; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To continue participating in and contributing to relevant international conferences 
and events with the aim of promoting the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon</i> all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in 
his/her task, to supply all necessary information requested by him/her and to give serious 
consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the Special Rapporteur to visit their 
countries, to enable him/her to fulfil his/her mandate effectively; </p>

<p> A/HRC/6/L.11 
 page 9

Council in 2008 a comprehensive final report on his findings, conclusions and recommendations, 
after more than six years as mandate-holder on the right to food;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of 
the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the 
General Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 
November 2004 represent a practical tool to promote the realization of the right to food for all, 
contribute to the achievement of food security and thus provide an additional instrument in the 
attainment of internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the 
Millennium Declaration; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to submit a report on the implementation of the 
present resolution to the General Assembly at its sixty-third session and to the Council in 2008,

<p>mandate, inter alia through the submission of comments and suggestions on ways and means of 
realizing the right to food;

<p><b>6/3.  Human rights and international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p><i> The</i> <i>Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/55 of 20 April 2005, and taking 
note of the report presented to the Council by the independent expert on human rights and 
international solidarity (A/HRC/4/8), 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> the resolutions 5/1 &#8220;Institution-building of the United Nations Human 
Rights Council&#8221; and 5/2 &#8220;Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of the 
Human Rights Council&#8221; of 18 June 2007 and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge 
his/her duties in accordance with these resolutions and their annexes,  
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> that the processes of promoting and protecting human rights should be 
conducted in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations 
and international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the importance, in the view to the promotion and protection of international 
solidarity, of the declarations and programmes of action of international conferences such as the 
World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna in 1993, the International Conference on 
Financing for Development held in Monterrey in 2002, the United Nations Conference on 
Environment and Development held in Rio in 1992, the World Summit on Sustainable 
Development held in Johannesburg in 2002, and the World Conference on Disaster Reduction 
held in Kobe in 2005, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note with appreciation </i>of the initiatives of the International Action against Hunger 
and Poverty, particularly in the field of innovative financial mechanisms,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that at the World Conference on Human Rights States pledged to cooperate with 
each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development, and stressed that 
the international community should promote effective international cooperation for the 
realization of the right to development and the elimination of obstacles to development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that article 4 of the Declaration on the Right to Development states that 
sustained action is required to promote more rapid development of developing countries and, as a </p>

<p> A/HRC/6/L.11 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p>complement to the efforts of developing countries, effective international cooperation is essential 
in providing these countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive 
development, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking into account</i> that article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights states that each State party to the Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually 
and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the 
maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of 
the rights recognized in the Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the 
adoption of legislative measures, 
</p>
<p><i> Persuaded</i> that sustainable development can be promoted by peaceful coexistence, friendly 
relations and cooperation among States with different social, economic or political systems,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that the widening gap between the economically developed and developing 
countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human rights in the international 
community, and makes it all the more imperative for every nation, according to its capacities, 
to make the maximum possible effort to close this gap,  
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing concern</i> at the fact that the immense benefits resulting from the process of 
globalization and economic interdependence have not reached all countries, communities and 
individuals, and at the increasing marginalization from their benefits of several countries, 
particularly the least developed and the African countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its deep concern</i> at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and 
agricultural pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in a massive 
loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and environmental consequences for 
vulnerable societies throughout the world, in particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the crucial importance of increasing the resources allocated for 
official development assistance, and recalling the pledge of the industrialized countries to 
allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance, and 
recognizing the need for new and additional resources to finance the development programmes 
of developing countries, </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/L.11 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p><i> Determined</i> to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international community 
with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights endeavours by an increased and 
sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i> Asserting</i> the necessity for establishing new, equitable and global links of partnership and 
intra-generational solidarity, and for promoting intergenerational solidarity for the perpetuation 
of humankind, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity as a vital 
component of the efforts of developing countries towards the realization of the right to 
development of their peoples and the promotion of the full enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights by everyone has been insufficient, 
</p>
<p><i> Resolved</i> to strive to ensure that the present generations are fully aware of their 
responsibilities towards future generations, and that a better world is possible for the present and 
future generations, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the recognition set forth in the declaration adopted by the Heads of State 
and Government at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations of the fundamental value of 
solidarity to international relations in the twenty-first century, in stating that global challenges 
must be managed in a way that distributes costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with basic 
principles of equity and social justice, and that those who suffer, or who benefit least, deserve 
help from those who benefit most; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses its determination</i> to contribute towards the solution of current world 
problems through increased international cooperation, to create such conditions as will ensure 
that the needs and interests of future generations are not jeopardized by the burden of the past, 
and to hand on a better world to future generations; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> the international community to consider urgently concrete measures to 
promote and consolidate international assistance to developing countries in their endeavours for 
development and for the promotion of conditions that make possible the full realization of all 
human rights; </p>

<p> A/HRC/6/L.11 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Recognizes</i> that the so-called &#8220;third-generation rights&#8221; closely interrelated to the 
fundamental value of solidarity need further progressive development within the United Nations 
human rights machinery in order to be able to respond to the increasing challenges of 
international cooperation in this field;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests </i>all States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations to mainstream the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity in their activities;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Decides</i>, taking into account the urgent need to further develop guidelines, standards, 
norms and principles with a view to promoting and protecting the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity, to request the independent expert on human rights and 
international solidarity to continue discharging his mandate, subject to the review of this 
mandate that will be accomplished by the Council in the near future; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> the independent expert to continue his work in the preparation of a draft 
declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity and to submit a 
report on the implementation of the present resolution at its ninth session (to be held in 
September 2008), unless otherwise decided by the Council; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Also requests</i> the independent expert to take into account the outcomes of all major 
United Nations and other global summits and ministerial meetings in the economic and social 
fields and to seek views and contributions from Governments, United Nations agencies, other 
relevant international organizations and non-governmental organizations in the discharge of 
his/her mandate;

agenda item.

<p><i> Recalling</i> the Final Document of the Fourteenth Conference of Heads of State or 
Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in September 2006 in Havana, in which they 
agreed to oppose and condemn these measures or laws and their continued application, persevere

General Assembly and other United Nations organs, and to request States applying these 
measures or laws to revoke them fully and immediately, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also</i> that the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna from 14 to 
25 June 1993, called upon States to refrain from any unilateral measure not in accordance with

</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> that, despite the resolutions adopted on this issue by the 
General Assembly, the former Commission on Human Rights and United Nations conferences 
held in the 1990s and their five-year reviews, and contrary to norms of international law and the 
Charter of the United Nations, unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated, 
implemented and enforced, inter alia through resorting to war and militarism, with all their 
negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social 
development of developing countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby creating 
additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under

<p> 1. <i>Urges</i> all States to stop adopting or implementing unilateral coercive measures not in 
accordance with international law, international humanitarian law, the Charter of the 
United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations among States, in 
particular those of a coercive nature with extraterritorial effects, which create obstacles to trade 
relations among States, thus impeding the full realization of the rights set forth in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments, in particular the 
right of individuals and peoples to development; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Strongly objects</i> to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, in addition, 
threaten the sovereignty of States and, in this context, calls upon all Member States neither to 
recognize these measures nor apply them, as well as to take effective administrative or legislative 
measures, as appropriate, to counteract the extraterritorial application or effects of unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Condemns</i> the continued unilateral application and enforcement by certain Powers of 
such measures as tools of political or economic pressure against any country, particularly against 
</p>
<p>developing countries, with a view to preventing these countries from exercising their right to 
decide, of their own free will, their own political, economic and social systems; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reiterates its call</i> upon Member States that have initiated such measures to abide by 
the principles of international law, the Charter of the United Nations, the declarations of the

their obligations and responsibilities arising from the international human rights instruments to 
which they are parties by putting an immediate end to such measures;

resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, in particular article 32, no State may use or 
encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in 
order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from 
it advantages of any kind;

<p> 7. <i>Reaffirms</i> that essential goods such as food and medicines should not be used as tools 
for political coercion and that under no circumstances should people be deprived of their own 
means of subsistence and development; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Underlines</i> that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major obstacles to the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and, in this regard, calls upon all 
States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive measures and the extraterritorial 
application of domestic laws which run counter to the principles of free trade and hamper the 
development of developing countries, as recognized by the Intergovernmental Group of Experts 
on the Right to Development in its report on its second session (E/CN.4/1998/29); 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Rejects</i> all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, as well as the
