<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. During its twenty-sixth session, the Human Rights Council held its annual full 
</p>
<p>day of discussion on women&#8217;s human rights in accordance with its resolution 6/30. 
</p>
<p>The full-day discussion took place on 17 June 2014. The discussions were divided 
</p>
<p>into two panels. The first panel addressed the impact of gender stereotypes and 
</p>
<p>gender stereotyping on the recognition, exercise and enjoyment of women&#8217;s human 
</p>
<p>rights. The second panel focused on the intersections between realizing women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights and achieving sustainable development. 
</p>
<p>2. The present summary report sets out the main issues raised during the 
</p>
<p>discussions including the conclusions and recommendations. As the two panels were 
</p>
<p>separate but addressed related issues, the report presents the discussions under the 
</p>
<p>two separate themes. 
</p>
<p>3. The summary report on the discussions was prepared by the Office of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights at the request of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Panel I </b>&#8212;<b> The impact of gender stereotypes on the 
recognition and enjoyment of w</b>omen&#8217;s <b>human rights 
</b></p>
<p>4. The panel on the impact of gender stereotypes on the recognition and 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of women&#8217;s human rights was moderated by Todd Minerson, Executive 
</p>
<p>Director, White Ribbon Campaign, and composed of Dubravka Simonovic, Member 
</p>
<p>of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Simone 
</p>
<p>Cusack, Lawyer, Veronica Undurraga, Law Professor, Adolfo Ib&#225;&#241;ez University, and 
</p>
<p>Yetnebersh Nigussi, Executive Director, Ethiopian Centre for Disability and 
</p>
<p>Development. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Panel summary 
</b></p>
<p>5. In her opening statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights stressed that the issue of gender stereotypes and its impact on women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>human rights was of fundamental importance to every society. The High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner said that in the past few decades, almost every State had 
</p>
<p>acknowledged women&#8217;s equality &#8212; in principle. Yet it was rarely fully realized. One 
</p>
<p>problem was the lack of real commitment from decision makers, but another obstacle 
</p>
<p>stemmed from deep-seated gender stereotypes about women&#8217;s supposedly proper 
</p>
<p>attributes, characteristics or place in the family and society. Women continued to be 
</p>
<p>treated as dependants or minors by many justice systems, formal and informal, and 
</p>
<p>according to the World Bank at least nine countries still had laws requiring women to 
</p>
<p>obey their husbands, and many countries still conditioned women&#8217;s access to health 
</p>
<p>services on the authorization from a husband, father or brother. Even when the law 
</p>
<p>itself was free of overt discrimination, gender stereotypes created tremendous 
</p>
<p>obstacles to women&#8217;s pursuit of justice, particularly in cases of gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence, marriage and family, economic opportunities and women and adolescent 
</p>
<p>girls&#8217; sexual and reproductive health. She recalled human rights obligations to 
</p>
<p>eliminate harmful stereotypes and called on States to implement those obligations.  
</p>
<p>6. Ms. Simonovic spoke about the importance of the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and outlined some of its </p>


<p>key provisions related to stereotyping. The issue of stereotyping could be analysed 
</p>
<p>under multiple articles of the Convention, including those addressing the elimination 
</p>
<p>of all forms of discrimination (art. 2), the obligation to modify gender stereotypes 
</p>
<p>(art. 5), and the elimination of stereotypes in education (art. 10). She added that the 
</p>
<p>Convention should be used as a comprehensive, legally binding instrument for the 
</p>
<p>modification of sex and gender-based stereotypes that constituted discrimination 
</p>
<p>against women.  
</p>
<p>7. Ms. Cusack shared her research on how judicial stereotyping undermined 
</p>
<p>justice for women, explaining that judicial stereotyping posed a substantial barrier to 
</p>
<p>justice for women, particularly for victims of gender-based violence. She referred to 
</p>
<p>the several ways in which judicial stereotyping resulted in miscarriages of justice. 
</p>
<p>First, it undermined justice by compromising impartiality. I t also influenced judges&#8217; 
</p>
<p>understanding of the nature of criminal offences and their perception of whether 
</p>
<p>violence had or had not occurred. Stereotyping could further affect judges&#8217; view 
</p>
<p>about the credibility of witnesses, as well as prevent judges from holding 
</p>
<p>perpetrators accountable or even blame the victims for the attack experienced. Th at 
</p>
<p>harm was continuing to play out and judicial stereotyping was an issue that had to be 
</p>
<p>addressed if women were to achieve substantive equality.  
</p>
<p>8. Ms. Undurraga said that girls were stereotyped and treated as if they were not 
</p>
<p>(or should not be) interested in sex, so health systems d id not respond to the needs of 
</p>
<p>girls according to their evolving capacities for autonomous behavio ur. Girls became 
</p>
<p>exposed to coercion, pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. Other 
</p>
<p>stereotypes included the notion that women were not able to take important decisions 
</p>
<p>and needed the protection of their husbands or doctors, resulting in women being 
</p>
<p>denied decision-making autonomy regarding contraception or abortion. The idea that 
</p>
<p>women should always be available for their husbands denied them the right to decide 
</p>
<p>when to engage in intercourse and made it difficult for women to win marital rape 
</p>
<p>cases in courts. Stereotypes that women should sacrifice themselves for their 
</p>
<p>children have provided the excuse to delay medical treatment to women when such 
</p>
<p>treatment could affect the foetus. Stereotypes that grounded women&#8217;s value on their 
</p>
<p>fertility or capacity to perform domestic work, sustained practices such as forced 
</p>
<p>marriage, sexual exploitation and domestic slavery.  
</p>
<p>9. Ms. Nigussie, addressing the situation of women with disabilities, reiterated 
</p>
<p>that in many cases women were expected to be beautiful, fertile and dedicated to 
</p>
<p>household work, and women with disabilities were regarded as lacking those 
</p>
<p>attributes. She provided several examples of compounded stereotypes and their 
</p>
<p>impact on women with disabilities, for instance, in certain places, if a sister of a 
</p>
<p>woman with disability married, the woman with disability was also &#8220;given&#8221; to the 
</p>
<p>husband. In another example, she said that in some communities, HIV-infected men 
</p>
<p>targeted disabled women in the belief that their purity would cure them of HIV. She 
</p>
<p>also pointed to the impact of stereotypes in access to justice, explaining that justice 
</p>
<p>systems did not consider women with disabilities, including victims of violence, as 
</p>
<p>reliable witnesses, hindering the ability of those women to claim justice. She called 
</p>
<p>for enhanced efforts to effectively respond to the needs of women with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>10. Mr. Minerson, as the moderator, drew attention to the role of stereotypes in 
</p>
<p>perpetuating certain conceptions of masculinity, and the impact that had had on 
</p>
<p>eliminating violence against women. He explained that his organiza tion was 
</p>
<p>interested in the narrative surrounding masculinity and the way men dealt with 
</p>
<p>violence, and also in breaking stereotypes of men as violent, aggressive, in control of 
</p>
<p>money, not nurturing and loving. He stressed that it was important to change the </p>


<p>stereotypes of men and boys in order to create stronger allies for women and for 
</p>
<p>women and girls&#8217; equality. 
</p>
<p>11. In the discussion that followed, speakers noted that progress had been made 
</p>
<p>towards ensuring gender equality but many challenges remained on the path to true 
</p>
<p>equality. Challenging gender stereotypes was the first step to combating 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women. Several speakers expressed concern that gender 
</p>
<p>stereotyping presented obstacles to achieving gender equality, ensuring women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights, including their sexual and reproductive rights and the right to be free from 
</p>
<p>violence. Some noted that gender stereotypes relegated women to a secondary 
</p>
<p>position to men not only at home but also at work, where women performing the 
</p>
<p>same tasks as men were often paid significantly less than men. 
</p>
<p>12. It was agreed that stereotypes were subtle and difficult to detect, often acting 
</p>
<p>on the subconscious. The phenomenon had been amplified by new information and 
</p>
<p>communication technologies, which could however also contribute to combating 
</p>
<p>prejudice. Several speakers noted that education was one of the effective ways of 
</p>
<p>combating harmful stereotypes. 
</p>
<p>13. Several States emphasized that because of their detrimental impact on society, 
</p>
<p>gender stereotypes needed to be addressed at different levels and by different actors. 
</p>
<p>In that regard, laws against discrimination and violence were crucial. Gender 
</p>
<p>mainstreaming was key and measures must be taken to organize and evaluate policy 
</p>
<p>processes to ensure that gender perspectives were included in a ll stages. In addition, 
</p>
<p>public policies must ensure the neutrality of public institutions and promote a gender 
</p>
<p>balance in areas such as education, where important disparities remained , as well as 
</p>
<p>in economic and political life. It was acknowledged that governments alone and the 
</p>
<p>implementation of public policies did not sufficiently address issues of gender 
</p>
<p>inequality. Family and community leaders also had an important role to play in 
</p>
<p>eliminating prejudices in the community. The most commonly called upon too l for 
</p>
<p>combating gender stereotypes was the use of the mass media to broadcast awareness-
</p>
<p>raising campaigns. At the same time, there was an appeal for the media to be held 
</p>
<p>accountable for messaging that contributed to the unequal gender narrative. 
</p>
<p>Challenging gender stereotypes was the first step to combating discrimination 
</p>
<p>against women and improving women&#8217;s well-being.  
</p>
<p>14. It was agreed that the post-2015 framework must be based on human rights 
</p>
<p>and all goals must be gender-mainstreamed.  
</p>
<p>15. Responding to some of the questions, panellists reiterated that stereotypes 
</p>
<p>diminished the potential of all individuals, infantilized women, made them 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to violence, and affected their self-esteem. It was noted that the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and 
</p>
<p>other treaties, such as the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</p>
<p>provided guidance to States on eliminating gender stereotypes. Recommendations 
</p>
<p>coming from the human rights treaty bodies in the area of stereotypes required 
</p>
<p>concerted action by several actors, including, inter alia, relevant government 
</p>
<p>ministries, parliament, the educational systems, and civil society organizations. The 
</p>
<p>role of special procedures was also emphasized.  
</p>
<p>16. Panellists recommended that States take into consideration the diverse 
</p>
<p>concerns and needs of all women, including women with disabilities, and for a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive and inclusive approach to addressing gender stereotyping in all 
</p>
<p>sectors of society, including in education, employment, marriage and family life. The 
</p>
<p>role of both regional and international mechanisms to ensure accountability was 
</p>
<p>further highlighted.  </p>


<p><b> III. Panel II </b>&#8212;<b> </b>Women&#8217;s <b>human rights and the sustainable 
development agenda 
</b></p>
<p>17. The panel was composed of Saraswathi Menon, Director, Policy Division at 
</p>
<p>UN Women; Frances Raday, Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on the issue of 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women in law and in practice; Gita Sen, Professor of Public 
</p>
<p>Policy, Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore and Adjunct Professor of Global 
</p>
<p>Health and Population, Harvard School of Public Health; Luisa Cabal, Vice-
</p>
<p>President of Programs, Center for Reproductive Rights, New York; and Kingsley 
</p>
<p>Kariuki, Kenya Federation of Slum Dwellers. The panel was moderated by Sarah 
</p>
<p>Cook, Director, United Nations Research Institute for Social Development . 
</p>
<p><b> A. Panel summary  
</b></p>
<p>18. In her opening statement, the Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>recalled that although the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) had made 
</p>
<p>progress in sectors such as education and poverty reduction, the hidden reality of 
</p>
<p>growing inequality, particularly for women, had not been adequately addressed. The 
</p>
<p>new framework was an opportunity to embrace a more human rights -based agenda. 
</p>
<p>The Deputy High Commissioner highlighted the need to ensure women&#8217;s economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights, citing examples of land and sexual and reproductive health 
</p>
<p>rights. Furthermore, she noted that one of the most glaring omissions of the MDGs 
</p>
<p>was the failure to address violence against women and girls, despite the fact that that 
</p>
<p>was a reality for many women and girls, and not only in conflict situations. She 
</p>
<p>emphasized that the post-2015 agenda must establish a strong accountability 
</p>
<p>mechanism to hold governments accountable for reaching the goals, identifying clear 
</p>
<p>responsibilities to ensure that all actors, including private actors, were held to 
</p>
<p>account, that institutions were answerable and that commitments were enforceable.  
</p>
<p>19. Ms. Menon focused her remarks on efforts made by UN Women in the 
</p>
<p>discussions relating to the post-2015 development agenda. She reported that UN 
</p>
<p>Women was advocating sustainable development goals that were based on human 
</p>
<p>rights, gender equality and sustainability and which recognized multiple and 
</p>
<p>intersecting forms of discrimination. She called for a stand-alone goal on gender 
</p>
<p>equality, which included explicit attention to women&#8217;s human rights. She also 
</p>
<p>outlined the targets which UN Women was advocating, namely on discrimination 
</p>
<p>against women, violence against women, sexual and reproductive health and rights, 
</p>
<p>unpaid care and domestic work, property and land rights, and participation. She 
</p>
<p>further emphasized the need to mainstream gender concerns across the entire 
</p>
<p>framework. She expressed concern about the fact that unpaid care work and sexual 
</p>
<p>and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) continued to be contested. She 
</p>
<p>emphasized with regard to unpaid care work that it was the fundamental basis for 
</p>
<p>sustaining societies, communities and households. With regard to SRHR, she said 
</p>
<p>that population planning and interventions must not undermine women&#8217;s rights or 
</p>
<p>bodily integrity.  
</p>
<p>20. Ms. Raday referred to the recent report of the Working Group on the issue of 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women in law and in practice which focused on 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women in economic and social life. She reaffirmed the 
</p>
<p>importance of a post-2015 framework that recognized women&#8217;s unpaid care work 
</p>
<p>and that structural barriers to women&#8217;s economic opportunities, which existed as a 
</p>
<p>result of women&#8217;s reproductive function and caring roles, should be dismantled. She 
</p>
<p>called for unpaid care work to be integrated into macroeconomic policies, such as </p>


<p>tax policy, and to ensure a robust social protection floor. She also noted that the 
</p>
<p>gender gap in women&#8217;s participation in decision-making in the economic sphere 
</p>
<p>needed to be addressed. Ms. Raday called for a goal on women&#8217;s economic 
</p>
<p>leadership in the post-2015 framework and for gender-sensitive analysis of corporate 
</p>
<p>responsibility that identified, prevented and remedied the harm caused by corporate 
</p>
<p>activities to women, as workers, consumers and community members, especially 
</p>
<p>with regard to export processing zones, sweatshops, garment industries, land 
</p>
<p>dispossession by extractive biofuels, agribusiness and real estate progress, in all  of 
</p>
<p>which most of the victims were women. She further drew attention to discrimination 
</p>
<p>against women in formal employment and the need to address women&#8217;s exploitation 
</p>
<p>in informal labour and the alleviation of greater poverty of older women, a reflection 
</p>
<p>of their lifetime of lesser economic opportunities. Finally, she recommended a 
</p>
<p>gender-sensitive analysis of austerity measures.  
</p>
<p>21. Ms. Sen noted that the challenges of the post-2015 framework were in the 
</p>
<p>details. She recalled some of the shortcomings of MDG 3, including narrow 
</p>
<p>indicators for reaching the broad goal of gender equality. She warned that the current 
</p>
<p>discussions on that subject were also facing some of the same gaps and omissions. In 
</p>
<p>particular, while some human rights aspects and emphasis were implicit in the goals, 
</p>
<p>they were not explicit, and were incomplete as well as inconsistent. She also noted 
</p>
<p>that there was non-recognition of the indivisibility and interdependence of human 
</p>
<p>rights. She offered the example of Goal 1, which included secure rights to own land, 
</p>
<p>but questioned whether that was about equal rights or the right to equal land. In 
</p>
<p>addition, the current discussions had not paid sufficient attention to adolescent girls 
</p>
<p>specifically on the intersection between education and violence against women. She 
</p>
<p>noted that the implementation of the goals also depended on whether sufficient funds 
</p>
<p>would be allocated.  
</p>
<p>22. Ms. Cabal began by emphasizing that at the core of SRHR were the most 
</p>
<p>intimate decisions in any individual&#8217;s life &#8212; related to their bodies, their identities, 
</p>
<p>their relationships, marriage, and if and when to have children. She highlighted some 
</p>
<p>of the worrying statistics surrounding maternal health, unsafe abortion, child 
</p>
<p>marriage, unmet need for contraception and HIV. She noted that ensuring  SRHR was 
</p>
<p>an end in itself, but also a precondition for the well -being of individuals and 
</p>
<p>resilience of communities. As such, she pointed out that SRHR were priorities in 
</p>
<p>their own right. She referred to three fundamental pillars of SRHR, namely, bodily 
</p>
<p>integrity and autonomy, access to information and services, and non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p>She also emphasized that ensuring SRHR was essential for gender equality. If 
</p>
<p>women and girls could not enjoy their SRHR, their ability to claim other rights, 
</p>
<p>including education and participation, was undermined. When women were 
</p>
<p>empowered to make decisions about their bodies, they were able to make decisions 
</p>
<p>about their lives more broadly. She further emphasized that ensuring SRHR was 
</p>
<p>critical for sustainable development more generally.  
</p>
<p>23. Mr. Kariuki stressed the need to build inclusive and safe human settlements. 
</p>
<p>He drew attention to the lack of basic services, in particular water and sanitation, in 
</p>
<p>informal settlements. He noted that for women, access to sanitation in informal  
</p>
<p>settlements was a particularly insecure experience and that that insecurity meant that 
</p>
<p>in many instances, women were forced to delay the use of sanitation facilities to the 
</p>
<p>times they considered to be most safe, a situation that exposed them to urinary tr act 
</p>
<p>infections and other serious health issues. That, in turn, had an impact on the 
</p>
<p>financial resources available to women because they had to use the little money they 
</p>
<p>had for medical treatment. He expressed concern about girls missing over a month of 
</p>
<p>the school year due to menstruation and lack of sanitation facilities and the impact 
</p>
<p>that that had on their right to education. Young girls did not often go to school during </p>


<p>their periods for lack of sanitary pads as well as fear of using toilets and sanitati on 
</p>
<p>facilities because they were unsafe and lacked water. He noted it was important to 
</p>
<p>understand that the existence of slums was being exploited by cartels who profited 
</p>
<p>from the higher prices charged for water, sanitation, rents (per square metre) and the 
</p>
<p>fact that some politicians used slums as lucrative vote banks during elections. They 
</p>
<p>would therefore not promote any slum improvement initiative that would reduce 
</p>
<p>their number of votes if the informal settlements were decongested during 
</p>
<p>improvement. That situation required urgent attention.  
</p>
<p>24. During the discussion, there was a consensus that the post-2015 development 
</p>
<p>strategy must build on the gaps and lessons of the MDGs and around the inclusion of 
</p>
<p>gender equality as a stand-alone goal in the new development agenda. States 
</p>
<p>acknowledged the importance of continuing their efforts to mainstream gender 
</p>
<p>equality and women&#8217;s empowerment across all of the goals especially health, 
</p>
<p>education, poverty, food security and others.  
</p>
<p>25. It was noted that despite substantial progress towards achieving the MDGs, no 
</p>
<p>country across the globe could claim to have achieved de facto gender equality. 
</p>
<p>There could be no sustainable development without gender equality and the full 
</p>
<p>participation of women and girls. The new development agenda must value women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>potential and their contributions, paid and unpaid, to families, societies and 
</p>
<p>economies. Some States stressed the importance of financing required for achieving 
</p>
<p>the ambitious goals of the new development agenda and warned that unless  financing 
</p>
<p>could be guaranteed through national resources, private sector investment and 
</p>
<p>official development assistance, the goals would remain aspirations.  
</p>
<p>26. Accountability and adequate resources provision was a recurrent concern 
</p>
<p>expressed by State representatives and non-governmental organizations. Several 
</p>
<p>speakers referred to the need for monitoring and evaluation frameworks to be built 
</p>
<p>into the development agenda. Sex-disaggregated data was cited as vital to progress, 
</p>
<p>as well as specific attention to budgets for achieving gender equality.  
</p>
<p>27. The need to validate care and unpaid work as a positive social good was 
</p>
<p>emphasized repeatedly, as was ensuring women&#8217;s access to productive resources, 
</p>
<p>including credit. Violence against women and girls, including forced  marriage, was 
</p>
<p>also a topic raised by numerous speakers. Concern was further expressed about 
</p>
<p>multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination against women and girls due to 
</p>
<p>their age, race or sexual orientation, or because they were indigenous persons, 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities, migrants, or belonging to certain minority or ethnic groups. 
</p>
<p>SRHR were also mentioned as an area that should be addressed by the post-2015 
</p>
<p>framework.  
</p>
<p>28. Responding to some of the questions, panellists emphasized the importance of 
</p>
<p>allocating specific funds for mainstreaming and the need for a contextualized 
</p>
<p>approach when considering financing mechanisms, for example, debt swaps pegged 
</p>
<p>against delivery or issues around secure tenure and water and sanitation services. 
</p>
<p>The importance of adolescent girls, and the need to have them explicitly addressed in 
</p>
<p>the post-2015 framework was also addressed, in particular with respect to their 
</p>
<p>bodily autonomy and integrity as well as their right to comprehensive sexual 
</p>
<p>education. Panellists also emphasized the role of the judiciary in upholding the rule 
</p>
<p>of law, including remedies and compensation. It was agreed that disaggregat ed data 
</p>
<p>needed to factor in sex and age in order to capture the situation of adolescents and of 
</p>
<p>older women. It was noted that data were particularly important in view of the 
</p>
<p>experience with violence against women, which the MDGs did not address because 
</p>
<p>there were no data. As a result, considerable effort had been put into ensuring there 
</p>
<p>was adequate data on violence against women in order to ensure better monitoring. It </p>


<p>was suggested that terminology such as &#8220;universal&#8221; or &#8220;for all&#8221; should be replaced 
</p>
<p>with &#8220;women, men, boys and girls&#8221;. Concerning the means of implementation, it was 
</p>
<p>suggested that it would make sense to mainstream that throughout, rather than 
</p>
<p>having it is a separate focus area.  
</p>
<p>29. Regarding specific goals, it was recommended that the goal on health should 
</p>
<p>uphold the right to health especially with regard to it being available, accessible, 
</p>
<p>acceptable, appropriate and of good quality. It was critical to keep SRHR in the 
</p>
<p>gender equality goal &#8212; because it was not just about health, but about dignity and 
</p>
<p>autonomy in decision-making. Several other issues were also proposed as additions 
</p>
<p>to the sustainable development goals, including access to de facto education 
</p>
<p>(addressing non-attendance), maternity rights, positive measures to accelerate 
</p>
<p>equality in decision-making in public and private sectors, advancing women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>entrepreneurship, covering all care services guaranteed by the social protection floor 
</p>
<p>and inclusion in a tax framework, pensions and older women&#8217;s issues, more detail on 
</p>
<p>violence against women, gender-sensitive budgeting and policies across the board.  
</p>
<p>30. In conclusion, Ms. Cook, panel moderator, noted the overwhelming consensus 
</p>
<p>for a combination of a stand-alone gender goal together with a mainstream approach 
</p>
<p>to gender. This was justified both on intrinsic (women&#8217;s rights) and instrumental 
</p>
<p>grounds (that investing in girls and women was important for achieving all other 
</p>
<p>goals). She highlighted the strong focus on issues related to care and unpaid work, 
</p>
<p>the importance of focusing on adolescent girls, and discussions of budgeting and 
</p>
<p>accountability mechanisms among many important points raised by the panellists 
</p>
<p>and from the floor. The issue of how to increase awareness of men and boys about 
</p>
<p>gender was also important for changing social norms and behaviour around gender. 
</p>
<p>While evidence of progress and examples of how change happened existed, the 
</p>
<p>question was currently how to bring onto the agenda some of the neglected issues 
</p>
<p>and to find appropriate entry points to address deep-seated, structural and 
</p>
<p>institutionalized gender constraints.  
</p>
<p>31. The discussion broadly affirmed the importance of ensuring a strong focus on 
</p>
<p>gender equality in the post-2015 universal framework. Many speakers supported 
</p>
<p>calls for a stand-alone goal covering women&#8217;s human rights and recognized that 
</p>
<p>gender discrimination persisted in all regions of the world. The need to mainstream 
</p>
<p>gender concerns across the entire framework was also emphasized. Multiple speakers 
</p>
<p>drew attention to specific areas of women&#8217;s human rights that required attention, 
</p>
<p>including women&#8217;s employment, addressing their unpaid work and reducing the care 
</p>
<p>burden, ensuring basic services such as toilets and sanitation, eliminating gender-
</p>
<p>based violence, ensuring women&#8217;s participation, equal rights to land and other 
</p>
<p>productive resources, and sexual and reproductive health. The need to ensure 
</p>
<p>adequate financing and accountability mechanisms to achieve the goals in the new 
</p>
<p>framework, and to ensure disaggregated data were available, were further central 
</p>
<p>issues.
