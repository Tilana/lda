<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The independent expert on minority issues, Ms. Gay McDougall, in pursuance of her 
mandate, visited France between 19 and 28 September 2007. During her visit she travelled to 
Paris, Marseilles and Strasbourg and environs, where she held consultations with ministers and 
other senior government representatives, NGOs, civil society groups, religious leaders, 
academics and others working in the field of minority issues, anti-discrimination and gender 
issues. The independent expert visited communities living in suburbs of Paris and Marseilles 
described as urban &#8220;ghettos&#8221; or &#8220;sensitive&#8221; suburbs, including Bobigny and La Courneuve, 
which were affected by urban upheavals in 2005. She talked directly to community members 
about their lives, issues and concerns in relation to her mandate and held forums specifically for 
minority women, enabling them to reflect specific issues facing them.  
</p>
<p> The independent expert found that serious discrimination is experienced by members of 
minority communities in France, clearly targeted at those &#8220;visible&#8221; minorities of immigrant 
heritage, many of whom are French citizens. She concluded that the particular problems faced by 
people in &#8220;sensitive&#8221; suburbs are a direct consequence of discrimination and consequently 
require policy initiatives to address the special circumstances they face. Discrimination against 
minorities manifests itself in such areas as the allocation of housing, access to employment, 
quality of education, and grossly inadequate levels of political participation. Issues of identity are 
central in discourse and mind-sets regarding exclusion. Members of minority communities 
described an extreme pressure on them to alter their cultural and religious identities as a 
precondition for immigration and full inclusion and acceptance in French society. 
</p>
<p> Visits to minority communities revealed high levels of frustration. She found that young 
people from minority communities feel their hopes and dreams are being denied; they see no 
possibility of upward mobility because of their skin colour, religion, surname or address (in the 
sensitive suburbs). People who have worked hard, played by all the rules and truly believe in the 
principles of the French Republic are trapped in socially and geographically isolated urban 
ghettos, with unemployment over 40 per cent in some areas. They feel discriminated against and 
rejected by rigid notions of French national identity to which they do not conform. 
 The independent expert found that there is a general climate of suspicion and negativity 
against those of immigrant origin, generated in part by public debates over immigration policies, 
the announcement of quotas for deportations and questions of DNA testing. Much more must be 
done to establish an acceptance of cultural diversity. Currently, she found, there is a widespread 
feeling within the community of visible minorities that to become a citizen of France is not 
sufficient for full acceptance; that acceptance will be granted only with total assimilation that 
forces them to reject major facets of their identities. Only when a way is found to shed the colour 
of their skins and hide the manifestations of their religion or the traditions of their ancestors will 
they be accepted as truly French. The message that they take from the name of the new Ministry 
of Immigration, National Identity, Integration and Co-development seems to be that the presence 
and increasing numbers of people of immigrant heritage is a threat to the national identity of 
France; that it is a problem that must be solved. 
</p>
<p> The independent expert commended recent anti-discrimination initiatives, including the 
2004 Anti-discrimination Law and the establishment of the Independent High Authority for 
Equality and Against Discrimination (HALDE), an independent body with powers to mediate or </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/23/Add.2 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p>refer discrimination cases for prosecution, conduct studies and promote non-discrimination 
programmes and activities. While welcoming the role of HALDE and civil society organizations 
in prosecuting discrimination on a case-by-case basis, she emphasized that targeted and more 
robust approaches are required to have a deeper and far-reaching impact on persistent 
discrimination experienced by minorities. Penalties for acts of racial discrimination should be 
sufficiently severe to act as a deterrent to future violations.  
</p>
<p> Given the level and nature of inequalities in France, fulfilling the negative obligation of 
non-discrimination is not enough to secure equality in practice. The State is under a positive 
obligation to create favourable conditions for the exercise of the rights of minorities. The 
independent expert calls for the promotion of equality through affirmative action policies in the 
field of employment that should help to transform the ranks of the civil service, the police, and 
other public and private institutions to fully reflect the broad diversity within French citizenry.  
</p>
<p> France has historically rejected the concept of minority rights and recognition of minority 
groups or collective rights as incompatible with the French Constitution and the principles of the 
Republic, which prioritize individual rights, equality, unity and universalism. This has been an 
obstacle to the adoption of policy initiatives that by their nature must acknowledge the reality of 
discrimination against specific population groups within French society. It has prevented any 
serious consideration of affirmative action programmes or the collection of statistical data 
concerning the socio-economic status of population groups that can be disaggregated by 
ethnicity or religion. The independent expert recommends that such government measures, rather 
than being considered to violate the Constitution, should be seen as essential to achieving a true 
vision of &#8220;Libert&#233;, Egalit&#233;, Fraternit&#233;&#8221;. The acknowledgement of ethnicity, religion and heritage 
should not be considered to threaten the principles of unity and equality that are the foundation 
of French society. 
</p>
<p> Minority women voiced specific additional concerns, including the rights and protection of 
minority women in abusive relationships; concerns over access to social services and protection 
mechanisms; access to justice; the legal status of women of immigrant origin in cases of divorce, 
encompassing the right to remain in France after divorce and the execution by French courts of 
foreign divorce judgements based on gender-biased laws; the rights of minority women relating 
to inheritance, housing and property; specific issues relating to the education of girls of Muslim 
faith; security issues and the high incidence of rape of women in disadvantaged minority 
communities in suburbs; and the lack of access to political participation of minority women.  
</p>
<p> The independent expert also received information regarding the situation of the 
Gypsy/Travellers, the Jewish community and linguistic minorities including the Breton, Basque, 
Catalan and Occitan communities.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In conformity with her mandate&#8217;s requirement to promote implementation of the 
Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic 
Minorities (hereafter &#8220;the 1992 Declaration on Minorities&#8221;), the independent expert visited 
France between 19 and 28 September 2007. She conducted extensive consultations with senior 
government representatives, including ministers responsible for human rights, urban policy and 
poverty, the President of the Constitutional Council and other senior officials, in order to assess 
government perspectives on minority issues in France. She also consulted civil society 
organizations, academic institutions, students and media representatives and held open 
discussion forums.<b>1</b> The independent expert visited Paris, Marseilles and Strasbourg and their 
environs, where she consulted directly with community members, local regional government 
representatives, regional intergovernmental organizations and others in order to gain their views 
and opinions. She held forums specifically for minority women in order to allow them to express 
their views, talk about their lives and raise the issues most important to them. 
</p>
<p>2. The independent expert expresses her thanks to the Government of France for the excellent 
assistance and cooperation extended to her during the preparation and conduct of her visit, and to 
those government officials with whom she met. 
</p>
<p>3. The independent expert wishes to thank the numerous non-governmental organizations and 
civil society groups that met with her, provided valuable information, and facilitated aspects of 
her visit. The important work being done by NGOs has ensured that issues relating to 
discriminatory policies and practices are on the political agenda and before the courts. The 
independent expert encourages additional support for such organizations.  
</p>
<p>4. The independent expert has chosen to focus primary attention on the experiences of French 
citizens and long-term residents of immigrant heritage, particularly those of North African and 
Sub-Saharan origin, Muslims, and those from overseas departments and territories resident in 
mainland France. Persons belonging to such groups, often people of colour described as &#8220;visible 
minorities&#8221;, typically experience serious discrimination and are grossly underrepresented in State 
and political institutions. Racism (including Islamophobia), discrimination, alienation and lack of 
social mobility for persons belonging to such groups were contributing factors to the violent 
urban upheavals that occurred in French cities in 2005.  
</p>
<p>5. The independent expert also held consultations with representatives of 
Gypsies/Travellers/Roma communities and linguistic minorities such as the Bretons and Basques 
and Occitan-speaking communities. That information will also be reflected in this report.  
</p>
<p>6. The independent expert&#8217;s evaluation of minority issues in France is based on the 1992 
Declaration on Minorities and other relevant international standards, from which she has 
identified four broad areas of concern relating to minorities globally. These are: (a) the

</p>
<p>protection of a minority&#8217;s survival, through combating violence against them and preventing 
genocide; (b) the protection and promotion of the cultural identity of minority groups and the 
right of national, ethnic, religious or linguistic groups to enjoy their collective identity and to 
reject forced assimilation; (c) the guarantee of the rights to non-discrimination and equality, 
including ending structural or systemic discrimination and the promotion of affirmative action 
when required; and (d) the guarantee of their right to effective participation of members of 
minorities in public life, especially with regard to decisions that affect them. The current report is 
based upon analysis of these four areas of concern as they relate to France. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  LEGAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Recognition of minorities in France 
</b></p>
<p>7. France does not recognize the concept of minority rights and the official recognition of 
minority groups or collective rights is considered incompatible with the French Constitution and 
the principles of the Republic, which give priority to individual rights, equality, unity and 
universalism. In France&#8217;s 2007 report to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the Government states: &#8220;Under the French Constitution, the nation is defined as being 
composed of persons with equal rights: &#8216;France is an indivisible, secular, democratic and social 
Republic. It guarantees equality of all citizens before the law without distinction as to origin, 
race or religion&#8217; (art. 2). It follows from the French position that minorities are not recognized as 
holders of collective rights, but this position does not prevent the public manifestation or 
expression of diversity.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>8. Successive French Governments have maintained the position that there should be no 
official acknowledgement of the ethnic, religious or cultural characteristics of citizens, despite 
the recommendations of European and United Nations anti-discrimination bodies. France 
attached a reservation to article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and to article 30 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child relating to the rights of minorities.<b>2</b> 
France has not ratified the Council of Europe&#8217;s Framework Convention for the Protection of 
National Minorities or the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. As a 
United Nations Member State, France is required to observe and conform to the provisions of the 
Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic 
Minorities, adopted by consensus in 1992. 
</p>
<p>9. As stated in her initial report,<b>3</b> the independent expert supports the view that the existence 
of minorities and the determination of which groups constitute minorities does not lie with the 
State alone, but is dependent on a range of both objective and subjective criteria, in accordance 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  The French reservation attached to both article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights and article 30 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child states that: &#8220;The 
Government of the Republic declares that, in the light of article 2 of the Constitution of the 
French Republic, article 27 (article 30 in the case of ICRC) is not applicable so far as the 
Republic is concerned.&#8221; 
<b>3
</b>  E/CN.<footnote name="4">3. The independent expert focused on three areas that particularly featured in her 
consultations as being problematic in regard to discrimination against persons belonging to 
minorities: housing, education and employment. </footnote>/2006/74.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/23/Add.2 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>with the principles of international law. The Human Rights Committee, in its general comment 
No. 23 (1994) on article 27 (Rights of minorities), makes it clear that &#8220;the existence of an ethnic, 
religious or linguistic minority in a given State party does not depend on a decision by that State 
party but [needs] to be established by objective criteria&#8221;. At the same time, minority status is 
closely tied to how a group defines itself.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Domestic legislation relevant to minority issues 
</b></p>
<p>10. The independent expert notes the extensive legislative framework and institutional 
mechanisms established to combat racism, discrimination and anti-Semitism in France, which 
provide a strong legal foundation for the protection of the right to non-discrimination of persons 
belonging to minority groups. While space precludes a full analysis of relevant legislation and 
institutions, she highlights a number of developments which are particularly significant in 
relation to the protection and promotion of the rights of minorities.  
</p>
<p>11. The core of France&#8217;s anti-discrimination regime is found in the Criminal Code and the 
Labour Code. French law has been interpreted as prohibiting the Government from collecting 
information about the racial or ethnic background of its citizens. The independent expert 
welcomes the additional provisions of Act No. 2004-1486 of 30 December 2004, inspired by 
European Union anti-discrimination directives. This Act prohibits discrimination &#8220;on the 
grounds of origin, gender, family/marital status, physical appearance, surname, state of health, 
disability, genetic characteristics, lifestyle, sexual orientation, age, political opinions, religious 
beliefs, union activities, and real or supposed membership or non-membership of an ethnic 
group, nation or race&#8221;. Under the provisions of this Act, the Independent High Authority for 
Equality and Against Discrimination (Haute Autorit&#233; de Lutte contre les Discriminations et pour 
l&#8217;Egalit&#233;, HALDE) was established as an independent statutory authority, competent to deal with 
all forms of discrimination, whether direct or indirect, prohibited by law or by an international 
commitment ratified by France. 
</p>
<p>12. Article 19 of the Act relating to discrimination on the grounds of ethnic origin and 
incorporating into domestic law Council directive No. 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 is significant 
in that, upon presentation of evidence of direct or indirect discrimination by a complainant and a 
finding that a prima facie case exists, it shifts the burden of proof on to the defendant to prove 
that the challenged action or measure was justified by facts unrelated to any type of 
discrimination. Previously, a serious obstacle to the prosecution of discrimination cases was that 
the burden of proof lay solely with the plaintiff. However, the concept of indirect discrimination 
is applied only in matters of employment and housing. 
</p>
<p>13. HALDE is composed of an 11-member Council. It receives complaints from victims, 
members of Parliament and NGOs and determines the action to be taken on claims and issues 
recommendations. It has powers to mediate or refer discrimination cases for prosecution; 
conducts studies; and promotes non-discrimination programmes and activities. HALDE can 
intervene directly in court cases and can propose a settlement involving the payment of a fine. 
Unfortunately, it lacks enforcement powers with respect to non-payment of fines but can use 
publicity to &#8220;shame&#8221; parties failing to comply. In 2006, over 35 per cent of the 4,058 claims 
received were on the grounds of discrimination on the basis of &#8220;origin&#8221;, indicating the victim is a </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/23/Add.2 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>person belonging to a visible minority. Nearly 43 per cent of all claims related to discrimination 
in employment. Of the 2,143 cases actually handled by HALDE in 2006, fines were proposed as 
settlements in 20 cases and 42 others were transferred to the State Prosecutor.<b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>14. HALDE can conduct investigations on its own initiative, allowing it to act independently 
even where no complaint is received. It uses the tool of &#8220;discrimination testing&#8221;,<b>5</b> which 
compares how individuals who are similar in all significant respects but for ethnic origin are 
treated when seeking access to employment, housing or other public goods. Discrimination 
exists when the rejection rate for visible minorities is more than a specified rate higher than the 
&#8220;benchmark&#8221; testers. Importantly, French courts now accept the results of &#8220;discrimination 
testing&#8221; as admissible proof of discriminatory behaviour. However, a court official must be 
present to validate the &#8220;testing&#8221; evidence, which can be prohibitive.  
</p>
<p>15. The independent expert welcomed the positive work done by HALDE and recognizes that 
it is a young institution (created on 30 December 2004) and that it is still too early to fully assess 
its impact on decreasing racial discrimination. One positive sign is that its caseload more than 
tripled between 2005 and 2006. Creative initiatives by HALDE seek to raise awareness of 
discrimination and assist individuals in benefiting from its services, including a telephone 
shared-cost hotline and a radio programme hosted by HALDE&#8217;s President. 
</p>
<p>16. In March 2006, a new law (Law No. 2006-396 of 31 March 2006) on equal opportunities 
was adopted by the French Parliament following the outbreak of urban violence in French cities 
in autumn 2005. Focusing largely on promoting employment opportunities in urban areas 
classified as &#8220;sensitive&#8221; or &#8220;high risk&#8221;, the law also gives HALDE additional powers. Among 
these are provisions enabling HALDE to recommend that local government representatives 
impose administrative penalties on companies found guilty of discriminatory behaviour.  
</p>
<p>17. HALDE is only empowered to propose the payment of a &#8220;settlement&#8221; by those found 
responsible for discrimination, however does not have the legal authority to impose a penalty. 
However, the ceilings on penalties that can be proposed by HALDE on both individuals 
(3,000 euros) and on legal entities (15,000 euros) are set at a very low level and such penalties 
are only infrequently applied. The punishments that can be imposed for acts of discrimination 
under the Penal Code can be considerably higher and include the possibility of prison terms in 
addition to fines of up to 75,000 euros for individuals.<b>6</b> However, it was noted by 
</p>

</p>

</b>  HALDE 2006 Annual Report. 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  See the Equal Opportunities Act of 2 April 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  Act 2004-204 of 9 March 2004 increased the applicable penalties for racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>Now, the penalty for a person committing an act of racial discrimination can be as high as three 
years&#8217; imprisonment and a 45,000 euro fine. Where a discriminatory refusal of admission takes 
place on premises open to the public or with the aim of denying access, or where the 
discrimination is the act of a person vested with public authority, the penalties have increased 
from three to five years&#8217; imprisonment, and from a 45,000 to a 75,000 euro fine.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/23/Add.2 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>non-governmental sources that despite the possibilities open to the courts, penalties for 
discrimination are usually low and symbolic rather than being sufficiently severe to act as a 
deterrent to future violations. 
</p>
<p>18. The independent expert notes the inactivity of an Inter-Ministerial Committee to Combat 
Racism, Anti-Semitism and Xenophobia, which has not been convened since 2005. Such bodies 
offer the potential to ensure coordinated policies and practices across ministries, recognizing 
their interrelated mandates and the need for cooperation and holistic approaches to combat 
racism and its impact on minorities. The local prosecutor in the Paris suburb of Bobigny noted 
the potential benefits of greater cooperation between the authorities responsible for criminal 
justice, including those responsible for alternatives to custodial sentencing and those with 
mandates relating to education and employment. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  IDENTITY, LANGUAGE, CULTURE AND RELIGION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Issues of identity  
</b></p>
<p>19. Members of minority communities consistently described feelings of frustration that 
becoming a citizen of France is not sufficient for full acceptance by French society. They spoke 
of their sense that the precondition for acceptance is nothing less than total assimilation. They 
feel that rigid notions of French national identity required them to reject major aspects of their 
identities. Only when they find a way to disguise the colour of their skins and hide the 
manifestations of their religion or their traditions will they be accepted as truly French. They 
spoke of feeling unwelcome because of who they are. They referred to the newly named 
&#8220;Ministry of Immigration, National Identity, Integration and Co-development&#8221; as conveying a 
message that the presence and increasing numbers of people of immigrant heritage is a threat to 
French national identity. A Muslim community member in the Marseilles suburbs stated: &#8220;We 
are called upon to conform &#8230; but it is important to be proud and not hide your identity and 
culture. We have to respect the laws but be ourselves. The real French are also us: Mohammad 
and Fatima. Where are we going to go?&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>20. The independent expert notes that debates under way during her visit in regard to a new 
immigration bill (subsequently adopted as Law No. 2007-1631 of 20 November 2007 relating to 
control of immigration, integration and asylum) regarding DNA testing for immigration 
applicants and quotas for deportations are highly relevant to her mandate. They contribute to 
generating a national climate of suspicion and negativity against those of immigrant or Muslim 
origin; creating a presumption that they are all illegal and are fraudulently bringing non-family 
members into France, a factor that may boost Islamophobia.  
</p>
<p>21. Community members stated that the commonly felt sense of exclusion and alienation is 
leading to an unfortunate anti-integration reaction, in which members of minority groups are 
retreating from mainstream French society, which they perceive as rejecting them. 
Manifestations can be seen in the growing radicalization of young Muslim men and an increase 
in ethnically-based gang culture. It was noted that the urban disturbances of 2005 were partly  </p>
<p>triggered by what was perceived as a violation of a mosque by police, which caused 
consternation throughout France&#8217;s Muslim communities. A student of Algerian heritage in </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/23/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>Strasbourg stated: &#8220;People always say to me &#8216;where do you come from?&#8217; I come from Lyon. I 
am French. But when people keep asking me I feel less French and more Algerian. I am often 
told &#8216;look at you, you are not French&#8217;. You end up saying you are from another country and you 
don&#8217;t feel French any more.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Language and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>22. Representatives and scholars of numerous linguistic and cultural minority groups from 
different regions in France, including the Bretons and Basques and the Catalan- and 
Occitan-speaking communities, strongly complained that their languages and cultural rights are 
not fully respected and promoted within France. They predict that some regional languages and 
elements of cultural identity and heritage are in danger of disappearing in the medium to long 
term. Following the amendment of the Constitution of France in 1992 to reflect the position of 
French as the language of the French Republic, community representatives described 
government policy to promote French at the expense of regional languages. Immigration trends 
have brought significant numbers of speakers of various non-European languages, notably 
Arabic, to France.  
</p>
<p>23. Basque community representatives reported that, despite community desire to maintain and 
preserve the Basque language, there are some 5,000 fewer Basque speakers than 10 years ago 
and the language is seriously endangered in France as a result of lack of official status. 
Representatives of the Catalan- and Occitan-speaking communities also pointed out that absence 
of recognition or official status results in a constant decline in the number of Basque, Catalan 
and Occitan speakers in both absolute and percentage terms to such an extent that, despite the 
recommendations of European and United Nations anti-discrimination bodies, these languages 
are endangered languages limited to use in the private sphere with implications in both linguistic 
and cultural terms.  
</p>
<p>24. Breton representatives reported to the independent expert that subsidies had been stopped 
to schools for teaching of and in the Breton language. Independent Breton-language immersion 
schools (called <i>Diwan</i>) exist but are not part of the State education system since their 
incorporation was blocked by the French Constitutional Council, reportedly on the grounds that 
French is the language of the Republic and that no other language may be used as a language of 
instruction in State schools. Representatives of the Breton-speaking communities note that the 
numbers of speakers has declined from 1.<footnote name="3">8. Dedicated forums for minority women revealed specific additional issues affecting women, 
such as the rights and protection of minority women in abusive relationships, including concerns 
over access to social services and protection mechanisms; access to justice; the legal status of 
women of immigrant origin in cases of divorce, including the right to remain in France after 
divorce and the execution by French courts of foreign divorce judgements that were based on 
gender-biased laws; the rights of minority women relating to inheritance, housing and property; </footnote> million in 1900 to 200,000 today.  
</p>
<p>25. The Government states<b>7</b> that &#8220;in the education system, regional and minority languages are 
taught as optional subjects and special competitive examinations are held to recruit first- and 
second-level teachers of the languages concerned, which include Basque, Breton, Catalan, 
Corsican and Occitan within metropolitan France and Creole, Tahitian and Melanesian 
languages overseas&#8221;. The Government underscores that &#8220;museums and cultural centres focusing 
on regional cultures have been established and festivals celebrating these heritages are supported 
by the Ministry of Culture and Communication and local authorities. The Ethnological Heritage

<p>Council and Mission established by the Ministry of Culture in 1980 have been tasked with 
preserving key constituents of the identity of local cultures and helping to coordinate 
ethnological research policy throughout metropolitan France and its overseas departments, 
regions and communities&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>26. The independent expert considers such issues to be central to the 1992 Declaration on the 
Rights of Minorities. Even when linguistic minorities are relatively well integrated in economic, 
social and political fields, the 1992 Declaration<b>8</b> places great emphasis on preservation of 
linguistic, religious and cultural identity. The State is under a positive obligation to &#8220;create 
favourable conditions&#8221; in this regard. Information received suggests that policy and practice in 
France require review in consultation with the affected communities themselves, with a view to 
achieving consistency of approach and policy.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Rights of religious minorities 
</b></p>
<p>27. France maintains the principles of secularism (<i>la&#239;cit&#233;</i>) in regard to different religious faiths. 
Those of Muslim faith, however, may face particular challenges. Under conditions of societal 
intolerance, suspicion, misunderstanding of Islam and growing Islamophobia, the principle of 
non-discrimination alone is not sufficient to ensure equality in practice. Concerns were raised 
with the independent expert regarding provision of Muslim prayer facilities and mosques. There 
is no specific law on the construction of places of worship. While the same rules apply to all 
religious communities with respect to leases, land use and ownership and building restrictions, 
community prejudices may result in unequal treatment by local authorities, leading to undue 
restrictions on Muslim communities. There is a perception of bias when in practice these laws 
are only relevant to the building of mosques because in secular France, Islam is the primary 
religion with a growing need for places of worship. 
</p>
<p>28. Estimates put the Muslim population in France at 5 to 6 million people, the largest in 
Western Europe, most of whom are part of settled and established communities. The independent 
expert welcomes the positive practice of government recognition of different religious 
communities and initiatives, including the establishment of the French Council of the Muslim 
Faith, that play an important role in a process of interfaith and inter-community dialogue.  
</p>
<p>29. The innovative &#8220;Marseilles Hope&#8221; initiative supported by town hall and municipal 
authorities is a collective of religious leaders who meet together and with local authorities to 
share information, views and issues, and to maintain positive and constructive communication. 
Founded in 1989 as a response to growing urban violence, the body promotes inter-community 
understanding and &#8220;social peace&#8221; through a range of activities including interfaith symposiums. 
Marseilles Hope was consistently highlighted by all respondents as an exemplary initiative of 
interfaith and community dialogue.

</p>
<p>30. The independent expert was informed that incidents of violent attacks on persons 
belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities and reported racist and 
anti-Semitic incidents have declined.<b>9</b> However, it was widely stated by community members 
and representatives that various manifestations of discrimination, including on the basis of their 
Muslim or foreign-sounding names, continue to impact seriously on their opportunities and equal 
treatment. In such fields as employment and access to housing, this problem is so widespread 
that some feel compelled to disguise their names and religious identities.  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Gypsies/Travellers10 in France 
</b></p>
<p>31. Gypsy/Traveller community members and representatives reported increasing levels of 
discrimination against such groups and continuing failure to prosecute offenders. Issues of 
concern include the failure to provide serviced parking areas for caravans and disproportionate 
taxing of caravans; access to identity cards and documentation issues; obstacles to the right to 
vote and participate in political life; forced evictions; obstacles to the purchase of private 
property; difficulties with regard to education; and the incidence of harassment, abuse and 
violent attack against members of such groups. They highlighted a general climate of racism 
against Gypsies/Travellers that perpetuates racist stereotypes, exclusion and discrimination and 
leaves many extremely vulnerable.  
</p>
<p>32. Governmental representatives acknowledged claims that certain local authorities openly 
defy national legislation relating to the rights of Gypsies and Travellers. Law No. 2000-614 of 
5 July 2000 relating to the Welcome and Housing of Travellers establishes the legal requirement 
for municipalities of over 5,000 residents to provide parking areas for Gypsy/Traveller caravans. 
National authorities confirmed that while an estimated 40,000 such sites are required, only 8,000 
currently exist. Municipal authorities reportedly prefer to pay penalties than comply with the 
law. In many cases, sites, where provided, do not meet required minimum standards of 
infrastructure and environmental adequacy. Complaints were received that Gypsy/Traveller 
caravans are subject to prohibitively high taxes (imposed locally by communes) aimed at 
dissuading them from remaining in municipalities.  
</p>
<p>33. A new law adopted by Parliament in 2007 seeks to encourage communes to abide by the 
law. Law No. 2000-614 grants those in compliance with requirements to assign parking areas for

</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  The National Consultative Committee for Human Rights (NCCHR) reported 974 racist and 
</p>
<p>anti-Semitic incidents in 2005, down 38 per cent from the 1,574 incidents recorded in 2004.  
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  <i>Note on terminology - </i>The independent expert recognizes debate regarding appropriate 
terminology in France and for the purposes of this report conforms to the ERRC uses of the 
terms &#8220;Gypsies&#8221; and &#8220;Travellers&#8221; to refer to individuals and groups who are descended from 
groups that have long been citizens of France and who have for many generations played a role 
in French society and history. The category &#8220;Gypsies and Travellers&#8221; includes persons of diverse 
culture, frequently self-identifying as &#8220;Sinti&#8221;, &#8220;Manouche&#8221;, &#8220;Kale&#8221;, &#8220;Gitan&#8221;, &#8220;Roma&#8221;, &#8220;Yenish&#8221;, 
&#8220;Traveller&#8221; or other. </p>

</p>
<p>caravans the ability to fast-track the eviction process of caravans parked illegally. Ministry of 
Interior officials noted that the law had been approved by Traveller associations on the grounds 
that it would encourage communes to create legal parking facilities for Travellers.  
</p>
<p>34. Gypsies and Travellers are subject to a range of special laws, including rules regarding 
documentation and the requirement for a travel permit (periodically renewable). Those found not 
to be in possession of a valid travel permit are subject to a heavy fine and/or a one-year prison 
sentence. They are not entitled to vote until they have been administratively attached to a 
municipality for three years, under article 10 of Law No. 69-3 of 3 January 1969 relating to the 
exercise of ambulatory activities and to the regime applicable to persons circulating in France 
without a fixed domicile or residence. The qualifying period for all other citizens is only six 
months. In view of the travelling lifestyles of Gypsies and Travellers, such legislation effectively 
disenfranchises many members of such communities; it is discriminatory with respect to the right 
of citizens to vote and stand for election to public office. 
</p>
<p>35. Responsibility for government policies concerning the Roma/Traveller communities rests 
with the Ministry of the Interior, and other ministries including those responsible for housing, 
health and education. In discussions with the Cabinet of the Ministry, the independent expert 
noted that the framework that dominated the discussion of those policies was one of &#8220;law and 
order&#8221; rather than the rights of citizens. This was emphasized by the fact that the official 
responsible for Traveller affairs was a senior General of the Gendarmerie, as was his 
predecessor. 
</p>
<p>36. The independent expert notes that the nomadic lifestyles of many Gypsies and Travellers 
do not diminish the right of their children to have access to education, for families to have access 
to adequate health care and social services, and the possibility to seek and obtain temporary or 
longer-term employment. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  NON-DISCRIMINATION AND EQUALITY 
</b>37. During community forums in Paris and Marseilles, the independent expert was informed of 
common experiences of discrimination of people from visible minorities. Some described having 
been barred from leisure venues such as clubs, discos and bars, often with the excuse of &#8220;a 
private party&#8221;. The &#8220;testing&#8221; methodology to reveal discrimination has been used increasingly to 
good effect in these situations. In June 2007, five employees from four Paris discotheques were 
fined for discrimination after turning away those of African and Arab origin, marking the first 
time that a Paris court has issued a ruling based on the testing methodology. A representative of 
an anti-discrimination NGO in Paris stated: &#8220;Those born in France do not accept discrimination 
in the way that their parents or grandparents did, but even those of third or fourth generation 
continue to be discriminated against over an origin that they know very little about.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/23/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>specific issues relating to the education of girls of Muslim faith; security issues and the high 
incidence of rape of women in disadvantaged minority communities in suburbs; and the lack of 
access to political participation of minority women. 
</p>
<p>39. The near complete absence of people of colour in the French media is indicative of a wider 
problem of their &#8220;invisibility&#8221; within French society in general, to the extent that the 
appointment of the first black newsreader to a prime-time television news broadcast in 2006 was 
itself headline news. The lack of a representative voice for minorities in French politics creates a 
combined effect of both invisibility and silence of France&#8217;s minority groups, which additionally 
feel physically segregated from mainstream French society by public housing policies that 
consign them to isolated urban suburbs. 
</p>
<p>40. The independent expert was told of messages emanating from political parties and senior 
politicians that have been unwelcoming at best and in some instances of a racist and 
inflammatory nature. After the 2005 riots, the Minister of the Interior, Mr. Sarkozy, remarked 
that he would &#8220;clean the scum off the streets with a high-pressure hose&#8221;. This was commonly 
referred to by community members and has left a legacy of resentment among Muslim 
communities. The independent expert considers that the messages emanating from the highest 
officials of the State must be unambiguous in signalling full commitment to promoting 
non-discrimination, equality and diversity. As a community member in the Marseilles suburbs 
stated: &#8220;The administration is the first to say &#8216;be careful of discrimination&#8217;, but they are the ones 
creating the discrimination.&#8221; </p>
<p>41. Racism within the police service that has become institutionalized was highlighted as an 
ongoing problem. Community sources described racial profiling in stop-and-search procedures, 
among many intimidating and humiliating police practices, heavy-handed and aggressive 
policing, and what they perceive to be an &#8220;anti-black culture&#8221; of the police which extends to 
structural issues of recruitment. Some community members spoke of police techniques to make 
people stay in their neighbourhoods. Many commented that heavy-handed and insensitive 
policing practices had been the major factor in triggering the urban disturbances of 2005. It was 
noted that neighbourhood or &#8220;proximity&#8221; policing techniques designed to build relationships and 
confidence between local communities and the police had been abolished prior to the 
disturbances. 
</p>
<p>42. The effects of discrimination and exclusion have resulted in disproportionately high levels 
of poverty among visible minorities who are long-term residents or French citizens of immigrant 
heritage. Community members and NGOs described urban ethnic and religious ghettos as clear 
concentrations of poverty within French society. While government representatives also 
acknowledge the problems of poverty in the urban suburbs, the independent expert is concerned 
that the Government views poverty among minority communities as solely social or economic 
problems rather than as problems closely related to discrimination against members of minority 
groups.

</p>
<p><b>A.  Housing 
</b></p>
<p>44. The independent expert visited the suburbs of Paris and Marseilles, including Bobigny and 
La Courneuve in Paris, areas affected by urban upheavals and violence in 2005, and the northern 
suburbs of Marseilles. Her visits enabled her to consult with local residents and to see for herself 
housing conditions and local demographics in these areas. Despite the lack of statistical data 
along ethnic and/or religious lines, visits to the poorest suburbs of Paris reveal an obvious high 
proportion of &#8220;visible&#8221; minorities and religious minorities. 
</p>
<p>45. Consistently, when poor immigrants arrive, those belonging to certain ethnic or religious 
groups are allocated to the poorest housing in specific neighbourhoods that have become highly 
ethnicized, resulting in a discriminatory pattern of de facto segregation. Housing in these suburbs 
is often dilapidated and poorly maintained. There are chiefly towering high-rise apartment blocks 
lined up in neighbourhoods devoid of any of the beauty or verve characteristic of the streets of 
central Paris. Teenage boys loiter on street corners; not in school and not at work. These are poor 
neighbourhoods, clearly economically depressed and spiritually depressing. Community 
members commonly noted that quality public housing in central locations or higher income areas 
is rarely allocated to those of immigrant heritage. 
</p>
<p>46. By all accounts, the level of discrimination in the private housing market also considerably 
limits housing options for visible minorities. Discrimination persists in spite of legislation 
prohibiting bias in residential leases.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>47. Government officials acknowledged areas of some 70 per cent &#8220;foreign&#8221; residents and the 
creation of what has become recognized as the &#8220;ghetto&#8221; phenomenon, officially acknowledged 
only in recent years. Community representatives reflected that the urban blight of these areas has 
been attributed to ethnic minorities themselves who are blamed for their own conditions, in a 
process of stigmatization which extends to other spheres of life. Many residents said that their 
very address in the &#8220;sensitive suburbs&#8221; provides further grounds for discrimination. When 
employers receive applications indicating that the job-seeker lives in a ghetto, they reject it 
because it means the applicant is a minority. One community member stated: &#8220;When they read 
La Courneuve on your application, it goes in the bin.&#8221; </p>
<p>48. Physically isolated housing areas, including suburbs such as Clichy-sous-Bois, were noted 
as being seriously deprived in the development of public transport, resulting in major problems 
of isolation. Clichy-sous-Bois is only 10 km distant but reportedly more than 1.5 hours from 
central Paris by public transport. This places major labour markets, such as central Paris,

<p><b>11
</b>  The Government states in its report to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination dated 15 March 2004 that the Act of 17 January 2002 concerning social 
modernization amended article 1, paragraph 2, of the Act of 6 July 1989 on housing leases. This 
explicitly prohibits refusal to rent housing for reasons related to the tenant&#8217;s origins, name, 
physical appearance, habits, sexual orientation, beliefs, race or nationality. The Act establishes 
that the burden of proof that denial was justified lies with the landlord. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/23/Add.2

</p>
<p>effectively out of reach for those living in such areas. A community member in La Courneuve 
stated: &#8220;People from here don&#8217;t go to the centre of Paris. Most of the people here are hostages to 
their neighbourhood. It is a housing ghetto, but also a mental ghetto.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>49. NGO representatives and community members in both Paris and Marseilles described low 
quality, poorly maintained and unsanitary housing. Some commented that inadequate conditions 
and environment, combined with problems of discrimination and unemployment, contribute to a 
&#8220;climate of despair&#8221; and a spiral of urban decay conducive to such problems as drug dealing and 
violent crime, including a high incidence of rape of young women. 
</p>
<p>50. A government representative in the suburb of Bobigny in Paris acknowledged that: &#8220;We 
think that there is a link between what happened [2005 urban violence] and a failure of urban 
policy.&#8221; Policy debates tacitly recognize, while failing to analyse, the reality of ethnic ghettos. 
NGOs noted that only since 2000 has the problem begun to appear on the political agendas of the 
Government and other major parties, and that it has been given added impetus by the 2005 urban 
upheavals. During her visit to La Courneuve, the independent expert witnessed redevelopment 
schemes under way that focused on renovating existing tower blocks of better quality and 
demolishing others in favour of lower-level developments with communal gardens and improved 
leisure facilities. 
</p>
<p>51. Conflicting opinions were expressed regarding solutions to the problem of ghettoization. 
Some propose the break-up of the ghettos through policies of relocation and urban 
redevelopment with the express purpose of dispersing minorities throughout French 
neighbourhoods. They recognize that this approach would require proactive measures to 
decrease negative attitudes among some ancestral French toward those of immigrant origin. 
Others believe that solutions lie in investing to improve such areas; their infrastructure, access to 
services and employment options. 
</p>
<p>52. Under French law,<b>12</b> all communes are required to have a certain percentage of low-cost 
housing. Community sources complained that rich communes ignore the law and would rather 
pay fines for non-compliance than live with poor minorities. Some suburban residents noted that 
accusations of &#8220;communitarianism&#8221; also stem from ethnic concentrations and misinformed 
perceptions of voluntary isolationism from wider French society. As one community member 
commented: &#8220;We want to integrate but we are not allowed to. It is very hard for example to get 
finance from a bank because of our background, name or colour. Then when we are forced to 
take initiatives within our communities we are accused of &#8216;communitarianism&#8217;.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>53. The Urban Policy Minister, Ms. Fadela Amara, commented on planned activities and 
substantial funding for the National Urban Renewal Agency (ANRU) aimed at upgrading social 
housing through 2012. The Minister noted that this would be with the express objective of

social housing.  </p>

</p>
<p>creating mixed neighbourhoods in the suburbs. In January 2008, the Minister is to unveil the 
&#8220;plan of respect and equality of chance&#8221;, which will consist of initiatives in education and 
accomplishment, employment access, economic development, public transport and culture for 
the deprived suburbs. The plan is being developed through a process of consultation and debate 
with those living in the suburbs and local authorities, including via a blog. Part of the plan 
entitled &#8220;Hope Suburbs, a Dynamics for France&#8221; recommends reinforcing the powers of the 
HALDE in relation to the problems of the suburbs. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Employment 
</b></p>
<p>54. The principle of non-discrimination set forth in article L.122-45 of the Labour Code 
prohibits any difference in treatment on grounds of &#8220;origins, sex, customs, family situation, 
actual or supposed membership or non-membership of an ethnic group, nation or race, political 
opinions, physical appearance, family name, genetic characteristics, state of health or disability&#8221;, 
yet NGOs have flagged racial discrimination in employment as a major problem in France. In 
March 2007, the International Labour Organization presented results of a major national 
&#8220;practice testing&#8221; survey measuring discrimination against immigrant-origin workers in access to 
employment.<b>13</b> The survey found that four out of five employers preferred ancestral French 
workers over candidates of Maghreb or black African origin. Only 11 per cent of French 
employers were considered to have complied with equal treatment standards throughout the 
recruitment process. 
</p>
<p>55. The independent expert was informed that it is common practice for job advertisements as 
well as notifications relating to rental housing to refer to &#8220;BBR&#8221;, indicating &#8220;Bleu, Blanc, 
Rouge&#8221;, the colours of the French flag. This is commonly understood as a coded reference that 
only &#8220;white&#8221; French people are invited to apply or will be considered. 
</p>
<p>56. An historic court ruling in 2007 found a subsidiary of the cosmetic firm L&#8217;Oreal guilty of 
racial discrimination in selecting only white applicants for an advertising campaign, the first time 
that a major company has been found guilty of such a discrimination offence in France. L&#8217;Oreal, 
together with a recruitment company it had contracted, was fined 30,000 euros. Despite this 
landmark ruling, the penalty imposed does not appear commensurate with the seriousness of the 
offence and is insufficient (in view of L&#8217;Oreal&#8217;s annual profits of 1.83 billion euros in 2006) to 
send a strong message to employers that discriminatory practices will not be tolerated by the 
courts. 
</p>
<p>57. Black and Muslim women spoke of having degrees or professional qualifications but not 
being able to find work in their field and having to accept low-paid, temporary cleaning jobs. 
Even in these positions, they described finding that white women are treated differently and have

<p>greater job security. A Muslim woman in a Marseilles suburb stated that despite being at the top 
of her class in her university law studies, she had subsequently been unable to obtain an 
internship position with a legal firm, whereas all of her white peers had obtained and completed 
their internships. She fears that her failure to secure an internship, a requirement for certification, 
will prevent her from becoming a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>58. In 2004, a French employment agency answered 258 job advertisements for senior 
salespeople and managers by sending a total of 1,806 fictitious r&#233;sum&#233;s.<b>14</b> Almost 30 per cent of 
white French men and 26 per cent of white French women received positive responses. But when 
the r&#233;sum&#233;s were changed to have Arab-sounding names, the positive response rate dropped to 
only 5 per cent. A community member of Algerian origin talked with the independent expert 
about her difficulty in finding work in Marseilles and stated: &#8220;I am of Algerian origin, but I am 
very white. I can get in the door, but when they hear my name is Fatima the excuses come.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>59. The independent expert welcomes initiatives proposed by the Minister of Justice, 
Ms. Rachida Dati, one of three recently appointed female ministers from minority backgrounds, 
who in July 2007 instructed all Attorney Generals in France to appoint to their offices dedicated 
staff with the specific assignment to prosecute discrimination. 
</p>
<p>60. Ordinance No. 2005-901 of 2 August 2005 established the &#8220;PACTE&#8221; (The Pathway to 
Civil Service Careers) as an alternative means of entry to low-level regional, hospital and State 
civil service posts rather than via the standard competitive examination processes, with the aim 
of making the civil service more representative.<b>15</b> However, the programme only targets entry 
into the lowest level jobs and is limited to two-year contracts. In addition, the independent expert 
was informed by senior police commissioners of programmes, including the Cadets of the 
Republic Programme, which have been established to assist young people from all sectors of 
society in entering the police force. While anecdotally noting its success, police commissioners 
were unable to provide figures relating to the results in promoting diversity because identifying 
the graduates of the programme by ethnicity or minority status would be committing an offence 
under criminal law.

<p>  The Government states that the aim of PACTE is to make the civil service more 
representative of the society it serves, by trying to curb discrimination and exclusion. PACTE is 
open to those between 16 and 25 with no qualifications, and is a contract governed by public law 
lasting between one and two years and offering training and work experience in &#8220;Category C&#8221; 
posts, including maintenance, clerical and secretarial positions. It provides access to civil-servant 
status after an aptitude test. </p>

</p>
<p>61. On several occasions, the independent expert was informed by members of ethnic and 
religious minorities that they had experienced severe problems in finding employment in the 
police service despite having passed the qualifications and that discrimination remains 
commonplace within the police force. As a community representative in a Marseilles suburb 
noted: &#8220;It is hard to convince young people to do competitive examinations when they say &#8216;show 
us the examples of those who have succeeded&#8217; and there are none.&#8221; A case filed before HALDE 
shortly after the independent expert&#8217;s visit focused media attention on issues of discrimination 
within the police service. A policeman of Moroccan heritage charged that he was asked racist 
questions in his interview for the officers&#8217; competition, such as &#8220;Does your wife wear the 
veil?&#8221;<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>62. Some proposed initiatives seeking to counter discrimination on the grounds of name or 
address, such as anonymous application forms, continue to be debated and have met with support 
in some ministries. A system of urban tax-free zones has also been created and will be extended 
by the Government to assist in bringing investment and employers to particular areas of high 
unemployment. Of course, relocating industries to ghetto areas must go hand in hand with 
requirements or incentives to hire local residents. 
</p>
<p>63. Some companies are taking the lead in promoting diversity in the workplace through 
internal equality and non-discrimination policies. Since October 2004, heads of 60 companies 
with operations in France, including Airbus, IBM and Total, have signed a &#8220;Charter on 
Diversity&#8221; to promote non-discrimination, employment opportunities and promotion of 
minorities. Lack of statistical data continues to hamper evaluation of progress and the outcome 
of this and other initiatives. HALDE notes that it has worked to encourage companies to adopt 
more transparent internal staffing and recruitment practices. Practices such as &#8220;legacy hiring&#8221; 
and recruitment based on social networks are commonplace in certain sectors of the French 
labour market. By their nature, hiring practices that are not merit-based or transparent work to 
exclude minorities. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Education 
</b></p>
<p>64. The independent expert notes the high priority given to issues of education within France 
as well as French legislation and public policy, as demonstrated in the Government&#8217;s country 
reports to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child. However, she remains concerned that a reliance on current approaches to 
tackling discrimination issues fails to fully address the specific situations facing families and 
children from particular ethnic, religious and linguistic communities. 
</p>
<p>65. Disproportionate dropout rates were highlighted as a serious issue facing those belonging 
to minority communities. The Government has sought to address such issues via training, career 
advice and vocational initiatives, in particular via Law No. 2006-396 of 31 March 2006 on equal 
</p>

</p>
<p>opportunities. However, anti-discrimination organizations noted a tendency for members of 
minority groups to be directed towards vocational courses rather than studies required for 
university and professional preparation. 
</p>
<p>66. Government and NGO representatives highlighted to the independent expert the continuing 
problem of exclusion from access to France&#8217;s &#8220;elite&#8221; schools and universities, traditionally the 
means of entry to the civil service in France. The independent expert welcomed plans to enhance 
pre-training facilities in some schools, noted by the Minister Fadela Amara, and initiatives to 
create partnerships between schools in difficult areas and elite schools, to help facilitate access 
for those from minority communities. 
</p>
<p>67. Gypsy/Traveller communities face particular challenges in regard to the education of their 
children as a result of their ambulatory lifestyles, resulting in particularly low participation levels 
and high dropout rates. Community representatives noted worrying trends of Gypsy/Traveller 
children being placed in schools or classes for those with learning impediments without evidence 
of impaired learning abilities. Circular No. 2002-101 of 25 April 2002 provides guidelines on the 
&#8220;Schooling of Traveller Children and Non-Sedentary Families&#8221;, which aim to increase 
participation in the education system; however, Gypsy and Traveller representatives complain 
that these remain largely unimplemented. 
</p>
<p>68. Particular issues face minority girls in the sphere of education. During consultations, the 
issue of the wearing of the veil by Muslim girl students and the wider debate regarding religious 
symbols in French schools was frequently discussed. The independent expert urges that such 
debates be conducted in an open and inclusive manner and with the rights and interests of the 
child to the fore, including within Muslim communities themselves. She considers that caution 
must be exercised in legislation and policy that, irrespective of neutral intent, impact 
disproportionately on those faiths for which external, visible symbols or clothing are considered 
important tenets of faith, including Muslims, Orthodox Jews and Sikhs. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Comparisons between Marseilles and Paris 
</b></p>
<p>69. Discrimination in housing, policing, and unemployment, together with a lack of social and 
geographical mobility are important contributing factors to social unrest. The independent expert 
noted that Marseilles was relatively unaffected during the urban upheavals of 2005. She visited 
Marseilles to understand the particular circumstances and dynamics that contributed to its 
stability, meeting with senior government representatives, community groups and local residents, 
and with the innovative &#8220;Marseilles Hope&#8221; collective of religious leaders. 
</p>
<p>70. Consultations revealed that the limited nature of disturbances in Marseilles can be 
attributed to various factors, including a closer proximity between the housing for minorities and 
the city centre, which countered feelings of isolation; more community-sensitive policing; 
stronger family and social cohesion; more meaningful dialogue between communities and 
religious leaders and between communities and local authorities; relatively greater employment 
opportunities for those from minority groups; an explicit recognition and celebration of the 
diverse cultures and communities by local authorities; and the historical and geographical factors 
that have contributed to Marseilles&#8217; development as a multicultural city. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/23/Add.2

</p>
<p><b>IV.  POLITICAL PARTICIPATION OF MINORITIES 
</b></p>
<p>71. Article 2.3 of the 1992 Declaration on the Rights of Minorities states that: &#8220;Persons 
belonging to minorities have the right to participate effectively in decisions on the national and, 
where appropriate, regional level concerning the minority to which they belong or the regions in 
which they live, in a manner not incompatible with national legislation.&#8221; This is a guarantee that 
must be read in conjunction with the political rights of citizens under articles 2.1 and 25 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>72. Although minorities in France account for an estimated 12 per cent of the population, 
according to the Institute Montaigne, an independent French institute, only 2 of the 555 members 
of the lower house elected in metropolitan (non-overseas) France come from the country&#8217;s black, 
Asian and North African minorities.<b>17</b> In the 2007 elections, France&#8217;s governing political party, 
the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), had only seven minority candidates running for 
election while the opposition Socialists had 20 candidates, mostly in the Paris region.<b>18</b> A total 
of 7,639 candidates stood for 577 seats, including France&#8217;s overseas possessions. 
</p>
<p>73. The legitimate interests of minorities are not fully considered within political institutions 
that do not reflect the diversity of French society. Parliamentary debates on key issues relevant to 
minorities, including policy to combat racism and discrimination and to promote equality and 
immigration issues, are being conducted without representatives of minorities, who are frequent 
victims of discrimination. Lack of minority representation constitutes an extremely serious 
problem of underrepresentation in the legislative and at all levels of political structure. A 
significant sector of French society feels excluded from the organs of power, as a result of which 
those deliberative bodies suffer a deficit in the absence of their views. This raises issues of 
legitimacy and a legislative process that is not fully informed. 
</p>
<p>74. The rise of far-right political platforms within mainstream French politics influences the 
nature of political discourse and decision-making according to community representatives. They 
highlighted a growing nationalist, anti-immigrant discourse and political climate, exemplified by 
the slogan &#8220;France, love it or leave it&#8221;. This sends a message to communities not to complain. 
One community member in the suburbs stated: &#8220;If I speak of my living conditions, they will say 
I hate France. Given that climate, it is hard to have a dialogue on how to improve things.&#8221; NGO 
representatives noted that despite recent urban violence in 2005, issues of disadvantaged urban 
communities and discrimination featured little in 2007 election campaigns of major parties. 
Rather, immigration controls and tougher law and order measures were the primary campaign 
issues, suggesting that solutions to urban problems are being sought in &#8220;get tough&#8221; policies 
rather than in improved approaches to employment opportunities, urban redevelopment and 
human rights.

<p><b>V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
OF THE INDEPENDENT EXPERT 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>In spite of important national anti-discrimination legislation, serious racial 
discrimination is experienced by members of minority communities in France that is 
entrenched and institutionalized in nature. A political culture of denial has been an 
obstacle to effective measures to fully implement non-discrimination laws and to take 
concrete steps to address the complex inequalities that have been generated. The recent 
explosions of urban discontent have alerted authorities to the need for change.19</b> 
</p>
<p>76. <b>The independent expert urges the Government to take fully into consideration the 
analysis of the present report in developing policy responses to the urban upheavals. The 
most important actions that can be taken by Government lie in addressing the underlying 
causes of discontent and working towards structural solutions.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Acknowledgement of the reality 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Government of France is urged to: (1) recognize the existence of national or 
ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities within its territories and to withdraw its 
reservation to article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights relating 
to the rights of persons belonging to minorities and article 30 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child; and (2) ratify the European human rights treaties relating to the rights 
of minorities, including Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights and 
the Council of Europe&#8217;s Framework Convention on the Protection of National Minorities.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Guarantees of non-discrimination and equality 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>France&#8217;s anti-discrimination legislation should be amended to allow the imposition of 
penalties and fines for discriminatory practices that are sufficiently severe as to act as a 
deterrent to future violations. Legislation should also be amended to grant HALDE 
meaningful enforcement powers when there is a failure to comply with agreed settlement 
fines. Courts should impose more severe penalties for discriminatory acts, as allowed for 
under the Penal Code. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Robust affirmative action policies should be put in place to counter the effects of 
long-term discrimination against minorities. The independent expert encountered strong 
opinions both for and against affirmative action policies, from civil society groups and 
</b></p>

<p><b>19
</b>  The independent expert notes that further incidents of unrest and violence occurred in the 
</p>
<p>suburbs of Paris (Villiers-le-Bel) in November 2007, following the tragic death of two young 
men after a collision between their motorcycle and a police vehicle. She deeply regrets this 
further violence. </p>

<p><b>governmental sources. The terminology of &#8220;positive discrimination&#8221; was commonly used, 
which she believes creates misleading perceptions of &#8220;privileges&#8221; given to people from 
certain sectors of society at the expense of others. Using such terminology sabotages public 
support from programmes that generate equality in ways that benefit everyone. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>A wider debate is required on the issue in France that is open, informed and 
inclusive, and that builds on the experiences of other United Nations Member States and 
the recommendations of regional and international institutions. Such a debate should be 
framed by the concept of special measures/affirmative action as it is understood in 
international standards, including articles 1.4 and 2.2 of the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The independent expert shares the view of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination that efforts to combat discrimination in France are hampered by 
inadequate statistical information on the grounds of race, ethnicity or religion. She 
welcomes the current debate regarding the use of statistical data, including its 
constitutionality, and hopes this debate will continue to be informed by the experiences and 
practice of other European countries.20 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The collection of data regarding the socio-economic status of the population 
disaggregated by ethnic and religious identities as well as along gender lines is 
recommended as an essential tool to reveal the full extent of social problems experienced by 
persons belonging to different ethnic and religious minority groups. Such data will assist in 
the development of appropriate and effective policies and practices to combat the effects of 
discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Government should undertake confidence-building and awareness-raising 
measures among all communities, including minority groups, to promote and encourage 
participation in voluntary data collection, including census registration, and allay fears 
that data collection will be used as a means of deepening rather than combating 
discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Inter-Ministerial Committee to Combat Racism, Anti-Semitism and 
Xenophobia has been inactive since 2005 and should be reinstated and convened on a 
regular basis. Such a body offers the potential to ensure coordinated policies and practices 
across the ministries, recognizing their interrelated mandates and the need for holistic 
approaches in</b> <b>efforts to combat racism and discrimination and to promote the rights of 
minorities.

</p>
<p>85. <b>Following consultations with the High Commissioner for Active Solidarity Against 
Poverty in France, the independent expert notes that policy initiatives designed to address 
the needs of the poor as an aggregate group rather than targeting the specific nature of the 
obstacles faced by minority groups will fail to create sustainable solutions to their poverty, 
highlighting the recommendations of the 2007 report <i>Minorities, Poverty and the 
Millennium Development Goals</i>.21</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Discrimination in employment 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The public sector must lead by example in promoting and ensuring equality, 
non-discrimination and diversity, in order to send a clear message to all sectors of society. 
The Government should undertake more aggressive strategies to dramatically increase the 
number of people with immigrant heritage in the public service, particularly the police, 
civil service and the judiciary, in order better to reflect the broad diversity within French 
citizenry. These efforts should be evaluated on the basis of results or outcomes, using 
statistical data disaggregated to reveal the number of visible minorities who have been 
newly employed and their advancement. In the private sector, anonymous employment 
applications should be encouraged.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Discrimination in housing 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The independent expert welcomes proposed initiatives to improve housing and living 
conditions in French suburbs. However, she considers that substantial investment in urban 
renewal should be just one component of a much wider policy package, which includes 
employment and education in the broader context of dedicated anti-discrimination 
initiatives. She emphasizes that priority should be given to ensuring that new or renovated 
housing is first offered to long-term residents of such suburbs. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>When communes fail to meet the regulations regarding the availability of a specified 
percentage of social housing that must be allocated to poor families, they should be severely 
penalized to the limit specified in the law. The Government should establish effective 
means to monitor compliance with the laws in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Furthermore, the severe penalties currently foreseen in law should be imposed on 
municipalities that violate laws adopted to implement the rights of individuals belonging to 
Gypsy/Traveller communities. No municipality should be allowed to disregard the law with 
impunity.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Discrimination in education 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Government should evaluate its current programmes that focus on 
under-achieving schools against specific studies on the educational obstacles faced by

<p><b>minority students, both those of immigrant heritage and those from Gypsy/Traveller 
communities. Special measures should be adopted to guarantee the right to education in 
mainstream schools for children of Gypsy/Traveller families. Steps should be taken to 
protect the right of those children to not be segregated into schools or classes for the 
learning impaired when there is no evidence of need. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Inclusion of minority women 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Women from the various minority groups in France face complex issues and 
specific challenges. In addition to discrimination in the fields of education, employment 
and housing, they are often confronted with specific challenges relating to family 
matters when their immigration status is tied to that of their husband. Divorce 
proceedings in foreign courts of certain countries can create problems for the realization 
of rights that they might have under French law. These special concerns require targeted 
attention and dedicated resources within relevant ministries and local and regional 
authorities. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The full and effective participation of minority women must be seen as an essential 
component of Government and civil society efforts to address their issues. The 
establishment of an advisory body to HALDE on minority women&#8217;s issues should be 
considered as a means of gaining the views and experiences of minority women and 
assisting in the planning, design, implementation and evaluation of policies in order to 
address their specific issues and concerns. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Promotion of language, religion and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The independent expert supports calls for France to ratify the European Charter for 
Regional or Minority Languages, which provides valuable guidance to all European States 
in their treatment of such issues, and for the preservation and promotion of the rich 
cultural and language heritage of each State. The Government of France should support 
the use of regional and minority languages as a medium of instruction in the early years of 
public primary education for students who so request. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The independent expert supports the conclusions and recommendations which the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief stated in her report on her visit to 
France in 2005, namely, that Law 2004-228 of 15 March 2004 on &#8220;la&#239;cit&#233;&#8221; and the 
wearing of conspicuous religious symbols in public schools &#8220;constitutes a limitation of the 
right to manifest a religion or</b> <b>a belief [&#8230;] and has mainly affected certain religious 
minorities, and notably, people of a Muslim background&#8221;. The independent expert 
supports the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation that the Government should 
closely monitor the way that education institutions are implementing the law and adopt 
a flexible implementation of the law which would accommodate schoolchildren for whom 
the display of religious symbols constitutes an essential and freely chosen element of their 
faith. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/23/Add.2 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p><b>Enhancement of political participation 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Full and effective participation in national and regional political structures, as well as 
representation within key government ministries and institutions, is essential to future 
efforts to protect and promote the rights of minorities. Political parties in France should 
seek ways to increase the number of persons belonging to minorities that win election to 
national regional and local government structures. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Government of France should establish consultative bodies of persons belonging 
to minorities to facilitate the full and effective participation of minorities in all decisions 
that affect them, and in the planning, design, implementation and evaluation of policies and 
programmes in respect of minority issues and those which impact on the lives of minorities.
