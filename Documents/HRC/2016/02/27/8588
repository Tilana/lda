</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons carried out a follow-up visit to Azerbaijan from 19 to 24 May 2010. He 
last visited the country in 2007. While noting important progress since his last mission, 
such as the closing of tented camps, the Representative emphasized that the protracted 
nature of the displacement, which has persisted for nearly two decades, continues to affect 
the human rights of close to 600,000 internally displaced persons in that country. 
</p>
<p> The Government of Azerbaijan has provided significant resources towards the 
improvement of overall living conditions for its displaced population. This has resulted in 
better housing conditions for some internally displaced persons and a significant decline in 
the poverty rate among this sector of the population over the last five years. However, both 
old and new problems are affecting their rights, including access to adequate housing, 
which remains a persistent concern, and health and education rights. Stronger efforts are 
necessary to provide internally displaced persons with livelihood opportunities and 
decrease dependency on Government transfers. The Representative encouraged the 
Government to continue their efforts to address these issues, to reduce both the isolation 
and the insular effects experienced by some displaced communities, and to promote self-
reliance and the full economic and social integration of internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p> The Representative also emphasized the need to strengthen efforts towards 
achieving a peace agreement, including one which takes the rights of internally displaced 
persons into consideration.

</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with his mandate contained in Human Rights Council resolution 6/32, 
and by invitation of the Government of Azerbaijan, the Representative of the Secretary-
General on the human rights of internally displaced persons (the Representative), Walter 
K&#228;lin, conducted an official mission to Azerbaijan from 19 to 24 May 2010. This visit built 
upon the Representative&#8217;s previous mission in April 2007.1 His main objectives were to 
observe the changes and progress made since his last visit, to identify remaining or newly 
emerging problems, and provide relevant recommendations in light of these. 
</p>
<p>2. During the course of his visit, the Representative met with President Ilham Aliyev, 
Deputy Prime Minister Ali Hasanov, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Economic 
Development, as well as Deputy Ministers of Health, Labour and Social Protection, and 
Education. He also met with the Ombudsperson of Azerbaijan and representatives of the 
international community and non-governmental organizations. He visited locations where 
internally displaced persons live in Baku, Beylagan and the Lachin winter grounds in 
Aghjabedi. 
</p>
<p>3. The Representative expresses his thanks for the exchange he was able to have with 
all of his interlocutors, which enabled him to gain a clearer picture of the present situation 
of internal displacement in Azerbaijan. He would like to thank the internally displaced 
persons who were ready to share their experiences with him. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Current situation of internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Demographic and geographic composition 
</b></p>
<p>4. According to Government figures, there are an estimated 586,013 internally 
displaced persons (IDPs) in Azerbaijan.2 Of an overall population of 9 million people in 
Azerbaijan, approximately 7 per cent are internally displaced, representing one of the 
countries with the largest per capita displaced populations. The vast majority of IDPs 
originate from seven territories around Nagorno-Karabakh and have been displaced since 
the Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict which ended with the 1994 ceasefire 
still in place until today. 
</p>
<p>5. While there are IDPs living in every district of the country, the majority live in and 
around the capital Baku and Sumgayit. Other significant numbers live in rural settlements 
close to the contact line. Displaced persons living in urban areas merge and live side by side 
with the local population. Those living in rural areas, however, often live in isolated 
settlements far from local towns. Overall, relations with the local populations have been 
positive, marked by understanding for their situation and the general absence of 
discrimination. The Representative found indications, nonetheless, that frustrations within 
displaced communities, as well as tensions with locals may be mounting as a result of the 
prolonged displacement. 
</p>
<p>6. The displaced population has a diverse socio-economic profile, although most have 
a basic primary and secondary education and come from agricultural backgrounds. The 
conflict and subsequent displacement had a disruptive effect on the education of those 
displaced and particularly the youth, making it impossible for many to continue their 
</p>

 2 Letter of the State Committee for Refugees and IDPs (providing IDP statistics with age and gender 
</p>
<p>breakdown), 2 January 2010. </p>

<p>studies.3 The protracted nature of the displacement has also had a negative effect on their 
psychological and social condition, particularly in the case of women, children and the 
elderly. This has been exacerbated in many cases by the isolation and marginalization they 
experience resulting from, among other things, the greater difficulties they face in 
integrating fully into the economic life of the country and becoming self-reliant. The 
conflict also resulted in an important number of displaced persons being disabled and 
handicapped, and some orphaned.4 
</p>
<p><b> B. Living conditions, unemployment and poverty rates 
</b></p>
<p>7. Azerbaijan has experienced significant improvements in the living conditions of its 
population in the last decade, a period in which reform efforts sought to advance overall 
living standards and during which the average household consumption more than doubled.5 
Yet, a full picture or agreement on the current living conditions of IDPs in the country does 
not exist. It is generally considered, however, that a large percentage remain especially 
vulnerable to poverty and other risk factors, as most lack self-reliant economic 
opportunities and continue to be heavily dependent on State transfers.6 
</p>
<p>8. According to a World Bank survey, the majority of IDPs live in urban areas, as do 
the majority of those who are considered poor. Despite this high poverty rate among the 
urban displaced, those living in rural areas continue to be at higher risk of poverty than their 
urban counterparts, as well as at a higher risk of poverty than the rest of the rural 
populations in the country.7 
</p>
<p>9. While the general incidence of poverty among IDPs has diminished significantly in 
the last five years and is no longer as substantially different from the rest of the general 
population, important differences distinguish and exacerbate poverty among internally 
displaced communities. These factors are related, among others, to housing conditions, 
sources of livelihood and the location or areas of settlement. The first two factors are 
addressed in the relevant sections of this report. With regard to the areas of settlement, this 
has been found to be a key factor in relation to the risk of poverty. Indeed, while IDPs 
living in Baku appear to be at a decreased risk of poverty, the trend for those living in other 
major urban areas actually reveals a significantly greater risk of poverty, accompanied by 
very difficult living conditions. As such, Government and donor support to IDPs appear to 
date, to have had limited impact in cities outside Baku.8

</b></p>
<p><b> III. Frameworks for the assistance and protection of internally 
displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Domestic response 
</b></p>
<p>10. In addition to having ratified most major international human rights instruments, 
Azerbaijan is a party to regional human rights treaties including the European Social 
Charter, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms and many of its Protocols,9 also recognizing the jurisdiction of the European 
Court of Human Rights. Moreover, according to its Constitution, international treaties 
constitute an integral part of the Azerbaijani legal system and are to prevail in the event of 
conflicting provisions in national legislation.10 
</p>
<p>11. Azerbaijan has developed and now had in place for many years, an important body 
of national legislation addressing the situation of its internally displaced population which 
aims to normalize their status as citizens with equal rights, while also affirming their special 
situation and needs. The key legislation relevant to the displaced population has remained 
essentially the same as that in place at the time of the Representative&#8217;s visit to Azerbaijan in 
</p><p>2007. 
</p>
<p>12. Central among this body of legislation is the 1999 Law of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan on the Status of Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons, which provides a 
definition of an internally displaced person11 and regulates their rights and obligations. It 
includes a wide range of rights which both assert their equal rights as citizens, including 
equal access to the labour market, employment opportunities and the courts, as well as 
provisions which provide for various forms of special assistance from the State. 
</p>
<p>13. With regard to the latter, these rights to special assistance are further detailed in the 
1999 Law on the Social Protection of Internally Displaced Persons and Persons Equated to 
Them, which provides for their right to, inter alia: free temporary accommodation; public 
health care; social assistance; pensions; State education from the primary to the University 
levels; exemption from payment of utilities and taxes; the allocation of land plots; the 
provision of preferential loans; and assistance in seeking employment. This law therefore 
provides for special financial and other forms of assistance to IDPs, while also allowing for 
the possibility of external humanitarian assistance from the international community. 
</p>
<p>14. Various other provisions in a number of laws grant particular rights to IDPs such as 
the 2004 Presidential Decree prohibiting the forced eviction of IDPs from their current 
place of residence until their return to their place of origin or resettlement.12 
</p>
<p>15. Based on Presidential Decree no. 298, the Government also adopted in 2004, the 
State Programme for the Improvement of Living Standards and Generation of Employment 
for Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons. This programme seeks to improve living 
conditions for displaced populations, in particular by: improving public utility services and 
housing conditions; reducing poverty, including through a number of employment and 
income-generation initiatives; and ensuring coordination with humanitarian agencies on 
</p>
<p>  
 9 More particularly, Protocols 1&#8211;8, 11 and 14. 
 10 Art. 148, para. 2, of the Constitution; see exception in article 151. 
 11 Art. 1, defines an internally displaced person as &#8220;any person who has moved to another place by 
</p>
<p>being forced to leave his/her permanent residence within the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan in 
connection with military aggression or natural or manmade disaster&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 12 Order of the President of the Azerbaijan Republic on adoption of &#8220;The State Programme for 
Improvement of Living Standards and Generation of Employment for Refugees and Internally 
Displaced Persons&#8221; No. 298, 1 July 2004. </p>

</p>
<p>issues such as durable solutions and mine clearance in liberated areas. This decree was 
followed by another in 2007, namely Decree No. 2,475, which aimed to improve 
infrastructure, promote construction projects (e.g. houses and community facilities), and 
generate employment opportunities for IDPs by 2011. Significantly, the 2004 State 
Programme is linked to broader development plans of the country, including the State 
Programme on Alleviation of Poverty and Sustainable Development in Azerbaijan 2008&#8211;
2015, the common country assessment and the United Nations Development Assistance 
Framework, which also includes displaced populations.13 
</p>
<p><b> B. International responses 
</b></p>
<p>16. Over the years, international and national agencies in Azerbaijan have gradually 
reduced and reoriented their activities from large-scale emergency programmes to smaller-
scale development programmes. This is largely in response to the protracted nature of the 
displacement situation, the fact that the most urgent humanitarian needs have been 
addressed and the growth of the State economy. While assuming its full responsibilities 
with regard to its internally displaced population, and related costs, the Government of 
Azerbaijan continues to express its interest in continued engagement with the international 
community.14 
</p>
<p>17. The current support from the international community includes a number of 
programmes, including initiatives to improve livelihoods, such as: a soft loan scheme by the 
World Bank; small-scale livelihood projects through micro-credit schemes; a multi-crop 
greenhouse project; and skills training for youths in Sumgayit. Other types of support to the 
displaced population are also provided in the form of relief items, community-based 
projects in selected settlements and advocacy activities promoting a rights-based protection 
approach to displacement problems. 
</p>
<p>18. In addition, the United Nations Country Team and some individual international 
agencies have integrated the protection and assistance needs of internally displaced persons 
into their country programmes. A project of particular note was the undertaking of a gaps 
analysis on the protection of IDPs in Azerbaijan, a European Union-funded project led by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 
collaboration with the Government, the results of which were presented in March 2010. 
This detailed analysis constitutes an important tool which will enable all relevant actors to 
take stock of the situation of IDPs in the country and set relevant priorities and objectives. 
UNHCR also provides free legal counselling and assistance to IDPs, through its 
implementing partner. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Specific rights and issues of concern to internally displaced 
persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Access to adequate housing  
</b></p>
<p>19. The Government of Azerbaijan has committed significant resources towards the 
construction and improvement of housing for IDPs. According to Government figures, 
between 2001 and 2009, a total of 646.1 million manats, largely from the State Oil Fund, 
were allocated for the construction of new settlements, individual housing units, and related 
buildings and infrastructure such as schools and medical centres, natural gas pipelines,

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.2 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>sewage systems and power lines. This enabled<i>, </i>inter alia: the construction of 64 new rural 
or semi-rural settlements in the regions and individual housing for 18,190 internally 
displaced and refugee families (81,800 individuals); 123 school buildings and 45 medical 
points; as well as kindergartens, post offices and major infrastructures providing essential 
community services such as electricity and sewage systems.15 
</p>
<p>20. However, given the scale and number of displaced persons in the country, these 
efforts, despite their magnitude, have not reached the majority of IDPs, most of whom 
continue to live in poor or substandard housing conditions, including makeshift housing in 
abandoned apartments and private accommodation offering no security of tenure and poor 
conditions. While the closing of the tented camps and the relocation of IDPs to new 
settlements or urban accommodation are significant achievements, these efforts have 
provided housing solutions to a relatively small percentage (i.e., approximately 14 per cent) 
of IDPs in the country. Inadequate living conditions and infrastructure therefore remain the 
primary areas of concern for the majority of IDPs, in both rural and urban areas. 
</p>
<p>21. Government efforts to continue addressing this concern include: the implementation 
of both the original and the amended State Programme on the Improvement of Living 
Conditions for Internally Displaced Persons; new building projects such as the six nine-
storey buildings constructed in Benegadi (Baku) and the new complex in Qabala; as well as 
plans for other future urban housing construction projects which the Government shared 
with the Representative during this visit. In this regard, the Representative was encouraged 
to learn that land plots (where necessary) had been allocated and planning was under way 
for the construction of a number of new settlements and multi-storey buildings, together 
with the necessary social infrastructure and public utilities, in various regions and cities in 
the country, in addition to the housing projects being implemented in Baku. 
</p>
<p>22. According to the Government, renovations have already been completed in 50 
settlements and will soon be undertaken in the remaining 80 of the total 130 collective 
centres used to house displaced persons; a project which has been made possible through 
microprojects funded by the World Bank. Collective centres used to house internally 
displaced persons are most typically former dormitories, public buildings, sanatoriums and 
health camps, and exist in various regions and cities, including Baku and Sumgait.16 Some 
of these new settlements and housing construction projects are intended to replace the 15 
Finnish-style settlements which temporarily sheltered displaced persons, but which are no 
longer habitable. Other projects of note include the renovation of 1,500 houses in 
settlements in parts of Fuzuli. 
</p>
<p>23. The Representative visited IDPs living in both newly built multi-story buildings in 
the outskirts of Baku, as well as families still living in dilapidated and overcrowded 
university dormitories in the centre of Baku. While the former are provided apartments 
according to the size of their family and expressed satisfaction with their housing, many of 
families remaining in overrun collective centres &#8211; in Baku as well as other urban areas &#8211; 
continue to live in a one-room space, which in many cases does not afford any privacy, 
private bathrooms or kitchen facilities. One such dormitory which the Representative 
visited was to be renovated and returned to the University for its original function as a 
dormitory for university students, thereby making it a priority to ensure that adequate 
alternative housing is available for the resident IDPs. In such cases, it would be important 
to consult with residents on the new locations for resettlement, and to ensure that they are

<p>provided some viable alternatives rather than compelled to move far away from their 
current neighbourhoods, where they have established their lives, including employment, 
schooling for their children and social networks. 
</p>
<p>24. While overcrowding, substandard housing and insecure tenure are the general 
housing concerns of the urban displaced, particular groups have additional concerns. The 
Representative highlights, for example, that overcrowding is likely to affect the need for 
privacy and personal development of children and adolescents from displaced communities, 
and that current housing conditions may not be able to meet the particular needs of certain 
groups such as the disabled, the elderly and single mothers. Moreover, while many 
displaced persons living in settlements benefit from more spacious accommodation, the 
remoteness of some settlements and the lack of public transport facilities continues to pose 
important barriers to the livelihood and social integration needs of these displaced 
communities, as well as to adequate access to certain essential services. More livelihood 
projects and the provision of public transportation services in order to better access local 
communities could alleviate the situation, in particular if they are provided through 
cooperation with the Ministry of Transport and local authorities. 
</p>
<p>25. Of particular concern since the Representative&#8217;s last visit to Azerbaijan, is the 
increased risk of future evictions in urban areas; a new problem that has emerged as a result 
of, inter alia, the pressures of privatization, urbanization, and increased public construction 
works. IDPs have been granted guarantees against eviction in domestic legislation.17 
However, these guarantees are increasingly placed under pressure by a number of new 
factors. One such factor is a number of decisions in cases brought to the European Court of 
Human Rights. These decisions have subsequently been used as precedents by domestic 
courts in judgements relating to eviction orders. The threshold case in this regard is the 
European Court <i>Akimova v. Azerbaijan</i> case (19853/03) of 2007, although several other 
cases have followed it, including a number of more recent judgements from December 
2009 to July 2010, which hold that the Government must enforce domestic judgements 
involving the evictions of IDPs.18 
</p>
<p>26. In addition to instances, such as the above, where evictions are related to disputes 
involving private property rights, the Representative stressed the need to also address the 
increasing risk of future evictions due to the pressures of privatization of State property and 
the need for public constructions works. 
</p>
<p>27. The Representative would like to recall that evictions, as such, are not prohibited 
under international human rights law. In some cases, evictions may become inevitable 
where IDPs refuse to leave their accommodation voluntarily and the owners insist on 
regaining possession. Nonetheless, evictions should be carried out in full compliance with 
international standards and, in particular, not be undertaken without offering persons 
concerned with viable alternatives as regards housing, livelihoods and access to basic 
services such as health and education. In the context of internal displacement in Azerbaijan, 
this requires the development and implementation of a comprehensive housing strategy 
</p>
<p>  
 17 Order of the President of the Azerbaijan Republic on adoption of &#8220;The State Programme for 
</p>
<p>Improvement of Living Standards and Generation of Employment for Refugees and Internally 
Displaced Persons&#8221; No. 298, 1 July 2004. Paragraph 2 reads: &#8220;Officials of the relevant State bodies 
shall be instructed not to allow eviction of IDPs from public buildings, apartments, lands and other 
places, temporarily occupied by them during the period of 1992&#8211;1998, regardless of ownership, until 
they return to their homeland or move to new settlements and houses for temporary residence&#8221;.

<p>which ensures that the rights of the displaced are respected in regard to eventual evictions, 
and programmes which offer practical housing alternatives or housing schemes (e.g. rental 
subsidies) to IDPs in need which do not disrupt access to livelihoods and basic services. 
</p>
<p>28. The Representative observes that consultation processes with IDPs have generally 
been either insufficient or absent, with regard to the location, design and implementation of 
new housing projects. Lack of consultation can be especially problematic for particularly 
vulnerable persons, such as the disabled and the elderly who may have special housing 
requirements or for whom housing impacts on their access to essential services. It also 
affects the urban displaced who must leave districts in which they have lived for many 
years in order to move to unknown locations, or who must adapt to housing schemes which 
may not be the most suited to the needs of displaced communities. Similarly, the lack of 
consultation continues to affect those who are either currently living or eventually to move 
to new and often isolated settlements. The latter in particular, would benefit from more 
information and consultation, especially in regard to issues of access to livelihoods and 
services, as well as security, as recent settlements are situated precariously close (in some 
cases less than 5 km) to the contact line, such as is the case of some newly built villages in 
parts of Fuzuli.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Access to employment, livelihoods and an adequate standard of living  
</b></p>
<p>29. While some progress has taken place since the Representative&#8217;s visit to the country 
in 2007, the lack of economic opportunities, together with housing, remains the key 
concerns for IDPs in Azerbaijan. According to Government figures, the poverty level 
among IDPs currently stands at 25 per cent,19 which is substantially less than the 63 per 
cent poverty rate among the displaced reported in 2007.20 It is nonetheless significantly 
higher than the overall poverty rate of 13.2 per cent among the general population.21 
</p>
<p>30. Moreover, in line with the discrepancy in general poverty rates between rural and 
urban residents, poverty is also more prevalent among IDPs in rural areas. However, it is 
worth noting that the State benefits they receive appear to render them less vulnerable to 
extreme poverty than their local counterparts.22 Furthermore, while living in Baku appears 
to decrease the incidence of poverty among displaced persons, their living conditions in 
other major cities such as Ganja and Sumgait vastly increase the incidence of poverty.23  
</p>
<p>31. Higher poverty rates among IDPs also reflect their overrepresentation among the 
unemployed. While constituting 7 per cent of the overall population, they represent 13.4 per 
cent of all registered unemployed in the country.24 In a 2008 study, it was estimated that 
over half of IDPs are not active participants in the labour force, i.e., they are neither 
working nor looking for jobs, in comparison to 36 per cent of the general population.25 
</p>
<p>32. Laudable new efforts have been made by the Government and the international 
community to enhance livelihood opportunities for IDPs over the last several years. Most 
notably, in May 2008, the World Bank and the Government of Azerbaijan concluded a new 
project agreement of US$ 24 million covering the period 2009&#8211;2011, to support the 
economic development of IDPs. Moreover, according to the Government, over 17,000 IDPs

<p>benefited from new community microprojects implemented in 2009, within the framework 
of new credit agreements.26 Other programmes, such as those provided by regional 
vocational centres, seasonal work programmes and business training for small 
entrepreneurs, as well as initiatives to create new farms, and construction works in new 
settlements, have benefited IDPs as well as the general population.27 These efforts 
complement the long-standing employment and small business assistance programmes 
targeting the displaced, which are provided by the Social Fund for Development of 
Internally Displaced Persons.28 
</p>
<p>33. Despite some of these efforts, livelihood and employment opportunities do not 
appear to have substantially improved for IDPs, and in particular for those living in rural or 
semi-rural settlements. While persons living in such settlements are often allocated small 
plots of land in which they can grow a limited amount of vegetables or raise small animals 
for domestic consumption, such activities are insufficient in themselves to provide for their 
needs and can at best supplement other sources of revenue. Often located in remote areas, at 
considerable distances from major urban areas, and with no public transportation easily 
available, IDPs in these settlements continue to have few, if any, livelihood or employment 
prospects. In this regard, the Representative remains concerned during this second visit, by 
the dependency syndrome being engendered among these displaced communities &#8211; which is 
increasingly diminishing their prospects for becoming economically active and self-
sufficient. 
</p>
<p>34. Self-sufficiency also appears to be difficult to attain among IDPs who are working, 
however. According to a World Bank study, approximately 73 per cent of IDPs reported 
Government assistance as their main source of livelihood, and only 15 per cent claimed to 
rely on their own earnings (e.g. from employment). One of the most important sources of 
income for the internally displaced is Government assistance in the form of social transfers 
and exemptions, which amounts to more than half of their overall income. This renders 
them more vulnerable to possible changes in Government policy than the rest of the 
population, since they are heavily dependent on sources of livelihood which are effectively 
outside their control.29 
</p>
<p>35. IDPs remain exempt in whole or in part from many charges and taxes, including 
household utilities, and educational and health-care fees. This additional social protection 
and assistance has managed to reduce their poverty levels, particularly over the last five 
years,30 and to protect the most vulnerable groups of internally displaced from some the 
worst effects of poverty. The latter may also be eligible for targeted social assistance 
benefits, based on the Law on Targeted Social Assistance which came into effect in 2009. 
According to Government information, over 166,332 families have had access to these 
benefits, of which 11,212 were IDPs.31 
</p>
<p>36. While many IDPs continue to depend on Government assistance to make ends meet, 
others are likely to no longer be in need of such assistance. The Representative therefore 
recommends and agrees with the Government that it would now be timely to undertake a 
comprehensive needs assessment to determine more precisely who among the internally 
displaced population is actually still in need of specific assistance. This would allow, 
among other things, the Government to better target assistance to the most vulnerable and

<p>estimate the numbers of persons who have achieved economic self-sufficiency in their new 
place of residence. It would, in addition, enable the Government to determine more 
precisely the patterns of dependence on different forms of State assistance and the differing 
needs in the major regions of the country. In Baku, where over 200,000 of the displaced 
live, it would be important to understand the level of economic self-sufficiency that has 
been achieved, what measures are still necessary in order to improve this and what are the 
current needs of the most vulnerable.  
</p>
<p>37. In other cities, rural areas and new settlements, the overall dependence on 
Government assistance and poverty among the displaced is clearer due to the lack of job 
prospects and other indicators. Measures to improve livelihood opportunities in the regions, 
and rural areas in particular, would be essential to break the cycle of chronic dependency 
that has affected displaced populations in these areas; a cycle of dependency that is at risk 
of becoming a cycle of poverty should Government assistance be diminished in the future. 
While many displaced may have been attracted by the better housing conditions in these 
new settlements, the conditions of isolation and dependency resulting from the lack of 
livelihood opportunities in these settlements are most likely to increase their economic and 
social vulnerability in the future &#8211; and render them ill-equipped to rebuild their lives in their 
place of origin should returns become possible.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Education  
</b></p>
<p>38. There continues to be a lack of sufficient information with regard to the educational 
patterns and needs of IDPs, and children in particular. According to the 2009 Gaps 
Analysis, the level of literacy among displaced communities, which stands at 97.1 per cent, 
is not considerably different from the rest of the population.  
</p>
<p>39. However, no precise data is available on the countrywide enrolment of children from 
displaced communities, as compared to local enrolment rates.32 Such information would be 
useful in view of concerns about early marriage, poverty and child labour among some 
displaced children, which are noted as possible reasons for school dropouts in displaced 
communities &#8211; although it is unclear at the moment whether these phenomena are more 
prevalent among displaced communities than among the general population.33  
</p>
<p>40. The Representative found that despite persistent concerns regarding the quality of 
education of children from these communities, the Government had not yet undertaken a 
study on this issue, despite their assurances to this effect during his visit in 2007.34 He 
acknowledges that some significant efforts have been made to improve the educational 
sector overall. These include the construction of over 2,000 schools and the refurbishing of 
many others over the last five years, the provision by the State of free school books (from 
the first to the eleventh grade) and a programme to make computers available in all 
schools.35 It is unclear however, to what extent the construction and refurbishing of school 
buildings have benefited children from displaced communities. Many parents of displaced 
children continue to express concern that their schools are substandard, and note in 
particular, inadequate school infrastructure, and the lack of adequate educational facilities, 
equipment, playgrounds, and qualified teachers, especially in rural IDP settlements &#8211; thus

<p>leading to the recommendation during a workshop in March 2010 that assessments be 
conducted in this regard.36 
</p>
<p>41. Moreover, the Representative stresses that while the national strategy to improve 
Azerbaijan&#8217;s educational system, and the new incentives programmes to encourage teachers 
to work in rural areas is expected to also have a positive impact on displaced communities, 
it would be important for the Ministry of Education to undertake a review of the remaining 
substandard IDP schools, as well as a study to assess the quality of education being 
provided to children from internally displaced communities.  
</p>
<p>42. The Representative welcomes that the previous official segregation policy in schools 
in Azerbaijan between IDP and non-IDP children has been abolished. Parents may therefore 
now elect whether they wish their children to go to a mixed school or one primarily 
attended by displaced children. In certain areas, however, this choice may either not exist in 
practice, such as in settlements consisting only of displaced persons, or may be limited by 
the fact that in some instances IDPs are unable to afford the expenses related to the 
requirements of local schools (e.g. clothing and equipment),37 whereas IDP schools may 
exercise more flexibility in this regard. 
</p>
<p>43. During a visit to a school in one such new settlement conducted in the course of his 
mission, the Representative noted that all the children with whom he spoke, including 
children of kindergarten age, articulated their fervent wish to return to their place of origin. 
This strong emphasis on history, and in particular on return to their place of origin, is 
perhaps best understood in the context of the separate administrative structure which 
applies to IDP schools; a structure which is based on a policy of maintaining the original 
administrative structures in existence before the conflict, including the executive as well as 
the school structures. Thus, schools from those regions are virtually recreated or transferred 
to other locations in the country, with the same administrative structure, staff and name as 
they originally had, and with children from those regions also being registered in that 
school. According to the Ministry of Education, maintaining these administrative structures 
in place is expected to facilitate the speedy relocation and operation of these schools once 
return to their place of origin is made possible.38 While noting the reasons for this policy the 
Representative would encourage the Government of Azerbaijan to promote mixed schools 
in order to facilitate the integration of displaced children and to place more emphasis on 
aspects conducive to reconciliation which will be essential should return become feasible. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Health  
</b></p>
<p>44. In his 2007 report on his mission to Azerbaijan, the Representative noted the 
psychological stress experienced by IDPs due, among other factors, to experience of war, 
isolation, uncertainty about their future and their living conditions. It was also concluded 
that there was a lack of adequate structures and services to address mental health issues 
among displaced communities.39 At the time of the Representative&#8217;s visit in 2010, some 
notable plans and initiatives were being developed in this regard, to improve the situation. 
These include a World Health Organization in-depth study on the mental health of IDPs, 
conducted in collaboration with the Government of Azerbaijan, and a number of other

<p>United Nations agencies.40 Preliminary results of the assessment confirm that mental health 
issues continue to be of concern and that internally displaced persons continue to need 
assistance in this area. In particular, the results showed that mental health issues were twice 
as prevalent among internally displaced women as men. In Azerbaijani society, mental 
health problems continue to be affected by social stigma, a factor which should also be 
included in a mental health strategy.  
</p>
<p>45. The Representative was encouraged to learn from the Ministry of Health that a 
national plan was to be developed as a result of this study, and that other important health 
reform initiatives were being undertaken in the country more generally. As part of these 
reforms, the Ministry informed that mental health problems would now be included as an 
integral part of primary health services, especially on an outpatient basis, that the number of 
doctors addressing mental health problems would be increased by 40 per cent and that other 
activities were being planned in the area of rehabilitation for patients with mental health 
problems. In view of the mental health assessment undertaken by the World Health 
Organization, these services would be provided to IDPs as a first priority. 
</p><p>46. According to national legislation, public health care is free of charge in Azerbaijan. 
However, IDPs, like the overall population, face certain problems accessing adequate 
health care. In urban areas, access to basic health care is generally seen as adequate by most 
displaced persons, although poor urban families and vulnerable groups such as the elderly, 
single mothers and disabled persons experience more difficulties in this respect. In 
particular, IDPs in rural areas and more remote settlements continue to have poor access to 
health-care services, despite the more recent construction of some new medical facilities in 
a number of settlements. This was confirmed in the 2009 Gaps Analysis, which noted that 
the remote location of some settlements made it difficult to access health facilities and to 
receive specialized services such as gynaecological care or treatment for chronic conditions 
such as diabetes and tuberculosis.41 The Representative also noted that, while IDPs face 
many of the same obstacles in accessing adequate health care as other citizens, other 
factors, such as poverty levels, distances to health facilities, sanitary conditions, 
psychological factors associated with forced displacement and the lack of certain services &#8211; 
such as regular availability of clean water and heating in winter &#8211; continue to negatively 
influence the health of some IDPs. 
</p>
<p>47. The lack of medical personnel in particular, is a key challenge in rural areas and 
more remote parts of the country, a problem which affects IDPs living in such areas. In this 
regard, the Representative was also encouraged to learn during this last visit, that the 
Government, including the Ministry of Health, had begun to implement new reforms 
providing special incentives such as better wages and housing for professionals such as 
doctors and teachers to work in more remote regions of the country. According to the 
Ministry of Health, this programme has already begun to show results with 50 per cent of 
new graduates going to work in remote areas in the last year. 
</p>
<p>48. The Representative was also informed that a survey on reproductive health among 
IDPs had recently been conducted. While the results had not yet been analysed at the time 
of the visit, the Ministry of Health reported that initial results indicated multiple 
pregnancies a year among some communities. This may indicate a need for further focus on 
internally displaced communities with regard to family planning and reproductive health 
issues. Internally displaced women, and especially single mothers, are also reported to often 
have difficulty in accessing skilled antenatal care and gynaecological services, owing to 
lack of resources or available specialized staff and equipment.  
</p>
<p>  
 40 The final draft of this study was submitted to the Minister of Health for consideration and for further 
</p>
<p>submission to the Cabinet of Ministers.

<p>49. By law, IDPs are to be provided many types of medication free of charge. However, 
in practice, they &#8211; like other parts of the population &#8211; may sometimes face obstacles in 
accessing it due to the need to pay unofficial fees, or because geographic distances mean 
that they must pay fees to ensure a speedier delivery of the medicine to remote regions. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Registration, documentation and freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. IDP registration / certificates 
</b></p>
<p>50. According to the 2009 Gaps Analysis, IDPs often continue to experience difficulties 
in obtaining the documents necessary for a certificate confirming their internally displaced 
person status (IDP certificate) &#8211; a status formally entitling them to related assistance, free 
medical care and exemption from payment of taxes or utilities. Documents required to 
obtain an IDP certificate include evidence of their place of origin and original personal 
identification documents. Persons who fled without essential documents, and who now 
reside in rural or remote areas, often face important bureaucratic obstacles, corruption and 
delays in obtaining such documentation. As a result some IDPs decide not to obtain IDP 
certificates. Persons who are dependant on others and have limited knowledge of legal 
procedures or limited access to local authorities, such as single mothers and women living 
in rural areas, elderly persons, orphans and children over 16 years of age, may also have 
particular difficulty in obtaining IDP certificates. 
</p>
<p>51. In the Representative&#8217;s mission report to Azerbaijan in 2007, he noted that less than 
half of internally displaced persons possessed IDP certificates.42According to information 
he has received at present, it is difficult to gauge whether this estimate continues to be 
accurate. Indeed, while noting certain difficulties in obtaining this certificate, estimates on 
the current scale of the problem are not possible since some displaced persons, in particular 
those living in remote rural areas, do not report to authorities in order to register for IDP 
certificates. 43 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Residency documents and freedom of residence 
</b></p>
<p>52. During his visit in April 2007, the Representative was informed that the Government 
was in the process of amending legislation related to residency registration requirements, 
with a view to improving the rights of freedom of movement and choice of residence for 
IDPs in the country.44 To date, however, such reforms have not taken place, and IDPs 
continue to experience significant obstacles in obtaining residency documents in their 
elected place of residence owing to Government policies designed to limit urban migration. 
Residency registration is necessary in order to access an important range of rights and 
benefits, including access to: formal employment or Government assistance; health care, 
education and other communal services; pensions; bank loans and judicial procedures, 
including those related to property rights. Moving their district of residence also indirectly 
affects on their eligibility to receive IDP-specific Government assistance and social 
entitlements such as a monthly subsistence allowance.45 
</p>
<p>53. Moreover, while in theory IDP certificates can be reissued with a new place of 
residence &#8211; should it be approved (which is a rare occurrence), IDPs must demonstrate that 
they will not need Government assistance or benefits. In practice, because few can meet 
this criteria, many families opt to remain registered in their former place of residence so as 
not to lose Government assistance and to have one family member, often the male head of

<p>household, move informally to another district in search of employment.46 Despite 
guarantees of freedom of movement and residence in the Azerbaijani Constitution, IDPs 
continue to be limited by administrative rules which limit their choice of place of residence 
and eligibility to receive IDP-specific Government assistance. At the same time, IDPs who 
continue to be disproportionately affected by unemployment and poverty are often 
compelled by these Government policies to remain or move to remote IDP settlements, 
including newly constructed settlements increasingly close to the contact line. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Participation  
</b></p>
<p>54. While the participation of IDPs in decisions which affect them is always an 
important right and a vital part of successful programmes and strategies to assist them, the 
protracted nature of the displacement in Azerbaijan has come to make this an urgent need. 
The lack of information, consultation and participation of IDPs has been noted, for 
example, in relation to decisions on the establishment of new IDP settlements. In addition 
to their lack of participation in the development of resettlement programmes, it is unclear 
how much information has been provided to them on the location, infrastructure and 
livelihood opportunities available to them in new settlements, which are often in remote 
locations with little if any transportation facilities.47 Similarly, there is little evidence that 
full information is provided to IDPs, or that they are adequately consulted in relation to 
housing plans in urban areas. IDPs have generally not been included in the development 
and implementation of Government policies and programmes to respond to their needs, 
either during displacement or with regard to durable solutions.48 This may result in 
programmes and policies that do not properly take into account the needs of this population, 
including the specific needs of particularly vulnerable groups such as the elderly persons 
with disabilities and female-headed households. The Representative strongly encourages 
the Government of Azerbaijan to more fully and actively promote consultations and the 
participation of IDPs, including vulnerable groups, in all programmes and decisions which 
may impact on their lives both in the immediate and the long-term future. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Particularly vulnerable groups  
</b></p>
<p>55. The internally displaced population in Azerbaijan is approximately equally divided 
between women (50.9 per cent) and men (49.1 per cent), with a relatively high proportion 
of children (33.4 per cent) and elderly persons (11.4 per cent).49 Displacement has had a 
particularly negative impact on women, children and the elderly, including both on their 
psychological and social well-being, but also in terms of the isolation and marginalization 
they suffer as a result of difficulties in integrating the labour market or becoming self-
reliant. Feelings of dependency, uncertainty about the future, and poverty continue to 
deeply affect internally displaced communities in general, and in particular their social 
integration and mental health. 
</p>
<p>56. Women, and especially female-headed households and single mothers, are reported 
to be particularly affected by isolation and, as outlined above, mental health problems, as 
well as by the lack of access to livelihoods and resources &#8211; a factor which further 
exacerbates their social vulnerability and health condition. In addition, awareness of 
gender-based violence is low among these communities, as well as among police and 
medical staff, and limited medical, legal or psychological services are available for

<p>survivors. Yet gender-based violence, including domestic violence, sexual harassment, 
early marriage and both psychological and physical abuse are believed to often occur within 
internally displaced families and communities. More recently, some local authorities, such 
as in Gabala, have introduced measures to combat sexual and gender-based violence, 
including reporting and support mechanisms for survivors.50 
</p>
<p>57. There are reports that some children from internally displaced communities have had 
to drop out of school in order to help their families financially, a phenomenon which also 
exists more generally among poor rural populations. In the case of adolescent girls from 
poor displaced families, they are sometimes forced to leave school due to early marriage.51 
As regards persons with disabilities or other specific needs, and older persons, while they 
are specifically included in national IDP programmes, in practice few measures exist to 
identify and respond to their specific needs.52 They do receive some social assistance, 
however, and are not discriminated against with regard to access to shelter or the allocation 
of new housing, although the construction of ramps and other facilities for disabled persons 
have been recommended to the Government.53 
</p>
<p><b> V. Returns and other durable solutions 
</b></p>
<p>58. Ultimately, it is difficult to find durable solutions for the IDPs in Azerbaijan without 
a comprehensive peace agreement over Nagorno-Karabakh that addresses the specific 
rights and needs of the displaced. While some initiatives have been undertaken to advance 
peace negotiations since the Representative&#8217;s first visit to Azerbaijan, including through the 
&#8220;Madrid Principles&#8221; presented by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe 
(OSCE) Minsk Group Co-Chairs in Madrid on 29 November 2007 to Azerbaijan and 
Armenia as a set of basic principles for the peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict:54 to date these have not provided a concrete resolution to the political impasse over 
Nagorno-Karabakh.  
</p>
<p>59. As during his last visit, the Representative noted that the majority of IDPs he met 
with continue to express their desire to return to their place of origin and have thus been 
unable to find a durable solution to their displacement. The return to their place of origin is 
dependent on a settlement of the conflict, while at the same time their possibilities for local 
integration in their current place of residence have been restricted by policies which 
consider the settlement of IDPs as temporary and fail to sufficiently promote social 
integration or create livelihood opportunities which would foster self-reliance.

<p>60. The protracted nature of the displacement has nonetheless meant that a significant 
number of IDPs have begun a new life, particularly in urban areas. Some of them may wish 
to stay in their new place of residence, even if return becomes possible. This is particularly 
true for those who have found work or support networks in urban areas and for the youth, 
many of whom will never have lived in the place of origin of their families. The 
Representative therefore reiterates the need to ensure respect for the right of IDPs to choose 
between return and integration in the area of displacement or in another part of the country. 
</p>
<p>61. He also continues to be convinced that both the success of local integration and 
returns is contingent on the economic and livelihood opportunities which IDPs enjoyed 
during their displacement. The longer-displaced populations suffer from unemployment, 
poverty, dependency and the lack of meaningful activities, the less they will be equipped to 
deal with the challenges of return and reconstructing a new life. 
</p>
<p>62. Further efforts would be necessary in this regard, in the context of the Government 
relocation programmes to newly constructed IDP settlements as well, such as those in 
Fuzuli. While some of these settlements may be considered by some IDPs as temporary 
relocation sites which provided much needed housing alternatives, for others they may 
represent a long-term solution to displacement. In this context, Government assessments of 
these settlements and projects to improve infrastructure, services, transportation and 
employment opportunities would be necessary in order to render these settlements viable 
for durable solutions. 
</p>
<p>63. The Representative noted that, while more programmes promoting livelihood 
opportunities were still needed, some IDPs may after all these years have become self-
reliant and integrated into their new place of residence. In this context, it would be 
opportune at this stage to conduct a needs assessment or profiling exercise in order to 
identify IDPs who are still in need of specific assistance, and those who no longer need 
special assistance. Such a survey could serve not only to determine the specific groups and 
the numbers of IDPs still in need of assistance, but would also provide an indication of the 
readiness, capacity and resources of these persons to successfully return, locally integrate or 
resettle in a different location. 
</p>
<p>64. Simultaneously, conducting a survey (suggested to be an anonymous survey or one 
conducted by independent partners) on intentions with regard to durable solutions among 
the internally displaced population in the country would contribute towards a realistic and 
multifaceted Government strategy, not only for returnees but also for groups opting for 
alternative solutions.  
</p>
<p>65. The Government has developed a &#8220;Great Return Programme&#8221;, which asserts the 
principle of voluntary return in the context of an eventual settlement of the Nagorno-
Karabakh conflict. The Representative is encouraged by efforts to prepare a return 
programme and urges the Government of Azerbaijan to further these efforts by developing 
a strategic action plan which could serve in the technical implementation of the programme. 
In particular, such an action plan could address the complex issues which cannot be 
properly addressed in the course of a rapid and mass return movement, such as the 
challenge of building a new market economy, addressing property issues and privatization, 
ensuring the issuance of demining certificates and increasing the capacity of relevant actors. 
The expertise of different agencies and actors, such as UNHCR and development 
organizations, could provide valuable technical assistance in this regard. 
</p>
<p>66. In addition, the recent return of some IDPs to some areas near the contact line, such 
as certain areas in Fuzuli, could provide some lessons learned and examples of the future 
challenges such as establishing basic infrastructures, addressing property rights and other 
legal issues and creating other conditions for sustainable returns. Best practices from other 
countries and lessons learnt from these recent returns, could be integrated into a strategic </p>

<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>action plan for the return of other IDPs to their place of origin, in the event of an eventual 
peace settlement. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> The Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons concludes that the Government of Azerbaijan has made significant 
progress in improving many aspects of the lives of IDPs since his visit to the country in 
2007. He commends the Government of Azerbaijan for continuing to assume the 
primary responsibility for the care and protection of the close to 600,000 IDPs in the 
country. This has been accompanied by important budgetary allocations towards the 
implementation of its 2004 State Programme on Internally Displaced Persons and 
increased cooperation with key counterparts in the international and non-
governmental communities that can provide valuable technical assistance. 
Simultaneously, the Government is undertaking a number of broader social reforms 
in the country which the Representative believes will also contribute to improving the 
lives of IDPs. 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> However, IDPs continue to face a number of problems, some of which are 
increasingly related to the protracted nature of their displacement. In addition, the 
vast majority have not found a durable solution to their situation. The full restoration 
of the human rights of IDPs requires first and foremost, a resolution to the 
outstanding peace negotiations over the Nagorno-Karabak conflict, so that those who 
wish to do so may exercise their right to return to their place of origin. 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> The Representative renews his appeal to the international community to 
strengthen their efforts to find a process which can advance peace negotiations, 
implement Security Council resolutions calling for the withdrawal of occupying forces 
and secure the return in safety and dignity of displaced persons on both sides to their 
places of origin.</b>55<b>  
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> The Representative noted a number of areas and rights which, despite some 
substantial improvements, continue to require particular attention and efforts in 
order to improve the situation of internally displaced persons: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) In the area of housing, the substantial progress made over the last three 
years, which includes the closing of &#8220;tented camps&#8221; and railway carriages, the 
construction of thousands of houses in new settlements and recent plans to build new 
apartment buildings in order to address the problem of overcrowded and substandard 
collective centres in urban areas, including in Baku. However, more efforts and new 
housing strategies are necessary, particularly as housing security for IDPs may 
become increasingly precarious in view of the pressures of urbanization, economic 
expansion in large cities and privatization. An increased risk of evictions of IDPs exists 
as a consequence of decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and the 
domestic courts. Developing alternative housing strategies should be a priority in the 
coming years. Such strategies could include measures such as rental subsidies, or 
special rental agreements between the state and private owners. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Important new reforms to the health sector, the construction of new 
medical facilities in some settlements, as well as other initiatives such as the mental 
health assessment of IDPs, have contributed significantly to improving the health 
prospects for this population. The Representative encourages the Government of 
Azerbaijan, to rapidly develop an action plan to implement the recommendations of 
</b></p>
<p>  
 55 Security Council resolutions 822, 884, and 874 (1993). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>the mental health assessment of the World Health Organization, together with key 
international and non-governmental actors. He further highlights the continued need 
to increase access to specialized medical services such as gynaecology and treatment 
for chronic diseases, and to monitor and address complaints related to the demand for 
informal medical fees. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The lack of employment and livelihood opportunities continues to be an 
area of major concern for IDPs. Despite some efforts in this regard over the last years, 
the majority of IDPs continue to depend on Government assistance to make ends meet, 
and cannot be considered economically self-reliant. Despite improvements in the 
overall figures, they continue to suffer from disproportionately high poverty and 
unemployment rates as compared to the overall population. The Representative calls 
on the Government and other stakeholders to strengthen efforts and programmes 
designed to improve the economic integration and employment opportunities of IDPs 
and to foster their self-reliance. He recommends that an assessment of livelihood 
opportunities should be an integral aspect of all IDP related policies and programmes, 
including housing. He also notes that certain groups among the internally displaced 
population, including persons who have lived in isolated settlements (including youth) 
or who have been unemployed for many years, as well as female-headed households 
and the elderly will require special assistance in many cases, both through State 
benefits which allow for an adequate standard of living, and to prepare them for re-
entry into the labour market. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) While important efforts to improve national educational infrastructures 
can be noted, the overall progress in improving the quality of education of IDPs 
remains unclear. As recommended in his last mission report, the Representative 
encourages the Government to conduct a study to determine the level and quality of 
education provided to IDPs. Such a study would provide a basis for objectively 
determining the quality of education that children from displaced communities have 
been receiving, as well as for filling any gaps in this regard through specific 
programmes. Mixed schools should be promoted, so as to foster greater social 
integration of children from displaced communities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Difficulties in obtaining necessary documents continue to effect access by 
IDPs to basic rights and services. Persons with special needs such as older persons or 
those with disabilities, those who fled without their essential personal documents, and 
persons living in isolated areas are particularly affected. The Representative urges the 
Government to take measures such as simplified documentation procedures, allowing 
for &#8220;alternative&#8221; documents when those normally required are not available wherever 
possible in order to ensure that their rights are not adversely affected by such 
problems. The Representative also encourages international and non-governmental 
organizations to continue and strengthen their efforts in this regards, including 
through legal aid services. 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> While notable efforts have been made to improve the overall situation of many 
IDPs, the Representative believes that more targeted measures addressing the specific 
needs of particularly vulnerable groups, including female-headed households, the 
elderly, orphaned children and disabled persons, are necessary. The Representative 
recommends the Government, as well as relevant international and non-governmental 
organizations, take measures to better identify vulnerable groups, ensure that their 
specific needs are taken into account in all programmes and policies on internal 
displacement and actively promote targeted intervention and assistance programmes. 
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> IDPs in Azerbaijan have now been displaced for nearly two decades. During 
this time, some have found a durable solution in their current place of residence and 
have successfully reintegrated into mainstream society both economically and 
otherwise. Therefore, while they may still have IDP-specific issues, such as those </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>related to property restitution or compensation, they may no longer be in need of 
Government assistance and benefits specifically targeting IDPs. The Representative 
therefore recommends that a needs assessment be conducted among the internally 
displaced population in order to determine who is still in need of assistance, de-
register those who no longer require assistance from the list of beneficiaries and 
provide more targeted or increased assistance to particularly vulnerable groups. 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> The Representative commends the Government of Azerbaijan for its 
commitment to develop a comprehensive framework or action plan for the practical 
implementation of the &#8220;Great Return Programme&#8221;. Such a framework would be 
invaluable in addressing many of the complex and technical aspects related to 
eventual returns (e.g. infrastructure, economic and property issues) and greatly 
improve the state of preparedness should progress in the ongoing peace negotiations 
allow for voluntary returns. In light of the expertise of some international 
organizations, including key development, human rights and humanitarian actors, the 
Representative would recommend close collaboration between these actors, the 
Government and internally displaced communities in the elaboration of such a 
framework. A survey of intentions and the profile of possible returnees would also 
enable a more accurate planning process for eventual returns. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>While voluntary return remains the preferred solution for the majority of 
IDPs, the Representative encourages the development of policies and strategies which 
will foster self-reliance and full social integration for all persons during their 
displacement. The Representative strongly believes that such a policy would improve 
the chances of a successful reintegration of persons who may eventually return to 
their places of origin, as well as the success of alternative durable solutions such as 
local integration or resettlement in another part of the country, for persons who are 
unable or do not wish to return to their place of origin. For internally displaced 
populations who have been relocated to remote settlements, an assessment of the 
sustainability of durable solutions in these locations would also be necessary, in 
addition to improvements with regard to public services and transportation facilities.</b>
