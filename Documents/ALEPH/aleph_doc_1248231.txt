General and Administrative Expenses
Total general and administrative expenses were $1,168,264 for the year ended October 31, 2005, compared to
$593,477 for the year ended October 31, 2004 for an increase of $574,787. The increase in expenditures is a result
of  the  Company's  increased  activity  due  to  the  commencement  of  production  and  further  exploration  and
development of its oil and gas properties as compared to the comparative period in 2004 when the Company
had just acquired its first oil and gas property and recently commenced exploration activities. In particular, the
Company saw its fees to consultants rise to $301,965 for the year ended October 31, 2005, as compared with
$117,682 for the prior year. The consulting expenses included $240,000 for technical consulting services for
administering the oil and gas operations, as compared to $60,000 in the comparative period.
Interest Revenue and Expenses
Interest revenue totaled $84,783 and $2,094 for the years ended October 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Interest revenue in both periods was a result of investment of monies raised in equity financings during the
periods and not representative of the on-going operations of the Company. Interest expense for the years
ended October 31, 2005 and 2004 was $79,052 and $5,481, respectively, and was related to the associated
accrued interest regarding the flow through renouncements in the fiscal years 2004 and 2003.
Depletion and Amortization
The Company recorded depletion of its oil and gas properties of $3,841,900 for the year ended October 31,
2005 compared with $506,728 in such expenditure in the comparative period in 2004. The depletion rate for
oil and natural gas properties for the period is based on production volume against the proven producing
reserves of the Company. Included in the depletion amount for the year ended October 31, 2005, is $1,743,462
from the write down of the Company's carrying value of property and equipment that was in excess of the
value  attributed  to  the  assets  by  the  independent  reserve  report.  This  compares  with  $506,728  in  write
downs in the prior year.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
During the quarter ended April 30, 2005, the Company commenced production from its oil and gas properties
and recorded revenue. The commencement of production also increased expenditures of the Company due
to the recording of royalties, operating costs, depletion and accretion.
During the quarter ended October 31, 2005, the Company experienced production from its two Lavoy gas
wells which increased its revenue from gas sales significantly. In addition, the Company experienced higher
commodity prices from the sale of natural gas which increased revenue.
Liquidity
The Company's cash was $2,505,111 as at October 31, 2005 compared to $1,451,252 as at October 31, 2004. At
October 31, 2005, the Company had a working capital deficit of $207,940 compared to working capital of
$828,420 at October 31, 2004.
Cash used in operating activities was $55,473 for the year ended October 31, 2005 as compared to $647,308
for  the  previous  year.  The  improvement  was  largely  due  to  commencement  of  production  from  the
Company's natural gas wells during the current period which provided positive cash flow to the Company's
operations.
The Company received net proceeds from the issuance of its common stock of $12,360,174 for the year ended
October  31,  2005  as  compared  to  $3,752,585  for  the  year  ended  October  31,  2004.  The  Company  used
$11,094,762 of the proceeds for net expenditures on its oil and gas properties during the year ended October
31, 2005 compared with $1,286,894 during the comparative period.
If the Company is unable to obtain the financing necessary to support its operations, it may be unable to
continue as a going concern. The Company currently has no commitments for any credit facilities such as
revolving credit agreements or lines of credit that could provide additional working capital and uncertainty
exists regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has no long term debt,
capital lease obligations, operating leases or any other long term obligations other than its asset retirement
obligation.
The Company is committed to spend $5,968,600 in flow through eligible expenditures by December 31, 2005.
At  October  31,  2005,  the  Company  had  met  its  flow  through  commitment  and  spent  $5,968,600  on  flow
through eligible expenditures.
Capital  Resources
During the year ended October 31, 2005, the Company financed its operations from capital contributions
from shareholders. During the year, the Company closed a brokered private placement of 6,136,364 flow-
through common shares in its capital stock at a price of $0.55 per share and 6,550,000 non-flow-through
common shares in its capital stock at a price of $0.50 per share, for total gross proceeds of $6,650,000 and
net proceeds of $6,003,670. In conjunction with the financing, each flow-through common share and non-
flow-through  common  share  received  a  share  purchase  warrant  which  entitles  the  holder  thereof  to
purchase one additional non-flow-through common share of the Company at a price of $0.65 per share for
the first year and $0.85 for the second year.  Agents fees of $532,000 were paid in connection with the
private placement. The agent also received 1,268,637 units exercisable at $0.50 for two years. Each unit is
comprised on one share and one half of one share purchase warrant, each whole warrant exercisable to
purchase one additional common share for a period of two years at a price of $0.65 for the first year and
$0.85 during the second year.
As at the date of this MD&A, the Company has no other arrangement for sources of financing. Subsequent to
the year ended October 31, 2005, 8,562,210 warrants were exercised for gross proceeds of $5,565,437.
Related  Par ty  Transactions
During  the  year  ended  October  31,  2005,  the  Company  paid  or  accrued  $121,700  (2004  -  $73,450)  for
management fees to companies controlled by officers of the Company.
During the year ended October 31, 2005, $265,884 (2004 - $135,500) was paid or accrued to directors or
companies controlled by directors of the Company for consulting and technical consulting services.
Pursuant  to  an  agreement  with  Tenax  Energy  Inc.,  a  related  entity  with  a  director  in  common  with  the
Company,  the  Company  agreed  to  pay  a  2.5%  gross  overriding  royalty  on  all  petroleum  and  natural  gas
rights. During the year ended October 31, 3005, the Company paid or accrued gross overriding royalties of
$70,413 (2004 - $nil) to Tenax.
During  the  year  ended  October  31,  2005,  the  Company  received  regulatory  approval  of  the  agreement
between the Company and Kanatex Resource Management Ltd. (“Kanatex”) to acquire from Kanatex, all of
their interest in an option to lease all undisposed oil and natural gas rights on Reserves held by a Northern
First Nation. The Company issued to Kanatex 2,000,000 escrowed commons shares, paid $100,000 in cash and
paid  $110,000  in  technical  consulting  fees  to  February  2004,  pursuant  to  the  agreement.  The  Company
attributed no value to the 2,000,000 shares because the shares are subject to escrow, pending a valuation
report to the satisfaction of regulators. The determination on the number of shares that were issued to
Kanatax was based on management's opinion of fair value. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company
is  obligated  to  pay  $1  million  in  cash  (or  equivalent  amount  of  common  shares)  on  the  earlier  of  first
production or conveyance of the land, subject to regulatory approval. The Company has also granted a 1.5%
gross  overriding  royalty  to  Kanatex  on  any  production  from  the  land.  Kanatex  is  a  related  party  to  the
Company by virtue of sharing a common director.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
Grouard, Alberta 
In late September, 2004, the Company began its exploration program on the Grouard/Kapawe'no property.
Initially the 11-33 gas test well was drilled and production tested, and a 24 Kilometer 2D seismic program was
shot  and  processed  for  interpretation.  The  11-33  well  was  subsequently  equipped  for  production  and
pipelined to a third party facility and began producing gas in February 2005.
In  February  2005,  the  Company  entered  into  various  pooling  arrangements  with  other  explorers  whom
owned lands adjacent to the Company's. The Company is required to complete drilling spacing units before
certain wells could be drilled.  The first of such joint wells, 15-32, which the Company holds a 23.6% interest,
was operated by an industry partner. The well was drilled in late February 2005, logged, cased and tested for
commercial quantities of gas. The well was determined to be marginal and will likely be abandoned in 2007.
In January and February 2005, the Company completed other pooling arrangements and acquired an 87.5%
interest in certain Alberta Provincial Crown land rights north of the Company's existing holdings. In March
2005, the Company operated and drilled two new exploration prospects namely the 12-3 and 8-4 test wells.
These  wells  were  logged,  cased  and  subsequently  tested  various  zones  in  each  well.  In  May  2005,  the
Company purchased an 87.5% interest additional crown land rights adjacent to the wells drilled in March
2005. During the month of June 2005, the Company participated in drilling a new pooled land operated by
an industry partner. The 9-32 gas test well is currently standing after being logged, cased and tested. The
well could be a marginal producer provided the pipeline tie-in costs do not exceed its economic value. The
Company continues to evaluate the options.
In  late  August  2005,  the  Company  shot  additional  2D  seismic  across  its  land  and  proceeded  to  drill  two
Company operated new exploration wells. The wells were drilled, logged, cased and tested by early October
2005 and one of the new wells, 7-33, was subsequently pipelined and tied in for gas production which began
in November 2005. The second well, 14-9, remains standing pending further evaluation.
The Company commenced the regulatory approvals process to tie-in the 8-4 and 12-3 wells for gas production
in late November 2005 with construction and new gas production estimated to begin in early 2006. The
Company continues to flow all its gas production in the Grouard area through a third party facility which
operates under a manageable volume restriction.
The Company is in the process of finalizing plans to drill additional wells and shoot additional seismic in the
Grouard area in 2006.
Lavoy, Alberta
The Company acquired the Lavoy property via a crown land sale and retains a 100% working interest. During
the year ended October 31, 2005, the Company purchased seismic data and in February 2005 drilled a gas
test well to a depth of 650 meters resulting in the discovery of a new gas pool. The test well encountered
gas in six separate and distinct zones and began producing from both the basal quartz and regional colony
zones in August 2005. The Company surveyed and licensed a follow-up well that was drilled in June 2005 into
the new discovery pool based on data obtained from the initial well. The well was fracture stimulated and
began  producing  from  both  a  Viking  sand  and  a  Colony  channel.  The  Company  recently  installed  a
compressor and the two wells are producing at a combined rate of 1,000 Mcf/day at October 31, 2005. The
Company continues to experience third party facility line pressures which tend to reduce production from
the wells and has experienced mechanical problems with dually completed production setups in the wells.
Senlac, Saskatchewan
The Company acquired the Senlac property via a crown land sale and retains a 100% working interest. During
the year ended October 31, 2005, the Company purchased seismic data and in November 2005 drilled a gas
test well to a depth of 800 meters encountering gas in the two separate zones. The well was successfully
completed and subsequent testing indicates that the well should produce at a rate of approximately 500 to
600  Mcf/day  (80  to  100  barrels  of  oil  equivalent  per  day)  depending  on  third-party  restrictions.  A  two
kilometers pipeline tie-in to an existing third party facility is complete and production from the new gas well
has commenced.
Fort Pitt, Saskatchewan
The Company acquired the Fort Pitt property via a crown land sale and retains a 100% working interest.
During the year ended October 31, 2005, the Company purchased seismic data and in November 2005 drilled
a gas test well to a depth of depth of 800 meters encountering gas in various zones. The well has been
successfully completed and awaits the arrival of a test unit for gas production testing.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
Battle Creek, Saskatchewan 
Pursuant to a farm-in agreement entered into during the year ended October 31, 2005, the Company was
committed to drill at least two horizontal development wells in the existing producing Madison formation,
with the additional opportunity to explore for deeper oil. The Company paid 100% of all costs to earn a 70%
working  interest  in  the  wells  and  production.  The  Company  has  also  committed  to  drill  six  vertical  gas
development wells in the existing producing field with a further opportunity to drill an additional infill gas
wells per section. The Company paid 100% of all costs to earn a 67.5% working interest in the gas wells and
production.  During  the  period  the  Company  drilled  both  horizontal  development  oil  wells  in  the  existing
producing Madison formation, and after testing the wells abandoned them due to high water cuts associated
with fractures in the reservoir. The drilling of the six vertical gas development wells in the existing producing
field was completed during the latter part of the current year. During the quarter ended October 31, 2005,
two of the six gas wells had commenced nominal production. The remaining gas wells are expected to begin
production in the first quarter of 2006.
Divide, Saskatchewan 
Pursuant to our shallow gas strategy, the Company entered into a farm-in agreement during the year ended
October 31, 2005, to purchased a 50% working interest in sixteen sections of land and two existing wells and
will jointly drill one exploration gas well and will re-enter the two existing wells to fracture stimulate them
to enhance deliverability. The Company plans to drill additional gas wells in the area after evaluation of the
initial well results and will pay 50% of all costs to earn a 50% working interest in any follow-up well activity.
The Company paid $500,000 to acquire a 50% interest and participate in the Divide joint venture. To date,
the  Company  has  drilled  one  well  and  is  awaiting  long  term  test  results.  The  Company  purchased  an
additional seven sections of land in the Divide area with the Company's joint venture partner and purchased
an additional six sections of land which the Company owns 100%.
Bittern Lake, Alberta 
Pursuant to a farm-in agreement executed during the year ended October 31, 2005, the Company drilled one
exploration gas test well into the Ellerslie formation with the possibility of a deeper Leduc oil test with a
rolling option to continue to develop the gas and or oil play. The Company paid 100% of all costs to earn a
67.5% working interest in the well and any resulting production. The Company drilled the exploration well in
early July 2005. The well was completed and certain zones were briefly production tested and ultimately
proved to be uneconomic and the well was subsequently abandoned. The Company has no further plans for
the area.

This MD&A may contain “forward looking statements” that reflect the Company's current expectations and
projections about its future results.  When used in this MD&A, words such as “estimate”, “intend”, “expect”,
“anticipate” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which, by their
very  nature,  are  not  guarantees  of  the  Company's  future  operational  or  financial  performance,  and  are
subject  to  risks  and  uncertainties  and  other  factors  that  could  cause  the  Company's  actual  results,
performance, prospects or opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these
forward-looking  statements.  These  risks,  uncertainties  and  factors  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:
unavailability  of  financing,  failure  to  identify  commercially  viable  oil  or  gas  reserves,  fluctuations  in  the
market valuation for oil or gas, difficulties in obtaining required approvals for the development of oil or gas
projects and other factors.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only
as  of  the  date  of  this  MD&A  or  as  of  the  date  otherwise  specifically  indicate  herein.  Due  to  risks  and
uncertainties,  including  the  risks  and  uncertainties  identified  above  and  elsewhere  in  this  MD&A,  actual
events may differ materially from current expectations. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation
to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events
or otherwise.
The term barrels of oil equivalent (“BOE”) may be misleading, particularly in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio
of 6:1 is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does
not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. All BOE conversions in this report are derived by converting
natural gas to crude oil in the ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued)
NOTES  TO  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS
Basis  of  Presentation
1.
Northern  Sun  Exploration  Company  Inc.  (the  “Company”)  is  a  Canadian  based  oil  and  gas  exploration
company  whose  oil  and  gas  properties  are  located  in  the  provinces  of  Alberta,  Saskatchewan  and  the
Northwest Territories.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of  assets  and  the  satisfaction  of  liabilities  and  commitments  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  The
Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  is  dependent  upon  the  Company  achieving  profitable
results,  receiving  support  from  its  lenders  and  attracting  sufficient  capital  to  continue  to  develop  and
explore for oil and natural gas.  Management efforts to raise capital have been successful in the past.  The
amount shown as property and equipment represents net costs to date and do not necessarily represent
present or future value.  These financial statements do not reflect adjustments that would be necessary if
the going concern assumption was not appropriate.
2. Significant  accounting  policies
These  financial  statements  of  the  Company  have  been  prepared  by  management  in  accordance  with
Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (“Canadian  GAAP”).    The  preparation  of  financial
statements in conformity with Canadian GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could
differ  from  those  estimates.    The  financial  statements  have,  in  management's  opinion,  been  properly
prepared  using  careful  judgment  with  reasonable  limits  of  materiality  and  within  the  framework  of  the
significant accounting policies summarized below:
(a)  Property and equipment
Oil and gas properties
The  Company  follows  the  full  cost  method  of  accounting.  All  costs  of  acquiring  crude  oil  and
natural gas properties and related exploration and development costs, including overhead charges
directly related to these activities, are capitalized and accumulated in one cost center. The costs
associated  with  the  acquisition  and  evaluation  of  unproved  properties  are  excluded  from  the
depletion  base,  until  such  time  when  proved  reserves  can  be  assigned  to  these  assets.
Maintenance  and  repairs  are  charged  against  income,  and  renewals  and  enhancements  that
extend the economic life of the property and equipment are capitalized.
Gains and losses are not recognized on disposition of oil and natural gas properties unless that
disposition would alter the rate of depletion by 20% or more.
The Company applies a two-stage ceiling test to capitalized costs to ensure that such costs do not
exceed  the  undiscounted  future  cash  flows  from  production  of  proved  reserves.  Undiscounted
future cash flows are calculated based on management's best estimate of forward indexed prices
applied to estimated future production of proved reserves plus anticipated proceeds from the sale
of  undeveloped    properties,  less  estimated  future  operating  costs,  royalties,  future  capital
development costs and abandonment costs. When the carrying amount of a cost centre is not
recoverable  the  second  stage  of  the  process  will  determine  the  impairment  whereby  the  cost
centre  would  be  written  down  to  its  fair  value.  The  second  stage  requires  the  calculation  of
discounted future cash flows from proved plus probable reserves. The fair value is estimated using
the  accepted  present  value  techniques,  which  incorporate  risks  and  other  uncertainties  when
determining expected cash flows.
The  costs  of  unproved  properties  are  excluded  from  the  preceding  impairment  test,  and  are
subject to its own impairment test.
(b) Depletion and depreciation
Capitalized  costs  of  proved  oil  and  gas  properties  are  depleted  using  the  unit  of  production
method based on estimated natural gas reserves before any royalty deductions as determined by
independent engineers.  The basis for this calculation includes the estimated future development
costs  of  proved  undeveloped  reserves.  Natural  gas  is  converted  using  the  equivalent  of  six
thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil.
(c) Revenue recognition
Revenues  associated  with  the  sale  of  natural  gas  are  recognized  when  title  passes  from  the
Company to its customers. Transportation costs are not netted against revenue but included with
production costs as they are not material to disclose separately.
(d) Asset retirement obligation
During  the  prior  year,  the  Company  adopted  CICA  Handbook  Section  3110  “Asset  Retirement
Obligations”.  The Company recognizes the estimated fair value of an Asset Retirement Obligation
(ARO) in the period in which it is incurred when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.
The  fair  value  of  the  estimated  ARO  is  recorded  as  a  long-term  liability  with  a  corresponding
increase in the carrying amount of the related asset. ARO obligations are initially measured at fair
value and subsequently adjusted for the accretion of discount and any changes to the underlying
cash flows. The capitalized amount is depleted on a unit-of-production basis over the life of the
proven reserves. The liability amount is increased each reporting period due to the passage of
time and the amount of accretion is charged to earnings in the period. Revisions to the estimated
timing  of  cash  flows  or  to  the  original  estimated  undiscounted  cost  would  also  result  in  an
increase or decrease to the ARO. Actual costs incurred are charged against the ARO to the extent
of  the  recorded  liability.  Any  difference  between  the  actual  costs  incurred  and  the  recorded
liability is recognized as a gain or loss in the period in which the costs are incurred.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued)

(e)
Joint venture accounting
(i)
Stock-based compensation and other stock-based payments
The  Company  conducts  a  portion  of  its  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  exploration  and  production
activities through joint ventures, and the accounts reflect only its proportionate interest in such
activities.
(f)
Per share amounts
Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing earnings from operations by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
The Company uses the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of stock options and
other dilutive instruments. This method assumes that proceeds received from the exercise of in-
the-money stock options and other instruments, are used to repurchase common shares at the
average market price of the period. Basic net earnings (loss) per common share are determined
by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed by giving effect to the potential
dilution that would occur if stock options and other dilutive instruments were exercised.
(g)
Income taxes
The  Company  follows  the  liability  method  of  accounting  for  income  taxes.  Under  this  method,
future  income  taxes  are  based  on  the  differences  between  assets  and  liabilities  reported  for
accounting purposes from those reported for income tax purposes. The rates used in the future
income tax calculation are enacted or substantively enacted at the time of the calculation. The
effect of a change in rates on future tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period
in which the change occurs.
(h)
Financial instruments
The  Company's  financial  instruments  include  cash,  cash  equivalents,  accounts  receivable,  due
from joint venture partners, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and  amounts due to related
parties. In the opinion of management, the Company is not exposed to significant credit or interest
risk, except as disclosed. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their
fair market values because of the short-term maturity of these items.
The Company uses the fair value method of accounting for the share option plan (Note 5). Under
this method, compensation cost is measured at fair value using the Black Scholes option pricing
model at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period of the option.
Transactions to acquire goods or services by granting equity instruments are accounted for based
on  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  received  or  the  fair  value  of  the  equity  instruments,
whichever is more reliably measured.
(j) Measurement uncertainty
Amounts recorded for depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion and amounts used for
the ceiling test calculation are based on estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves and future
costs required to develop and reclaim and abandon those reserves.
The Black Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded  options  and  warrants  which  have  no  vesting  restrictions  and  are  fully  transferable.    In
addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the
expected stock price volatility.  Because the Company's employee stock options and warrants have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective  input  assumptions  can  materially  affect  the  fair  value  estimate,  in  management's
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value
of its employee stock options and warrants.
The capital expenditures classification made by the Company with respect to the renouncement of
flow-through  shares  is  based  on  estimates  from  geologic  information  obtained  and  the
classification of the expenditures may be challenged by the taxation authorities and in this regard
the assessments may be different from that of management.
The  operations  of  the  Company  are  complex,  and  related  tax  interpretations,  regulations  and
legislation affecting the Company are continually changing.
By their nature, these estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty and the effect on the
financial statements of changes in such estimates in future periods could be significant.

(k)
Flow through shares
Resource expenditure deductions for income tax purposes related to exploratory activities funded
by flowthrough share arrangements are renounced to investors in accordance with income tax
legislation. The Company provides for the future effect on income taxes related to flow-through
shares as a reduction of share capital and an increase in future income tax at the date of the
renunciation.
(l)
Hedging
Effective  January  1,  2004,  the  Company  has  implemented  CICA  Accounting  Guideline  (AcG-13),
"Hedging Relationships", which is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2003. AcG-
13  addresses  the  identification,  designation,  documentation  and  effectiveness  of  hedging
transactions  for  the  purposes  of  applying  hedge  accounting.  It  also  established  conditions  for
applying or discontinuing hedge accounting. Under the new guideline, hedging transactions must
be documented and it must be demonstrated that the hedges are sufficiently effective in order to
continue accrual accounting for position hedges with derivatives. The Company has no hedges in
place at October 31, 2005. As a result, the adoption of AcG-13 had no impact on the Company.
(m) Cash and cash equivalents
Short-term  investments  with  maturities  less  than  three  months  are  considered  to  be  cash
equivalents and are recorded at cost, which approximate market value.
(n) Comparative figures
Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.

Depletion of petroleum and natural gas properties and production assets is determined using the unit of
production method based upon proved recoverable reserves. General and administrative costs related to
exploration and development activities of $328,849 (2004 - $152,000) have been capitalized during the year
ended October 31, 2005.
At October 31, 2005, costs related to undeveloped properties of $5,983,491 (2004 - $1,804,235) were excluded
from the depletion calculation.
During the year ended October 31, 2005, the Company issued 300,000 common shares at a fair value of
$150,000 as a finder's fee for various farm-in agreements for properties in Alberta and Saskatchewan. This
amount was capitalized as acquisition costs. The fair value of the common shares issued was based on the
market price of the Company's common shares on the date the finder's fee agreement was executed.
An impairment test calculation was performed on the Company's property and equipment at October 31,
2005 in which the estimated discounted future net cash flows of the proved reserves and an estimate of the
discounted future net cash flows from the probable reserves associated with the reserves report did exceed
the  carrying  amount  of  the  Company's  property  and  equipment  by  $1,743,462  (2004  -  $506,728)  and  is
included in accumulated depletion, amortization and write-down. The following table outlines benchmark

The undiscounted amount of cash flows, required over the estimated reserve life of the underlying assets,
to  settle  the  obligation,  adjusted  for  inflation,  is  estimated  at $721,538  (October  31,  2004  -  $42,665).  The
obligation was calculated using a credit-adjusted risk free discount rate of 9% and an inflation rate of 2%.
It is expected that this obligation will be funded from general Company resources at the time the costs are
incurred with the majority of costs expected to occur between 2012 and 2015.

8. Contingencies
The Company is subject to various regulatory and statutory requirements relating to the protection of the
environment. These requirements, in addition to contractual agreements and management decisions, result
in the accrual of estimated future removal and site restoration costs. Any changes in these estimates will
affect future earnings.
Costs attributable to these commitments and contingencies are expected to be incurred over an extended
period  of  time  and  are  to  be  funded  mainly  from  the  Company's  cash  provided  by  operating  activities.
Although the ultimate impact of these matters on net earnings cannot be determined at this time, it could
be material for any one quarter or year.
9.  Financial  Instruments
As disclosed in Note 2(h), the Company holds various forms of financial instruments. The nature of these
instruments and the Company's operations expose the Company to commodity price risk and credit risk. The
Company manages its exposure to these risks by operating in a manner that minimizes its exposure to the
extent practical.
The Company will be subject to commodity price risk for the delivery of natural gas and crude oil.
The  Company  may  manage  and  minimize  the  risk  by  entering  into  various  joint  ventures  with
subparticipants.  As  at  October  31,  2005,  the  Company  has  not  entered  into  any  commodity
contracts.
(b)
Credit Risk
A  significant  portion  of  the  Company's  trade  accounts  receivable  are  from  working  interest
partners  in  the  oil  and  gas  industry  and,  as  such,  the  Company  is  exposed  to  all  the  risks
associated  with  that  industry.  At  October  31,  2005  all  of  the  Company's  cash  was  held  at  one
financial institution. At October 31, 2005 $198,903 (2004 - $Nil) was receivable from the Company's
joint venture partners.
(c)
Interest Rate Risk
Included in cash and cash equivalents is a 2.3% interest bearing redeemable term investment of
$1,560,000 due January 2006.
10. Significant  Customer
Substantially all of the Company's revenues comes from several wells, the production of which is sold to one
customer.  As  such,  the  Company  is  exposed  to  concentrations  of  credit  risk.  However,  due  to  the  credit
quality of the entity to which the Company sells to, credit risk and credit risk concentration is minimized.
11.

described in note 6.
(iii) During  the  year  ended  October  31,  2004,  the  Company  issued  1,000,000  escrow  common

undisposed  oil,  natural  gas  and  bitumen  rights  on  Reserves  held  by  the  Kapawe'no  First
Nation (“Kapawe'no”) of Grouard, Alberta.
13.
Indemnities  and  guarantees
(a)
In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contracts which contain indemnification
provisions, such as loan agreements, purchase contracts, service agreements, licensing agreements,
asset purchase and sale agreements, operating agreements, leasing agreements, asset use agreements
etc. In such contracts, the Company may indemnify counterparties to the contracts if certain events
occur. These indemnification provisions vary on an agreement by agreement basis. In some cases, there
are no pre-determined amounts or limits included in the indemnification provisions and the occurrence
of  contingent  events  that  will  trigger  payment  under  them  is  difficult  to  predict.  Therefore,  the
maximum potential future amount that the Company could be required to pay cannot be estimated.
(b) Under  the  terms  of  certain  agreements  and  the  Company's  by-laws  the  Company  indemnifies
individuals who have acted at the Company's request to be a director and/or officer of the Company, to
the extent permitted by law, against any and all damages, liabilities, costs, charges or expenses suffered
by  or  incurred  by  the  individuals  as  a  result  of  their  service.    The  claims  covered  by  such
indemnifications  are  subject  to  statutory  and  other  legal  limitation  periods.    The  nature  of  the
indemnification  agreements  prevents  the  Company  from  making  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the
maximum  potential  amount  it  could  be  required  to  pay  to  beneficiaries  of  such  indemnification
agreements.
14. Subsequent  events
Subsequent to the year ended October 31, 2005, 8,562,210 warrants were exercised for gross proceeds of
$5,565,437.
Subsequent  to  the  year  ended  October  31,  2005,  the  Company's  production  from  two  of  its  wells  was
materially restricted due to capacity constraints.
