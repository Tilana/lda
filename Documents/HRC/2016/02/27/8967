<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The establishment of the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women (SRVAW) 
mandate and the appointment of an incumbent in 1994 was part of a series of developments that 
finally accorded explicit recognition to violence against women (VAW) as a human rights 
concern within the United Nations. Thirteen years after the coming to force of the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) - the &#8220;Women&#8217;s 
International Bill of Rights&#8221; - the expert committee monitoring the convention adopted general 
Recommendation 19 in 1992, thus filling a major gap in the convention. In 1993, at the Vienna 
Conference, the international community officially recognized VAW as a human rights violation, 
and the same year the General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence 
against Women (DEVAW). These developments set the stage for the creation of a special 
mechanism to monitor VAW worldwide. 
</p>
<p>2. On 4 March 1994, the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) adopted a resolution for 
&#8220;integrating the rights of women into the human rights mechanisms of the United Nations and 
the elimination of violence against women&#8221;, appointing a Special Rapporteur on VAW, 
including its causes and consequences.<b>1</b> The creation of this mechanism and the scope of its 
mandate was a hard-won victory for women&#8217;s rights movements globally. With the victory came 
the onerous responsibility upon the SRVAW for covering a vastly neglected and obstacle-ridden 
legal terrain - that of developing legal doctrines for distinct forms of gender-based violence faced 
by women, including those that are cognizant of the multilayered violations of women, to 
examine communications and make recommendations for eliminating violence as well as its root 
causes. The SRVAW has fulfilled this daunting role through consultations and cooperation with 
governments; United Nations bodies/agencies and other special mechanisms; women&#8217;s 
groups/non-governmental organizations (NGOs); academicians; and research institutes. 
</p>
<p>3. This review aims to take stock of the achievements of 15 years of work on the VAW 
mandate, which has produced an impressive collection of 14 annual reports, 32 country mission 
reports, 11 communication reports comprising many communications to and from governments, 
and several other pieces of research.<b>2</b> Given the quantum of work and its significance, a review 
provides an opportunity to consolidate the main achievements, and the space to reflect upon the 
gains and the potential for future progress and directions of the mandate. The expansive coverage 
by the mandate and the complexity and interconnections among the concerns and categories of 
violence make it difficult to undertake a comprehensive review - and this exercise does not aim 
to be one. Rather, it is selective in terms of its focus on the substantive achievements of the 
mandate and the challenges before it. 
</p>

</b>  E/CN.4/RES/1994/45. Two experts have since held the office of the SRVAW: Radhika 
</p>
<p>Coomaraswamy, a Sri Lankan lawyer, who served three terms of office (three years each), 
June 1994-July 2003; and Yakin Ert&#252;rk, a Turkish sociologist, who will have served two terms 
by August 2009 (August 2003-August 2009). A new mandate holder is expected to be nominated 
during the course of 2009.

</p>
<p>4. Yakin Ert&#252;rk, the current SRVAW, initiated this study, with the objective of reviewing the 
work of the SRVAW, highlighting the conceptual shifts in the VAW mandate since its inception, 
and assessing the lessons learned as well as remaining challenges in combating VAW. A further 
objective is to assess the extent to which such issues as reproductive health and rights, poverty, 
migration, internally displaced persons (IDPs), women refugees, trafficking, aging, and 
adolescent girls have been addressed by the mandate, so as to propose some ideas on how best to 
integrate those issues into future work within the context of the VAW mandate. It is hoped that 
this study can also serve as a frame of reference for the next SRVAW, governments, civil society 
and United Nations agencies in their initiatives to move forward in the struggle against VAW. 
</p>
<p>5. The study involved a desk review and an analysis of the annual/thematic reports, the 
country mission reports, the communications sent to governments, and statements from the 
former and current SRVAWs delivered by a consultant who worked under Ert&#252;rk&#8217;s 
supervision and guidance, with support from UNFPA and the office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>6. This report structures the review into seven parts: Part I introduces the review; Part II 
provides a general introduction to the mandate and its scope; Part III examines the key areas of 
VAW covered by the mandate; Part IV discusses tools developed by the mandate to facilitate 
compliance, implementation and accountability; Part V takes stock of the conceptual advances 
made by the mandate in relation to the human rights of women; Part VI looks at the challenges 
and potential that remain to be considered by the mandate in the future; and Part VII is a 
conclusion. The various parts of this report overlap somewhat, given the interconnections they 
share. For example, Part IV, on implementation, also discusses issues that arise in Part III in 
relation to key areas covered by the mandate; and elements of conceptual gains, although 
independently discussed in Part V, are also partially subsumed in Part III. While some amount of 
repetition is inevitable due to such overlaps, the structure adopted for this review aims to 
minimize them, in order to distinguish and classify the broad achievements of the mandate over 
the past 15 years and suggest potential areas of attention. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF THE MANDATE 
</b></p>
<p>7. The progression in recognition of women&#8217;s human rights within the United Nations has 
been slow, beginning with addressing civil and political exclusions/restrictions during the early 
periods of the organization and moving on to women&#8217;s integration into development in 
the 1960s, then on to addressing sex discrimination in public and private arenas - within the 
family, employment, development, health, education and the State - in the late 1970s, as 
embodied in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
(CEDAW).<b>4</b> Although women did gain a comprehensive bill of rights through CEDAW, the 
                                                 
</p>

<p>have had sustained engagement with the mandate.

</p>
<p>treaty did not explicitly name violence against women (VAW) until 1992 in its General 
Recommendation 19 on VAW, thereby reading gender-based violence into several of the treaty&#8217;s 
substantive provisions. This was largely motivated by the sustained global campaign of the 
1980s led by the women&#8217;s movements on VAW, and was followed by the recognition of 
women&#8217;s rights as human rights at the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights, in Vienna.<b>5</b> 
The gains for women at the Vienna conference also included a blueprint for strengthening and 
integrating women&#8217;s human rights within the United Nations, spurring developments towards the 
creation of the mandate. 
</p>
<p>8. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action noted that &#8220;the human rights of women 
and of the girl-child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights&#8221;.<b>6</b> 
Further, the document emphasized that the elimination of VAW in all areas of life, the public 
and the private, was central to the attainment of women&#8217;s human rights.<b>7</b> Accordingly, the 
document outlined the steps necessary for the realization of these goals, including that the human 
rights of women should be &#8220;integrated into the mainstream of United Nations system-wide 
activity&#8221;<b>8</b> - through the treaty monitoring bodies, through the effective use of existing 
procedures, and through the creation of new procedures to &#8220;strengthen implementation of the 
commitment to women&#8217;s equality and the human rights of women&#8221;.<b>9</b> Towards this end, the 
recommendations for a new mechanism on VAW and an Optional Protocol to CEDAW were 
endorsed, leading to the creation of the mandate and the appointment of the Special Rapporteur 
on Violence against Women (SRVAW) in 1994, and the adoption of the optional protocol to 
CEDAW in 1999 and its coming to force in 2000. 
</p>
<p>9. While the focus of this review is the work of the SRVAW since its creation, it is important 
to keep in mind the work of other international or regional mechanisms and agencies - notably, 
in addition to the CEDAW Committee, the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), the 
     
</p>
<p>feminist critique of international law, see Hilary Charlesworth and Christine Chinkin, The 
Boundaries of International Law: A Feminist Analysis (Huntington, N.Z.: Juris 
Publishing, 2000). 
<b>5
</b>  Women&#8217;s movements from around the world held the Tribunal on Violations of Women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Human Rights at the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna in 1993, to claim moral and 
legal authority of human rights in seeking justice for women. This event was part of a larger 
worldwide campaign by women&#8217;s movements to draw attention to VAW and seek explicit 
recognition of women&#8217;s rights as human rights by the United Nations and within international 
human rights. &#8220;Women Testify: A planning guide for popular Tribunals and hearings&#8221;, Centre

<p>General Assembly, the Secretary-General and the Security Council, United Nations agencies, 
and regional human rights mechanisms such as the Inter-American Commission on Human 
Rights, the African Commission on Human and People&#8217;s Rights, and the Council of Europe. 
Many of these entities have indeed addressed aspects of VAW and interrelated issues pertaining 
to women&#8217;s status in various reports, resolutions and other documents, often reflecting issues 
discussed by the SRVAW. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Definition and scope of violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>10. CEDAW General Recommendation 19 on VAW views gender-based violence as a form of 
discrimination that constitutes a serious obstacle in the enjoyment of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms by women, and addresses intersections of gender-based violence with the 
different substantive areas covered by the articles of CEDAW.<b>10</b> It defines gender-based violence 
as &#8220;violence directed against a woman because she is a woman or which affects a woman 
disproportionately. It includes physical, mental or sexual harm or suffering, threats of such acts, 
coercion and other deprivations of liberty&#8221;. Accordingly, it calls upon State parties to address 
and report on VAW within the substantive framework of CEDAW. 
</p>
<p>11. The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (DEVAW) provides a 
more comprehensive framework on VAW in terms of definition, scope, obligations of the State, 
and the role of the United Nations.<b>11</b> It defines VAW to mean &#8220;any act of gender-based violence 
that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to 
women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether 
occurring in public or private life&#8221;. DEVAW further outlines the scope of private and public to 
include violence in the family, violence in the community, and violence perpetrated or condoned 
by the State, wherever it occurs. 
</p>
<p>12. In their reports, the Special Rapporteurs have further elaborated upon these forms of 
violence as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Violence in the family - such as domestic violence; battering; marital rape; incest; 
forced prostitution by the family; violence against domestic workers and the girl-child 
(non-spousal violence, violence related to exploitation); sex-selective abortion and 
infanticide; traditional practices such as female genital mutilation; dowry-related 
violence; and religious/customary laws 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Violence in the community - such as rape/sexual assault; sexual harassment; violence 
within institutions; trafficking and forced prostitution;<b>12</b> violence against women 
migrant workers; and pornography 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  CEDAW/C/1992/L.1/Add.15. 
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  A/RES/48/104 (23 February 1994). 
</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  The term &#8220;forced prostitution&#8221; used here corresponds with the terminology of DEVAW and 
</p>
<p>the reports of the SRVAW, E/CN.4/1995/42, E/CN.4/1996/53 and E/CN.4/1997/47. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.5 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Violence perpetrated or condoned by the State - such as gender-based violence during 
armed conflict; custodial violence; violence against refugees and internally displaced 
persons (IDPs); and violence against women from indigenous and minority groups 
</p>
<p>13. Ert&#252;rk also suggested adding the &#8220;transnational arena&#8221;, which, due to globalization and 
increased transnational processes, has emerged as a fourth level where women are encountering 
new vulnerabilities.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>14. Different forms of violence continued to be addressed and elaborated upon in the 
documents adopted in the years that followed. For instance, the Beijing Platform for Action 
(PFA) - by including, among its 12 critical areas of concern, VAW, along with women and 
armed conflict, and the human rights of women - specified various forms of sexual assault on 
women that were not specifically mentioned in DEVAW. These include systematic rape and 
forced pregnancy during armed conflict, sexual slavery, forced sterilization and forced abortion, 
female infanticide, and prenatal sex selection.<b>14</b> The review of the implementation of the PFA 
that took place at the 23rd special session of the General Assembly, in 2000, clearly 
demonstrated that VAW had become a priority issue on the agenda of many member States. The 
outcome document of the special session on Beijing +5 went a step further in calling for the 
criminalization of VAW, punishable by law. Paragraph 69 (c) states that governments shall &#8220;treat 
all forms of violence against women and girls of all ages as a criminal offence punishable by 
law, including violence based on all forms of discrimination&#8221;. The document also calls for the 
taking of measures to address VAW resulting from prejudice, racism and racial discrimination, 
xenophobia, pornography, ethnic cleansing, armed conflict, foreign occupation, religious and 
anti-religious extremism, and terrorism.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>15. DEVAW and other documents pay specific attention to the increased risk of violence 
against women on account of marginalized status, location or context. Resolutions on the 
mandate of the SRVAW have likewise addressed forms of VAW on various grounds, thereby 
reinforcing this approach.

<p><b>B.  Mandate and work methods of the SRVAW 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and all other international human rights 
treaties and instruments, including CEDAW and DEVAW, guide the mandate of the SRVAW.<b>16</b> 
The SRVAW&#8217;s work is structured on the basis of the substantive framework set out in DEVAW, 
listing distinct forms of violence as discussed in the preceding section. 
</p>
<p>17. The methods of work set out in the mandate are (a) to seek and receive information on 
VAW, its causes and consequences, from governments, intergovernmental bodies, women&#8217;s 
groups, and United Nations agencies/mechanisms/treaty bodies, and to respond effectively to 
such information; (b) to recommend measures, ways and means at national, regional and 
international levels towards the elimination of VAW and its causes, and to remedy its 
consequences; and (c) to work closely with other special mechanisms created by the 
Commission on Human Rights (and since 2006 by the Human Rights Council), and bodies 
within the United Nations.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>18. The mandate holder interacts with a wide range of stakeholders engaged with eliminating 
VAW, including governments, United Nations bodies/agencies/special mechanisms, civil society 
organizations and academia; receives communications and complaints; conducts and reports on 
country missions; and produces annual reports. All of this allows the SRVAW to identify and 
express concerns over trends in women&#8217;s human rights violations and develop legal standards 
and doctrines. 
</p>
<p>19. With regard to seeking and receiving information, the mandate holder, as part of her 
engagement with the civil society, also interacts with women&#8217;s groups, non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and academia. In this respect, regional consultations with women&#8217;s groups 
and organizations have become an integral part of the SRVAW&#8217;s working methods. The Asia 
Pacific regional consultations - organized by the Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and 
Development (APWLD), initiated during Radhika Coomaraswamy&#8217;s tenure as SRVAW, and 
further developed during the tenure of the second SRVAW - have become institutionalized and a

<p>  The mandate holders have participated annually in regional consultations in the Asia Pacific 
organized by the Asia Pacific Forum for Women, Law and Development, Chiang Mai, Thailand. 
From 1995-2002, consultations were held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in August of each year. 
Thereafter they were held in October 2003 in New Delhi, in July 2004 in Jakarta, in 
October 2005 in Bangkok, in September 2006 in Ulaan Baatar, in September 2007 in Manila, 
and in October 2008 in New Delhi. </p>

<p>consultations have begun to be organized in Africa, Central Asia and Europe to communicate 
region-specific concerns to the SRVAW, and to enable civil society actors to use the mandate 
more effectively in responding to problems confronting women in their respective regions.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>20. The annual reports are particularly good resources in providing a normative framework for 
addressing distinct forms of gender-based violence, an analysis of the causes and consequences 
of violence, and an elaboration of the role of the State as well as regional and international 
stakeholders in combating violence in the public and private domains. They are also important 
for informing policy and shaping the advancement of women&#8217;s human rights standards in 
international law.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>21. Coomaraswamy dedicated her annual reports to discussing in detail the three broad 
categories of VAW in the family, in the community, and perpetrated or condoned by the State, in 
addition to violence in specific contexts. Coomaraswamy indicated in her last report that the first 
decade of the mandate emphasized standards setting and awareness, and that the next decade 
should focus on strategies for a more effective implementation. Ert&#252;rk, in her first report, 
&#8220;towards an effective implementation of international norms to end VAW&#8221;, identified this as her 
starting point. She prioritized issues of intersectionality and obstacles in advancing women&#8217;s 
human rights.

<b>20
</b></p>
<p>  The themes of the annual reports are: preliminary report (1995); violence against women in 
the family (1996); violence against women in the community (1997); violence perpetrated or 
condoned by the State (1998); a follow-up report on violence against women in the family 
(1999); trafficking in women, women&#8217;s migration and violence against women (2000); violence 
against women perpetrated or condoned by the State during times of armed conflict (2001); 
cultural practices in the family that are violent towards women (2002); international, regional 
and national developments in the area of violence against women, 1994-2002 (2003); towards an 
effective implementation of international norms to end VAW (2004); intersections of violence 
against women and HIV/AIDS (2005); the due diligence standards a tool for elimination of 
VAW (2006); intersections between culture and VAW (2007); and indicators on VAW and State 
response (2008). The next thematic report, to be presented in 2009, will be on the subject of 
political economy and violence against women. A research study by Debora Singer on women 
asylum-seekers (&#8220;A Last Resort? Women Asylum Seekers and the UNSRVAW&#8221;, 
December 2006, Executive Summary, Asylum Aid) found that the annual reports hold immense 
potential to support and inform policy, whereas the country reports were greatly useful in 
supporting claims of women asylum-seekers. </p>

<p>22. The mandate holders have also sought the assistance of experts to undertake 
comprehensive research to complement themes covered by annual reports, such as in relation to 
domestic violence, trafficking and indicators of VAW and State response to violence.<b>21</b> Each of 
the annual reports of the SRVAW reflects the extent to which the mandate draws upon various 
stakeholders, through consultations with NGOs, review of research studies, and questionnaires 
sent to governments and United Nations agencies. 
</p>
<p>23. The country mission reports address the comprehensive status of VAW, grounding the 
analysis of violence in relation to a specific country, illustrating the particularistic aspect of the 
problems and identifying protection gaps and the nature of risks relevant to the context, and 
making detailed recommendations based on these.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>24. The VAW mandate receives individual complaints, and responds to all reliable and 
credible information regarding alleged cases of VAW. A standard reporting format is available 
on the website of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) to facilitate submission of individual complaints. The SRVAW communicates the 
case to the government, through allegation letters (when the human rights violation has allegedly 
already taken place) or urgent appeals (when alleged violations are time-sensitive in terms of 
involving loss of life, life-threatening situations, or either imminent or ongoing damage of a very 
grave nature to victims), to seek clarification or appeal, or to secure protection for the victim. 
Such communication is premised on the obligation of the State to prevent, protect, compensate 
and punish VAW in the family, in the community and by the State. The governments are 
expected to respond to allegation letters within two months and to urgent appeals as soon as 
possible.<b>23</b> The mandate therefore serves a pivotal role in the development of human rights law

protection for many women worldwide, particularly because access to special mechanisms is not 
contingent on ratification of any treaty law or reservations in respect thereto, nor is its role 
activated upon a periodic reporting cycle. 
</p>
<p>25. As part of the Special Procedures of the Commission on Human Rights and, since 2006, 
the Human Rights Council, the SRVAW has annual reporting obligations. Since 2004, the 
SRVAW has been mandated to make an annual oral presentation to the General Assembly. In 
addition, Resolution 7/24 of March 2008 (paragraph 12) mandates the SRVAW to make an 
annual oral presentation to the Commission on the Status of Women, which Ert&#252;rk had been 
lobbying for since the beginning of her tenure. The mandate also interacts with and responds to 
concerns raised within the United Nations, as it did in relation to integrating gender dimensions 
of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, contributing to the development of the Secretary-General&#8217;s 
&#8220;In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence against Women&#8221; (A/61/122/Add.1), and to the 
development of indicators on VAW with the Group of Friends of the Chair, established to 
support work done by the United Nations Statistical Commission. Likewise, the mandate 
undertakes work jointly with other special mechanisms<b>24</b> and recommends ways and means of 
integrating the issue of VAW within the United Nations human rights system. The mandate has 
also interacted with other regional bodies and mechanisms, such as the Special Rapporteur on 
Women&#8217;s Rights of the African Commission on Human and People&#8217;s Rights, the European 
Parliament&#8217;s Rapporteur on Women&#8217;s Rights in Turkey, and the Council of Europe. 
</p>
<p>26. In discussing the distinct forms or contexts of violence, both SRVAWs have consistently 
been attentive towards the intersectional and compounded risks experienced by women due to 
marginalized status or context. Intersectionality, discussed in detail in Part V of this report, is 
borne out in the work and the work methods of the mandate. The majority of the 
communications issued by the SRVAWs have been undertaken jointly with one or more special 
mechanisms, bringing to bear upon the State the range of violations that intersect in a given 
situation.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>27. CEDAW General Recommendation 19 and DEVAW specify that States should &#8220;refrain 
from engaging in violence against women&#8221;, directly or through their agents, and &#8220;exercise due 
diligence to prevent, investigate and, in accordance with national legislation, punish acts of 
violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the State or by private persons&#8221;.<b>26</b>

</b>  See part V, Subpart E, of this Report - Intersectionality of Discrimination and Continuum of 
</p>
<p>Violence. 
<b>25
</b></p>
<p>  The majority of the communications of the SRVAW are sent jointly with other special 
mechanisms; only a very small fraction of these are sent singly. See footnotes 181 and 182 in 
part V, Subpart E, of this report, for data on joint and single communications, as well as the 
thematic mechanisms with which SRVAWs have collaborated with regard to communications.

</p>
<p>The concept of due diligence has been developed and used by the SRVAWs as a key principle to 
hold States legally accountable for the prevention, investigation and punishment of violations by 
non-State actors. As will be discussed in Part IV, the use of the concept has considerably 
changed the nature of State obligations with respect to preventing VAW in particular. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  KEY AREAS OF FOCUS 
</b></p>
<p>28. This section looks at key areas that exacerbate violence examined by the mandate. It must 
be stated at the outset that the two mandate holders have examined additional forms of violence 
or contexts in their reports beyond what is covered in this section. The selectivity here is based 
on themes that have received independent and fuller attention in annual reports along with 
elaboration in the country mission reports. The areas that have not been discussed independently 
in this part - for example, concerns relating to women refugees and internally displaced persons 
(IDPs) - have instead been subsumed under other areas here. Further, although culture has 
received independent attention in two annual reports, it is not covered in this section and instead 
is taken up in Part V, on conceptual shifts, so as to avoid repetition on the subject. 
</p><p>29. The creation of a special mechanism on violence against women (VAW) has enabled the 
dynamic development of human rights standards that are responsive to contemporary challenges 
and emerging issues with respect to gender-based violence. The value of the mandate must be 
understood in the context of the historic, endemic and structural nature of VAW, as well as the 
history of gender blindness within domestic and international law. As a result, the forms of 
violence and contexts elaborated upon in this section are generally discussed, along with an 
examination of women&#8217;s status and gender inequality in society, patriarchal structures, and 
socio-economic frameworks/policies that exacerbate or condone VAW. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Domestic violence 
</b></p>
<p>30. The two broad categories addressed by the mandate in relation to violence in the family are 
that of domestic violence and culturally justified practices that are violent to or subordinate 
women. In the context of domestic violence, the contribution of the mandate has been to expand 
the concept of State obligation to develop protection for women in diverse family forms; to 
develop State obligation beyond prosecution of private actors to encompass protection from 
violence, including provision of legal support and health, safety, and shelter requirements for the 
survivor; and to develop the obligation to prevent VAW by addressing its root causes. The scope 
of State obligation breaks the private/public dichotomy by addressing the linkages of illegal 
private conduct with public policy and State structures. 
</p>
<p>31. With regard to family violence, Radhika Coomaraswamy has noted that despite the 
&#8220;neutrality&#8221; of the term, it must be defined by the broad range of women&#8217;s experiences of 
violence within familial relationships that establish it as primarily gendered violence perpetrated 
by men against women.<b>27</b> Conventionally, State protection with respect to domestic violence has 
been construed as covering only spousal violence, due to the limitations arising from institutional 
definitions of the family. Earlier on in the mandate, the report on violence in the family stressed

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.5 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>the need to redefine the concept of family as the first step towards addressing domestic violence. 
By bringing to bear the wide-ranging experiences of women into international law, the mandate 
adopted a subjective definition of the family based on individual bonds of nurturance and care, to 
encompass &#8220;difference and plurality&#8221; of family forms rather than institutional, State-based 
definitions.<b>28</b> The definition of the family has been expanded by the mandate to encompass 
intimate-partner and interpersonal relationships, including non- cohabitating partners, previous 
partners and domestic workers. This has allowed inclusion of &#8220;wives, live-in partners, former 
wives or partners, girl-friends (including girl-friends not living in the same house), female 
relatives (including but not restricted to sisters, daughters, mothers) and female household 
workers&#8221; to be recipients of State protection.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>32. Emphasizing the need to reject the narrow institutional definition of the family, the Special 
Rapporteur on Violence against Women (SRVAW) explained that upholding dominant norms of 
the family despite the empirical realities of diverse family forms serves to sanction violence 
against women transgressing traditional roles within and outside the home.<b>30</b> Taking stock of the 
impact in the decade following the mandate&#8217;s recognition of diverse family forms, Yakin Ert&#252;rk 
noted that &#8220;attention has focused, albeit insufficiently, on violence against women by family 
members and intimate partners; the situation of domestic workers, who are employed in the 
private household setting, has been largely ignored in research, policy and standard-setting&#8221;.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p>33. The mandate has applied international standards of equality and non-discrimination, in the 
context of marriage and the family, upholding the right to privacy, sexual health (including 
sexual orientation) and reproductive rights within the context of family. In doing so, the mandate 
has rejected conventional critiques judging interventions to address oppressive family forms as 
being anti-family.<b>32</b> In applying rights holistically within the domain of the family, the SRVAW 
&#8220;intentionally [departed] from traditional definitions of domestic violence, which address 
violence perpetrated by intimates against intimates, or equate domestic violence with 
woman-battering&#8221;.<b>33</b> The Secretary-General&#8217;s study on VAW reinforced the principle that 
protection from domestic violence must extend to a broad range of interpersonal relationships 
within the family.<b>34</b>

</p>
<p>34. The addendum to the report on violence in the family<b>35</b> set out a framework for model 
legislation on domestic violence to assist States in meeting their human rights obligations in the 
private sphere. The model law proposed by the SRVAW comprised civil and criminal remedies, 
in addition to mandating coordinated emergency and non-emergency support services, and 
training of police, counselors and the judiciary to ensure implementation of the law.<b>36</b> The State 
obligations envisaged to address VAW go beyond enactment of laws, criminalization of violence 
and protection from it. In further reports, stress has also been placed on the broader obligations 
of the State towards violence prevention through public policies and public education.<b>37</b> The 
sustained attention to all dimensions of State obligations towards addressing domestic violence 
has given impetus to legislative advocacy and enactment of special legislation on the subject in 
various countries.<b>38</b> By 2006, 89 States were reported to have legislation addressing domestic 
violence; of these, 60 states had specific domestic-violence laws, seven had violence laws, and 
about 20 had draft legislations on domestic violence in various stages of development.<b>39</b> In the 
mission reports on many countries - for example, Brazil and the Russian Federation - the 
SRVAW highlighted the necessity of enactment of a specific law on domestic violence, along 
with the provision of coordinated services and the strengthening and sensitization of existing 
State structures. The SRVAWs also caution in their mission reports that the State initiatives 
should not be urban-centric but available across regional and ethnic disparities. 
</p>
<p>35. In her treatment of domestic violence, Ert&#252;rk has ruptured the public/private dichotomy by 
expanding State accountability beyond private actors for private acts of violence, by calling upon 
the State to address external pressures that bear upon particular groups because of their status, 
ethnicity or context, and that exacerbate domestic violence. In this regard, contexts such as 
stigma-laden and flawed HIV/AIDS policies, occupation, racism, socio-economic 
marginalization and restrictive immigration policies have been held to constitute the external 
environments that exacerbate domestic violence. Accordingly, the HIV/AIDS report outlines the 
State&#8217;s obligation to counter stigma, VAW and gender inequality in its HIV/AIDS prevention 
policies to combat the enhanced discrimination and violence that HIV-positive women 
experience within the family.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>36. Similarly, in the case of the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), the SRVAW noted the 
importance of ensuring State commitment to women&#8217;s rights through the development of a

<p>secular democratic state, increased political representation of women, and enactment of laws on 
non-discrimination, equality, sexual assault, domestic violence, honour crimes and the need to 
end occupation.<b>41</b> In the context of Sweden, where, despite a strong gender-equality framework, 
domestic violence and under-representation of women in senior positions of private enterprises 
prevailed, the SRVAW noted that the equal opportunities agenda had yet to address the 
deep-rooted causes of gender hierarchy, or to respond to the protection gaps for specific 
women&#8217;s groups, such as Saami women; women with disabilities; women from an immigrant, 
refugee or asylum background; young women; and women in the sex sector. The 
recommendations emphasized the need to address root causes, including avoidance of gender 
and cultural stereotypes in the media.<b>42</b> With regard to the Netherlands, the SRVAW drew 
attention to the application of the gender mainstreaming approach, which resulted in 
gender-neutral State responses to domestic violence, as well as the cultural essentialist responses 
to violence among immigrant communities.<b>43</b> The particularization of domestic violence among 
non-Western immigrants as a cultural problem was held to be problematic, as it discounted the 
relationship of socio-economic disadvantage and restrictive immigrant policies to domestic 
violence. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Trafficking and migration 
</b></p>
<p>37. The mandate&#8217;s work on trafficking has significantly shifted the way in which the issue had 
conventionally been framed, in terms of de-linking it from prostitution, bringing out its linkages 
with migration, and putting human rights of the trafficked women in the centre of approaches to 
trafficking. The report on violence in the community places trafficking in the context of 
movement of persons within and across borders from South to North, as well as from 
impoverished and conflict-ridden areas of the South to areas with a concentration of capital and 
employment in the South, in the wake of reduced controls of exports and imports in the 
globalized market.<b>44</b> 
</p>
<p>38. Trafficking was earlier linked exclusively to prostitution, but patterns in the past two 
decades have shown that trafficking serves forced and/or bonded labour, including within the sex 
trade, forced marriage and other slavery-like practices. In view of the absence of international 
consensus on approaches to trafficking, including among non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), and the incompatibility of existing definitions with contemporary trends, 
Coomaraswamy proposed a definition and set out the human rights obligations in relation to 
trafficking. The SRVAW&#8217;s definition makes trafficking conditional upon the occurrence of

</p>
<p>non-consensual transportation for the purpose of slavery-like practices or forced labour.<b>45</b> The 
country mission reports on Guatemala and the Netherlands note that trafficking of women and 
children is primarily for sexual exploitation, as well as, to a lesser extent, for forced labour.<b>46</b> 
The report on Coomaraswamy&#8217;s mission to Bangladesh, Nepal and India examined trafficking 
for forced marriage, sex work, forced begging, organ harvesting and camel jockeying.<b>47</b> 
39. The thematic report on the subject discusses in depth the legal, social and economic 
dimensions, as well as the violations and discrimination linked to the movement of women.<b>48</b> 
The interlinkages of trafficking and migration with macroeconomic policies and with armed 
conflict are woven into two other reports on separate themes: &#8220;Economic and Social Policy and 
Its Impact on Violence against Women&#8221;, and the subsequent report on &#8220;Violence against Women 
perpetrated and/or Condoned by the State during Times of Armed Conflict (1997-2000)&#8221;.<b>49</b> In 
view of the fact that movement of labour has been driven by macroeconomic policies that shape 
both contemporary forms of trafficking and migration, the SRVAW&#8217;s definition proposes 
making trafficking conditional only upon consent and purpose of transport, rather than legality or 
illegality of transport. This approach views trafficking as one violation rather than the total sum 
of a continuum of violations experienced by trafficked women in the course of movement. 
</p>
<p>40. Approaches that restrict movement or forcibly rescue, detain, rehabilitate and repatriate 
trafficked persons, including performing forced and non-confidential HIV testing, have been 
viewed by both mandate holders as treating trafficked persons as criminals and violating their 
human rights. Accordingly, the mandate has been critical of migration and immigration policies 
of sending and receiving countries that restrict free movement, of the criminalization of work in 
the sex sector, and of detention and deportation that curtails the victims&#8217; human rights and 
further penalizes the trafficked persons. Drawing attention to violations resulting from 
restrictions on free movement, the country mission report on the Netherlands notes that 
trafficking victims are housed in penal institutions rather than shelters for domestic violence

for trafficked victims to recover; the extension of this period is contingent on the victim&#8217;s 
cooperation with law enforcement. Such a condition discounts that victims fear reporting, as it 
results in deportation, public shame on return to their home country, or retaliation by traffickers. 
The state obligations developed by Coomaraswamy in her thematic report on trafficking place 
importance upon recognition and protection of human rights of trafficked women in terms of 
labour rights, migrant workers&#8217; rights (including through the implementation of the Convention 
on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families),<b>50</b> free 
movement and agency, while recommending strong action against and protection from 
trafficking, in combination with protection of human and labour rights of women in the sex 
sector. 
</p>
<p>41. The mandate holders have succeeded in influencing international standards on trafficking, 
although gaps remain in terms of harmonizing different positions among international, regional 
and national approaches, cooperation among States, and implementation. For instance, 
Coomaraswamy engaged in a dialogue with member States with regard to the definition of 
trafficking included in the &#8220;Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime&#8221; (2000). The Protocol, however, has been critiqued by the 
mandate for its law-and-order approach to trafficking, while compliance with the office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) &#8220;Recommended Principles and 
Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking&#8221; has been recommended, as it upholds the 
human rights of trafficked women.<b>51</b> The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) also created a 
new special mechanism on trafficking in 2004 to focus on &#8220;the human rights aspects of the 
victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children&#8221;.<b>52</b> Further, the Special 
Rapporteur on Torture has expanded the definition of torture to include trafficking as a form of 
torture in the private sphere.<b>53</b> Despite the above developments, Ert&#252;rk noted that more progress 
is needed to comprehensively address trafficking from a human rights and gender perspective, 
which requires the full implementation of the OHCHR Recommended Principles and Guidelines, 
a rethinking of restrictions on legal migration, legal protection under national and international 
labour law regardless of legality of status, and removal of gender bias in law that makes the 
immigration status of women contingent on their being &#8220;dependent&#8221; spouses.<b>54</b>

<p><b>C.  Armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>42. Although sexual brutality, enslavement, forced prostitution and forced pregnancy have 
marked armed conflicts across the globe, these crimes have long remained invisible in 
international criminal and humanitarian law. Viewed as an unfortunate outcome of war, rather 
than crimes, they have been popularly explained in terms of aberrant behaviour by men under 
harsh conditions of war and separation from their families and communities. Studies of rape in 
war, however, prove the contrary. The wartime slavery of &#8220;comfort women&#8221;, and the conflicts in 
Darfur, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Liberia, Rwanda and the former 
Yugoslavia, as well as accounts of scores of other conflicts around the world, conclusively 
demonstrate that sexual violence is not an outcome of war, but that women&#8217;s bodies are an 
important site of war, which makes sexual violence an integral part of wartime strategy. 
</p>
<p>43. Feminist analysis has explained the linkage between patriarchal notions of female sexual 
purity with honour and VAW.<b>55</b> These values attached to female sexuality legitimize sexual 
regulation of &#8220;one&#8217;s&#8221; women, and the sanctioning of sexual violence against transgressors as 
well as women belonging to the &#8220;other&#8221;.<b>56</b> Coomaraswamy has reiterated this position in relation 
to sexual violence during armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>44. Ert&#252;rk also has established a strong link between wartime violence and patriarchal gender 
hierarchies. In her mission report on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the SRVAW 
cautions against addressing sexual violence associated with war in isolation from gender-based 
discrimination that women experience in times of &#8220;peace&#8221;.<b>57</b> 
</p>
<p>45. In this context, it is important that the law addressing sexual violence in armed conflict 
recognizes the violence for what it is, and addresses the barriers posed by notions of female 
sexuality rather than reinforcing them. Commenting on the partial and problematic references in 
international law, the first SRVAW has observed: &#8220;Until recently, violence against women in 
armed conflict has been couched in terms of &#8216;protection&#8217; and &#8216;honour&#8217;. Article 27 of the 
1949 Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War treats 
violence against women as a crime of honour rather than as a crime of violence. By using the 
honour paradigm, linked as it is to concepts of chastity, purity and virginity, stereotypical 
concepts of femininity have been formally enshrined in humanitarian law. Thus, criminal sexual 
assault, in both national and international law, is linked to the morality of the victim. When rape 
is perceived as a crime against honour or morality, shame commonly ensues for the victim, who

<p>is often viewed by the community as &#8216;dirty&#8217; or &#8216;spoiled&#8217;. Consequently, many women will 
neither report nor discuss the violence that has been perpetrated against them. The nature of rape 
and the silence that tends to surround it makes it a particularly difficult human rights violation to 
investigate.&#8221;<b>58</b> 
</p>
<p>46. Coomaraswamy&#8217;s report on violence perpetrated or condoned by the State documents the 
range of violations perpetrated during armed conflict by State and non-State actors such as the 
army, the militia, the peacekeeping forces and the armed opposition groups.<b>59</b> The absence of 
explicit recognition of gender-based violence in armed conflict has historically and in recent 
times contributed to impunity for widespread, systematic sexual brutality against women. In her 
report, the SRVAW noted the slow evolution towards partial recognition of gender-based crimes 
in international humanitarian law - to begin with, through terminology of morality/honour,<b>60</b> 
moving to limited recognition of sexual violence to the extent of rape,<b>61</b> and then to the inclusion 
of rape within the scope of torture through expansive interpretation.<b>62</b> 
</p>
<p>47. Significant steps were later taken by the international community - in particular through 
the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the International 
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), in the wake of systematic use of sexual 
violence in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia and the genocide in Rwanda - to accord explicit 
recognition and sanction appropriate procedures to address gender-based violence within the 
scope of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and components of the crime of genocide and 
torture. Despite these encouraging developments, the challenges of securing explicit recognition 
remained in the preparatory process of drafting the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court (ICC), under way in 1998, when Coomaraswamy&#8217;s first report on the subject was released. 
The SRVAW expressed concern that the drafting of the Rome Statute had not fully incorporated 
developments from the two ad hoc tribunals in relation to gender-based crimes in conflict, and 
that much of the gender-specific language remained contentious.<b>63</b> The report further strongly 
recommended that the ICC &#8220;explicitly incorporate provisions on violence against women, both

<p>  In 1992, the Special Rapporteur on Torture defined rape as a form of torture, bringing it 
explicitly within the scope of the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Later, the ICTR and ICTY indicted individuals for rape as 
a form of torture.

<p>substantively and procedurally&#8221;,<b>64</b> thereby reinforcing efforts of the Women&#8217;s Caucus for Gender 
Justice, which was advocating for inclusion of explicit gender-based crimes in the statute, and 
also incorporate procedural, evidentiary and structural arrangements supporting its full 
integration.<b>65</b> In this regard, the SRVAW pursued justice for gender-based crimes during war 
through steadfast efforts, including country missions, to seek acknowledgement of legal 
responsibility for military sexual slavery during World War II by Japan.<b>66</b> Similarly, the 
SRVAW made recommendations to remedy the lack of capacity of the office of the prosecutor 
and the Sexual Assault Team to actively prosecute sexual violence perpetrated during the 
conflict in Rwanda. In addition to the focus on prosecutions of sexual violence in their mission 
reports, both SRVAWs also addressed the status of women in post-conflict and peace processes, 
notably in relation to the status of survivors of violence, women in detention, the operations of 
the United Nations agencies, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
and the reconciliation processes.<b>67</b> 
</p>
<p>48. The entry into force of the ICC Statute on 1 July 2002 marked a historic advancement for 
gender justice in terms of explicit inclusion of gender-based crimes, in line with the 
recommendations of the SRVAW&#8217;s report on VAW during armed conflict.<b>68</b> While lauding this 
as a landmark victory, the report documents the continuing nature and magnitude of VAW in 
armed conflict, as well as the continuum of VAW in developments triggered by armed conflict, 
such as migration, forced displacements or trafficking; and the invisibility of women in 
post-conflict processes, such as reconstruction, peacebuilding and accountability through truth 
and reconciliation processes. Despite the advancements in recognition of VAW in armed 
conflict, the SRVAW drew attention to the implementation gaps that remained at the 
international level at the time, including those in relation to the ICTR and ICTY.<b>69</b> 
</p>
<p>49. Regarding violence against women in armed conflict, as refugees, IDPs, or residents in 
areas occupied by foreign military bases, peacekeeping forces, or humanitarian workers, the 
SRVAW recommended increasing the representation of women &#8220;in all institutions of the 
United Nations and at all levels of decision-making, including as military observers, police, 
peacekeepers, human rights and humanitarian personnel in United Nations field-base

abuses by peacekeepers, impact studies on women and armed conflict, the creation of an 
international body for protection of IDPs, responses to IDPs in terms of camp layout, and 
humanitarian aid to incorporate women&#8217;s security and other needs.<b>71</b> Specifically, on the 
responsibilities of peacekeeping forces, Ert&#252;rk expressed concerns in her country report on the 
DRC<b>72</b> over a &#8220;pattern of sexual exploitation&#8221; by the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the 
DRC, contrary to standards set by the department of peacekeeping operations (DPKO) of the 
United Nations Secretariat, which prohibit any solicitation of prostitution, regardless of the age 
or consent of the person solicited. She noted that while some important measures had been taken 
by the Secretary-General and the DPKO in recent years, some troop contingents within the 
United Nations organization mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) 
nevertheless failed to address allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse with due diligence. 
She also regretted that at the time of writing, the United Nations was still lacking a mechanism to 
provide victims of sexual exploitation and abuse with adequate compensation. She recommended 
that the United Nations give the Office of Internal Oversight Services the capacity to investigate 
all allegations of sexual exploitation and misconduct of peacekeeping forces, to collect forensic 
evidence that could be used in a court of law and, where allegations are substantiated, to ensure 
that the victim receives compensation from MONUC or relevant troop-contributing countries. 
She also called for a transparent process of prosecution of the perpetrators, preferably through 
court hearings in the country where the crime has been committed. 
</p>
<p>50. Since the adoption of the Rome Statute, the mandate holders have continued to pursue 
accountability for sexual violence and gender-based crimes in situations of armed conflict, 
among IDPs, and in relation to peace and reconstruction processes through country missions, 
bringing out the exacerbated impact of armed conflict when combined with patriarchy, ethnic 
and racial marginalization, poor status of women, and the absence of gender equality in 
legislation and State processes. The mission to the OPT evinces the combined impact of 
occupation and patriarchy on women, bringing to the surface, on the one hand, the gendered 
impact of restricted movement, house demolitions, detention, injuries and loss of life on women; 
and on the other, the consequences of heightened pressure and the humiliation of occupation on 
Palestinian men, in terms of increased control and aggression over women, through domestic 
violence and honour crimes.<b>73</b> 
</p>
<p>51. The mission to the Russian Federation covers the situation of women in the North 
Caucasus in the context of the regional demand for autonomy and Russian military operations to 
combat terrorism. It reveals the multiple forms of VAW resulting from military operations, 
armed conflict and patriarchy - in relation to the private sphere, as IDPs, and as targets of

<p>counter-terrorism.<b>74</b> In the context of the DRC, the country mission report brings out the 
magnitude and extreme sexual brutality perpetrated upon women and its devastating 
consequences in conditions of continued armed conflict; the existence of multiple armed groups; 
armed civilians; low social, economic and educational status of women; gender discrimination in 
law; and the State security and justice sectors that are marked by inefficiency and a lack of 
independence and capacity.<b>75</b> 
</p>
<p>52. The sustained attention to VAW in armed conflict within and outside the United Nations 
has resulted in two noteworthy resolutions by the Security Council. In 2000, Resolution 1325 on 
women, peace and security acknowledged the impact of war on women, and emphasized the 
need to include women in conflict resolution and peace processes for achievement of sustainable 
peace. In 2008, Resolution 1820 recognized rape as a weapon of war and a threat to international 
security, noting that &#8220;women and girls are particularly targeted by the use of sexual violence 
including as a tactic of war to humiliate, dominate, instill fear in, disperse and/or forcibly 
relocate civilian members of a community or ethnic group.&#8221; While these developments have 
succeeded in prioritizing attention to efforts towards cessation of sexual violence in armed 
conflict, much remains to be accomplished in terms of compliance, implementation and 
accountability. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Reproductive rights, HIV/AIDS and violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>53. The mandate has paid consistent attention to the impact of health and population policies 
on women&#8217;s reproductive rights and their linkages with VAW. Three thematic reports are 
particularly significant for the purpose of this discussion, as they focus on the intersections 
among VAW, reproductive rights and HIV/AIDS.<b>76</b> In addition, country mission reports discuss 
reproductive health consequences and the psychosocial impact of VAW during conflict and in 
peacetime, covering issues of reproductive health services, sex education for adolescents, child 
sexual abuse, confidentiality of HIV testing, the need for sensitive medico-legal procedures, and

</p>
<p>54. The report on policies and practices that impact women&#8217;s reproductive rights and 
contribute to, cause or constitute VAW<b>79</b> sets out the legal framework defined by governments at 
the International Conference on Population and Development (1994) and the Fourth World 
Conference on Women (1995), together with relevant provisions of treaty law, in particular 
CEDAW. Reproductive health includes sexual health, and reproductive rights entail recognition 
of women&#8217;s &#8220;basic right ... to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of 
their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest 
standard of sexual and reproductive health. It also includes their right to make decisions 
concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence ...&#8221;<b>80</b> This entitlement is 
reinforced and expanded to recognize the right of women to have control over their sexuality.<b>81</b> 
</p>
<p>55. The legal framework on the right to sexual and reproductive health has been summarized 
by the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health as comprising, on the one hand, freedom from 
violence and discrimination, and on the other, entitlements to reproductive health, maternal and 
childcare services; access to information; emergency obstetric services; family planning; safe, 
legal, accessible abortions; and voluntary and confidential testing, counselling and treatment of 
HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, and breast and reproductive system cancers. The 
entitlements also include access to underlying determinants of health such as education, female 
literacy and empowerment.<b>82</b> The legal framework clearly establishes that the primary duty 
bearer responsible for securing the freedoms and entitlements is the State. The State has been

</p>
<p>56. Coomaraswamy classified policies and practices that have an impact on women&#8217;s 
reproductive rights, or constitute or contribute to VAW in two categories.<b>83</b> The first relates to 
the reproductive health consequences of violence against women, and the second, to violations 
resulting from State action/inaction. In the first part of the report, she brought out the health 
dimensions of the distinct forms of gender-based violence covered by the mandate, including 
rape, domestic violence, forced prostitution/trafficking, and cultural practices such as child 
marriage/early childbearing and sex-selective abortion/female infanticide. The SRVAW 
observed that each of these acts constitutes violence in and of itself, in addition to inflicting 
serious reproductive, sexual, physical, psychological and health-related long-term harm to 
women. Accordingly, the obligation of the State to be duly diligent so as to prevent, investigate 
and punish VAW includes the fulfilment of reproductive rights, in addition to guaranteeing other 
rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p>57. The second category of violations related to reproductive rights pertains to violence 
occurring directly and indirectly as a result of State action/inaction in the context of reproductive 
health policy.<b>84</b> Direct State action that violates women&#8217;s reproductive rights arises from 
coercive population policies and measures of population control, coerced sterilization of women 
from marginalized ethnic populations, criminal sanctions against all forms of abortions and 
contraception, and inadequate sex education for adolescents. Such State policies and measures 
infringe upon women&#8217;s liberty, security and life. State inaction that contributes to the violation of 
women&#8217;s reproductive rights results from the neglect of the State obligation to address structural 
subordination of women and dominant notions of sexuality that impose norms of chastity and 
honour upon them. Measures that aim to counter subordination of women and prevent violence 
include women&#8217;s empowerment and development of security and self- determination. The 
SRVAW has noted that a lack of effective policies based on reliable data to meet minimum core 
obligations, State failure to prevent maternal mortality, non-provision of contraceptive 
information/family planning services that recognize and enable women&#8217;s sexual autonomy, and 
State failure to address physical and psychological abuse perpetrated by health-care providers all 
amount to violence resulting directly or indirectly from State policies. This report is significant 
for highlighting grave human rights consequences to women due to State policies and actions 
that are guided by imperatives other than the protection of women&#8217;s reproductive rights. The 
country mission report on El Salvador expresses concern with regard to the criminalization of 
therapeutic abortion and abortion following rape - which increases the economic and social 
hardships on women, especially poor women, who lack options for dealing with unwanted

context of armed conflict and widespread sexual violence and slavery, the country report on 
Sierra Leone recommends better access to health care, the development of a strategy for 
prevention of HIV/AIDS, and the prioritization of the needs of female victims of sexual 
violence, including through fistula surgery and psychosocial support.<b>86</b> 
</p>
<p>58. The report on HIV/AIDS has brought out the magnitude of the human rights tragedy borne 
by women and girls resulting from the neglect of their right to sexual and reproductive health. 
The SRVAW has drawn attention to the importance of prioritizing sexual and reproductive 
health and HIV/AIDS prevention for women, particularly in contexts of armed conflict, 
trafficking and sexual exploitation - as in the country reports on Bangladesh, Nepal and India, 
and Sierra Leone.<b>87</b> The significance of this concern becomes evident in the context of the 
strikingly higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS among girls and young women compared with their 
male counterparts in many countries,<b>88</b> in spite of which the HIV/AIDS policies and programmes 
have been slow and neglectful of incorporating, let alone prioritizing, gender approaches in 
prevention and control.<b>89</b>

<p>causes&#8221; of VAW and multilayered vulnerabilities that compound the experience of 
discrimination, Ert&#252;rk has outlined the continuum of gendered discrimination and violence 
cutting across the private and public domains in the context of HIV/AIDS. This report 
demonstrates the linkage among unequal power relations, VAW and increased vulnerability of 
women to contracting HIV, thereby explaining the increasing numbers of women living with 
HIV/AIDS. Gender inequality results in sexual assault, women&#8217;s lack of information, 
disempowerment and an inability to negotiate safe sex, thus increasing women&#8217;s vulnerability to 
contracting HIV/AIDS. Similarly, situations of armed conflict, trafficking, criminalization of 
prostitution and commercial exploitation of prostitution make women more vulnerable to sexual 
abuse and increase their inability to seek redress. Women&#8217;s disempowerment resulting from 
patriarchy is exacerbated by disadvantages of class, refugee, migrant, conflict situation and other 
marginalized status, increasing their risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. The SRVAW&#8217;s report 
outlines how gender inequality shapes the additional and specific forms of stigma borne by 
women upon contracting the virus. For instance, it increases the experience of stigma and results 
in desertion and impoverishment within the family and the community, in terms of social 
ostracism, withdrawal of family/community care, disentitlement from succession and property 
rights, and, in many cases, violence. Moreover, HIV/AIDS further impedes women&#8217;s access to 
health care and justice. 
60. As women&#8217;s vulnerability to contracting HIV/AIDS and the nature of violations pursuant 
to contracting HIV/AIDS are linked to unequal gender relations, sexuality and notions of 
masculinity, Ert&#252;rk has stressed the need for States to acknowledge and act upon the 
interlinkages between the &#8220;twin pandemics&#8221; HIV/AIDS and VAW. In this context, the SRVAW 
has highlighted the need for addressing gender discrimination to challenge structural inequality 
between men and women in all policies and programmes as part of the effort to combat 
HIV/AIDS, in order to make a difference in women&#8217;s lives and mitigate the disproportionate 
risks and violations they experience in this context.<b>94</b> 
</p>
<p>61. The annual report by the SRVAW on this theme places value on approaches that target 
vulnerable groups, but stresses the imperative of integrated approaches to combating AIDS that 
target gender inequality. The mandate has stressed the necessity of prevention through tackling 
root causes of gender inequality, pointing to the need for approaches that enable sexual and 
reproductive autonomy, empowerment of women&#8217;s capacities, and transformation of conditions 
that cause inequality. The recommendations emphasize non-discrimination and human rights 
through laws, programmes, and trainings; improvements in health care to ensure access; 
voluntary confidential HIV testing; care for survivors of sexual violence; affordable generic 
drugs; demilitarization; and research for HIV prevention. They also stress the importance of 
human rights standards, international cooperation, and funding to reverse the trend of the 
feminization of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

</p>
<p><b>IV.  COMPLIANCE, IMPLEMENTATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
</b></p>
<p>62. The focus in the first decade of the mandate was on securing recognition for distinct forms 
of violence against women (VAW) and their causes, and outlining legal doctrines and State 
obligations in relation to them. These have been critical to granting visibility to the continuum of 
violence through the public and private spheres, highlighting the distinction and the 
commonalities between VAW in peacetime and during conflict, and to establishing linkages of 
VAW with power structures, including macroeconomic policies. The final report of Radhika 
Coomaraswamy, marking the end of her tenure as SRVAW in 2003, reflected on the strides 
made in terms of recognition and, to some extent, in relation to creating implementation tools,<b>95</b> 
while noting the gaps that remain, particularly with reference to implementation. The first report 
of Yakin Ert&#252;rk, submitted in 2004 on assuming the SRVAW office, emphasized 
implementation and accountability as priority areas of the mandate, particularly in relation to 
non-State actors. The SRVAW has focused on clarifying emerging forms and contexts of 
violence, as well as tools and frameworks that facilitate implementation. This section looks at the 
mandate&#8217;s contribution in facilitating compliance and accountability through legal frameworks, 
definitions, and expansion of the due diligence standard in relation to VAW, as well as through 
the value of indicators, impact studies and research in informing State responses to VAW. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>63. Introducing terminology to name wrongs that reflect women&#8217;s experiences of violence has 
helped push the boundaries of gender blindness and bias in international law. The focus during 
the first decade of the mandate was on distinct forms of VAW within the framework of 
international law. Drawing upon research studies, women&#8217;s experiences, documentary evidence 
and comparative legal approaches, the SRVAW set out to define the parameters of specific 
wrongs and propose legal frameworks and responses to address distinct forms of violence. As 
part of developing legal frameworks, the SRVAW has assessed prevalent legal responses, 
pointed out gaps, and proposed substantive, procedural and evidentiary changes to correct these.  
</p>
<p>64. Standards setting in law has been vital to defining offences and State responsibility in 
relation to respecting, protecting and fulfilling women&#8217;s human rights. The previous section of 
this report covered the key forms and contexts of violence in relation to which legal doctrines 
were elaborated by the SRVAW. Naming the various forms of violence within the family, the 
community, in armed conflict, and perpetrated by the State has accorded recognition to each 
form of violence, attaching international human rights standards and State obligations with 
regard thereto. As discussed in the previous section, standards setting with respect to domestic 
violence, sexual violence in armed conflict, trafficking and migration has been a very significant 
step towards facilitating State accountability in these areas. The naming of the State as a duty 
bearer for prevention and investigation of, protection from, and redress and compensation for 
wrongs committed by the State, its agents, and non-State actors through the principle of due 
diligence has been an important advancement in international law regarding women. 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>95
</b>  While the mandate paid greater attention in the first decade to recognition of forms, causes 
</p>
<p>and consequences of VAW, it also contributed to implementation through the model framework 
for domestic violence law and recommendations to engender the Rome Statute. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/6/Add.5 
  page 31 
 
</p>
<p>Recommendations with respect to procedural and evidentiary norms, especially in the context of 
sexual assault, crimes against humanity and war crimes, have contributed significantly to 
standards setting with regard to addressing VAW. 
</p>
<p>65. The mandate&#8217;s identification of specific groups of women has helped grant recognition to 
women who face multiple risks/violations, as well as to greater barriers to justice due to 
marginalization arising from grounds such as status or location in systems of inequality in 
addition to gender. This has helped create recognition for the compounded effects of more than 
one form of discrimination, and has emphasized the need for solutions that respond to aggravated 
forms of discrimination. For instance, the SRVAWs have consistently stressed the recognition of 
the multilayered discrimination and higher risk of violence faced by migrant domestic workers, 
asylum-seekers facing persecution on account of gender, refugee women, migrant women and 
women living with HIV/AIDS, along with drawing attention to the additional barriers to justice 
due to illegal status, non-citizen status, poverty, displacement, unfamiliarity with local language 
and systems, or stigma. The intersectional framework allows for differentiated State responses 
and the need for measures that correspond to the additional risks and greater barriers to justice. 
The recommendations of the SRVAWs concerning State obligations are important in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Due diligence 
</b></p>
<p>66. The due diligence standard has been crucial in developing State responsibility for violence 
perpetrated by private actors in the public and private arenas. It imposes upon the State the 
responsibility for illegal acts that are not directly committed by the State or its agents, but by 
private actors on account of State failure to take sufficient steps to prevent the illegal acts from 
occurring. Likewise, once an illegal act has occurred, the State&#8217;s inaction and failure to 
investigate prosecute or punish the act perpetrated by a private actor amounts to neglect of the 
State obligation to be duly diligent. The due diligence standard has long been part of 
international law<b>96</b> and was incorporated into general Recommendation 19 of CEDAW,<b>97</b> and 
later DEVAW, to expand State accountability to include VAW by private actors (in addition to 
State actors) in the private or public sphere, thus placing upon the State the duty to prevent, 
investigate, punish and provide compensation for all acts of VAW wherever they occur. 
</p>
<p>67. The extent to which a State is duly diligent is assessed through the steps it takes in relation 
to each level of accountability. As elaborated by the SRVAW in her report on due diligence,<b>98</b> 
the obligation to prevent VAW includes specific recognition by way of ratification of relevant 
treaties and enactment of special legislation, going beyond penal responses so as to ensure 
positive action by the State, through policies, programmes, creation of special mechanisms such

<b>97
</b></p>
<p>  CEDAW General Recommendation 19 stipulates that &#8220;States may also be responsible for 
private acts if they fail to act with due diligence to prevent violations of rights or to investigate 
and punish acts of violence, and for providing compensation&#8221;.

<p>as ombudspersons/commissions, public education campaigns, sensitization of agencies engaged 
with operationalizing women&#8217;s rights programmes, or collection of data to assess the de facto 
status of the problem. Protection requires the State to establish or promote institutional 
arrangements that provide services vital to respond to VAW, such as counselling, shelter, health 
care, crisis support, restraining orders, and financial aid to victims of violence, ensuring their 
accessibility to women from marginalized groups. Punishment is measured in terms of action 
taken by various State agencies in relation to investigating and prosecuting cases of violence or 
abuse, observance of the rule of law, convictions and sentencing. 
</p>
<p>68. While the fulfillment of due diligence requires treating law as &#8220;part of a broader effort that 
encompasses public policies, public education, services and violence prevention&#8221;,<b>99</b> the SRVAW 
has also emphasized that each of the interventions must in fact be effective and responsive. 
Responsiveness requires data collection to ensure that interventions are designed to respond to 
the context of violations, and monitoring of the interventions&#8217; impact. For instance, a law does 
not fulfill the requirement of due diligence if it exempts domestic violence under certain 
conditions,<b>100</b> or if it is gender-neutral.<b>101</b> In relation to high levels of VAW, including murder 
and disappearance of a large number of young, single, migrant women, the SRVAW held that 
the negligence and indifference of the State authorities led to a majority of the cases being 
unsolved and no convictions, thereby leading to denial of protection and justice to women.<b>102</b> 
Similarly, it has been held that the State failure to prosecute or punish a perpetrator of domestic 
violence for more than 15 years after the start of an investigation amounted to condoning the 
violence.<b>103</b> With regard to obstacles faced in the search for justice for women who have been 
victims of violent crimes, the SRVAW referred to the decision of the Inter-American Court of 
human Rights asking for public recognition of the State&#8217;s responsibility in the denial of justice 
and in ensuring that the perpetrators are brought to justice.<b>104</b> 
69. Combating VAW requires not only gender-competent responses, but the &#8220;adoption of 
multifaceted strategies&#8221; to effectively prevent and combat the &#8220;multiplicity of forms of violence 
against women ... that ... frequently occurs at the intersection of different types of

</p>
<p>discrimination&#8221;.<b>105</b> In this regard, the SRVAW observed that the higher degree of violence 
against migrant women in Mexico and their increased vulnerability to violence was linked to the 
law that barred undocumented migrant women from accessing State authorities.<b>106</b> Similarly, the 
SRVAW observed that the law excluding undocumented immigrant women from accessing State 
shelters for domestic violence in the Netherlands exposed them to arrest, created an obstacle to 
accessing justice, and made them vulnerable to a range of violations.<b>107</b> 
70. An important contribution of Ert&#252;rk in relation to the due diligence standard has been to 
emphasize the two neglected areas - the State duty to prevent VAW and to compensate its 
victims. The responsibility to &#8220;prevent&#8221; has the potential of involving the State in actively 
intervening in and transforming social and material structures that are at the root of VAW. In this 
context, the SRVAW has emphasized the value of altering the intrinsic nature of the State to 
make it less patriarchal. The SRVAW has explained that State action, symbolized through 
judicial or prosecutorial action, embodies &#8220;consequential effects in that condemnation of 
patriarchy can lead to changes in socio-cultural norms, as well as intrinsic effects in that 
prosecutors or judges can be considered to be the &#8216;mouthpieces&#8217; of society, and strong statements 
condemning violence against women made on behalf of society through the judiciary or the 
prosecutorial services will make that society less patriarchal&#8221;.<b>108</b> The SRVAW&#8217;s suggestions are 
echoed in feminist writings, which purport that in relation to assessing the effectiveness of 
prosecutorial action in terms of its ability to transform the intrinsic nature of the State, such State 
action not only must fulfill &#8220;consequential&#8221; values that enable punishment of batterers, increased 
safety of victims and prevention of domestic violence, but must also achieve &#8220;intrinsic&#8221; values, 
in terms of sending a symbolic message that domestic violence is a crime that the society will not 
tolerate.<b>109</b> For a State action to realize such an intrinsic value, it must not be a one-off instance 
of condemnation, but in fact it must systematically engage with domestic violence and condemn 
it so as to characterize the State as having values that lessen patriarchy. State action, as a 
consequence, helps lessen the patriarchal nature of society - that is to say, it &#8220;realizes certain 
kinds of values that are independently relevant to the project of ending domestic violence&#8221;.<b>110</b> 
71. In addition, the SRVAW has emphasized the duty of the State to compensate the 
consequence of violence. Ert&#252;rk notes that this not only includes but goes beyond access to legal 
remedies and rehabilitative and support services, possibly involving &#8220;financial damages for any 
physical and psychological injuries suffered, for loss of employment and educational

medical or social costs incurred as a consequence of the violence&#8221;.<b>111</b> She points out that the 
State must provide reparations to compensate financial and other forms of loss so as to fulfill the 
demands of restorative justice. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Accountability for actions of non-state actors 
</b></p>
<p>72. The due diligence standard has enabled the extension of the State accountability to prevent, 
protect and punish actions beyond those of State agents, thereby covering actions of private 
actors in the private sphere. However, conventional approaches to due diligence have been 
limited to extending accountability of the State to acts of violence by private actors within the 
family and the community. This approach has severely limited the State&#8217;s capacity to meet 
challenges posed by the influence exerted on women&#8217;s lives by non-State actors operating, as 
described by the SRVAW, from below and above the State. The SRVAW has indeed classified 
identity politics movements that trump cultural justifications to limit women&#8217;s rights as 
non-State actors operating &#8220;below the State&#8221;, and actors within the transnational arena whose 
actions often affect women adversely as those operating &#8220;above the State&#8221;.<b>112</b> In light of the 
serious challenges to women&#8217;s rights posed by these two levels of non-State actors, the mandate 
has recommended widening the application of due diligence to include their actions within the 
ambit of the responsibility to prevent, protect and punish. 
</p>
<p>73. The two mandate holders have drawn attention to the impact of social and economic 
policies as well as the relationship of political economy to women&#8217;s human rights.<b>113</b> In this 
context, the mandate holders have addressed transnational players through various reports that 
call for revisiting the conventional parameters of due diligence in light of &#8220;global restructuring&#8221; 
so as to include transnational actors and solutions within the ambit of due diligence.<b>114</b>

<p><b>112
</b>  This classification is proposed in the report on due diligence, E/CN.4/2006/61. It is 
</p>
<p>nonetheless acknowledged that corporations are also organs of society and as such are subject to 
national laws and regulations. The classification of businesses as being &#8220;above the State&#8221; 
pertains more to influential transnational corporations than to national enterprises, and remains 
context-specific. 
<b>113
</b></p>
<p>  These concerns have been expressed through various reports: E/CN.4/1999/68/Add.4, 
E/CN.4/2000/68/Add.5 and E/CN.4/2006/61. The forthcoming report on political economy and 
violence against women, which will be presented to the Human Rights Council in 2009, will also 
address these concerns while examining the tension caused between women&#8217;s economic and 
social rights and the prevailing macro-economic policy environment, as well as the tension 
caused by the dichotomization of political/civil rights and economic/social rights, which 
characterizes the latter not as entitlements but as aspirations.

</p>
<p>74. Regarding powerful non-State actors, the mandate has expressed the need to go beyond 
responding to violations and develop the duty to prevent violations. The mandate has 
emphasized the need to ensure accountability for actions of independent but powerful sources of 
authority that have an impact on women&#8217;s rights as being particularly important in the context of 
the shrinking domain of State authority.<b>115</b> In relation to addressing the influence of non-State 
actors from below the State, the report on due diligence recommends developing the generalized 
obligation of the State to prevent violence. As part of this obligation, the SRVAW has stressed 
operationalizing, as per the Beijing Platform for Action, women&#8217;s empowerment by the State at 
the individual level and engaging in &#8220;cultural negotiation&#8221; at the community level. The latter has 
been defined as State support of women&#8217;s initiatives at the community level so as to challenge 
and demystify myths around misogynous cultural discourses within the community. The 
SRVAW has stressed the value of women&#8217;s voices in relation to hegemonic interpretations of 
culture and prescriptions of identity politics that undermine women&#8217;s autonomy and their human 
rights. Women&#8217;s leadership, the SRVAW has explained, will surface heterogeneity and 
competing interests within communities, and as a consequence will question hegemonic voices 
and representations of culture by identity politics movements.<b>116</b> This approach seeks to question 
and rupture patriarchal monopoly of culture from below by addressing unequal power relations 
within the community. It is shaped by the perspective that the threat to women&#8217;s human rights 
comes from the monopoly over the interpretation and representation of culture by the powerful 
few rather than from culture per se. As a consequence, State engagement in women&#8217;s 
empowerment and cultural/societal transformations is central to challenging and changing 
hegemonic patriarchal structures and practices. The prevention approach is the more sustainable, 
focusing on change, whereas the State obligation to protect and punish remains relevant in 
combating violations.<b>117</b> 
</p>
<p>75. Both mandate holders have also expressed concern about the protection gaps in relation to 
the influence of non-State actors operating in society, and often also extraterritorially on the lives 
of people, and in particular their gendered impact on women. Although the contexts of 
globalization and conflict and post-conflict situations are varied, they represent sectors of 
growing influence by a multiplicity of State and non-State actors in territories beyond their 
domicile, thereby escaping the net of accountability afforded by conventional legal frameworks 
and mechanisms in domestic arenas. The non-State actors with transnational influence have not

<p>only affected governance, market changes or movements of people, but have also challenged 
conventional notions of territoriality, sovereignty and duty bearers with respect to human rights 
compliance by bringing into play a multiplicity of normative systems in each context.<b>118</b> 
</p>
<p>76. The SRVAWs have discussed the issue of non-State responsibility with respect to 
transnational corporations in conjunction with their increased power over macroeconomic 
decision-making in the process of global restructuring, which has favored liberalization and 
privatization of States at the national level. In this regard, they have emphasized that economic 
changes are not an outcome of the market forces alone, nor do they function independently of 
social dynamics. Rather, they are shaped by political and social structures, such that the 
allocation of resources and distribution of income and opportunities are constituted to reinforce 
existing power relations.<b>119</b> The forthcoming and last annual report of the current SRVAW will 
note that the enjoyment of human rights by women is contingent on a material basis of society 
sustained by the prevailing power relations, pointing to the necessity of aligning the economy 
with human rights policies through State and self-regulatory mechanisms.<b>120</b> The SRVAW has 
recommended gender impact studies, inclusion of gender as part of corporate responsibility, and 
the institutionalization of codes of conduct incorporating human rights within corporations or as 
part of social responsibility of corporations, rather than complete reliance upon State 
conditionality - for that is contingent upon not just a strong State, but one that is also committed 
to women&#8217;s human rights.<b>121</b> 
</p>
<p>77. The need for accountability of transnational corporations and other business enterprises has 
been further elaborated upon by John Ruggie, the Special Representative to the 
Secretary-General on this theme. A survey of governments and Fortune Global 500 firms on 
their human rights and management practices conducted by the Special Representative<b>122</b> shows 
that States rarely make trade and investment treaties conditional upon human rights, and that 
most criminal laws, despite their limitations, do not allow prosecution of legal persons or 
extraterritorial jurisdiction. Likewise, few corporations have human rights policies that go 
beyond labour rights, non-discrimination, freedom of association and forced/child labour 
restrictions, and these are rarely applicable beyond employees and a few others on the top of the 
value chain. In this context, the Special Representative recommended a policy framework that 
subjects business and corporate actors to the duty to respect human rights, and that emphasizes 
the State obligation to protect people from the actions of non-State actors and ensure access to

<p>remedies.<b>123</b> The SRVAW&#8217;s recommendations regarding gender impact studies provide a gender 
focus into the Special Representative&#8217;s recommendations for impact assessment, and creates 
space for arguing for integration of gender concerns into business activities, as well as for the 
integration of human rights in all processes and programmes of corporations and the availability 
of redress mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Indicators, data collection and research studies 
</b></p>
<p>78. Laws, State policies and programmes regarding women are often not based on actual data 
or research studies, resulting in a disjuncture between State responses and the prevalent patterns 
of violations/violence. To assess State compliance in relation to violence in the family, 
Coomaraswamy sought information from governments inter alia, on national plans and statistics 
on domestic violence, and noted that erroneous linkages were made by States among domestic 
violence, alcoholism and drugs, instead of linkages with patriarchal ideology, resulting in 
misdirected responses and resources.<b>124</b> Reporting on the extent to which reproductive rights are 
violated through policies derived from imperatives extraneous to women&#8217;s needs, the SRVAW 
noted that &#8220;all too often, State policies derive from the perceived moral requirements of the 
community, or even the needs and priorities of the health profession, rather than a careful 
epidemiological and social assessment of women&#8217;s health needs&#8221;. <b>125</b> Similarly, the effect of 
gender blindness undermines women&#8217;s human rights - such as in the absence of a gender focus in 
relation to HIV/AIDS prevention and control, or rehabilitation and reconstruction initiatives for 
refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). The relevance of indicators, sex-disaggregated 
data and gender impact studies is part of the obligation to comply with human rights standards, 
and is the basis for formulating State responses and monitoring the extent of State compliance. 
</p>
<p>79. Uninformed legislative activity or tokenistic responses cannot amount to compliance with 
the due diligence obligation of the State to prevent, investigate and punish. The 
recommendations of the SRVAW have repeatedly stressed research studies, sex-disaggregated 
data, linkages and coordination with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and gender 
impact studies, to inform State action and to design responses that are evidence-based and 
correspond to women&#8217;s needs. In taking stock of the progress made by the mandate at the end of 
her tenure in 2003 as the SRVAW, Coomaraswamy pointed to the gap in implementation of the 
standards set for addressing VAW. While charting the future direction of the mandate at the start 
of her tenure as the SRVAW, Ert&#252;rk observed that the difficulty in measuring compliance by 
States arose due to failure by the States to undertake &#8220;gender analysis in order to accurately 
assess how, why, and under what circumstances specific forms of violence are perpetrated&#8221;, and 
further, due to the lack of &#8220;measurable and comparable indicators of gender justice ... and a 
complex set of disaggregated data that captures the interlinkages of multiple forms of

<p>discrimination that lead to violence against women in diverse contexts&#8221;.<b>126</b> The SRVAW 
recommended &#8220;gender budgeting&#8221; and development of indicators to monitor VAW and State 
responses to it.<b>127</b> 
</p>
<p>80. Acting upon these recommendations, the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) called 
upon the SRVAW to recommend proposals for indicators on VAW and on measures taken by the 
States to eliminate it,<b>128</b> following which the SRVAW undertook extensive research on 
trans-national indicators and based her annual report on that research. The General Assembly 
further requested that, building on the work of the SRVAW, the United Nations Statistical 
Commission propose possible indicators on VAW,<b>129</b> and the Secretary-General&#8217;s study 
reiterated the importance of knowledge tools such as data on the nature, prevalence and 
incidence of all forms of violence as part of State responsibility to eliminate VAW.<b>130</b> 
</p>
<p>81. The annual report dedicated to indicators on VAW and State response<b>131</b> views indicators 
as part of the State&#8217;s human rights obligations, as they ensure that interventions aimed at 
combating VAW are based on accurate empirical data, and as a consequence are effective and 
responsive to prevailing patterns of violence. Similarly, in country mission reports, the Special 
Rapporteurs consistently reminded States of the need to collect sex-disaggregated data, and to 
map and examine patterns of violence and their causes in order to understand the prevalence and 
specific forms of violations. 
</p>
<p>82. In her report on indicators, the SRVAW further notes that indicators help make data 
accessible for non-specialist decision makers, and enable interventions and their impact to be 
open to public scrutiny. The SRVAW clarifies, however, that although indicators are necessary, 
they cannot substitute for qualitative and quantitative research, which are necessary to 
complement indicators. 
</p>
<p>83. The research study titled &#8220;The Next Step: Developing Transnational Indicators on 
Violence Against Women&#8221; examines proposals, perspectives and debates on indicators, and sets 
out the value and objectives of transnational indicators, while acknowledging the limitations of 
indicators per se and the limitations of transnational indicators in particular, in view of the need 
for context-specific variations.<b>132</b> The annual report of the SRVAW on this theme draws upon

intimate-partner violence, as well as gaps in transnational studies on various responses to VAW 
(such as help-lines, shelter and advocacy). 
</p>
<p>84. The report calls for formulating common indicators on VAW, and proposes a set of 
indicators to measure VAW (outcome indicators) and State responses to it. These consist of 
institutional/structural indicators, which pertain to States&#8217; international commitments, including 
ratification of CEDAW and plans of action on VAW; and process indicators, which pertain to 
access to justice and reporting, including victims&#8217; protection, prevention and training. The report 
further recommends that the proposal be carried forward within the United Nations by an expert 
working group through technical manuals, pilots, and revisions based on the pilots, with 
concurrent steps and assistance on management of data systems at the national level. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCEPTUAL GAINS 
</b></p>
<p>85. There has been a general tendency in human rights work to treat violence against women 
(VAW) largely within a welfare/humanitarian paradigm, or to view women as &#8220;poor victims&#8221; in 
need of protection.<b>133</b> In addition, with the adoption of the &#8220;harmful traditional practices&#8221; agenda 
b the United Nations in the 1980s, VAW came to be associated with traditional societies, thus 
de-linking the problem from structural inequalities inherent in existing gender relations.<b>134</b> The 
VAW mandate has contributed significantly to the growth of human rights jurisprudence beyond 
such narrow conceptual understandings of the problem. The conceptual shifts experienced since 
the inception of the mandate have not only broadened the under- standing of VAW, but have 
accordingly compelled revisiting international and domestic laws and State responsibility. This 
section identifies some of the major conceptual shifts in the understandings of VAW.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Beyond law and order 
</b></p>
<p>86. One of the most significant aspects of the mandate is its requirement to examine not only 
VAW but also &#8220;its causes and consequences&#8221;, and to recommend measures, ways and means, at 
the national, regional and international levels, &#8220;<i>to eliminate violence against women and its 
causes, and to remedy its consequences</i>&#8221; (emphasis added).<b>135</b> This has enabled the SRVAWs to 
question approaches that treat violations in isolation from the overall subordination of women 
within a patriarchal system. Until recently, a welfare/humanitarian paradigm has dominated the 
work of States as well as civil society on VAW. States have typically responded to the problem 
within a law-and-order framework, thereby prioritizing prosecutorial procedures as foreseen in 
the criminal law. This has meant not only overlooking the gendered specificities in the way

<p>women experience violence, particularly in the private sphere, but also focusing on the harm 
done rather than addressing the systematic nature in which VAW takes place. Departing from the 
conventional approaches, the SRVAW mandate accentuated the need to understand the 
underlying causes of VAW so as to work towards preventing violence from occurring in the first 
place. 
</p>
<p>87. The &#8220;causes and consequences&#8221; dimension of the mandate expands the human rights 
scrutiny past symptoms of gender inequality that become manifest as distinct forms of violence 
to look at structural and ideological causes that underlie the problem beyond the injury caused. 
Further, it views VAW as an outcome of gender discrimination that shapes social, economic, 
cultural and political structures, rather than being independent of them.<b>136</b> As a consequence, the 
State is obligated not merely to protect against violence, but rather to eliminate its &#8220;causes&#8221; - that 
is, gender discrimination at structural, ideological and operational levels - as well as to bear the 
responsibility for addressing its consequences. This marks a radical departure from the 
traditional notions of State responsibility towards addressing VAW. 
</p>
<p>88. The inquiry into &#8220;root causes&#8221; implicates ideology, structures and systems on which the 
institutions of the family, the community, the market and, indeed, the State are founded. The 
recurring reference in the works of the SRVAWs to &#8220;unequal power relations&#8221; as the root cause 
explains that this inequality is sustained through dominant norms regulating women&#8217;s sexuality, 
and notions of masculinity that sanction violence and control over women. For instance, the high 
rates of VAW in Mexico were contextualized by the SRVAW in the country mission report in 
relation to gender discrimination in machista cultures that institutionalize women&#8217;s subordination 
in the family and the community, and that sanction the use of violence to uphold double 
standards in male and female sexuality.<b>137</b> Likewise, in the country mission report on the 
Russian Federation, the SRVAW highlighted the resulting changes in the transition from a 
socialist economy to a market economy, and the disproportionate impact on women of wage 
cuts, wage arrears, unemployment, and reduction in access to health care and education.<b>138</b> Such 
an approach recasts gender-based violence as a logical outcome of unequal social, cultural and 
economic structures, rather than as a social aberration or a &#8220;law-and-order&#8221; problem, implicating 
the State structures (of which the law is a part) in reinforcing the root causes and thereby 
sustaining conditions for gender-based violence. For this reason, the mandate cites several 
examples of gendered legal provisions and State policies while discussing VAW - such as a 
narrow definition of rape based on patriarchal considerations, exemption of marital rape, 
discriminatory family law provisions, culture-based justification of various forms of VAW, and 
policies on abortion, family planning, sterilization and reproductive health that undermine 
women&#8217;s reproductive rights and sexual autonomy.

<p><b>B.  From victimization towards empowerment 
</b></p>
<p>89. While the recognition of women&#8217;s human rights owes much to the international campaign 
to highlight VAW, feminist writers<b>139</b> have rightfully critiqued the VAW mandate arguing that 
exclusive reliance on violence in claiming rights casts women as victims who must be rescued, 
prompting responses that may be imperialist, protectionist or charity-based. They argue that the 
responses are not concerned with the complex analysis of power and materiality that underlie 
subjugation and dominance, nor are they grounded in recognition of women&#8217;s human rights. 
Rather, the responses and remedies reinforce stereotypes, often that of the disempowered and 
brutalized Third World woman as the authentic victim, such as the victim of dowry violence or 
honour crimes, and essentializes Third World societies as backward. 
</p>
<p>90. Yakin Ert&#252;rk has responded to the critics arguing that the victimization approach to the 
VAW mandate is a result of short-sighted interpretations and treatment of violence as an isolated 
phenomenon as indicated above, rather than being inherent to the mandate itself. She further 
argues that the United Nations mandate for the elimination of VAW entails tackling the root 
causes of the problem at all levels, from the home to the transnational arena. Such a call is also 
inherent in the prevention obligation of the due diligence standard. Therefore, perceived within 
such a framework, the &#8220;violence against women agenda&#8221; intrinsically challenges aspects of 
everyday life that are taken for granted, and necessitates a shift of focus from a 
victimization-oriented approach to one of empowerment. The former sees women as weak, 
vulnerable and in need of protection, whereas in the latter approach, women are seen to be 
subjected to violence not because they are vulnerable, but because of a gender order that 
privileges male violence through the normative and institutional formations of societies. This 
gender order has historically been resisted and reacted to through women&#8217;s individual and 
collective agency. In the process, traditional patriarchy has slowly but systematically been 
ruptured at different paces in various parts of the world. Applying a human rights perspective to 
violence has created a momentum for breaking the silence around violence, and for connecting 
the diverse struggles across the globe. Today, a life free of violence is increasingly accepted as 
an entitlement rather than merely a humanitarian concern. 
</p>
<p>91. The SRVAW has placed increasing emphasis on the &#8220;causes&#8221; of VAW and the 
responsibility to redress causes. This responsibility is based on the recognition that &#8220;violence is 
not an isolated incident targeting vulnerable women but a systematically used tool of patriarchal 
control to ensure that &#8216;women stay in their place&#8217;. Therefore the agenda for the elimination of 
VAW is not about victimization but rather about the empowerment of women to overcome and

<p>eventually change patriarchal hierarchies&#8221;.<b>140</b> Over the past few years, the mandate has called for 
greater attention towards addressing &#8220;causes&#8221; by making empowerment of women central to 
State responsibility for eliminating VAW. 
</p>
<p>92. The mandate has always included education, health and gender equality requirements 
within the scope of its recommendations, and more recently has increased emphasis on these 
interventions as part of the due diligence obligation of the State to prevent VAW. Accordingly, 
country mission reports place greater emphasis on the role of the State in ensuring gender 
equality frameworks, bringing in attitudinal change, proactively ensuring women&#8217;s participation 
and decision-making, and undertaking programmes with a strong focus on promoting women&#8217;s 
empowerment and agency - in addition to recommendations directed at context- specific forms 
of violence. 
</p>
<p>93. The shifts are evident particularly in relation to culturally justified violence and trafficking, 
where the mandate has stressed developing agency of women through empowerment initiatives 
that respond to gender inequality along with other relevant axes of oppression. For instance, in 
the country mission to the Netherlands, the SRVAW drew attention to the socio-economic 
disparities between immigrant and native Dutch women, and to the vulnerability faced by 
immigrant women because of their status to essentialized notions of culture on honour crimes 
and female genital mutilation (FGM) that increasingly stigmatize immigrant communities. 
Existing State responses addressing violence specific to immigrant women have involved 
tightening of immigration policy and requirements aimed at social and cultural integration of 
immigrants, while neglecting their socio-economic marginalization. Rather than promoting and 
supporting women&#8217;s empowerment and agency, the State responses have further marginalized 
the immigrants while normalizing the discrimination and violence faced by mainstream native 
women, creating a binary of the oppressed immigrant woman versus the emancipated Dutch 
woman.<b>141</b> The SRVAWs&#8217; recommendations in response to the challenges posed by cultural 
identity politics stress the need to prevent violence at the level of the individual woman through 
empowerment of women - through securing rights and access to justice, health-care and support 
services; and at the level of the community - through facilitating and encouraging women&#8217;s 
participation and cultural negotiation so as to dismantle monolithic representations of culture.<b>142</b> 
In the case of Turkey, in order to empower women, the SRVAW called on State compliance with 
its laws in realizing obligatory primary education for all women, monitoring educational quality 
and outcomes, and promoting alternative visions of customs that are compatible with gender 
equality.<b>143</b>

<p>94. In relation to trafficking, the approach proposed is grounded in developing women&#8217;s 
agency and protecting their human rights - through making migration legal for women, removing 
immigration restrictions and law-and-order responses where movement and stay is illegal, 
protecting labour and migrant workers&#8217; rights (including those relating to the sex sector), and 
further stressing the State obligation to help in recovery and skill building, thus promoting 
women&#8217;s choices rather than detention and deportation approaches.<b>144</b> While the approaches 
promoting empowerment and agency need to be developed further, they must be combined with 
affirmation of rights and freedoms, particularly with regard to the more contentious areas, such 
as sexuality. The shift towards empowerment and agency is transformative and a step towards 
addressing &#8220;root causes&#8221; of violence. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Sexuality and violence 
</b></p>
<p>95. The root cause of VAW as noted by the mandate lies in unequal power relations between 
men and women that are founded upon differential gender-based norms. The mandate has 
consistently explained that the ideological basis sustaining unequal gender relations derives from 
the dominant notions of women&#8217;s sexuality and of masculinity that establish dual moral 
standards for women and men.<b>145</b> The mandate holders have shown how the control of female 
sexuality is central to the normative systems at the social, cultural and State levels, thereby 
reinforcing and reproducing unequal power relations that justify VAW. The SRVAW has 
examined ways in which female sexuality is controlled in the law, in the family, in the 
community and in armed conflict, clarifying its linkages with different forms of VAW.

<p>96. The SRVAW has critiqued norms based on chastity and honour that underpin laws and 
social norms, explaining how such values legitimize proprietorial control over women&#8217;s 
sexuality by men in the family and the community.<b>146</b> The SRVAW further explains the linkage 
of honour with the fear of violence or actual violence perpetrated upon women for real and 
perceived sexual transgressions in peacetime. By extension, this ideology of honour is deployed 
during armed conflict to perpetrate systematic sexual violence against women belonging to the 
other community/nation as a means of humiliating the opposition and as part of genocidal 
violence. Further, identity politics movements based on culture view women as 
markers/custodians of community identity and honour, placing upon them the burden of 
conforming to the notions of the ideal woman, integral to which is normative sexuality.<b>147</b>

<p>97. In relation to the law, the SRVAW has observed that dominant notions of female sexuality 
have shaped protectionist approaches in international humanitarian law<b>148</b> and domestic penal 
codes. Rape and sexual assault laws that refer to women&#8217;s chastity, closure of rape cases upon 
marriage with the rapist, non-criminalization of marital rape, adultery laws, and restrictions 
regarding relationships outside ethnic, religious or class boundaries are ways of policing 
women&#8217;s sexuality.<b>149</b> The SRVAW has been critical of moral and patriarchal foundations of 
laws on rape and sexual assault that are reflected in restrictive definitions of rape, and that place 
value on corroboration and previous sexual history of the rape survivor. 
</p>
<p>98. The mandate holders have noted that all forms of gender-based violence are &#8220;often used as 
an instrument to control female sexual behaviour&#8221;<b>150</b> in ways that cast women as male property 
or punish women who transgress the sexual norms. Through the country missions and the 
communications, the mandate holders have responded to retribution for women&#8217;s expressions of 
reproductive and non-reproductive sexual activity, as well as for expressions of heterosexual and 
non-heterosexual sexuality.<b>151</b> The SRVAW has issued communications in respect to information 
received regarding detention of women in police stations on grounds of sexual orientation and 
the resulting risk of torture and sexual violence to them in custody,<b>152</b> and in respect of arrest, 
detention and torture of transgendered persons;<b>153</b> similarly, a communication was issued to 
express concern for the physical security and access to justice for a man who had undergone 
sex-change surgery.<b>154</b> Many of the communications to governments by the mandate holders 
have been in relation to honour crimes committed by family members, or to the action/inaction 
of the State with regard to stoning, flogging or death by hanging of women for suspected 
premarital sex, for adultery, for failing to prove rape, and for acts deemed incompatible with 
chastity - in one case involving a minor raped by her brother, and another of a teenage girl with 
psychosocial disabilities.<b>155</b>

<p>99. The SRVAWs have consistently referred to the linkage between culturally justified VAW 
and control of female sexuality, observing that women&#8217;s emotional and sexual expression is seen 
to destabilize the unequal social order.<b>156</b> Alongside the notions of female sexuality are notions 
of masculinity that valorize violence in and of itself, as an expression of male sexuality, and as a 
means of conflict resolution.<b>157</b> The country mission reports on El Salvador and Mexico 
contextualize violence in relation to the machista culture that subordinates women and sanctions 
double standards regarding male and female sexuality.<b>158</b> Similarly, the report on Turkey 
contextualizes violence in relation to the conceptions of honour that view sexual transgressions 
by women as stains on the family honour, deserving of punishment even by death as a means of 
upholding patriarchal privilege.<b>159</b> 
</p>
<p>100. The observations of the mandate have not been limited to violations alone, but have also 
endorsed rights, such as the inclusion of same-sex unions within the expanded definition of the 
family,<b>160</b> and have reaffirmed reproductive and sexual rights.<b>161</b> While calling attention to the 
Cairo language that &#8220;all human beings have a right to a safe and satisfying sex life&#8221;, Radhika 
Coomaraswamy has also noted that &#8220;gender-based violence ... is particularly acute when 
combined with discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or change of gender identity. 
Violence against sexual minorities is on the increase and it is important that we take up the 
challenge of what may be called the last frontier of human rights&#8221;.<b>162</b>

<p><b>D.  Demystifying cultural discourses 
</b></p>
<p>101. Culture-based identity politics has been considered by the mandate holders to pose one of 
the most serious challenges to women&#8217;s human rights.<b>163</b> They have addressed challenges arising 
from cultural relativist assertions that reject universality of human rights, particularly with regard 
to women&#8217;s equality, as well as cultural essentialist approaches that view some cultures as being 
inherently misogynist. Cultural discourses are a significant source of diverse normative systems 
that shape power relations between men and women, while the common values across societies 
have helped develop human rights law reflecting universality and shared culture. Despite the 
shared values that human rights largely embody, colonial histories, deepening political and 
economic inequalities and divisions between and among nations have polarized societies, 
particularly in the post-September 11 times. These divisions and inequalities have coalesced with 
patriarchy to provide fertile ground for cultural discourses. Cultural discourses are manifested in 
international law,<b>164</b> on the one hand, by resorting to cultural justification to resist women&#8217;s 
rights, and through references to primordial and hegemonic interpretations of culture. On the 
other hand, they are visible in the cultural essentialist targeting of &#8220;traditional societies&#8221; in the 
global South that are perceived as harmful to women. Over the period of 15 years and several 
reports - in particular the three annual reports,<b>165</b> two of which deal with this theme specifically - 
the VAW mandate has contributed to a paradigm shift in the way cultural discourses are 
addressed and considered within a human rights framework. 
</p>
<p>102. The shift in the responses to cultural discourses by the mandate is evident primarily at two 
levels: first, through rejection of the term &#8220;harmful traditional practices&#8221; and instead adoption of 
the term &#8220;harmful practices&#8221; in relation to cultural practices in the family that violate women&#8217;s 
rights;<b>166</b> and second, through debunking the monolithic static representations of culture (by both 
cultural relativists and cultural essentialists) to call for State participation in validating 
alternative and non-hegemonic interpretations of culture by women and encouraging cultural 
negotiation. The harmful cultural practices framework was developed particularly in relation to 
traditional cultures in the context of CEDAW. Article 5 (a) of CEDAW calls for modification of 
&#8220;social and cultural patterns of conduct ... with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices 
and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the 
superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women&#8221;. General 
Recommendation 21 of the CEDAW Committee elaborated on this problem in relation to 
traditional cultures only, observing that practices based on &#8220;custom, religious beliefs or the

<p>ethnic origins of particular groups of people [in certain countries] permit forced marriages or 
remarriages. Other countries allow a woman&#8217;s marriage to be arranged for payment or 
preferment and in others women&#8217;s poverty forces them to marry foreign nationals for financial 
security&#8221;.<b>167</b> 
</p>
<p>103. The first annual report of the mandate retains the terminology of &#8220;traditional practices&#8221; to 
document culturally derived forms of VAW in the family, such as FGM, son preference, 
discriminatory nutritional and health care for girls, and early marriage and discrimination in 
traditional laws.<b>168</b> The subsequent report on the theme, titled &#8220;Cultural Practices in the Family 
that Are Violent towards Women&#8221;,<b>169</b> reflects the shift to &#8220;harmful practices&#8221;. While the report is 
alert to the challenges posed by cultural identity politics, the predominant focus remains on 
practices from the Southern cultures,<b>170</b> inadvertently reinforcing global identity politics - 
&#8220;othering&#8221; the traditional/primitive South from the modern/progressive North. The report 
proposes a two-pronged approach to defining State obligation in relation to modification of such 
harmful practices, distinguishing practices that amount to torture from those that are essentially 
discrimination. It views cultural practices that involve pain and suffering and violation of 
physical integrity as amounting to torture under customary international law, attaching to such 
practices strict penal sanctions and maximum international scrutiny regardless of ratification of 
CEDAW or reservations made thereto. With regard to discriminatory practices such as unequal 
family/succession laws, polygamy or unequal divorce rights, the report discusses a range of 
approaches adopted by various countries to correspond to the diversity of contexts, which 
ultimately aim towards attitudinal change so that social transformation is led by the community 
itself. In this context, the obligations of State parties to CEDAW as well as those under due 
diligence are relied upon, citing examples to address discrimination, such as the notion of 
progressive realization of rights as recognized in the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and further developed by the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights (CESCR); protection of core minimum rights elaborated upon by CESCR; and 
the right to choose traditional law or opt out of it.<b>171</b> The recommendations emphasize the need 
for education and health services for women. 
</p>
<p>104. The report on this theme titled &#8220;Intersections between Culture and Violence against 
Women&#8221; addresses cultural discourses from the standpoint of inequalities and subjectivities 
within culture and cultural groups, so as to promote empowerment, agency and contestation by 
women within the domain of culture.<b>172</b> This report acknowledges the biases and shortcomings

<p>of the &#8220;traditional cultural practices&#8221; approach in terms of &#8220;othering&#8221; Southern cultures, 
essentializing them as being harmful to women, while treating violence in non-Southern cultures 
as individualized aberrations and projecting women from traditional cultures as being uniformly 
victimized.<b>173</b> Instead, it locates culture within the equality framework as part of addressing 
discrimination in the private arena, so as to facilitate women&#8217;s participation, decision-making 
and representation within the domain of culture. Such an approach allows the unmasking of 
patterns of &#8220;domination&#8221; within rather than &#8220;difference&#8221; among cultures, to question hegemonic 
interpretations of culture, and it directs attention towards the patriarchal, political and economic 
interests within and outside the community that gain from static, homogenous and monolithic 
representations. In doing so, it also seeks to debunk culture-based discourses as being cultural 
manifestations of a universal patriarchal culture, with its roots in gender inequality rather than in 
cultural expressions of people in diverse social settings and standings. 
</p>
<p>105. The SRVAW has been critical of State-supported hegemonic interpretations of religion to 
debunk cultural relativism, and equally critical of State approaches that essentialize certain 
cultures as inherently violent and discriminatory towards women. In the country mission report 
on Afghanistan, the prevalence of child and forced marriages, the criminalization of &#8220;running 
away from home&#8221;, and the labeling of a wide range of behaviours as &#8220;adultery&#8221; in the law 
demonstrate that tribal rules are wrongly passed off as sharia to enforce compliance.<b>174</b> The 
country mission report on Iran states that the &#8220;ruling clergy, in their reading of the sharia that 
shapes both the attitudinal as well as the institutional structures, have tended towards 
conservative, gender-biased interpretations&#8221;, noting the impact of such interpretations on 
women&#8217;s vulnerability to violence in public and private spheres. The report further notes the 
existence of a plurality of interpretations, such as the debates in the political arena between the 
hardliners and the reformists, and the contribution of women&#8217;s organizations in reinterpreting the 
Koran from a women&#8217;s perspective.<b>175</b> As part of this shift in approach to culture, the SRVAW 
has questioned cultural relativist arguments used to justify VAW, as well as cultural essentialism 
underlying State action or inaction regarding women from marginalized communities. For 
instance, the country mission report on Mexico critiques the view that VAW is an inherent part 
of indigenous culture, in relation to the multiple violations faced by indigenous women from 
rural areas due to ethnicity and poverty.<b>176</b> 
</p>
<p>106. Noting state complicity in according importance to such hegemonic voices, the SRVAW 
specifies that the due diligence responsibility of the State must include not only legislative, 
investigative and judicial reform to end impunity, but also empowerment approaches to build 
women&#8217;s capacities and to facilitate the questioning of hegemony within cultures by women. 
With regard to Ghana, for instance, Ert&#252;rk noted that although there were laws against FGM,

<p><i>trokosi </i>(ritual servitude) and sexual abuse of girls, culture continued to be invoked to sustain 
these forms of violence. She recommended, therefore, public denouncement of violence, and the 
need to engage traditional authorities in public dialogue on women&#8217;s rights and secure their 
compliance on women&#8217;s rights under the Constitution; to increase the appointments of women in 
district assembly and law enforcement bodies; and to undertake awareness raising.<b>177</b> This 
approach has helped develop understanding in relation to the State obligation to prevent VAW 
through transformatory processes based on women&#8217;s empowerment and encouragement of 
&#8220;cultural negotiation&#8221; discussed under accountability of non-State actors earlier in this report. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Intersectionality of discrimination and continuum of violence 
</b></p>
<p>107. The representations of women and violence by the SRVAWs have been cognizant of the 
multiple layers of discrimination that combine to heighten the vulnerability of women and their 
experience of violence, and that most typically result in a continuous chain of violence for 
marginalized women.<b>178</b> This marks a departure from the flat narratives of gender-based violence 
that tend to homogenize the diverse experiences of women, as well as from approaches that tend 
to fragment the experience of each individual woman. The intersectional approach has been used 
as an integral analytical tool in the work methods of the mandate, while also providing a 
conceptual paradigm that allows us to see the universality in VAW without losing sight of the 
particularities in women&#8217;s experiences. In the same vein, the continuum approach makes visible 
the linkages between violence in different contexts, such as in peace and in war. 
</p>
<p>108. The SRVAW has consistently adopted an intersectional framework to demonstrate how 
&#8220;multiple systems of discrimination and hegemony&#8221; result in three categories of discrimination: 
&#8220;targeted&#8221;, such as in armed conflict against women of the &#8220;other&#8221; community; &#8220;compounded&#8221;, 
in which an amalgam of gender and minority/marginalized group membership bars women from 
opportunities that would otherwise be available to them; and &#8220;structural&#8221;, whereby State policies 
intersect with structural discrimination to increase the degree of marginalization of women based 
on gender, race, poverty or migrant status.<b>179</b> Applying this framework, Coomaraswamy has 
shown how gender interacts with poverty and race to make African- American and Hispanic 
women in the United States face disproportionate levels of criminalization, more severe 
sentencing, over-representation in prisons, and abuse.<b>180</b> This framework has helped not only to 
draw attention to the experiences, violations and structural barriers faced by women on the 
margins, but also to design legal standards and State accountability in response to the particular 
kind of discrimination constituted in a given context.

<p>109. Intersectionality is also demonstrated by work methods in terms of the joint 
communications, country visits and reports undertaken by the SRVAW with other special 
procedures. Only a small fraction of the total number of communications issued by the SRVAW 
annually are sent singly; the bulk of the communications are sent jointly with other special 
mechanisms.<b>181</b> During the past two years, a large majority of the joint communications have 
been sent with the special thematic mechanisms on torture, human rights defenders, trafficking, 
and freedom of opinion and expression,<b>182</b> &#8220;indicating a convergence between diverse forms of

SRVAW sent 80 joint communications and three alone (total of 83); in 2007, the SRVAW sent 
55 joint communications and seven alone (total of 62); from 1 January to 1 December 2008, the 
SRVAW sent 65 joint communications and 12 others alone (total of 77). The data per year does 
not fully correspond to the figures mentioned in communications reports. This is because a 
period of 60 days is allowed for the governments to reply to allegation letters, as a result of 
which communications cannot be made public before the expiration of 60 days; if this period 
overlaps with the time when the SRVAW submits her report to the HRC, such communications 
do not get published in the year they are sent, and are instead reflected in the report due in the 
following year.

also signals an erosion of the public/private sphere dichotomy used for so long to exclude 
violence against women from public concern and scrutiny&#8221;.<b>183</b> In addition to conducting joint 
visits,<b>184</b> the SRVAW has participated in joint work or submissions upon the initiative of the 
Human Rights Council, such as with the group of experts on Darfur<b>185</b> and the group of special 
procedures mandated to make recommendations for technical cooperation to the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo,<b>186</b> or for other bodies, such as the Preparatory Committee for the Durban 
Review Conference.<b>187</b> In addition, the SRVAW has benefited from cooperation with treaty 
bodies - in particular from the work of CEDAW, by using, among other things, its general 
recommendations and concluding observations after consideration of reports of State parties, 
case law, and inquiry into situations of grave or systematic violations of women&#8217;s rights under 
the Optional Protocol.<b>188</b> 
</p>
<p>110. The SRVAW has noted that &#8220;integrating an intersectional approach to gender analysis will 
enhance the analytical capacity of gender analysis in better identifying the multiple forms of 
discrimination and link State accountability for human rights under various treaty bodies&#8221;.<b>189</b> 
Notably, such an approach makes visible the continuum of violence and discrimination that 
captures more fully the consequences of intersectional discrimination. The SRVAW has applied 
this in relation to female refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), to formulate

<p>recommendations to secure protection for them during flight, in refugee camps, and in relation to 
redress and prosecutions for violations; and further, to recommend inclusion of gender for 
purposes of seeking asylum on grounds of persecution.<b>190</b> In relation to trafficking, the SRVAW 
notes that &#8220;trafficking is fuelled by poverty, racism and sexism&#8221;,<b>191</b> highlighting the violations 
arising during the course of trafficking as a result of restrictions and illegalities created by 
migration and immigration policies and denial of labour rights. 
</p>
<p>111. The significance of this conceptual shift is evident in the centrality given to the concerns of 
marginalized women in the mandate of the SRVAW, instead of subsuming their heightened 
experience of discrimination under a generic singular form of discrimination - gender, race or 
poverty. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  POTENTIAL AND CHALLENGES 
</b></p>
<p>112. The violence against women (VAW) mandate has covered considerable ground in 
its 15 years of existence, and its function remains as crucial today as it was at the time of its 
creation. It has been a dynamic medium through which experiences of violations of women, 
many of which were marginalized and invisible in the domain of international law, have found 
recognition and a place within the framework of human rights realization. However, even as 
some forms of violation and marginalization become visible, many remain invisible, sensitive or 
contentious areas of recognition within women&#8217;s human rights. Gender inequality still exists, and 
alongside progressive developments and victories that inspire the struggle for women&#8217;s rights, 
newer developments coalesce with historic inequalities to deepen disparities, vulnerabilities and 
subordination, exposing many women to a constellation of violations.<b>192</b> In particular, the 
growing militarization, the security agenda since September 11, and the conservative political 
trends that agenda has fuelled will continue to pose serious challenges to women and to human 
rights in general. 
</p>
<p>113. The mandate of the SRVAW must continue to meet future challenges, some of which arise 
in relation to the work accomplished and others in relation to emerging issues. Some of the 
advances made - such as the use of cultural discourses in their relativist and their essentialist 
forms - will remain contested and will continue to pose challenges. In less contested areas of 
advancement, implementation, compliance and prevention remain predominant areas that the 
mandate must continue to address. This section looks at challenges and potentials, paying more

conventions on VAW while drawing attention to the limitations of universal understandings of 
violence in capturing or making visible the nuances and differences in understandings of power 
and violence, as well as the contingent nature of negotiations and struggles in varied local 
contexts. </p>

</p>
<p>attention to issues arising in relation to the work accomplished thus far. This discussion, 
therefore, is intended to be indicative of the continuing role of the mandate even in relation to the 
issues it covers substantially, in addition to its role regarding emerging areas within human rights 
law and practice. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Standards setting in relation to empowerment approaches 
</b></p>
<p>114. The concepts of empowerment and agency are interconnected, as the former constitutes a 
necessary condition for exercising agency and has an impact on power relations between women 
and men. The mandate holders have asserted in nearly all the annual and country mission reports, 
and more recently in public statements,<b>193</b> the need for the State to support the social, cultural, 
economic and political empowerment of women. Ert&#252;rk&#8217;s recommendations in various contexts 
are indicative of the types of interventions that can be categorized as facilitating empowerment. 
In relation to violence in the public and private spheres against women in Ghana, some of which 
are culturally justified, the recommendations include support for social, political and economic 
empowerment of women. Similarly, in relation to the mission in Turkey, the recommendations 
include promotion and endorsement of advancement of women, with an emphasis on gender 
equality and education. In relation to the Netherlands and Sweden, the SRVAW indicated the 
need to enhance the gender equality and institutional framework so as to integrate and involve 
marginalized constituencies within it. Ending impunity for VAW, according to a joint statement 
by several Special Rapporteurs, is not simply a matter of enacting and enforcing criminal laws, 
but also of empowering women through access to critical resources and justice.<b>194</b> The statement 
notes that women&#8217;s ability to protect themselves and access remedies entails the realization of 
their socio-economic rights, such as those regarding housing, land, property and inheritance. 
Empowerment has been elaborated upon in inclusive terms to encompass interventions dealing 
with education, legal literacy, skill training and access to productive resources. In relation to 
culture, empowerment strategies recommended by the SRVAW stress recognizing and 
facilitating women&#8217;s initiatives to contest, reinterpret debate and negotiate cultural norms and 
practices within the community.

</p>
<p>115. While there is enough elaboration on the types of interventions that lead to empowerment, 
there remains a need for clarity and operationalization on the approaches to take with respect to 
such interventions that will constitute empowerment, as contained, for instance, in the Beijing 
Platform for Action, or on the indicators that help determine whether in fact an intervention is 
likely to lead to empowerment. For example, would micro credit programmes or skill trainings 
as separate single interventions advance empowerment, or would they have to be implemented in 
conjunction with education that is free of gender stereotypes and accessible to women and girls? 
In view of the fact that protectionist, honour-based and welfare- oriented approaches are 
commonly adopted in State-run programmes regarding women, there is a concern about the 
value of such interventions in relation to empowerment. The need to distinguish empowerment 
from protectionist approaches within various contexts will help clarify empowerment approaches 
that counter disadvantages specific to women on the intersections of two or more axes of 
discrimination. In the context of effective approaches to support women&#8217;s empowerment, the 
SRVAW has referred to the minimum measures outlined by CEDAW for governments to 
address root causes.<b>195</b> Greater attention to and emphasis on the interlinkages between 
empowerment and CEDAW can bring clarity on this matter. Further work on developing 
indicators on VAW and State response to it can also help set criteria to determine approaches 
that advance empowerment beyond the ability to cope, to an ability to change. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Combining sexual rights with sexual wrongs 
</b></p>
<p>116. By placing protectionist legal responses relating to women&#8217;s sexuality at one end of the 
spectrum that contains egregious forms of sexual violence, the mandate has forced a radical 
questioning of the conceptualization of sexuality and a rethinking of protectionist approaches in 
law that are often viewed as benign. Although the mandate has identified dominant notions of 
female sexuality and masculinity as critical causes of gender-based violence, it has yet to 
reconceptualize sexuality or to suggest transformatory approaches in this regard. Yet the 
prevention/empowerment/agency approach to elimination of VAW requires going beyond 
addressing sexual violence and discrimination due to sexuality, towards articulation of positive 
rights in relation to sexuality. 
</p>
<p>117. Radhika Coomaraswamy has noted that responding to the challenge regarding sexuality is 
the last frontier of human rights. It has been argued that this challenge requires moving beyond 
condemning regulation of female sexuality through an exclusive focus in VAW on sexual 
wrongs, such as rape, child sexual abuse, sexual assault and sexual harassment. In this regard, it 
has been noted that &#8220;if we fail to pursue a more radical and affirmative strategy on matters 
related to sex we will fail to adequately address the sexual harms women continue to 
experience&#8221;.<b>196</b> Further, Coomaraswamy has pointed out that a focus on sexual wrongs and

</p>
<p>regulation will only perpetuate sexual stereotypes, sexism and orthodoxies that reinforce the 
control over female sexuality - ideologies that underscore gender inequality. The need to shift 
beyond sexual wrongs to sexual rights has been explained as: &#8220;The ability to say &#8216;no&#8217; to what 
one does not desire is hugely conditioned on the capacity to recognize, delight in, and respond to 
one&#8217;s desire to say &#8216;yes&#8217;, free of limiting stereotypes and with knowledge of the implications for 
one&#8217;s safety and contentment.&#8221;<b>197</b> Although sexual health is a part of reproductive rights, sexual 
rights are distinct from reproductive rights, &#8220;since many of the expressions of sexuality are 
non-reproductive&#8221;<b>198</b> and include &#8220;the right of all persons to express their sexual orientation, with 
due regard for the well being and rights of others, without fear of persecution, denial of liberty or 
social interference&#8221;, and require further attention in the context of human rights.<b>199</b> The scope of 
sexual rights is much broader than sexual health or reproductive rights, and is not specific to 
women alone. Thus it needs to be developed in terms of respect, protection and fulfillment 
within human rights law by more than one body or mechanism in the United Nations system, in 
order to move beyond its current violation-centered boundaries to fully challenge gender 
inequality. However, the SRVAW, in cooperation with the Special Rapporteur on the Right to 
Health, has a distinct role to play in this development given the causal link with the mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Applying intersectionality 
</b></p>
<p>118. The mandate has consistently drawn attention to the imperative of applying intersectional 
approaches to identify and address the effects of multiple systems of discrimination operating 
simultaneously, rather than address each form of discrimination in isolation of the other.<b>200</b> This 
approach has helped make visible the concerns of marginalized women, as well as contexts that 
heighten the risks and vulnerability of women to violence, as discussed earlier in this report. 
</p>
<p>119. In 2001, the SRVAW called for urgent action &#8220;to be taken at both the national and 
international levels to raise awareness of the multiple nature of discrimination experienced by 
marginalized women and to mainstream an intersectional or more holistic approach ... at a 
theoretical level and addressed at a practical level&#8221;. Towards this end, the SRVAW

created by intersectional discrimination are often subsumed within one category of 
discrimination, such as race or gender discrimination.&#8221; </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.5

</p>
<p>recommended the development of appropriate evaluation and implementation strategies aimed at 
the elimination of gender-based racial discrimination, and called upon the States to &#8220;collect, 
compile and disseminate data according to race and gender&#8221;, instead of the conventional practice 
of collecting data according to only race or gender, which renders invisible the distinct form of 
racial discrimination against women.<b>201</b> In relation to the United Nations system, the SRVAW 
made similar recommendations and proposed the need to: &#8220;(a) develop new methodologies, 
reporting procedures and evaluating tools to identify and address the effects of multiple forms of 
discrimination &#8230;; [and] (b) Address the intersection of gender and race in the design and 
implementation of policies and programmes of the United Nations system in social, economic, 
political and other domains.&#8221;<b>202</b> 
</p>
<p>120. While the development of methods, reporting procedures and evaluation tools for 
implementing and monitoring intersectionality remains to be undertaken, the need to apply 
intersectional approaches to emerging areas in women&#8217;s human rights is a continuing one as 
well. The gender- based dimensions of new treaties and declarations that have come into force 
need attention to ensure that their application in relation to women is not delayed. Just as the 
SRVAWs helped elaborate gender-based violence in terms of race and gender in addition to 
HIV/AIDS, the mandate would need to take the lead in relation to VAW and indigenous peoples 
as well as disability, the two recent areas of developments in international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>121. Article 44 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007) 
emphasizes that all the rights and freedoms recognized in the Declaration are equally guaranteed 
to male and female indigenous individuals. The Declaration further calls upon the States to take 
effective measures and, where appropriate, special measures to ensure continuing improvement 
of the economic and social condition of indigenous peoples, with particular attention to the rights 
and special needs of indigenous elders, women, youth, children and persons with disabilities.<b>203</b> 
Notably, it also calls upon States to take measures to ensure that indigenous women and children 
enjoy full protection and guarantees against all forms of violence and discrimination.<b>204</b> Clearly, 
the SRVAWs&#8217; work in relation to violence in the family and the community, in relation to 
culture, and in relation to the impact of economic, social and reproductive health policies 
requires contextualization to indigenous women to ensure that this Declaration is applied with 
reference to its intersection with gender-based violence, and keeping in mind indigenous 
women&#8217;s right to be free from violence and discrimination while furthering indigenous peoples&#8217; 
collective rights.

</p>
<p>122. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2007)<b>205</b> covers gender within 
its substantive scope to the extent of recognizing that women and girls with disabilities are often 
at greater risk of violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or 
exploitation; and further, that women are subject to multiple discrimination. It calls upon States 
to ensure women&#8217;s advancement and empowerment. Yet again, the distinct forms of these 
violations and their dimensions and impact in relation to various kinds of disability needs 
elaboration, as do State obligations to enable the treaty to address gender-specific concerns. 
Although this is within the mandate of the new Committee on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, the SRVAW could contribute to it significantly to ensure that the serious and often 
invisible nature of the abuse and the impunity attached to it are addressed, and that nuances of 
empowerment approaches in relation to disability are augmented. Similarly, the mandate can 
make a significant contribution through closer work and collaboration with treaty bodies to 
develop the gender dimensions in various themes and areas, such as with the Committee on 
Migrant Workers and the CEDAW Committee in relation to migrant women. 
</p>
<p>123. Other violations persist that would warrant further attention by the SRVAW. Although 
gender dimensions of conflict situations are covered, those pertaining to disaster management 
and humanitarian relief remain in need of elaboration. In addition, violence specific to elderly 
women or adolescent girls, women who are victims of caste-based discrimination,<b>206</b> and women 
who are migrants, refugees or non-citizens needs to be highlighted. Intersectionality sets out a 
wide canvas for the SRVAW to work on, as no matter how much ground is covered, issues and 
contexts that need attention will remain, given the overlapping and interconnectedness of issues, 
discriminations and structures of power. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Fuller coverage of areas addressed by the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>124. The mandate has paid attention to many forms of violence as well as aspects of 
implementation in its annual reports, discussed in the previous sections of this report. Apart from 
the issues that are covered as independent themes, the mandate has dealt with several other 
issues that have been subsumed within the themes of the annual reports, under country mission 
reports, and as subjects of communications to governments. There remains a need for 
consolidating and giving fuller attention to issues that find dispersed mention in various reports. 
In this regard, health and reproductive rights, women refugees and asylum-seekers, institutional 
mechanisms, and aspects related to implementation are flagged for attention.

</p>
<p><b>1.  Health and reproductive rights 
</b></p>
<p>125. Reproductive rights, discussed earlier in this report, have been the subject of several 
reports,<b>207</b> including country mission reports. Differential health status among women from 
particular racial groups, due to differential access to health-care services and coercive 
reproductive health measures that target such groups, resulting in forced sterilization and higher 
maternal and infant mortality, have also been addressed partially by the mandate in relation to 
indigenous women.<b>208</b> Likewise, health services for victims of domestic and sexual violence 
have been a recurring concern in various annual and country reports.<b>209</b> Although reproductive 
health has been a recurrent theme in relation to its interconnections with certain contexts, such as 
armed conflict, trafficking, HIV/AIDS and State policies, it appears dispersed and, as a result, its 
effect is diluted in terms of standards setting.<b>210</b> In addition, reproductive rights have been 
addressed predominantly in relation to adult women, leaving work to be done regarding the 
concerns of the girl-child, adolescents and the elderly. It is equally necessary that health issues 
other than reproductive health also be addressed, particularly from a life cycle approach, 
including concerns related to differentiated access to health services on grounds of age, marital 
status, ethnicity, HIV/AIDS, or rural or urban location. Issues of sex education, reproductive 
health or abuse by health-care providers are systemic, and their linkages with gender-based 
violence need to be consolidated in the interest of standards setting. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Violence in the context of migration, displacement, and asylum 
</b></p>
<p>126. The concerns of migrant, internally displaced and refugee women have been dealt with by 
the mandate holders in the contexts of armed conflict and trafficking. The concerns raised have 
been mostly in relation to violations that occur once the woman has become a refugee and is in 
flight or within camps. Likewise, the mandate has addressed asylum claims regarding 
communications and complaints received from women asylum-seekers to follow up on these

<p>with the governments.<b>211</b> While the mandate has shown that violations based on gender are often 
life-threatening, work remains to be done to establish gender as independent grounds for 
claiming asylum as a refugee. Although gender-based violations pursuant to becoming a refugee 
must continue to be addressed, urgent attention needs to be paid to gender as grounds for 
becoming a refugee or an asylum-seeker.<b>212</b> Mindful of the protection gap in relation to gender 
as grounds for seeking asylum within the Refugee Convention, the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 2002 adopted guidelines on &#8220;Gender-Related 
Persecution within the Context of Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention&#8221; and has since been 
encouraging States to give adequate importance to gender elements in examining asylum 
claims.<b>213</b> However, much remains to be done in this regard, and it would seem important for the 
mandate to dedicate a thematic report on these concerns for standards setting, providing an 
analysis of trends, and addressing aspects of &#8220;gender guidance, fast track asylum determination 
procedure, internal flight alternative, detention, forced removal and destitution&#8221;.<b>214</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Institutions and mechanism for monitoring and addressing VAW 
</b></p>
<p>127. Despite advances in the creation of tools to enable and enhance compliance, such as 
standards setting, indicators, and expansion of accountability for non-State actors, 
implementation continues to pose a serious challenge, which the mandate must continue to 
address by developing clarity on various dimensions of implementation. 
</p>
<p>128. In this regard, it is desirable to give greater emphasis and clarity to national and 
international mechanisms that must monitor and facilitate compliance. At the national level, the 
value of independent and autonomous mechanisms such as ombudspersons, machineries on 
women, observatories and national human rights institutions needs more emphasis. Based on the 
observations of the SRVAWs in mission reports, the mandate may want to clarify and stress the 
role of national human rights institutions with regard to gender-based violence regardless of the 
existence of a women-specific body, and the need for autonomous bodies to play a stronger 
monitoring role in relation to VAW. While the mandate has given some attention to autonomous

</b>  Eight women asylum-seekers who used the mechanism of the SRVAW from 1997 to 2006, 
</p>
<p>mostly to prevent deportation to their country of origin, have been discussed in &#8220;A Last Resort? 
Women Asylum-Seekers and the UNSRVAW&#8221; by Debora Singer, a report by the Refugee 
Women&#8217;s Resource Project at Asylum Aid (December 2006). 
<b>212
</b></p>
<p>  Despite women suffering violations because of their gender, the Refugee Convention does 
not include gender as one of the grounds on which an individual can claim asylum. Some 
countries, such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, recognize 
sexual abuse, forced marriage, forced abortion and FGM as amounting to persecutions in order 
to accept gender-based asylum claims on grounds of Particular Social Group. However, gender is 
not specific grounds within the Refugee Convention. See Singer, op. cit.

<p>bodies in the country mission reports,<b>215</b> consolidated standards setting in relation to such 
mechanisms at the domestic level remains to be done - particularly to encourage inclusion of 
gender-based concerns, and to strengthen the autonomy and role of these 
institutions/mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Women&#8217;s groups and human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>129. The mandate has taken note of the valuable role of non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), civil society groups and women&#8217;s movements, as well as the constraints and controls 
under which they work in different contexts.<b>216</b> In light of State controls that limit women&#8217;s 
movements&#8217;, freedom of association, autonomy or expression in many contexts, as well as 
threats by non-State actors to women human rights defenders, it would be important for the 
mandate to reinforce State responsibility towards enabling and protecting NGOs and women 
human rights defenders.<b>217</b> The affirmation of civil society actors in eliminating violence and 
monitoring State obligations is an important part of implementing the agenda of the mandate. 
The State obligation to ensure space, independence and security to women human rights 
defenders and women&#8217;s groups/movements is vital to the fulfillment of the due diligence 
obligations of the State, and to promote cultural negotiation strategies recommended by the 
mandate. International mechanisms for the protection of women human rights defenders working 
in conflict zones need to be developed and strengthened to ensure immediate and effective 
response when national-level mechanisms fail. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  International follow-up and implementation 
</b></p>
<p>130. At the international level, strategies and steps need to be put in place to ensure follow-up 
and implementation of the mandate&#8217;s recommendations. At present, there is no means of 
ensuring that the recommendations in the country mission reports are implemented or integrated 
into the programme of the government, a United Nations agency or other international agencies

<p>  In this regard, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Human Rights 
Defenders has emphasized that women human rights defenders face greater risks to particular 
forms of violence, including restrictions and prejudice; see A/HRC/4/37, paras. 98-104. </p>

<p>working in the country.<b>218</b> Attention towards developing systems and processes that ensure 
follow-up through planning, budgeting and resource allocation for international agencies, 
including the United Nations, is required in the future as part of facilitating compliance and 
accountability. In this regard, Ert&#252;rk has emphasized the need to complement the VAW mandate 
with a sustainable funding source from which funds can be channelled to the implementation of 
the recommendations made following official country visits. She has made a concrete proposal 
to this effect, which is under consideration.<b>219</b> 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p>131. The challenge before the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women has been and 
will remain immense, knowing that no matter how much the mandate advances the standards, 
conceptual understanding and tools for implementation and accountability in relation to VAW, 
the problem will persist - given how inextricably it is linked to other areas of subordination, 
disparities and discrimination. The role of the mandate is invaluable as the forum that can make 
visible hidden violations, lend support to and communicate the voices of the most vulnerable 
women, and act as a channel to access justice and accountability where national systems of 
justice are not well developed or when they fail to respond. The unfortunate fact remains that, for 
the most part, VAW continues to be perpetrated with impunity, access to justice is ridden with 
obstacles, and accountability remains elusive within the domestic realm. As a special 
mechanism, the mandate commands expertise, independence, concerted thematic focus, an 
ability to engage directly through country visits, ongoing accessibility to victims, and an 
advocacy role in identifying implementation gaps.<b>220</b> Thus, the mandate will continue to serve a 
pivotal role in the development of human rights law with respect to women, and in their 
protection.
