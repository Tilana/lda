Summary of Facts
1. The Complainants are 14 individuals who brought the communication on their behalf and on behalf of the
people of Southern Cameroon1 against the Republic of Cameroon, a State Party to the African Charter on
Human and Peoples' Rights.
2. The Complain[an]ts allege violations which can be traced to the period shortly after "La Republique du
Cameroun" became independent on 1st January 1960. The Complainants state that Southern Cameroon
was a United Nations Trust Territory administered by the British, separately from the Francophone part of
the Republic of Cameroon, itself a French administered United Nations Trust Territory. Both became UN
Trust Territories at the end of the 2nd World War, on 13 December 1946 under the UN Trusteeship System.
3. The Complainants allege that during the 1961 UN plebiscite, Southern Cameroonians were offered "two
alternatives" , namely: a choice to join Nigeria or Cameroon. They voted for the later. Subsequently,
Southern Cameroon and La République du Cameroun, negotiated and adopted the September 1961
Federal Constitution, at Foumban, leading to the formation of the Federal Republic of Cameroon on 1st
October 1961. The Complainants allege further that the UN plebiscite ignored a third alternative, namely
the right to independence and statehood for Southern Cameroon.
4. The Complainants allege that the overwhelming majority of Southern Cameroonians preferred
independence to the two alternatives offered during the UN plebiscite. They favoured a prolonged period of
trusteeship to allow for further evaluation of a third alternative. They allege further that the September 1961
Federal Constitution did not receive the endorsement of the Southern Cameroon House of Assembly.
5. The Complainants allege that the violations suffered by the people of Southern Cameroon emanate from
the UN plebiscite of 11 February 1961 organised to determine the political future of Southern Cameroon,
and the failure by the Respondent State to abide by the 1961 Federal Constitutional[sic].
6. They allege that on 1st October 1961 La République du Cameroun, with the tacit approval of the British
government, drafted gendarmes, police and soldiers from the Francophone side into Southern Cameroon,
which amounted to "forceful annexation" of Southern Cameroon. They allege that, >"[a]t no time was
sovereignty over Southern Cameroon transferred to a new Federal United Cameroons or any other entity."
They argue that the failure to exercise the third alternative, impacted negatively on the right of the people of
Southern Cameroon to self determination.
7. The Complainants allege further that "notwithstanding the forceful annexation," the people of Southern
Cameroon remained a separate and distinct people. Their official working language is English, whereas the
people in La République du Cameroun are Francophones. The legal, educational and cultural traditions of
the two parts remained different, as was the character of local administration. In spite of the foregoing, they
allege further that the Respondent State manipulate [sic] demographic data to deny the people of Southern
Cameroon equal rights to representation in government. They allege that the people of Southern Cameroon
have been denied powerful positions within the national/federal government. They claim that the
September 1961 Federal Constitution was designed to respect those differences.
8. The Complainants allege further that from the outset of unification in 1961, and the declaration of a
unitary state in 1972, Southern Cameroonians remain marginalised. They allege that Southern Cameroon
was allocated 20% instead of 22% of the seats in the Federal/National Assembly, as per the population
ratio, thus denying them equal representation. They allege that in 1961 West Cameroon was allocated 20
representatives in the Federal Assembly instead of 26. Later when representation to the Assembly was
expanded to 180 representatives, West Cameroon was allocated 35 representatives, instead of 40
representatives. The Complainants allege further that the Francophones occupy local administrative
positions in Southern Cameroon, and abuse their positions to amass land, and access economic
resources, while the Southern Cameroonians play the minutest role at the local or national level.
9. It is further alleged that several towns in Southern Cameroon were denied basic infrastructure, hence
denying them the right to development. It is alleged that the Respondent State, relocated or located various
economic enterprises and projects, such as the Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline, the deep seaport, and the oil
refinery to towns and cities in Francophone Cameroon, notwithstanding their lack of economic viability,
thereby denying employment opportunities and secondary economic benefits to the people of Southern
Cameroon.

1

10. The Complainants allege further that the Francophones have monopolistic control of the Ministry of
National Education. That the Respondent State has under funded primary education in Southern
Cameroon, it failed to build new schools, understaffed primary schools, and it is closing all teacher training
colleges. They allege further that the Respondent State "Cameroonised" the GCE from the University of
London, leading to mass protests which forced government to create an independent GCE Board. That,
upon unification, diplomas awarded by the City & Guild, a technical education institution based in England,
were replaced by the Certificat d'Aptitude Professionelle (CAP) and the BAC Technique. These measures
have resulted in persistent high levels of illiteracy in many areas in Southern Cameroon.
11. The Complainants allege that political unification and the application of the civil law system resulted in
the discrimination against Anglophones in the legal and judicial system. Southern Cameroonian companies
and businesses were forced to operate under the civil law system. The Companies Ordinance of the
Federation of Nigeria, which was until then applicable in Southern Cameroon, was abolished. Many
Southern Cameroonian businesses went bankrupt, following the refusal by Francophone banks to lend
them finances, in some cases, unless their articles of association were drafted in French.
12. They allege that Anglophones facing criminal charges were transferred to the Francophone zone for
trial, under the Napoleonic Code, thereby adversely affecting their civil rights. The Complainants state that
the common law presumption of innocence upon arrest is not recognised under the civil law tradition, since
guilt is presumed upon arrest and detention. The courts conduct trial in the French language without
interpreters. Furthermore, they allege that Southern Cameroon court decisions are ignored by the
Respondent State.
13. The Complainants allege that the entry by the Respondent State as a State Party to the Organisation
pour l'Harmonisation des Droits d'Affaires en Afrique (OHADA), a treaty for the harmonisation of business
legislation amongst Francophone countries in Africa, constituted discrimination against the people of
Southern Cameroon on the basis of language. OHADA stipulates that the language of interpretation of the
treaty shall be French. The Complainants argue that the Constitution recognises English and French as the
official languages of Cameroon. They argue therefore that by signing the OHADA treaty, Cameroon
violated the language rights of the English speaking people of Cameroon. They allege that any company
not registered under the OHADA law cannot open a bank account in Cameroon.
14. The Complainants allege further that, on 3rd April 1993, representatives of the people of Anglophone
Cameroon adopted the Buea Declaration, which declared the preparedness of the Anglophones "... to
participate in the forthcoming constitutional talks with their Francophone brothers...". The Declaration stated
that:
1. "...the imposition of the Unitary State on Anglophone Cameroon in 1972 was unconstitutional, illegal
2.
and a breach of faith,
3. That the only redress adequate to right the wrongs done to Anglophone Cameroon and its people
since the imposition of the Unitary state is a return to the original form of government of the
Reunified Cameroon,
4. That to this end, all Cameroonians of Anglophone heritage are committed to working for the
restoration of a federal Constitution and a federal form of government, which takes cognizance of
the bicultural nature of Cameroon and under which citizens shall be protected against such
violations as have been enumerated.
5. That the survival of Cameroon in peace and harmony depends upon the attainment of this objective
towards which all patriotic Cameroonians, Francophones as well as Anglophones, should
relentlessly work."
15. Subsequent to the 1993 Buea Declaration, it is alleged that between 29th April and 1st May 1994, the
Second Anglophone Conference convened in Bamenda adopted the Bamenda Proclamation, which stated,
inter alia, that: "....one year since the Anglophone constitutional proposals were officially submitted, the
government had not reacted to them;
that all efforts to generate the interest and understanding of the Francophone officials and Francophone
public generally in the Anglophone constitutional proposals had been greeted with responses ranging from
indifference through apathy to hostility..."
IN THE LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING the Anglophone people of Cameroon...; reiterated the Resolution
taken at its first session in April 1993... It stated further in paragraph 6 of the Proclamation that; "6. Should
the Government either persist in its refusal to engage in meaningful constitutional talks or fail to engage in
2

such talks within a reasonable time, the Anglophone Council shall inform the Anglophone people by all
suitable means. It shall, thereupon, proclaim the revival of the independence and sovereignty of the
Anglophone territory of Southern Cameroon and take all measures necessary to secure, defend and
preserve the independence, sovereignty and integrity of the said territory." (emphasis added)
16. The Complainants allege that the failure by the Respondent State to address the concerns of the
Southern Cameroon people for a new constitution, coupled with the adoption of the 1995 December
Constitution by the National Assembly of La République du Cameroun without public debate, meant that
the door was being finally closed on any future constitutional links between the Southern Cameroon and La
République du Cameroun. Henceforth, the Complainants decided to conduct a signature referendum, in
view of >"the hostile atmosphere created by the occupying power... which would not want to allow any form
of consultation which might reveal the true suppressed aspirations of the people of Southern Cameroons."
17. The Complainants aver that between 1st and 30th September 1995, the Southern Cameroons National
Council (SCNC) conducted a signature referendum which revealed that 99% of Southern Cameroonians
favour full independence by peaceful separation from the Respondent State.
18. Besides their claim for statehood, the Complainants allege further that human rights of various
individuals have been systematically violated by the Respondent State. The Complainants compiled eye
witness accounts and field investigations relating to arbitrary arrests, detentions, torture, punishment,
maiming and killings of persons who have advocated for the self determination of Southern Cameroon.

19. The Complainants allege that;

Law
Admissibility
62. The admissibility of communications brought pursuant to Article 55 of the African Charter is governed
by the conditions stipulated in Article 56 of the African Charter. This Article lays down seven (7) conditions,
which must be fulfilled by a Complainant for a communication to be declared admissible.
63. Of the seven conditions, the Respondent State claims that the Complainants have not fulfilled four,
namely: Articles 56(1), 56(2), 56(3) and 56(4). From the submissions of the Respondent State, there is an
inference that Article 56(7) has not been fulfilled by the Complainant.
64. The Respondent State submits that contrary to Article 56(1) of the African Charter, the victims of the
alleged violations, indicated in the communication have not been identified.
65. Article 56(1) of the African Charter provides that:
Communications ... received by the Commission shall be considered if they:
1. Indicate their authors even if the latter request anonymity
66. In this particular matter, the African Commission notes that the authors of the communication have
been identified at page 1 of the communication and they are 14 in number. Their ages and professions
have also been given as well as their addresses of service. Furthermore, the communication reveals that
the authors of the communication are members of the Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC) and
the Southern Cameroons Peoples' Organisation (SCAPO), organisations that were established principally
to protect and advance the human and peoples' rights of Southern Cameroonians, including their right to
self-determination.

5

67. Article 56(1) of the African Charter requires a communication to indicate its authors and not the victims
of the violations. Thus the present communication cannot be declared inadmissible on the basis of Article
56(1). In coming to this decision, the African Commission would like to refer to its decision in consolidated
communication - Malawi African Association et al/ Mauritania2 where it held that "Article 56.1 demands
simply that communications should indicate the names of those submitting and not those of all the victims
of the alleged violations".
68. The Respondent State argues that this communication does not meet the requirements of Article 56(2),
because the Complainants are advocating for secession under the pretext of allegations of violation of the
provisions of the African Charter and other universal human rights instruments. While conceding that the
right to self determination is an inalienable right, the Respondent State argues that the UN has established
that this right should not "be interpreted as authorising or encouraging any measure that would partly or
wholly compromise the entire territory or the political unity of sovereign and independent States". The
Respondent State submits further that it is established that the only entities likely as peoples to call for the
external right to self determination from preexisting States are the "peoples under foreign subjugation,
domination and exploitation".
69. The Complainants argue that the communication meets the requirements in Article 56(2) because it
alleges violations of the African Charter and other international human rights instruments.
70. Article 56(2) provides that "Communications... received by the African Commission shall be considered
if they:
(2) are compatible with the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or with the present Charter."
71. The condition relating to compatibility with the African Charter basically requires that:
• The communication should be brought against a State party to the African Charter3
• The communication must allege prima facie violations of rights protected by the African Charter4
• The communication should be brought in respect of violations that occurred after [the] State's
ratification of the African Charter, or where violations began before the State Party ratified the
African Charter, have continued even after such ratification5
72. It is apparent to the African Commission that the present communication meets all the above
requirements. The communication has been brought against Cameroon, which is State party to the African
Charter. It reveals prima facie violations of the African Charter, all of which are alleged to have continued to
occur following Cameroon's ratification of the African Charter.
73. The Respondent State also submits that the communication has been written in disparaging or insulting
language. The Respondent State argues that the Complainants' use of the phrases such as "forceful
annexation" and "State sponsored terrorism" to characterise violations by the government of Cameroon
against the people of Southern Cameroons, allegedly committed between 1961 and 2002 and a report titled
"Let My People Go Part II", are disparaging and insulting language, contrary to Article 56(3) of the African
Charter.
74. Article 56(3) of the African Charter provides that: Communications ... received by the Commission shall
be considered if they: (3) Are not written in disparaging or insulting language directed against the State
concerned and its institutions or to the Organisation of African Unity.
75. The African Commission acknowledges that the above-mentioned provision is quite subjective because
statements that could be disparaging or insulting to one person may not be seen in the same light by
another person. Matters relating to human rights violations normally elicit strong language from the victims
of the said violations. Nonetheless Complainants should endeavour to be respectful in the phrases they
choose to use when presenting their communications.
76. The Respondent State submits further that the Complainants are not the sole authors of some of the
documents and that the facts have been distorted.
77. The Complainants submit that they did not author the offensive publication, but rely on it to buttress
their allegations. They argue further that the communication is not based exclusively on news disseminated
through the media. They state that the evidence in support of their allegations is based on eye-witness
accounts and documents prepared by those who have personal knowledge of the events and from official
records.
78. Article 56(4) of the African Charter provides that: Communications ... received by the Commission shall
be considered if they: (4) are not based exclusively on news disseminated through the mass media
6

79. The African Commission has perused the appendices to the communication and has observed that they
contain the following documents:
• Appendix II is a publication by SCNC/SCAPO - Let my People Go!
• Appendix IV contains court documents, namely a motion on notice, 2 affidavits, originating
summons, a ruling of the Federal High Court of Nigeria in Abuja, terms agreed by the parties to be
embodied in the order of the court and an enrolment of order. [[/li]]
• Exhibit SC contains among others numerous documents, declarations, agreements between
Germany and Great Britain, UN General Assembly Resolutions, the Statute of the International
Court of Justice and the UN Charter, a Petition made by the Federal Republic of Southern
Cameroons to the United Nations etc.
80. Article 56(4) relates to communications brought before the African Commission based exclusively on
news disseminated through the mass media. Looking at the nature of documents described herein above, it
is quite clear that the Complainants do not base their case on mass media news, but on official records and
documents, as well as international statutes. This clearly falls outside the ambit of Article 56(4).
81. With respect to Article 56(5) , which relates to exhaustion of local remedies, the Complainants submit
that there are no local remedies to exhaust in respect of the claim for self-determination because this is a
matter for an international forum and not a domestic one. They argue that the issue for determination in this
communication is whether or not the "union" of La République du Cameroun and Southern Cameroons was
effected in accordance with UN Resolutions, International Treaty obligations and indeed International law.
They assert that the right to self determination is a matter that cannot be determined by a domestic court.
82. The Respondent State concedes that no local remedies exist with respect to the claim for self
determination. The Respondent State, however argues that, the right to self determination for the people of
Southern Cameroon was solved when the British Trusteeship over British Cameroon ended following the
plebiscite of 11th and 12th February 1961. Furthermore, it argues that the 1963 International Court of
Justice (ICJ) decision in the Northern Cameroon case found in favour of the Republic of Cameroon and put
the matter of Southern Cameroon to rest. The Respondent State believes that the Complainants are
seeking a similar declaratory decision which should not be entertained by the African Commission.
83. The African Commission believes that this argument is an inference by the Respondent State that the
Complainants have not met the conditions laid down in Article 56(7) of the African Charter. Article 56(7)
provides: Communications ... received by the African Commission shall be considered if they: (7) do not
deal with cases which have been settled by these States involved in accordance with the principles of the
Charter of the United Nations, or the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or the provisions of the
present Charter.
84. Article 56(7) of the African Charter bars the African Commission from entertaining cases that have been
settled by another international settlement procedure.6 The issue that the African Commission needs to
examine is whether the abovementioned complaint has been settled by some other international settlement
procedure.
85. The African Commission has read the judgment of the ICJ in the Northern Cameroons case7 . In that
case the Government of the Republic of Cameroon asked the Court to declare whether, "in the application
of the Trusteeship Agreement for the Territory of the Cameroons under the British Administration, the
United Kingdom failed, with regard to the Northern Cameroons, to respect certain obligations flowing from
that Agreement."8
86. It is the view of the African Commission that the matter before the ICJ was unrelated to the issues
before the African Commission. The African Commission states that for a matter to fall within the scope of
Article 56(7) of the African Charter it should have involved the same parties, the same issues, raised by the
complaint before the African Commission, and must have been settled by an international or regional
mechanism. The case before the ICJ was between the Republic of Cameroon and the United Kingdom,
and involved the interpretation and application of the Trusteeship treaty. These facts clearly differ from the
complaint before the Commission. As such the case falls outside the scope of Article 56(7) of the African
Charter.
87. For the reasons outlined herein above, the African Commission declares this communication
admissible.

Preliminary issue raised by the Respondent State regarding the jurisdiction of the African Commission

88. Before dwelling on the substance of the allegations, the Commission wishes to dispose of some
preliminary legal issues raised by the Respondent State. The Respondent State questions the
Commission's jurisdiction rationae temporis, and states the following: "...the complaint by the Complainants
contains an impressive number of cases of so called massive violations of human rights which [are] alleged
to have been carried out between 1961 and 2002. In this regard, the State of Cameroon refuses to
acknowledge in limine litis the jurisdiction rationae temporis of the Commission with regard to acts before
18 December 1989, the date of entry into force of the Charter."
89. The Respondent State also challenged the notion, or the existence of a territory known as "Southern
Cameroon." It states as follows: "....it should be pointed out that in spite of the fact that the complainants
refused to reveal their identities, they by no means ascertained to have been victims9 of violations imputed
to the State of Cameroon. And even when they act on behalf of a so called territory called Southern
Cameroon. The State of Cameroon will point out that no territory exists called as such in the Republic of
Cameroon..."
90. The Respondent State, similarly, questions the existence of a "people" known as "Southern
Cameroonians" and as such states that, "...[s]upposing that there are a people of Southern Cameroons,
nevertheless, it would have to be proven that it is entitled to claim its self determination, under the specific
form of 'separate statehood'."
91. The Commission proposes to deal, firstly, with the question of its jurisdiction then the question whether
the people of "Southern Cameroon" exist as a "people" and whether the territory otherwise referred to as
"Southern Cameroon" does exist, and if it does, can its "people" exercise their alleged "right to
self-determination?"
Decision on the preliminary issue of the Commission's jurisdiction rationae temporis

92. The Respondent State raises objection to the Commission's exercise of jurisdiction rationae temporis.
The Complainants responded that although those violations were carried out before the African Charter
came into force for Cameroon, they did not stop even after 18 December 1989.
93. The Commission acknowledges the Respondent State's argument that its jurisdiction rationae temporis
is limited in limine, and as such it cannot address violations retrospective [of] the entry into force of the
Charter. The Commission is aware that the Africa Charter entered into force in respect of the Respondent
State on 18 December 1989. The Commission has been informed by the Complainants that some of the
alleged violations occurred before that date.
94. The Commission stated its position on this principle in communication 97/93 John K. Modise v.
Botswana. In that communication the Complainant was arrested by the Botswana authorities in 1978 and
deported to apartheid South Africa, in violation of his citizenship rights. The communication was filed in
1993. The Commission held that: "The Republic of Botswana ratified the African Charter on 17 July 1986.
Although some of the events described in the communication took place before ratification, their effects
continue to the present day. The current circumstances of the Complainant are a result of a present policy
decision taken by the Botswana government against him."
95. The Commission expanded the principle further in its decision on the consolidated communications
Nos 54/91 [61-91, 98-93, 164-197, 210-98] Malawi African Association et al v. Mauritania, where it, inter
alia, considered an allegation of violations of the right to a fair trial. The Commission held that: "Mauritania
ratified the Charter on 14 June 1986, and it came into force on 21 October 1986. The September trials, thus
took place prior to the entry into force of the Charter. These trials led to the imprisonment of various
persons. The Commission can only consider a violation that took place prior to the entry into force of the
Charter if such a violation continues or has effects which themselves constitute violations after the entry
into force of the Charter..."10
96. The Commission has through its jurisprudence established the principle that violations that occurred
prior to the entry into force of the Charter, in respect of a State party, shall be deemed to be within the
jurisdiction rationae temporis of the Commission, if they continue, after the entry into force of the Charter.
The effects of such violations may themselves constitute violations under the Charter. In other words, this
principle presupposes the failure by the State party to adopt measures, as required by Article 1 of the Africa
Charter to redress the violations and their effects, hence failing to respect, and guarantee the rights.

8

97. The Commission therefore decides that it has the competence to consider this complaint against the
Respondent State, in relation to violations which emanated prior to 18 December 1989, the date the African
Charter entered into force for the Republic of Cameroon, if such violations or their residual effects
continued after that date.

Consideration of the Merits

98. The communication alleges that the Respondent State violated Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7(1), 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 17(1) in respect of individual Southern Cameroonians; and Articles 19, 20, 21, 22, 23(1) and 24 in
respect of the peoples of Southern Cameroons; and the general obligation under Article 26 of the African
Charter.

Decision on the Merits
Alleged violation of Article 2

99. The Complainants allege that there have been various cases of discrimination against the people of
Southern Cameroon contrary to Article 2 of the African Charter. Article 2 states that: "Every individual shall
be entitled to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognised and guaranteed in the present Charter
without distinction of any kind such as race, ethnic group, colour, sex, language, religion, political or any
other opinion, national and social origin, fortune, birth or any status".
100. The Complainants submit that Southern Cameroonians are discriminated against by the Respondent
State, in various forms. These include under-representation of Southern Cameroonians in national
institutions, economic marginalisation through the denial of basic infrastructure, such as roads, persistence
high levels of unemployment and illiteracy in Southern Cameroon. It is submitted that Southern
Cameroonians are discriminated against in the legal and judicial system.
101. The Complainants submitted further that the company law applied in Southern Cameroon was
abolished in favour of the Napoleonic Code upon unification in 1972. They argued that Southern
Cameroonians could not register companies whose articles of association were in the English language.
102. The issue for determination is whether the refusal to register the said companies was directly related
to the unification of the legal system in 1972, and if it constituted discrimination? Could the 1972 unification
prejudice registration of companies after ratification on 18 December 1989? This would be the case only if
the unification impacted negatively on the registration of companies after December 1989. The
Complainants argue that the refusal to register companies had such an effect. In order for the Southern
Cameroonian companies to do business they had to register under the Francophone civil law system. The
Respondent State did not dispute this allegation. English is one of the official languages in Cameroon.
Southern Cameroonians had a legitimate expectation that the English language could be used to conduct
official business, including the registration of companies. The Commission makes a finding that the refusal
to register companies established by Southern Cameroonians on account of language amounted to a
violation of Article 2 of the African Charter.
103. The Complainants submit further that the ratification of the Treaty for the Harmonisation of Business
Law in Africa, otherwise known as Organisation pour l'Hamonisation des Droits d'Affaires en Afrique
(OHADA), has discriminated against the people of Southern Cameroon on the basis of language. OHADA
is an instrument harmonising business law amongst French speaking countries in Africa. It states that the
language of interpretation and settlement of disputes arising under OHADA shall be French.
104. The Complainants alleged that the ratification of OHADA was discriminatory to individual businesses
and business people from Southern Cameroon. At this point we adopt the legal principle that businesses or
corporate bodies are legal persons. The Complainants submit that objections against OHADA were
ignored, and that companies not registered under OHADA could not open bank accounts in Cameroon.
105. The Respondent State argued that OHADA is not aimed at promoting the superiority of one legal
system over the other, but rather to harmonise business law in the contracting states by elaborating simple,
modern, common rules aimed at encouraging regional development and growth, setting up appropriate
judicial procedures and encouraging arbitration for the settlement of contractual disputes.
9

106. It states further that other non French speaking countries including Ghana and Nigeria, were
undergoing the process of acceding to the OHADA treaty. The Respondent State submitted that it had
taken several measures, such as the translation of the OHADA laws into English, with the support of the
OHADA Permanent Secretariat and the African Development Bank, and the training of Anglophone and
Francophone magistrates at the Ecole regionale superieure de la Magistature in Porto Novo, Republic of
Benin. It stated further that the apprehension by the Anglophones was merely a transitory situation.
107. The Commission takes note of the fact that the Respondent State had taken measures to address the
discriminatory effects of the ratification of OHADA. Had such measures not been taken upon the ratification
of OHADA in 1996, the Commission would not have hesitated to find a violation. The Commission is
cognisant of the bilingual nature of the Respondent State and the Western African region, in which the
Respondent State finds itself. The Respondent State is from time to time being expected to interact with its
neighbours in ECOWAS, or any other sub regional group, where both the French and the English language
continue to be lingua franca.
108. The mere accession or ratification of OHADA should not be deemed a violation of Article 2, unless the
Respondent State had manifestly failed to take any steps to ameliorate the effects of the linguistic
differences. The Respondent State has shown that it took measures, such as the training of magistrates,
and translation of texts to address the discriminatory concerns. The OHADA ratification, however, resulted
in the discrimination of Anglophone based companies and businesses, which could not open bank
accounts unless they registered under OHADA. There was no response from the Respondent State on this
issue. Nor were any measures taken to address this complaint. Notwithstanding the translation of OHADA
into English, it was wrong for institutions, such as banks to force Southern Cameroon based companies to
change their basic documents into French. The banks and other institutions could have dealt with the
companies without imposing the language conditionality. Banking documents should have been translated
into English. The Commission finds that the Respondent State failed to address the concerns of Southern
Cameroonian businesses, which were forced to re-register under OHADA, and as such violated Article 2 of
the African Charter.

Allegation of violation of Article 3

109. The Complainants alleged violation of Article 3, which protects the individual's right to equality before
the law and equal protection of the law. African Commission notes that although the communication alleges
violation of Article 3 of the African Charter, the Complainants did not specifically argue or bring evidence of
any instance against the Respondent State. In the absence of such evidence, the African Commission
cannot find violation of Article 3 of the Charter.

Alleged violation of Article 4

110. The Complainants allege violations of Article 4, the right to life, inviolability of the human being, and
the integrity of the person. They submit that the Respondent State committed violations against individuals
in Southern Cameroon. The communication gives account of people who were killed by the police during
violent suppressions of peaceful demonstrations, or died in detention as a result of the bad conditions and
the ill-treatment in prison.
111. The Respondent State contends that the allegations are not substantiated by documentary evidence.
No certificates to ascertain the cause of death, no forensic medical certificates, no investigation reports by
human rights organisation were produced. It states further that "the catalogue published by the press
organs of the SCNC and SCAPO cannot be considered as a reliable source".11 The Respondent State
however, admitted to the death of six people on the 26th March 1990, which occurred after a confrontation
between security forces and demonstrators, whom it argued, were involved in an illegal political rally in
Bamenda.
112. The African Commission observes that the parties do not have equal access to official evidence such
as police reports, death certificates and forensic medical certificates. The Complainants endeavoured to
inquire into the alleged violations and gave names of the alleged victims. The Respondent State restricted
itself to questioning the reliability of the evidence presented by the Complainants. It did not deny the
10

alleged violations. The Respondent State had the opportunity to inquire into the alleged violations. The
Respondent State did not conduct such investigation and redress the victims, it thus failed to protect the
rights of the alleged victims. The Commission finds that it violated Article 4 of the African Charter.

Alleged violation of Article 5

113. The communication gives details of victims who were subjected to torture, amputations and denial of
medical treatment by the Respondent State's law enforcement officers, in violation of Article 5 of the African
Charter. The Respondent State responded by stating that some SCNC and SCAPO members had
perpetrated terrorist acts in the country, killing law enforcement officers, vandalising State properties,
stealing weapons and ammunitions.
114. The Commission holds the view that even if the State was fighting alleged terrorist activities, it was not
justified to subject victims to torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment and treatment. It therefore
finds that the Respondent State violated Article 5 of the African Charter.

Alleged violation of Article 6

115. The communication further gives details of victims who were arrested, detained for days, sometimes
for months without trial before being released in violation of Article 6 of the Charter.
116. The Respondent State did not deny the allegations instead it tried to justify them. For instance, it
states that: "...concerning citizens who had been arrested for committing various ordinary law offences
since the return to multi party democratic processes, most of them are SCNC and SCAPO activists who, in
their logic of contestation, defied republican institutions especially the forces of law and order, either during
demonstration of the anniversary of "Southern Cameroon" every 1 October of the year, or at the approach,
during and after important elections."
117. It goes on to state that, "whatever the circumstances, the more it is true that every individual shall
have the right to liberty and the security of his person, the more it is accepted that an individual may be
deprived of his freedom for reason and conditions previously laid down by the law. (Article 6 of the Charter)
The cases of arrest registered since the return to multiparty politics in this part of the territory has always
obeyed the principle of legality..." .
118. The Commission states that a State Party cannot justify violations of the African Charter by relying on
the limitation under Article 6 of the Charter. The Respondent State is required to convince the Commission
that the measures or conditions it had put in place were in compliance with Article 6 of the Charter. The
Commission has previously expressed itself on the effect of claw back clauses. Communication 211/98
Legal Resources Foundation/Zambia,12 states the following; "The Commission has argued forcefully that
no State Party to the Charter should avoid its responsibility by recourse to the limitations and "claw back"
clauses in the Charter. It was stated following developments in other jurisdictions, that the Charter cannot
be used to justify violations of sections of it. The Charter must be interpreted holistically and all clauses
must reinforce each other. The purpose or effect of any limitation must also be examined, as the limitation
of the right cannot be used to subvert from the popular will, as such cannot be used to limit the
responsibilities of State Parties in terms of the Charter."
119. Further to the foregoing, communication 147/95 and 149/96, Sir Dawda Jawara/The Gambia, the
Commission stated that, "[t]he Commission in its decision on communication 101/93 laid down a general
principle with respect to freedom of association, that 'competent authorities should not enact provisions
which limit the exercise of this freedom. The competent authorities should not override constitutional
provisions or undermine fundamental rights guaranteed by constitution or international human rights
standards.' This therefore applies not only to right to freedom of expression of association, but also to all
other rights and freedoms ... for a State to avail itself of this plea, it must show that such a law is consistent
with its obligations under the Charter." 13
120. In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the Respondent State has violated Article 6 as
alleged by the Complainants.

11

Alleged violation of Article 7(1)

121. The Complainants alleged that the Respondent State violated Article 7(1), on the right to fair trial.
They allege that individuals were transferred from Southern Cameroon to Francophone Cameroon for trial
by military tribunals and that other victims were tried in civil law courts, without interpreters.
122. The Respondent State admits that between 1997 and 2001, some individuals were transferred from
the North West Cameroon, and were tried for various criminal offences by the Yaoundé Military Tribunal.
These offences include unlawful incitement, disturbances of public peace, destruction of public property,
assassination of gendarmes and civilian individuals, illegal possession of weapons and ammunition and the
illegal declaration of the independence of Anglophone Cameroon on 30 December 1999.
123. The Respondent States asserts the following: "[a]ware that in the past the actions of SCNC militants
have always ended up in assassinations, kidnapping of persons, destruction and setting ablaze of public
buildings, public authorities could not remain indifferent in front of this manifest determination to cause
disorder and disturbances. About three days before 1 October 2001, gendarmes were dispatched nearly
everywhere in the areas and localities targeted by the SCNC."
124. The Respondent State submitted that some of the victims were released, albeit after prolonged
periods of detention, for lack of evidence. Others were released on bail, and fled the country. It argues that
the prolonged detention was due to administrative bottlenecks, which are a constant concern of the
government. The Respondent State did not indicate the measures it had taken to address the chronic
administrative problems causing prolonged detentions.
125. The Respondent State denied that it ignored or failed to implement Court decisions in Anglophone
Cameroon. It cited a number court decisions it had complied with, including those which overturned
executive decisions. The Complainant did not give any specific case or decision which was not complied
with by the Respondent State.
126. The Commission wishes to state that the rights outlined in Article 7 constitute fundamental tenets of
any democratic state. It is through respect for these rights that other rights guaranteed by the Charter may
also be realised. The Commission has adopted the Principles and Guidelines on the Right to Fair Trial and
Legal Assistance in Africa, to assist State Parties to better guarantee the rights enshrined in Article 7.
127. The Respondent State did not explain why it transferred individuals from North West Cameroon for
trial by the Yaoundé and Bafoussam Military Tribunals, nor the reason why the victims were tried by
tribunals outside the jurisdictions where the offences were allegedly committed. The Commission has
stated previously that trial by military courts does not per se constitute a violation of the right to be tried by a
competent organ. What poses [a] problem is the fact that, very often, the military tribunals are an extension
of the executive, rather than the judiciary. Military tribunals are not intended to try civilians. They are
established to try military personnel under laws and regulations which govern the military. In
communication 218/98 Civil Liberties Organisation, Legal Defence Centre, Legal Defence and Assistance
Project v. Nigeria the Commission stated the following: "The military tribunals are not negated by the mere
fact of being presided over by military officers. The critical factor is whether the process is fair, just and
impartial"14
128. The accused persons were not military personnel. The offences alleged to have been committed were
quite capable of being tried by normal courts, within the jurisdictional areas the offences were allegedly
committed. The Commission finds that trying civilians by the Yaoundé and the Bafoussam Military Tribunals
was a violation of Article 7(1)(b) of the Charter.
129. The Complaints submit that the accused were tried in a language they did not understand, without the
help of interpreters. The Respondent State did not contradict that allegation. The Commission states that it
is a prerequisite of the right to a fair trial, for a person to be tried in a language he understands, otherwise
the right to defence is clearly hampered. A person put in such a situation cannot adequately prepare his
defence, since he would not understand what he is being accused of, nor would he apprehend the legal
arguments mounted against him.15 The aforementioned Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair
Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa, states that one of the essential elements of a fair hearing is: "...an
entitlement to the assistance of an interpreter if he or she cannot understand or speak the language used in
or by the judicial body." 16
130. The Commission recognises that the Respondent State is a bilingual country. Its institutions including
the judiciary can use either French or English. However since not all the citizens are fluent in both
languages, it is the State's duty to make sure that, when a trial is conducted in a language that the accused
12

does not speak, he/she is provided with the assistance of an interpreter. Failing to do that amounts to a
violation of the right to a fair trial.
131. The Commission therefore concludes that the Respondent State violated Articles 7(1)(b), 7(1)(c) and
7(1)(d) of the Charter.

Alleged violation of Article 9

132. The communication alleges violation of Article 9 of the Charter. The Complainants did not make any
submissions concerning Article 9. The Commission has therefore not made any finding regarding Article 9.

Alleged violation of Article 10

133. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State violated Article 10 of the African Charter. The
parties did not make any submission on Article 10 of the Charter. The Commission finds no violation of
Article 10.

Alleged violation of Article 11

134. The Commission examined whether Article 11 was violated. The Commission deems that there is
enough information on the record, based on the both parties to enable the Commission to make its
determination.
135. Article 11 states that: "Every individual shall have the right to assemble freely with others. The
exercise of this right shall be subject only to necessary restrictions provided for by law in particular those
enacted in the interest of national security, the safety of others, health, ethics and rights and freedoms of
others."
136. The facts before the Commission depict cases of suppression of demonstrations, including the use of
force against, the arrest and detention of people taking part in such demonstrations. The Commission has
held previously that: "...the Charter must be interpreted holistically and all clauses must reinforce each
other." 17
137. The Complainant states that several victims were arrested and held in detention for long periods, for
exercising their right to freedom of assembly. Some of the detained persons were acquitted. There were
others who died at the hands of security forces or in detention, after being accused of participation in
"unlawful political rallies." The victims who died, or had been detained suffered while exercising their
exercise of the right to freedom of assembly.
138. The Commission does not condone unlawful acts by individuals or organisations to advance political
objectives, because such actions or their consequences are likely to violate the African Charter. It
encourages individuals and organisations, when exercising their right to freedom of assembly, to operate
within the national legal framework. This requirement does not absolve States Parties from their duty to
guarantee the rights to freedom of assembly, while maintaining law and order. The Respondent States
admits that it detained demonstrators, applied excessive force to enforce law and order, and in some cases
lives were lost. The Commission concludes therefore that Article 11 of the African Charter was violated.

Alleged violation of Article 12

139. The Complainants alleged that Article 12 was violated by the Respondent State. They did not
substantiate any infringement by the Respondent State of the right to freedom of movement. The
Commission finds no violation of Article 12.

13

Alleged violation of Article 13

140. The Complainants alleged violation of Article 13. They stated that the people of Southern Cameroon
were not adequately represented in the institutions of the Republic of Cameroon except for "token"
appointments. They allege further that the Respondent State manipulated demographic data to deny
Southern Cameroonians equal representation in government.
141. The Respondent State submitted that, upon the introduction of multi-partyism in 1992, many Southern
Cameroonian opposition parties, such as the Social Democratic Front (SDF), have participated in
municipal, legislative and presidential elections. Opposition parties control several councils and are
represented in the National Assembly. It argues that access to high office is open to all citizens without
distinction. The Respondent State accused the Complainants of bad faith, and stated that some of the
highest positions in the Republic had been held by Southern Cameroonians. It accuses SCNC and SCAPO
of persecuting fellow Anglophones who refuse to adhere to the secession agenda.
142. The Complainants claim that Southern Cameroonians have since 1961 been accorded only 20 %
representation in the Federal/National Assembly instead of the 22% they think they deserve. The
Complainants' main complaint is the ratio of representation, rather than the non representation. The
Respondent State states that 20% representation cannot be said to be "tokenism".
143. The Commission is inclined to agree with the Respondent State. It finds that in spite of the alleged
disproportionate percentage, Southern Cameroonians were representation [sic], and hence participated in
public affairs of the Respondent State as required under Article 13 of the African Charter.
144. The Commission states that it is not sufficient for the Complainants to assert in general terms that a
certain category of citizens were denied the right to access public positions or that they were
under-represented in government or public administration. The Complainants did not furnish the
Commission with information or cases that individuals in Southern Cameroon were denied representation
or denied access to public services. The Commission finds that allegations concerning "tokenism" have not
been substantiated and concludes that there is no violation of Article 13.

Alleged violation of Article 17

145. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State violated Article 17 of the Charter, because it is
destroying education in the Southern Cameroons by underfunding and understaffing primary education.
That it imposed inappropriate reform of secondary and technical education. It discriminates Southern
Cameroonians in the admission into the Polytechnique in Yaoundé, and refused to grant authorisation for
registration of the Bamenda University of Science and Technology, thereby violating Article 17 on the right
to education.
146. The Respondent State denied that it is destroying the education system in the Southern Cameroon. It
provided detailed data and statistics on the measures it had taken to carter for the education sector in the
Southern Cameroons. It stated that in certain cases it had provided more resources to Southern Cameroon
than it had done for other regions. The Complainants contested the reliability of the data and statistics, but
did not convince the Commission that the data should not be relied upon.
147. Regarding the alleged discrimination concerning admission of Southern Cameroonians into the
Polytechnique in Yaounde, the Respondent State argued that admission to the National Advanced School
of Engineering is based on merit, as is the case with all higher institutions of learning. It stated that the
School has trained a number of civil engineers from both the Anglophone and Francophone parts.
148. Concerning the alleged refusal to grant authorisation for the registration of the Bamenda University of
Science and Technology, the Respondent State stated that the said university did not fulfill conditions for
establishment of private universities. The Complainant did not show whether the criteria were met by the
Bamenda University of Science and Technology or not. The Commission reiterates that for it to make
finding on any allegations, the Parties have to provide it with the necessary information. Rule 119 of the
Rules of Procedure of the Commission, (which govern this communication) require parties to furnish
explanation or statements, including additional information.
149. The Complainants should have done so under Rule 119 (3) of the Rules of Procedure. The
Commission allowed Parties to make oral submission in this particular case. The Complainants did not
substantiate the allegations. For the above reasons, the African Commissions finds that there is no violation
14

of Article 17(1) of the Charter.
150. The Commission then examined the alleged violation of Articles 19, 20, 21, 22, 23(1) and 24 of the
African Charter.

Alleged violation of Article 19

151. The Complainants premised the complaint alleging violation of their collective rights on the events
which happened prior to 18 December 1989. The Commission has already expressed itself on the question
of its jurisdiction rationae temporis. The Complainants alleged that the Respondent State, "forcefully and
unlawfully annexed" Southern Cameroon. They argue that the Respondent State: "........established its
colonial rule there, complete with its structures, and its administrative, military and police personnel,
applying a system and operating in a language alien to the Southern Cameroon, ... and continues to
exercise a colonial sovereignty over Southern Cameroon to this day."
152. They argue further that: "... the occupation and assumption of a colonial sovereignty over Southern
Cameroon by the Respondent State amounts to violation of Articles 19 and 20 of the African Charter....,
both of which outlaw domination, and colonialism in all its forms and manifestations. Article 19 places an
absolute ban on the domination of one people by another. Article 20 emphatically asserts the right of every
people to existence, to self determination, and of resistance to colonialism or oppression by resorting to any
internationally recognised means of resistance"
153. These are very serious allegations which go to the root of the statehood and sovereignty of the
Republic of Cameroon. The Respondent State responded by arguing that the Commission is:
"...incompetent to handle the issue of the process of decolonisation that took place in this State and under
the auspices of the United Nations."
154. Respondent State submits further that the Commission cannot examine or adjudicate on the 1961 UN
plebiscite, on events which took place between the October 1961 and 1972, when the Federal and Union
Constitutions were adopted, because they predated the entry into force of the Charter.
155. The Commission concedes that it is not competent to adjudicate on the legality of those events, due to
limitation imposed on its jurisdiction rationae temporis, for reasons stated hereinabove. The Commission
cannot make a finding on allegations made by the Complainants concerning "illegal and forced annexation,
or colonial occupation of Southern Cameroon by the Respondent State," since they fall outside its
jurisdiction rationae temporis.
156. The Commission states, however that, if the Complainants can establish that any violation committed
before 18 December 1989, continued thereafter, then the Commission shall have competence to examine
it.
157. The Complainants alleged cases of economic marginalisation, and denial of basic infrastructure by the
Respondent State, as constituting violations of Article 19. They allege that these violations were a
consequence of the events of 1961 and 1972, and continued after 18 December 1989.
158. The Respondent State contested the allegation of economic marginalisation. It submitted documents
and statistics in support of its provision of basic infrastructure in Southern Cameroon. The statistical
information and data show that, for the period 1998 up to 2003/4, the North West and South West
provinces, (Southern Cameroon,) were allocated substantially higher budgetary resources, than the
Francophone provinces, for the construction and maintenance of roads, and running of education training
institutions. The documents show that the situation in the Anglophone regions is not that different from
other parts of the country. It argued that the problem concerning inadequate infrastructural development is
not peculiar to Southern Cameroon.
159. The Complainants rejected as adulterated the data and statistics provided by the Respondent. The
Complainants did not furnish any document to support their allegation. The Commission finds no reason
why it should not rely on the data and statistics provided by the Respondent State in its decision. The
Commission holds that the Respondent State allocated public resources to the Anglophone provinces
without discrimination.
160. The Respondent State did not however respond specifically to the allegations concerning the
relocation of major economic projects and enterprises from Southern Cameroon. It explained the reason for
relocating the seaport to Douala from Limbe, otherwise known as Victoria. It argues that, Douala being the
gateway into Cameroon, the government needed to monitor the movement of persons and good for evident
15

security reasons and efficient customs control.
161. Every State has an obligation under international law to preserve the integrity of its entire territory. The
maintenance of security and movements of persons and goods on the territory is part of that obligation. The
argument by the Respondent State that it could not guarantee the security of persons and goods at Limbe,
unless it moved the port, is tantamount to acknowledging that it had no control of Limbe. The Commission
believes that the security and customs authorities could have effectively monitored the movement of
persons and goods, even if the seaport had continued to be at Limbe.
162. The Commission states that the relocation of business enterprises and location of economic projects
to Francophone Cameroon, which generated negative effects on the economic life of Southern Cameroon
constituted violation of Article 19 of the Charter.
Alleged violation of Article 20

163. The Complainants state that the "alleged unlawful and forced annexation and colonial occupation" of
Southern Cameroon by the Respondent State constituted a violation of Article 20 of the Charter. They claim
that Southern Cameroonians are entitled to exercise the rights to self determination under Article 20 of the
Charter as a separate and distinct people from the people of "La Republique du Cameroon." Article 20
stipulates that: 1. All peoples shall have the right to existence. They shall have the unquestionable and
inalienable right to self determination. They shall freely determine their political status and shall pursue their
economic and social development according to the policy they have freely chosen.
2. Colonised or oppressed peoples shall have the right to free themselves from the bonds of domination by
resorting to any means recognised by the international community.
3. All peoples shall have the right to the assistance of the states parties to the present Charter in their
liberation struggle against foreign domination, be it political, economic or cultural.
164. The Complainants submit that the UN plebiscite was premised on certain conditions, including the
convening of a conference of equal representative delegations from the Republic of Cameroon and
Southern Cameroon to work out the conditions for the transfer of sovereign powers to the future federation.
It is further submitted that such arrangements should have been approved by the separate parliaments of
the Republic of Cameroon and Southern Cameroon before sovereignty was transferred to a single entity
representing both sides. The Complainants submit that the results of the plebiscite were never submitted to
the parliament of the Southern Cameroon for approval.
165. The Respondent State did not respond to the allegations concerning "unlawful annexation and
colonialism." It submitted instead that the issues are incapable of adjudication by the Commission on
account of its lack of jurisdiction.
166. The Respondent State contested further the claim that Southern Cameroonians are a "separate and
distinct people" . The Commission shall examine this issue.
167. The Complainants reiterate that their "separate and distinct" identity is based on the British
administration over Southern Cameroon. They submit that they speak the English language, and apply the
common law legal tradition, as opposed to the Francophone zone, where French is spoken and the civil law
system is applicable.
168. The Respondent State submitted that it does not dispute the basic historical facts concerning the Trust
administration, but denies that Southern Cameroonians exist as a "people." It states the following; "[t]he
complainants raise in order to shore up this assertion the use of the English language (working language),
the specificity of the legal system, of the educational system, of the system of government, traditional
cultures. In fact, the specificities of former Southern Cameroons stem solely from the heritage of British
administration and the legacy of Anglo-Saxon culture. No ethno-anthropological argument can be put
forward to determine the existence of a people of Southern Cameroons, the Southern part being of the
large Sawa cultural area, the northern part being part of the Grass fields' cultural area. Since 1961,
although some specificities had been preserved on more than one aspect, there had been remarkable
rapprochement at the administrative and legal levels. The 'separate and distinct people' thesis is no longer
valid today."
169. The Commission shall clarify its understanding of "peoples' rights" under the African Charter. The
Commission is aware the controversial nature of the issue, due to the political connotation that it carries.
That controversy is as old as the Charter. The drafters of the Charter refrained deliberately from defining
16

it.18 To date, the concept has not been defined under international law. However, there is recognition that
certain objective features attributable to a collective of individuals, may warrant them to be considered as
"people".
170. A group of international law experts commissioned by UNESCO to reflect on the concept of "people"
concluded that where a group of people manifest some of the following characteristics; a common historical
tradition, a racial or ethnic identity, cultural homogeneity, linguistic unity, religious and ideological affinities,
territorial connection, and a common economic life, it may be considered to be a "people". Such a group
may also identify itself as a people, by virtue of their consciousness that they are a people.19 This
characterisation does not bind the Commission but can only be used as a guide.
171. In the context of the African Charter, the notion of "people" is closely related to collective rights.
Collective rights enumerated under Articles 19 to 24 of the Charter can be exercised by a people, bound
together by their historical, traditional, racial, ethnic, cultural, linguistic, religious, ideological, geographical,
economic identities and affinities, or other bonds.
172. The drafters of the Charter provided for the protection of "peoples rights" under the Charter. In his
book, entitled; The Law of the African (Banjul) Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, Justice Hassan B.
Jallow,20 an eminent African Jurist, who participated in the drafting the African Charter, sheds light on this
issue. He says that: "[t]he concept of peoples' rights, to which a whole chapter had been devoted in the
draft did not mean there was any grading of rights. There were economic, social and cultural rights which
have particular importance to developing countries and which together with civil rights and political rights in
one complementary whole should henceforth be given an important place."21
173. Justice Jallow cites the late President Leopold Sedar Senghor, the first President of Senegal and an
eminent African Statesman, who told the inaugural meeting of African Legal Experts to draft the Charter,
the following: "People will perhaps expatiate for a long time upon the 'People Rights' we were very keen on
referring [sic] to. We simply meant, by so doing, to show our attachment to economic, social, and cultural
rights, to collective rights in general, rights which have a particular importance in our situation of a
developing country. We are certainly not drawing lines of demarcation between the different categories of
rights. We want to show essentially that beside civil and political rights, economic, social and cultural rights
should henceforth be given the important place they deserve. We wanted to lay emphasis on the right to
development and the other rights which need the solidarity of our States to be fully met; the right to peace
and security, the right to a healthy environment, right to participate in the equitable share of the common
heritage of mankind, the right to enjoy a fair international economic order and, finally the right to natural
wealth and resources." 22
174. The African Commission has itself dealt with the issues of peoples' rights without defining the term
"people" or "peoples' rights". In its acclaimed Report of the Working Group of Experts on Indigenous
Populations/Communities,23 the African Commission described its dilemma of defining the concepts in the
following terms: "[d]espite its mandate to interpret all provisions of the African Charter as per Article 45(3),
the African Commission initially shied away from interpreting the concept of 'peoples'. The African Charter
itself does not define the concept. Initially the African Commission did not feel at ease in developing rights
where there was little concrete international jurisprudence. The ICCPR and the ICESR do not define
'peoples'. It is evident that the drafters of the African Charter intended to distinguish between the traditional
individual rights where the sections preceding Article 17 make reference to "every individual". Article 18
serves as a break by referring to the family. Articles 19-24 make specific reference to "all peoples."
175. It continues: "Given such specificity, it is surprising that the African Charter fails to define "peoples"
unless it was trusted that its meaning could be discerned from the prevailing international instruments and
norms. Two conclusions can be drawn from this. One, that the African Charter seeks to make provision for
group or collective rights, that is, that set of rights that can conceivably be enjoyed only in a collective
manner like the right to self determination or independence or sovereignty...".24
176. The Commission deduces from the foregoing discourse that peoples' rights are equally important as
are individual rights. They deserve, and must be given protection. The minimum that can be said of
peoples' rights is that, each member of the group carries with him/her the individual rights into the group, on
top of what the group enjoys in its collectivity, i.e. common rights which benefit the community such as the
right to development, peace, security, a healthy environment, self determination and the right to equitable
share of their resources.
177. It is in the light of the above that the Commission shall examine the allegations against the
Respondent State, concerning the violations of the collective rights cited hereinabove.

17

178. The Commission states that after thorough analysis of the arguments and literature, it finds that the
people of Southern Cameroon can legitimately claim to be a "people". Besides the individual rights due to
Southern Cameroon[ians], they have a distinct identity which attracts certain collective rights. The
UNESCO Group of Experts report referred to hereinabove, states that for a collective of individuals to
constitute a >
