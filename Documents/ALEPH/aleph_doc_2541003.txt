Dear Mr. Buffington:
This letter (the “Agreement”) constitutes the agreement between H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC

and HCW are collectively referred to herein as the “Placement Agents”) and Allied Nevada Gold
Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), that HCW shall serve as the exclusive sole lead
placement agent for the Company in the United States and Canaccord shall serve as placement
agent for the Company in the Qualifying Jurisdictions of Canada (as defined in Section 3), on a
“reasonable best efforts” basis, in connection with the proposed placement (the “Placement”) of
registered securities (the “Securities”) of the Company, including shares (the “Shares”) of the
Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and warrants to
purchase shares of Common Stock. The terms of such Placement and the Securities shall be
mutually agreed upon by the Company and the purchasers (each, a “Purchaser” and collectively,
the “Purchasers”) and nothing herein constitutes that the Placement Agents would have the
power or authority to bind the Company or any Purchaser or an obligation for the Company to
issue any Securities or complete the Placement. This Agreement, the warrants and the
documents executed and delivered by the Company and the Purchasers in connection with the
Placement shall be collectively referred to herein as the “Transaction Documents.” The date of

representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions made to any investor in a
Placement. The Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that each Placement Agent’s
obligations hereunder are on a reasonable best efforts basis only and that the execution of this
Agreement does not constitute a commitment by either Placement Agent to purchase the
Securities and does not ensure the successful placement of the Securities or any portion thereof
or the success of the Placement Agents with respect to securing any other financing on behalf of
the Company. HCW, and Canaccord with the prior consent of HCW, may retain other brokers,
dealers, agents or underwriters on its behalf in connection with the Placement; provided, any
such agents shall be at no additional cost to the Company. Canaccord Genuity Corp. shall sign

SECTION 2. UNITED STATES REGISTRATION STATEMENT.
(A) The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) a
registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration File No.333-2000357) under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), which became effective on November 25, 2014, for
the registration under the Securities Act of the Shares, warrants and shares of Common Stock
underlying the warrants. At the time of such filing, the Company met the requirements of Form S-
3 under the Securities Act. Such registration statement meets the requirements set forth in Rule
415(a)(1)(x) under the Securities Act and complies with said Rule. The Company will file with the
Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act,
and the rules and regulations (the “Rules and Regulations”) of the Commission promulgated
thereunder, a supplement to the form of prospectus included in such registration statement
relating to the placement of the Securities and the plan of distribution thereof and has advised the
Placement Agents of all further information (financial and other) with respect to the Company
required to be set forth therein. Such registration statement, including the exhibits thereto, as
amended at the date of this Agreement, is hereinafter called the “Registration Statement”; such
prospectus in the form in which it appears in the Registration Statement is hereinafter called the
“Base Prospectus”; and the supplemented form of prospectus, in the form in which it will be filed
with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (including the Base Prospectus as so
supplemented) is hereinafter called the “Prospectus Supplement.” Any reference in this
Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement
shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein (the
“Incorporated Documents”) pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), on or before the date of this
Agreement, or the issue date of the Base Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement, as the case
may be; and any reference in this Agreement to the terms “amend,” “amendment” or “supplement”
with respect to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement
shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after
the date of this Agreement, or the issue date of the Base Prospectus or the Prospectus
Supplement, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference. All references
in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information that is “contained,”
“included,” “described,” “referenced,” “set forth” or “stated” in the Registration Statement, the Base
Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement (and all other references of like import) shall be
deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information
that is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Base
Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement, as the case may be. No stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the use of the Base Prospectus or the Prospectus
Supplement has been issued, and no proceeding for any such purpose is pending or has been
initiated or, to the Company’s knowledge, is threatened by the Commission. For purposes of this
Agreement, “free writing prospectus” has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities
Act and the “Time of Sale Prospectus” means the preliminary prospectus supplement, or the
latest amended preliminary prospectus supplement, if any, together with the free writing
prospectuses, if any, used in connection with the Placement, including any documents
incorporated by reference therein.
(B) The Registration Statement (and any further documents to be filed with the Commission)
contains all exhibits and schedules as required by the Securities Act. Each of the Registration
Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, at the time it became effective, complied in
all material respects with the Securities Act and the applicable Rules and Regulations and did
not and, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, will not, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading. The Base Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, if any,
and the Prospectus Supplement, each as of its respective date, comply in all material respects
with the Securities Act and the applicable Rules and Regulations. Each of the Base Prospectus,
the Time of Sale Prospectus, if any, and the Prospectus Supplement, as amended or
supplemented, did not and will not contain as of the date thereof any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
The Incorporated Documents, when they were filed with the Commission, conformed in all
material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable Rules and
Regulations, and none of such documents, when they were filed with the Commission, contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein (with respect to Incorporated Documents incorporated by reference in the
Base Prospectus or Prospectus Supplement), in light of the circumstances under which they
were made not misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in
the Base Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, if any, or Prospectus Supplement, when such
documents are filed with the Commission, will conform in all material respects to the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable Rules and Regulations, as applicable, and
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.
(C) The Company is eligible to use free writing prospectuses in connection with the Placement
pursuant to Rules 164 and 433 under the Securities Act. Any free writing prospectus that the
Company is required to file pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act in connection with
this Placement has been, or will be, filed with the Commission in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable Rules and Regulations of the Commission
thereunder. Each free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file,
pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act in connection with this Placement that was
prepared by or used by the Company complies or will comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable Rules and Regulations of the Commission
thereunder. The Company will not, without the prior consent of the Placement Agents, prepare,
use or refer to, any free writing prospectus.
(D) The Company has delivered, or will as promptly as practicable deliver, to the Placement
Agents complete conformed copies of the Registration Statement and of each consent and
certificate of experts, as applicable, filed as a part thereof, and conformed copies of the
Registration Statement (without exhibits), the Base Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, if

SECTION 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Except as set forth under the
corresponding section of the disclosure schedules which disclosure schedules shall be deemed
a part hereof, the Company hereby makes the representations and warranties set forth below to
the Placement Agents.
(A) Organization and Qualification. All of the direct and indirect subsidiaries (individually, a
“Subsidiary”) of the Company are set forth on Schedule 3(A). Except as set forth on
Schedule 3(A), the Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the capital stock or other
equity interests of each Subsidiary free and clear of any “Liens” (which for purposes of this
Agreement shall mean a lien, charge, security interest, encumbrance, right of first refusal,
preemptive right or other restriction), and all the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of each Subsidiary are validly issued and are fully paid, non-assessable and free of
preemptive and similar rights to subscribe for or purchase securities. The Company and
each of the Subsidiaries is an entity duly incorporated or otherwise organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization (as applicable), with the requisite power and authority to own and use its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary is in violation or default of any of the provisions of its
respective certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational or charter
documents. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries is duly qualified to conduct business
and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other entity in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of the business conducted or property owned by it makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, as the case may
be, would not reasonably be expected to result in (i) a material adverse effect on the legality,
validity or enforceability of any Transaction Document, (ii) a material adverse effect on the
results of operations, assets, business, or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company
and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) a material adverse effect on the Company’s
ability to perform in any material respect on a timely basis its obligations under any
Transaction Document (any of (i), (ii) or (iii), a “Material Adverse Effect”) and no “Proceeding”
(which for purposes of this Agreement shall mean any action, claim, suit, investigation or
proceeding (including, without limitation, an investigation or partial proceeding, such as a
deposition), whether commenced or threatened) has been instituted in any such jurisdiction
revoking, limiting or curtailing or seeking to revoke, limit or curtail such power and authority
or qualification.
(B) Authorization; Enforcement. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority
to enter into and to consummate the transactions contemplated by each of the Transaction
Documents and otherwise to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The
execution and delivery of each of the Transaction Documents by the Company and the
consummation by it of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by
all necessary action on the part of the Company and no further action is required by the
Company, its board of directors or its stockholders in connection therewith other than in
connection with the “Required Approvals” (as defined in subsection 3(D) below). Each
Transaction Document has been (or upon delivery will have been) duly executed by the
Company and, when delivered in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, will
constitute the valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms except (i) as limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general
application affecting enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and (ii) as limited by laws
relating to the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
remedies.
(C) No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents by the
Company, the issuance and sale of the Securities and the consummation by the Company
of the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not (i) conflict with
or violate any provision of the Company’s or any Subsidiary’s certificate or articles of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational or charter documents, or (ii) conflict with, or
constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) under, result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the
Company or any Subsidiary, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) of, any agreement,
credit facility, debt or other instrument (evidencing a Company or Subsidiary debt or
otherwise) or other understanding to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by
which any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected, or
(iii) subject to the Required Approvals, conflict with or result in a violation of any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, injunction, decree or other restriction of any court or
governmental authority to which the Company or a Subsidiary is subject (including federal,
state and provincial securities laws and regulations), or by which any property or asset of the
Company or a Subsidiary is bound or affected; except in the case of each of clauses (ii) and
(iii), such as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
(D) Filings, Consents and Approvals. The Company is not required to obtain any consent,
waiver, authorization or order of, give any notice to, or make any filing or registration with,
any court or other federal, state, provincial, local or other governmental authority or other
“Person” (defined as an individual or corporation, partnership, trust, incorporated or
unincorporated association, joint venture, limited liability company, joint stock company,
government (or an agency or subdivision thereof) or other entity of any kind, including,
without limitation, any Trading Market) in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of the Transaction Documents, other than such filings as are

required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial

compliance with all U.S. and Canadian federal, state, provincial and local laws and
regulations relating to employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment and wages and hours, except where the failure to be in compliance would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

patents, patent applications, trademarks, trademark applications, service marks, trade
names, trade secrets, inventions, copyrights, licenses and other similar intellectual property
rights necessary or material for use in connection with their respective businesses as
described in the SEC Reports and which the failure to so have would have a Material
Adverse Effect (collectively, the “Intellectual Property Rights”). Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has received a notice (written or otherwise) that the Intellectual Property Rights
used by the Company or any Subsidiary violates or infringes upon the rights of any Person
except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable security measures to protect the
secrecy, confidentiality and value of all of their intellectual properties, except where failure to

Adverse Effect.

financial responsibility against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are prudent
and customary in the businesses in which the Company and the Subsidiaries are engaged,

or commissions are or will be payable by the Company to any broker, financial advisor or

action designed to, or which to its knowledge is likely to have the effect of, terminating the
registration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act nor has the Company received
any notification that the Commission is contemplating terminating such registration. The
Company has not, in the 12 months preceding the date hereof, received notice from any
Trading Market on which the Common Stock is or has been listed or quoted to the effect that
the Company is not in compliance with the listing or maintenance requirements of such
Trading Market. The Company is, and has no reason to believe that it will not in the
foreseeable future continue to be, in compliance with all such listing and maintenance
requirements.
(X) Application of Takeover Protections. Provided that no Purchaser beneficially owns more
than 9.9% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as determined under Rule 13d-3 of
the Exchange Act and assuming the effective operation of the restrictions upon exercise set
forth in Section 2(e) of the warrant, following the purchase of Securities under this
Agreement (and for the avoidance of doubt such calculation shall include any shares
beneficially owned by such Purchaser and its affiliates prior to the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement), then no action shall be required of the Company and
the Board of Directors to render inapplicable any control share acquisition, business
combination, poison pill (including any distribution under a rights agreement) or other similar
anti takeover provision under the Company’s certificate of incorporation (or similar charter
documents) or the laws of its state of incorporation that is or could become applicable to the
Purchasers as a result of the Purchasers and the Company fulfilling their obligations or
exercising their rights under the Transaction Documents, including without limitation as a
result of the Company’s issuance of the Securities and the Purchasers’ ownership of the
Securities.
(Y) Solvency. On and immediately after the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries, on
a consolidated basis (after giving effect to the issuance of the Securities and the other
transactions related thereto as described in each of the Time of Sale Prospectus and the
Prospectus Supplement) will be Solvent. As used in this paragraph, the term “Solvent”
means, with respect to a particular date and entity, that on such date (i) the present fair
market value (or present fair saleable value) of the assets of such entity is not less than the
total amount required to pay the liabilities of such entity on its total existing debts and
liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as they become absolute and matured; (ii) such
entity is able to realize upon its assets and pay its debts and other liabilities, contingent
obligations and commitments as they mature and become due in the normal course of
business; (iii) assuming consummation of the issuance of the Securities as contemplated by
this Agreement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement, the Company
and its Subsidiaries are not incurring debts or liabilities beyond their ability to pay as such
debts and liabilities mature; (iv) such entity is not engaged in any business or transaction,
and does not propose to engage in any business or transaction, for which its property would
constitute unreasonably small capital after giving due consideration to the prevailing
practice in the industry in which such entity is engaged; and (v) such entity is not a
defendant in any civil action that would reasonably be expected to result in a judgment that
such entity is or would become unable to satisfy. Except with respect to a repayment in full
of amounts outstanding on the maturity date (together with accrued and unpaid interest and
fees) under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated May 8, 2014 (the
“Revolver”), among the Company and The Bank of Nova Scotia as Lead Arranger,
Bookrunner and Administrative Agent, and The Bank of Nova Scotia and Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association as Co-Collateral Agents (collectively, the “Lenders”), the Company is
not aware of, and has not been given any written notice by the Lenders of, any circumstance
in which a repayment of amounts owing by the Company under the Revolver would result in
the amount of the Revolver being permanently reduced with respect to the amount of such
repayment.
(Z) Tax Status. Except for matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, the Company and each
Subsidiary has filed all necessary federal, state and foreign income and franchise tax
returns and has paid or accrued all taxes shown as due thereon, and the Company has no
knowledge of a tax deficiency which has been asserted or threatened against the Company
or any Subsidiary.

agent or other person acting on behalf of the Company, has (i) directly or indirectly, used any
funds for unlawful contributions, gifts, entertainment or other unlawful expenses related to
foreign or domestic political activity, (ii) made any unlawful payment to foreign or domestic
government officials or employees or to any foreign or domestic political parties or
campaigns from corporate funds, (iii) failed to disclose fully any contribution made by the
Company (or made by any person acting on its behalf of which the Company is aware)
which is in violation of law, or (iv) violated in any material respect any provision of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended or Canada’s Corruption of Public
Foreign Officials Act.
(BB)Accountants. The Company’s accountants are named in the Prospectus Supplement. To the
knowledge of the Company, such accountants, who the Company expects will express their
opinion with respect to the financial statements to be included in the Company’s next
Annual Report on Form 10-K, are a registered public accounting firm as required by the
Securities Act.
(CC)Regulation M Compliance. The Company has not, and to its knowledge no one acting on its
behalf has, (i) taken, directly or indirectly, any action designed to cause or to result in the
stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale
or resale of any of the Securities, (ii) sold, bid for, purchased, or, paid any compensation for
soliciting purchases of, any of the Securities (other than for the placement agent’s placement
of the Securities), or (iii) paid or agreed to pay to any person any compensation for soliciting
another to purchase any other securities of the Company.
(DD)Approvals. Other than approval of the listing application on the NYSE MKT and TSX, the
issuance and listing on the NYSE MKT and TSX of the Shares and shares underlying the
warrants requires no further approvals, including but not limited to, the approval of
stockholders.
(EE)FINRA Affiliations. Except as set forth on Schedule B(DD) hereto, there are no affiliations
with any FINRA member firm among the Company’s officers, directors or, to the knowledge
of the Company, any five percent (5%) or greater stockholder of the Company, except as set
forth in the Registration Statement.

termination or expiration of this Agreement.

of Securities distributed: (i) in each of the Qualifying Jurisdictions where such breakdown is
required for the purpose of calculating fees payable to Securities Commissions; and (ii) in any
other jurisdictions. Each of the Placement Agents, represents and warrants to the Company,

appropriately registered under Applicable Securities Laws, as applicable, so as to permit it to
lawfully fulfill its obligations hereunder, and (ii) it will sell the Securities in accordance with
Applicable Securities Laws and the laws of any other jurisdictions in which the Securities are

otherwise required by law, the Company will not disclose or otherwise refer to the advice or
information in any manner without the applicable Placement Agent’s prior written consent.

be construed as creating rights enforceable by any person or entity not a party hereto, except
those entitled hereto by virtue of the Indemnification Provisions hereof. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that neither Placement Agent is, and shall not be construed as a
fiduciary of the Company and shall have no duties or liabilities to the equity holders or the

statements and other financial information, statistical data and reserve and mineralized
material estimates contained or incorporated by reference therein and the information
included in or derived from reports of, or attributed to, persons named in the final
Prospectus Supplement under the heading “Interest of Experts”, as to which such counsel
need express no opinion);

“Governmental Authority” means any executive, legislative, judicial, administrative or
regulatory body of the State of Delaware or the United States of America, and the term

(including the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or pursuant thereto) that a
lawyer exercising customary professional diligence would reasonably be expected to
recognize as being applicable to the Company and the agreements related to the offering
of the Shares and warrants. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition of
Applicable Law, the term “Applicable Law” does not include any law, rule or regulation
that is applicable to the Company or the agreements related to the offering of the
Common Stock solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime
applicable to any party to any of the agreements related to the Shares and warrants or
any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate;
(s) no stamp, registration or similar taxes or public charges are payable in the State of
Delaware in respect of this Agreement by the Company.

Placement Agents shall have received a Rule 10b-5 negative assurance statement, dated as of

to the effect that such counsel has participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement
and the final Prospectus Supplement and in conferences with officers and other
representatives of the Company, Canadian counsel for the Company, representatives of the
independent accountants for the Company, counsel for the Placement Agents and
representatives of the Placement Agents at which the contents of the Registration Statement and
the final Prospectus Supplement and related matters were discussed and although such counsel
has not independently verified, and is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility
for, the factual accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration
Statement and the final Prospectus Supplement, on the basis of such participation, no facts have
come to such counsel’s attention which have caused such counsel to believe that (i) the
Registration Statement at the time of its most recent effective date, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the final Prospectus Supplement,
as of the date of the final Prospectus Supplement and as of the Closing Date, contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, or (iii) the amended preliminary Prospectus Supplement, as of
the time of sale, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein, or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case, other than the
financial statements and other financial information, statistical data and reserve and mineralized
material contained or incorporated by reference therein, and the information included in or

(D) Legal Opinion of Canadian Counsel. The Placement Agents receiving, at the Time of
Closing, a favorable legal opinion addressed to the Placement Agents, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Placement Agents, acting reasonably, and subject to customary assumptions,
qualifications and limitations, dated as of the Closing Date, from the Company’s Canadian
counsel, Cassels Brock & Blackwell LLP (which counsel may deliver or rely on, to the extent
appropriate in the circumstances, opinions of local counsel or arrange for separate opinions of
local counsel and, as to matters of fact, may rely on certificates of officers, public officials or of the
auditors or transfer agents of the Company), to the effect set forth below and to such other matters
as the Placement Agents may reasonably request, including without limitation that:
(a) all necessary documents have been filed, all requisite proceedings have been taken and
all approvals, permits and consents of the appropriate regulatory authority in each of the
Qualifying Jurisdictions have been obtained by the Company to qualify the distribution to
the public of the shares and warrants in each of the Qualifying Jurisdictions through
persons who are registered under applicable Canadian Securities Laws and who have
complied with the relevant provisions of applicable Canadian Securities Laws; and
(b) the statements set forth in the Canadian Final Prospectus under the caption “Certain

provisions of the laws referred to therein, are fair summaries of the matters discussed

(E) Title Opinion. The Placement Agents shall have received at the Time of Closing on the
Closing Date favourable legal opinions addressed to the Placement Agents, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Placement Agents, acting reasonably, dated as of the Closing Date,

public officials (as appropriate)) with respect to title and mineral rights to the Hycroft Mine.
(F) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the
latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Base Prospectus,

stock or long term debt of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any change, or any
development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business, general affairs,
management, financial position, stockholders’ equity, or results of operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole otherwise than as set forth in or contemplated by the
Prospectus Supplement or the Base Prospectus the effect of which, in any such case described
in clause (i) or (ii), is, in the reasonable judgment of the Placement Agents, so material and
adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the sale or delivery of the
Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Base Prospectus and the
Prospectus Supplement.
(G) The Common Stock is registered under the Exchange Act and, as of the Closing Date, the
Shares and shares underlying the warrants shall be listed and admitted and authorized for
trading on the NYSE MKT and TSX, and satisfactory evidence of such actions shall have been
provided to the Placement Agents. The Company shall have taken no action designed to, or

TSX is contemplating terminating such registration or listing.

Nasdaq National Market, the NYSE MKT or the TSX or in the over-the-counter market, or trading
in any securities of the Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market, shall have
been suspended or minimum or maximum prices or maximum ranges for prices shall have been
established on any such exchange or such market by the Commission, by such exchange or by
any other regulatory body or governmental authority having jurisdiction, (ii) a banking moratorium
shall have been declared by federal, state or provincial authorities or a material disruption has

escalation in hostilities involving the United States or Canada, or there shall have been a
declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or Canada, or (iv) there shall
have occurred any other calamity or crisis or any change in general economic, political or
financial conditions in the United States, Canada or elsewhere, if the effect of any
such event in clause (iii) or (iv) makes it, in the sole judgment of the Placement Agent,
impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms
and in the manner contemplated by the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement.
(I) No action shall have been taken and no statute, rule, regulation or order shall have been
enacted, adopted or issued by any governmental agency or body which would, as of the Closing
Date, prevent the issuance or sale of the Securities or materially and adversely affect or
potentially and adversely affect the business or operations of the Company; and no injunction,
restraining order or order of any other nature by any federal, state or provincial court of competent
jurisdiction shall have been issued as of the Closing Date which would prevent the issuance or

compensation shall be paid from the gross proceeds of the Securities sold. The Company shall
bear the cost of the escrow agent.
(L) Neither the TSX nor FINRA shall have raised an objection to the fairness and
reasonableness of the terms and arrangements of this Agreement. In addition, the Company
shall, if requested by the Placement Agents, make, or authorize Placement Agents’ counsel to
make, on the Company’s behalf, an Issuer Filing with FINRA pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110 with
respect to the Registration Statement and pay all filing fees required in connection therewith.
(M) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Placement Agents such
further information, certificates and documents as the Placement Agents may reasonably request,
including, without limitation, a “cold comfort” letter from the Company’s independent auditors.
All letters, evidence and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Placement Agents.
SECTION 11. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement will be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be
performed entirely in such State. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the
prior written consent of the other party. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto, and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any right to
trial by jury with respect to any dispute arising under this Agreement or any transaction or
conduct in connection herewith is waived. Any dispute arising under this Agreement may be
brought into the courts of the State of New York or into the Federal Court located in New York,
New York and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company hereby accepts for
itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of aforesaid
courts. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to
process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by delivering a copy thereof via
overnight delivery (with evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices to it
under this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of
process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any
right to serve process in any manner permitted by law. If either party shall commence an action or
proceeding to enforce any provisions of a Transaction Document, then the prevailing party in
such action or proceeding shall be reimbursed by the other party for its attorneys’ fees and other
costs and expenses incurred with the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or
proceeding.
SECTION 12. ENTIRE AGREEMENT/MISC. This Agreement (including the attached
Indemnification Provisions) embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the
parties hereto, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable in
any respect, such determination will not affect such provision in any other respect or any other
provision of this Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect. This Agreement may not be
amended or otherwise modified or waived except by an instrument in writing signed by both
Placement Agents and the Company. The representations, warranties, agreements and
covenants contained herein shall survive the closing of the Placement and delivery and/or
exercise of the Securities, as applicable for a period of two years. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, all of which when taken together shall be considered one
and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by
each party and delivered to the other party, it being understood that both parties need not sign the
same counterpart. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or a .pdf
format file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on
whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or
.pdf signature page were an original thereof. Where a provision of this Agreement provides for
the consent, approval or other action by the Placement Agents, the action of HCW acting alone
shall be sufficient, except as to matters pertaining to the Placement in Canada, as to which the
action of Canaccord acting alone shall be sufficient.
SECTION 13. NOTICES. Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries required or
permitted to be provided hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and effective
on the earliest of (a) the date of transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via
facsimile at the facsimile number specified on the signature pages attached hereto prior to 6:30
p.m. (New York City time) on a business day, (b) the next business day after the date of
transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via facsimile at the facsimile number
on the signature pages attached hereto on a day that is not a business day or later than 6:30 p.m.
(New York City time) on any business day, (c) the business day following the date of mailing, if
sent by U.S. nationally recognized overnight courier service, or (d) upon actual receipt by the
party to whom such notice is required to be given. The address for such notices and
communications shall be as set forth on the signature pages hereto.
Please confirm that the foregoing correctly sets forth our agreement by signing and returning to
HCW and to Canaccord the enclosed copy of this Agreement.

ADDENDUM A
INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS
In connection with the engagement of H.C. Wainwright& Co., LLC (“HCW”) and Canaccord
Genuity Corp. (“Canaccord” and together with HCW, the “Placement Agents”) by Allied Nevada
Gold Corp. (the “Company”) pursuant to a letter agreement dated December         , 2014, between
the Company, HCW and Canaccord, as it may be amended from time to time in writing (the
“Agreement”), the Company hereby agrees as follows:
1. To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify the Placement Agents and their
respective affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees and controlling persons (within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Section 20 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) against all losses, claims, damages, expenses
and liabilities, as the same are incurred (including the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel), relating to and arising out of its activities hereunder or pursuant to the Agreement,
except to the extent that any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) are found in a final judgment (not subject to appeal) by a court of law to have
resulted primarily and directly from such Placement Agent’s unlawful misconduct, acts of fraud,
illegal acts, or gross negligence in performing the services described herein.
2. Promptly after receipt by either Placement Agent of notice of any claim or the commencement
of any action or proceeding with respect to which such Placement Agent is entitled to indemnity
hereunder, such Placement Agent will notify the Company in writing of such claim or of the
commencement of such action or proceeding, and the Company will assume the defense of such
action or proceeding and will employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the applicable
Placement Agent and will pay the fees and expenses of such counsel. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, either Placement Agent will be entitled to employ counsel separate from
counsel for the Company and from any other party in such action if counsel for such Placement
Agent reasonably determines that it would be inappropriate under the applicable rules of
professional responsibility for the same counsel to represent both the Company and such
Placement Agent. In such event, the reasonable fees and disbursements of no more than one
such separate counsel will be paid by the Company. The Company will have the exclusive right
to settle the claim or proceeding provided that the Company will not settle any such claim, action
or proceeding without the prior written consent of the applicable Placement Agent, which will not
be unreasonably withheld.
3. The Company agrees to notify each Placement Agent promptly of the assertion against it or
any other person of any claim or the commencement of any action or proceeding relating to a
transaction contemplated by the Agreement.
4. If for any reason the foregoing indemnity is unavailable to the Placement Agents, or either of
them, or insufficient to hold the Placement Agents harmless other than by reason of the facts or
events set forth in the last sentence of paragraph 1 above, then the Company shall contribute to
the amount paid or payable by such Placement Agent as a result of such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits
received by the Company on the one hand and such Placement Agent on the other, but also the
relative fault of the Company on the one hand and such Placement Agent on the other that
resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any relevant equitable
considerations. The amounts paid or payable by a party in respect of losses, claims, damages
and liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees and expenses
incurred in defending any litigation, proceeding or other action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions hereof, neither Placement Agent’s share of the liability hereunder shall not be in
excess of the amount of fees actually received, or to be received, by such Placement Agent
under the Agreement (excluding any amounts received as reimbursement of expenses incurred
by HCW).
5. These Indemnification Provisions shall remain in full force and effect whether or not the
transaction contemplated by the Agreement is completed and shall survive the termination of the
Agreement, and shall be in addition to any liability that the Company might otherwise have to any
indemnified party under the Agreement or otherwise.
