</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and all relevant international treaties, 
including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and in particular its articles 3, 37, 39 
and 40, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>the numerous other international standards and norms in the field of the 
administration of justice, in particular of juvenile justice, including the United Nations Standard

General Assembly in its resolution 40/33 on 29 November 1985, the United Nations Guidelines

 <p> 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with interest</i> the adoption by the Human Rights Committee of general comment 
No. 32 on the right to equality before courts and tribunals and to a fair trial (CCPR/C/GC/32) 
and the adoption by the Committee on the Rights of the Child of general comment No. 10 on 
children&#8217;s rights in juvenile justice (CRC/C/GC/10), 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>the efforts made by the Secretary-General on improving the coordination 
of United Nations activities in the field of administration of justice, the rule of law and juvenile 
justice, in particular his reports on the enhancement of support by the United Nations for the rule 
of law (A/61/636), his guidance notes on a United Nations approach to rule of law assistance and 
on the United Nations approach to justice for children, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with interest</i> the relevant work of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in 
the administration of justice, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with satisfaction</i> the work of the Interagency Panel on Juvenile Justice and its 
members, including the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the 
United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research, the United Nations Development 
Programme, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Committee on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child and various non-governmental organizations, in particular their coordination in providing 
technical advice and assistance in juvenile justice, and the active participation of civil society in 
its respective work, 
</p>
<p><i> Mindful</i> of the importance of ensuring respect for the rule of law and human rights in the 
administration of justice, in particular in post-conflict situations, as a crucial contribution to 
building peace and justice, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that an independent and impartial judiciary, an independent legal profession 
and the integrity of the judicial system are essential prerequisites for the protection of human 
rights and for ensuring that there is no discrimination in the administration of justice, 
</p>
<p><i> Aware</i> of the need for special vigilance with regard to the specific situation of children, 
juveniles and women in the administration of justice, in particular while deprived of their liberty, 
and their vulnerability to various forms of violence, abuse, injustice and humiliation, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that the best interests of the child must be a primary consideration in all 
decisions concerning deprivation of liberty, and in particular that depriving children and 
juveniles of their liberty should be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest 
appropriate period of time, in particular before trial, and the need to ensure that, if they are 
arrested, detained or imprisoned, children should be separated from adults, to the greatest extent 
feasible, unless it is considered in the child&#8217;s best interest not to do so, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that the best interests of the child should also be a primary consideration in 
relation to the question of whether and how long children of imprisoned mothers should stay 
with them in prison, and emphasizing the responsibility of the State to provide adequate care for 
the women in prison and their children, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Welcomes</i> the latest report of the Secretary-General submitted to the Human Rights 
Council on human rights in the administration of justice, including juvenile justice 
(A/HRC/4/102); 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Reaffirms</i> the importance of the full and effective implementation of all 
United Nations standards on human rights in the administration of justice; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon</i> Member States to spare no effort in providing for effective legislative, 
judicial, social, educative and other relevant mechanisms and procedures, as well as adequate 
resources, to ensure the full implementation of those standards, and invites them to take into 
consideration the issue of human rights in the administration of justice in the universal periodic 
review procedure; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Invites </i>Governments to include in their national development plans the 
administration of justice as an integral part of the development process, and to allocate adequate 
resources for the provision of legal aid services with a view to the promotion and protection of 
human rights, and invites the international community to respond favourably to requests for 
financial and technical assistance for the enhancement and strengthening of the administration of 
justice, including juvenile justice; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Stresses</i> the special need for national capacity-building in the field of the 
administration of justice, in particular to establish and maintain stable societies and the rule of 
law in post-conflict situations, through reform of the judiciary, the police and the penal system, 
as well as juvenile justice reform; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Invites </i>Governments to provide for training, including anti-racist, multicultural and 
gender-sensitive and child rights training, in human rights in the administration of justice, 
including juvenile justice, for all judges, lawyers, prosecutors, social workers, immigration and 
police officers and other professionals working in the field of administration of justice, including 
personnel deployed in international field presences; 
</p>
<p> 7.<i> Recognizes</i> that every child and juvenile in conflict with the law must be treated in a 
manner consistent with his or her rights, dignity and needs, in accordance with international law, 
including relevant international standards on human rights in the administration of justice, and 
calls on States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to abide strictly by its 
principles and provisions and to improve the status of information on the situation of juvenile 
justice; 
</p>
<p> 8.<i> Notes</i> the concern of the Committee on the Rights of the Child that, in all regions of 
the world and in relation to all legal systems, the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child relating to the administration of juvenile justice are in many instances not reflected in 
national legislation or practice, and welcomes the fact that the Committee makes concrete 
recommendations concerning the improvement of national juvenile justice systems, including the 
implementation of juvenile justice legislation; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Encourages </i>States that have not yet integrated children&#8217;s issues in their overall rule 
of law efforts to do so and to develop and implement a comprehensive juvenile justice policy to 
prevent and address juvenile delinquency as well as with a view to promoting, inter alia, the use 
of alternative measures, such as diversion and restorative justice, and ensuring compliance with 
the principle that deprivation of liberty of children should only be used as a measure of last resort 
and for the shortest appropriate period of time, as well as to avoid, wherever possible, the use of 
pretrial detention for children; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of including rehabilitation and reintegration strategies for 
former child offenders in juvenile justice policies, in particular through education programmes, 
with a view to their assuming a constructive role in society; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Urges</i> States to ensure that, under their legislation and practice, neither capital 
punishment nor life imprisonment without the possibility of release is imposed for offences 
committed by persons under 18 years of age; 
</p>
<p> 12.<i> Invites </i>Governments, relevant international and regional bodies, national human 
rights institutions and non-governmental organizations to devote greater attention to the issue of 
women and girls in prison, including issues relating to the children of women in prison, with a 
view to identifying and addressing the gender-specific aspects and challenges related to this 
problem; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Emphasizes </i>that, when sentencing or deciding on pretrial measures for a pregnant 
woman or a child&#8217;s sole or primary carer, priority should be given to non-custodial measures, 
bearing in mind the gravity of the offence and after taking into account the best interest of the 
child; 
</p>
<p> 14.<i> Welcomes</i> the important activities of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the United Nations 
Development Programme in the field of administration of justice, in particular juvenile justice, 
and invites States, upon their request, to benefit from technical advice and assistance in juvenile 
justice provided by the relevant United Nations agencies and programmes, in particular the 
Interagency Panel on Juvenile Justice, in order to strengthen national capacities and 
infrastructures in the field of the administration of justice, in particular juvenile justice; </p>
<p> 15. <i>Calls upon</i> relevant special procedures of the Council to give special attention to 
questions relating to the effective protection of human rights in the administration of justice, 
including juvenile justice, and to provide, wherever appropriate, specific recommendations in 
this regard, including proposals for advisory services and technical assistance measures; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 16.<i> Calls upon</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to reinforce 
advisory services and technical assistance relating to national capacity-building in the field of the 
administration of justice, in particular juvenile justice, taking into account, inter alia, the Nairobi 
Declaration of October 2008 on the role of national human rights institutions in the 
administration of justice, adopted at the ninth international conference of the International 
Coordinating Committee of national human rights institutions; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Calls upon</i> the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner to strengthen 
system-wide coordination in this area further, including by providing assistance to national 
human rights institutions in implementing the Nairobi Declaration and by further supporting the 
Interagency Panel on Juvenile Justice in its work to respond favourably to requests for technical 
assistance in the field of juvenile justice; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to submit a report to the Council at its 
thirteenth session on the latest developments, challenges and good practices in human rights in 
the administration of justice, including juvenile justice and conditions for women and children in 
detention, as well as in activities undertaken by the United Nations system as a whole; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to report to the Council at its thirteenth session on 
the implementation of the present resolution; 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Decides </i>to continue its consideration of this issue under the same agenda item in

already overrepresented in the Office of the High Commissioner;

composition of the staff and the decision to continue paying special attention to this issue;

universality of human rights; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Recalls </i>the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General Assembly 
resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001, on human resources management, in which the Assembly 
reiterated its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to improve the 
composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical distribution of staff 
in all departments, and also recalls the request that he submit to the General Assembly proposals </p>

 <p>

</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> by the increasing number of cases of enforced or involuntary

harassment, ill-treatment and intimidation of witnesses of disappearances or relatives of persons 
who have disappeared, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> that acts of enforced disappearance may amount to crimes against 
humanity as defined in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of the right of victims to know the truth regarding the 
circumstances of the enforced disappearance, as set out in the International Convention for the

to give due consideration to relevant recommendations concerning this subject made in the 
reports of the Working Group; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges</i> States:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To promote and give full effect to the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearances; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To cooperate with the Working Group and help it to carry out its mandate effectively 
and, in that framework, give serious consideration to responding favourably to the requests for 
visits to their countries; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To prevent the occurrence of enforced disappearances, including by guaranteeing 
that any person deprived of liberty is held solely in officially recognized and supervised places of 
detention, guaranteeing access to all places of detention by authorities and institutions whose 
competence in this regard has been recognized by the concerned State, maintaining official, 
accessible, up-to-date registers and/or records of detainees, and ensuring that detainees are 
brought before a judicial authority promptly after detention; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To work to eradicate the culture of impunity for the perpetrators of enforced 
disappearances and to elucidate cases of enforced disappearances as crucial steps in effective 
prevention; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To prevent and investigate with special attention enforced disappearances of persons 
belonging to vulnerable groups, especially children, and enforced disappearances of women, as 
they may become particularly vulnerable to sexual violence and other forms of violence, and to 
bring the perpetrators of those enforced disappearances to justice; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To take steps to provide adequate protection to witnesses of enforced or involuntary 
disappearances, human rights defenders acting against enforced disappearances, and the lawyers 
and families of disappeared persons against any intimidation, persecution, reprisals or </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>ill-treatment to which they might be subjected, with special attention to women as relatives of 
disappeared persons in the context of their struggle to resolve the disappearance of members of

<p> (<i>d</i>) To address the specific needs of the families of disappeared persons; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Reminds</i> States that:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) As proclaimed in article 2 of the Declaration of the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearances, no State shall practise, permit or tolerate enforced disappearances; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) All acts of enforced or involuntary disappearances are crimes punishable by 
appropriate penalties which should take due account of their extreme seriousness under criminal 
law; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) They should ensure that their competent authorities proceed immediately to conduct 
impartial inquiries in all circumstances where there is reason to believe that an enforced 
disappearance has occurred in territory under their jurisdictions; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) If such belief is borne out, all the perpetrators of enforced or involuntary 
disappearances must be brought to justice; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Impunity is simultaneously one of the underlying causes of enforced disappearances 
and one of the major obstacles to the elucidation of cases thereof; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) As proclaimed in article 11 of the Declaration, all persons deprived of liberty must be 
released in a manner permitting reliable verification that they have actually been released and, 
further, have been released in conditions in which their physical integrity and ability fully to 
exercise their rights are assured; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses</i>: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Its thanks to the many Governments that have cooperated with the Working Group 
and replied to its requests for information and to the Governments that have accepted visits of

<p>Working Group&#8217;s recommendations and inviting them to inform the Working Group of any 
action they take on those recommendations;

<p> (<i>b</i>) Its appreciation to the Governments that are investigating, cooperating at the 
international and bilateral levels, and have developed or are developing appropriate mechanisms 
to investigate any claims of enforced disappearance that are brought to their attention, and 
encourages all the Governments concerned to expand their efforts in this area; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Invites</i> States to take legislative, administrative, legal and other steps, including when 
a state of emergency has been declared, to take action at the national and regional levels and in 
cooperation with the United Nations, if appropriate through technical assistance, and to provide 
the Working Group with concrete information on the measures taken and the obstacles 
encountered in preventing enforced or involuntary disappearances and in giving effect to the 
principles set forth in the Declaration;

<p> 9. <i>Takes note of</i> the assistance provided to the Working Group by non-governmental 
organizations and their activities in support of the implementation of the Declaration and invites 
those organizations to continue their cooperation; </p>

<p><b>10/12.  The right to food 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>all previous General Assembly and Human Rights Council resolutions on the 
right to food, in particular General Assembly resolution 63/187 of 18 December 2008 and 
Council resolution 7/14 of 27 March 2008, as well as all resolutions of the Commission on 
Human Rights in this regard, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also </i>the holding of its seventh special session, which analysed the negative 
impact of the worsening of the world food crisis on the realization of the right to food for all, and 
that a follow-up to that issue is being carried out, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides that 
everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for her or his health and well-being, 
including food, the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition and the 
United Nations Millennium Declaration, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further </i>the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, in which the fundamental right of every person to be free from hunger is 
recognized, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food 
Summit Plan of Action and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, adopted 
in Rome on 13 June 2002, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to 
support the progressive realization of the right to adequate food in the context of national food 
security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
in November 2004, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 
and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with 
the same emphasis, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic 
environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the essential foundation that will 
enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating</i>, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration of the 
World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument of political 
or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation 
and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in 
accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food 
security, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced </i>that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities 
to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome 
Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and, at the 
same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to 
global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and 
economies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that the problems of hunger and food insecurity have global dimensions and 
that there has been insufficient progress made on reducing hunger, and that they could increase 
dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, given the 
anticipated increase in the world population and the stress on natural resources, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>that environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change are 
factors contributing to destitution and desperation, causing a negative impact on the realization 
of the right to food, in particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its deep concern </i>at<b> </b>the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pests 
and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of life and 
livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security, in particular in developing 
countries, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>the importance of reversing the continuing decline of official development 
assistance devoted to agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of total official development 
assistance, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the recent pledges to increase official development assistance devoted to 
agriculture, and reminding that the realization of the right to food does not only entail increase in 
productivity, but also a holistic approach that includes a focus on smallholder and traditional 
farmers and the most vulnerable groups and national and international policies that are conducive 
to the realization of this right, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms </i>that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and 
therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international 
levels for its elimination; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also reaffirms </i>the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, 
consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from 
hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Considers it intolerable </i>that more than 6 million children still die every year from 
hunger-related illnesses before their fifth birthday, that there are at least 963 million 
undernourished people in the world and that, while the prevalence of hunger has diminished, the 
absolute number of undernourished people has been increasing in recent years, when, according 
to a study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the planet could 
produce enough food to feed 12 billion people, twice the world&#8217;s present population; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses its concern </i>that women and girls are disproportionately affected by 
hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, 
that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable 
childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from 
malnutrition; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages </i>States, in accordance with their relevant obligations under the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, to take action to 
address gender inequality and discrimination against women,<b> </b>in particular where it contributes to </p>

</p>
<p> 12. <i>Recognizes </i>that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, and 50 per cent are 
small-scale and traditional farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food 
insecurity, given the increasing cost of various inputs and the fall in farm incomes, that access to 
land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers, and 
that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises is an element 
key to food security and provision of the right to food;

<p> 13. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national 
efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and

Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, 
particularly in Africa;

on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and 
representatives of indigenous communities have expressed in different forums their deep 
concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face for the full enjoyment of the right to food,

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Takes note</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food on his mission

identified in his report;

Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of 
financing for the fight against hunger and poverty; 
</p>
<p> 23. <i>Recognizes </i>that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the 
number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, and invites once again all

United Nations agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding to 
realize the aim of halving by 2015 the number, or at least<b> </b>the proportion, of people who suffer

<p> 24. <i>Reaffirms </i>that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people 
at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and

of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 
</p>
<p> 25. <i>Urges </i>States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and 
expenditures to the realization of the right to food;

achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary 
responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this 
regard; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 27. <i>Invites </i>all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund, to promote policies and projects that have a positive impact on the

importing countries;

Cultural Rights in promoting the right to adequate food, in particular its general comment 
No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food (article 11 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), in which the Committee affirmed, inter alia, that the right 
to adequate food is indivisibly linked to the inherent dignity of the human person and is 
indispensable for the fulfilment of other human rights enshrined in the International Bill of 
Human Rights, and is also inseparable from social justice, requiring the adoption of appropriate 
economic, environmental and social policies, at both the national and the international levels, 
oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 33. <i>Recalls </i>general comment No. 15 (2002) of the Committee on the right to water 
(articles 11 and 12 of the Covenant), in which the Committee noted, inter alia, the importance of 
ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture in the realization of 
the right to adequate food; 
</p>
<p> 34. <i>Reaffirms </i>that the Voluntary Guidelines to support the progressive realization of the 
right to adequate food in the context of national food security represent a practical tool to

the Israeli military occupation of 1967, </p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>all relevant General Assembly resolutions, the most recent being 
resolution 63/99 of 5 December 2008, in which the Assembly declared that Israel had failed so 
far to comply with Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and demanded that Israel withdraw 
from all the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming once more </i>the illegality of the decision by Israel of 14 December 1981 to 
impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan, which has 
resulted in the effective annexation of that territory, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force in

the full implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) for the 
establishment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region,

<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>the previous relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights 
and the Human Rights Council, the most recent being resolution 7/30 of 28 March 2008, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon </i>Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant resolutions of 
the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Council, in particular 
Security Council resolution 497 (1981), in which the Council decided, inter alia, that the decision 
of Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan is null 
and void and without international legal effect, and demanded that Israel should rescind 
forthwith its decision; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also calls upon </i>Israel to desist from changing the physical character, demographic 
composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan, and 
emphasizes that the displaced persons of the population of the occupied Syrian Golan must be 
allowed to return to their homes and to recover their property; </p>

</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further calls upon </i>Israel to desist from imposing Israeli citizenship and Israeli 
identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan, and to desist from its 
repressive measures against them and from all other practices that obstruct the enjoyment of their 
fundamental rights and their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, some of which 
are mentioned in the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting 
the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories;

<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel to allow the Syrian population of the occupied Syrian Golan to visit 
their families and relatives in the Syrian motherland through the Quneitra checkpoint and under 
the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and to rescind its decision to 
prohibit these visits, as it is in flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;

</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>General Assembly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming </i>that the Israeli settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory

international humanitarian law and relevant United Nations resolutions, including plans to 
expand and connect Israeli settlements around occupied East Jerusalem, thus threatening the 
creation of a contiguous Palestinian State, </p>

</p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern </i>that continuing Israeli settlement activity undermines the realization 
of a two-State solution, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing grave concern </i>at the continuing construction, contrary to international law, by 
Israel of the wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around 
East Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the wall in departure 
from the Armistice Line of 1949, which could prejudge future negotiations and make the 
two-State solution physically impossible to implement and which is causing the Palestinian 
people further humanitarian hardship, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>that the route of the wall has been traced in such a way as to include the 
great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern </i>at the failure of the Government of Israel to cooperate fully with the

<p>relevant United Nations mechanisms, in particular the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes </i>the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the 
Palestinian Territories occupied since 1967 (A/HRC/10/20), and calls upon the Government of

</p>
<p> 2. <i>Deplores </i>the recent Israeli announcements of the construction of new housing units 
for Israeli settlers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in and around occupied 
East Jerusalem, as they undermine the peace process and the creation of a contiguous, sovereign 
and independent Palestinian State and are in violation of international law and Israeli pledges at 
the Annapolis Peace Conference; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses its grave concern </i>at: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The continuing Israeli settlement and related activities, in violation of international 
law, including the expansion of settlements, the expropriation of land, the demolition of houses, 
the confiscation and destruction of property, the expulsion of Palestinians and the construction of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>bypass roads, which change the physical character and demographic composition of the 
Occupied Palestinian Territories, including East Jerusalem, and the Syrian Golan, and constitute 
a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in 
</p>
<p>Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and in particular article 49 of that Convention; and recalls that 
settlements are a major obstacle to the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace and to 
the creation of an independent, viable, sovereign and democratic Palestinian State; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The Israeli planned settlement construction in the vicinity of the Adam settlements in 
the occupied West Bank, which constitutes a new settlement block; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The increasing number of newly built structures, in 2008 amounting to 1,257, 
including 748 permanent buildings and 509 mobile structures, which obstruct the efforts of the 
international community to advance the Middle East peace process; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) The implications for the final status negotiations of the announcement by Israel that 
it will retain the major settlement blocks in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
settlements located in the Jordan Valley; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) The expansion of Israeli settlements and the construction of new ones in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory rendered inaccessible behind the wall, which create a fait 
accompli on the ground that could well be permanent and would be tantamount to de facto 
annexation;

profiling of Muslim minorities in the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September 2001; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Recognizes </i>that, in the context of the fight against terrorism, defamation of religions

articles 19 and 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 19 and 20 of the

for by law and are necessary for respect of the rights or reputations of others, protection of 
national security or of public order, public health or morals and general welfare;

<p> 11. <i>Reaffirms </i>that general comment No. 15 of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination, in which the Committee stipulated that the prohibition of the 
dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred is compatible with freedom of 
opinion and expression, is equally applicable to the question of incitement to religious hatred; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Strongly condemns </i>all manifestations and acts of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance against national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities 
and migrants and the stereotypes often applied to them, including on the basis of religion or 
belief, and urges all States to apply and, where required, reinforce existing laws when such 
xenophobic or intolerant acts, manifestations or expressions occur, in order to deny impunity for 
those who commit such acts; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Urges </i>all States to provide, within their respective legal and constitutional systems, 
adequate protection against acts of hatred, discrimination, intimidation and coercion resulting 
from defamation of religions and incitement to religious hatred in general, and to take all 
possible measures to promote tolerance and respect for all religions and beliefs; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Underscores </i>the need to combat defamation of religions and incitement to religious 
hatred in general by strategizing and harmonizing actions at the local, national, regional and 
international levels through education and awareness-building; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Calls upon </i>all States to make the utmost effort, in accordance with their national 
legislation and in conformity with international human rights and humanitarian law, to ensure 
that religious places, sites, shrines and symbols are fully respected and protected, and to take 
additional measures in cases where they are vulnerable to desecration or destruction; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Calls for</i> strengthened international efforts to foster a global dialogue for the 
promotion of a culture of tolerance and peace at all levels, based on respect for human rights and 
diversity of religions and beliefs, and urges States, non-governmental organizations, religious 
leaders as well as the print and electronic media to support and foster such a dialogue; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Expresses its appreciation </i>to the High Commissioner for holding a seminar on 
freedom of expression and advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence, in October 2008, and requests her to continue to build on 
this initiative, with a view to contributing concretely to the prevention and elimination of all such 
forms of incitement and the consequences of negative stereotyping of religions or beliefs, and 
their adherents, on the human rights of those individuals and their communities; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to report on all manifestations of defamation 
of religions, and in particular on the serious implications of Islamophobia, on the enjoyment of 
all rights by their followers, to the Council at its twelfth session;

<p> 19. <i>Requests </i>the High Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the Council at its 
twelfth session on the implementation of the present resolution, including on the possible

degrading treatment or punishment, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment is a non-derogable right that must be protected under all circumstances, including in </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>times of international or internal armed conflict or disturbance and state of emergency, and that 
the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment is affirmed in relevant international instruments, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> the duty of medical and other health personnel to practice for the good of the 
patients and never do harm or injustice pursuant to the Hippocratic Oath and their respective 
professional codes of ethics, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that it is a gross contravention of medical ethics for medical and other health 
personnel to engage, actively or passively, in acts which constitute participation in, complicity 
</p>
<p>in, incitement to or attempts to commit torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment pursuant to the Principles of Medical Ethics, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that medical and other health personnel have a duty to provide competent 
medical service in full professional and moral independence, with compassion and respect for

<p> <i>Noting also</i> that, under the Geneva Conventions of 1949, torture and inhuman treatment 
are a grave breach and that under the statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of 
Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the

for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens 
Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of 
Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994 and the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court, acts of torture can constitute crimes against humanity and, when 
committed in a situation of armed conflict, constitute war crimes, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Condemns</i> all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time 
and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to

treatment or punishment; 
</p>

should not be invoked as a justification of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment and that States must never request or require anyone, including any medical or 
other health personnel, to commit any act of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges</i> States to respect the professional and moral independence, duties and

harassment; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Stresses</i> that all allegations of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment must be examined promptly and impartially by the competent domestic 
authority, including where relevant through examination by forensic experts and other relevant 
medical personnel, in order for those who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate such acts to 
be held responsible, brought to justice and punished commensurate with the severity of the 
offence; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Urges</i> States to establish effective investigation and documentation procedures, and 
takes note of the Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as a useful tool in this respect; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Stresses</i> that States must not punish or otherwise intimidate medical and other health 
personnel for not obeying orders or instructions to commit, facilitate or conceal acts amounting 
to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or for speaking out

</p>
<p> 9. <i>Urges</i> all States to provide all persons deprived of their liberty, in prisons or any 
other detention facility, with a professional medical examination at their admission to and 
transfer between such facilities and thereafter on a regular basis as a means to help prevent 
torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Also urges</i> all States to provide all persons deprived of their liberty with protection of 
their physical and mental health, treatment of any disease or care specifically needed by persons 
with disabilities of the same quality and standard as is afforded to persons not deprived of their 
liberty as a means to help prevent torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recognizes</i> that forensic investigation can play an important role in combating 
impunity by providing the evidentiary basis on which prosecutions can successfully be brought 
against persons responsible for violations of human rights and, where applicable, international 
humanitarian law and encourages further coordination concerning, inter alia, the planning and 
realization of such investigations, as well as the protection of forensic and related experts, 
between Governments, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations;

prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are fully

priority and calls upon States parties to give early consideration to signing and ratifying the

</p>
<p> 14. <i>Welcomes</i> the designation or establishment of independent national preventive 
mechanisms to prevent torture, with the participation of relevant medical and other health 
personnel, encourages all States that have not yet established such mechanisms to do so and calls

Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to fulfil their obligation to designate or 
establish truly independent and effective national preventive mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment and other relevant special procedures and invites relevant treaty bodies, 
within their respective mandates: 
</p>

article 24 (2) of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced
