</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. By its resolution 2005/69, the Commission on Human Rights requested the 
High Commissioner to convene annually, in cooperation with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
enterprises, a meeting with senior executives from companies and experts from a particular 
sector to consider, within the mandate of the Special Representative (paragraph 1 of 
resolution 2005/69), the specific human rights issues faced by those sectors, to raise awareness 
and share best practice.  A first sectoral consultation on human rights and the extractive industry 
was convened in November 2005.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>2. The Human Rights Council, by decision 2/102 of 6 October 2006, requested the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;continue with the fulfilment of her activities, in 
accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to 
update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>3. On 16 February 2007, the High Commissioner convened the second sectoral 
consultation in Geneva on human rights and the financial sector.  Participants included senior 
executives from financial institutions in the public and private sector, representatives from 
relevant non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academics and other experts.  The Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) expresses its gratitude to 
all the participants for their involvement in the consultation. 
</p>
<p>4. The present report summarizes the presentations made by panellists in each of the 
sessions and the subsequent discussion.  A number of issues were discussed in various sessions, 
and have been grouped for purposes of clarity.  The annex provides a list of participants who 
attended the consultation. 
</p>
<p><b>I.</b>  <b>OPENING STATEMENTS 
</b></p>
<p>5. Ibrahim Wani (Chief, Research and Right to Development Branch, OHCHR) opened the 
consultation on behalf of the High Commissioner.  Welcoming the wide range of high-level 
experience and views in the room, Mr. Wani emphasized the importance of respect for 
diverging views.  He noted that the consultation did not seek to draw a consensus on complex 
issues, but rather to share and record different opinions, corresponding to the wider role of the 
United Nations as a facilitator and convener of dialogue.  Mr. Wani thanked the Finance 
Initiative of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative for its contribution to 
the planning of the consultation. 
</p>
<p>6. John Ruggie (Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises) welcomed participants, and stressed 
that while the consultation was convened by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the 
deliberations would provide important information to him in his capacity as Special 
Representative.  He noted that while the attention in the business and human rights arena has

 <p> 
</p>
<p>thus far been on so-called front line businesses, i.e. those that interact with communities directly 
such as the extractive industries and infrastructure, there is now a growing interest in finance 
because the financial sector provides the means for front line industries to operate and can be a 
source of leverage.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>II.</b>  <b>HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES FOR THE FINANCIAL SECTOR 
</b></p>
<p>7. The second session was moderated by Daniel Taillant (Executive Director, Centro De 
Derechos Humanos y Ambiente, Argentina) and aimed to provide an overview of human rights 
issues in the financial sector. 
</p>
<p>8. As the flow of finance across national borders has increased, financial institutions (FIs) 
have come under increasing scrutiny for their role in operations that may cause or facilitate 
human rights abuses.  Today, many FIs and their key stakeholders share the view that they bear 
responsibility for the human rights impacts of their operations. 
</p>
<p>9. While FIs face risks related to human rights in their own operations, they must also 
grapple with the fact that their activities can enable - or disable - human rights impacts caused by 
others.  The involvement of FIs in large-scale projects has been criticized because of the negative 
impact on human rights of those projects, such as through environmental damage, forced 
relocation of local communities with inadequate compensation, or threats to the food supply or 
environment of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b>Panellist presentations 
</b></p>
<p>10. Michael Kelly (UK head Corporate Social Responsibility, KPMG) presented a study 
conducted by F&amp;C Asset Management and KPMG in 2004, &#8220;Banking on human rights:  
confronting human rights in the financial sector&#8221;.  The study identified various human rights 
issues in the financial sector related to risk management, such as staff security and reputation 
risks.  The study also identified business benefits related to human rights, such as reduction of 
litigation risk and improved stakeholder relations.  The study found that there was no 
commonly accepted definition of human rights and no common approach to human rights across 
banks.  Mr. Kelly said that since the report came out, there was little evidence that human rights 
have been systematically integrated into credit risk assessments.  Nevertheless, the level of 
debate has increased and expanded beyond the private sector and beyond project finance.  
Finally, Mr. Kelly listed the types of guidance that are now needed, such as tools for business 
training and implementation, and identification of broad principles based on existing voluntary 
codes for the whole finance sector. 
</p>
<p>11. Titi Soentoro (international campaigner, NADI/Solidaritas Perempuan) shared examples 
of projects in Asia financed by large public and private financial institutions (FIs) that are 
alleged to have caused significant environmental and social harm.  Protesters against these 
projects were allegedly harassed by State authorities, communication with affected communities 
was insufficient or non-existent, and there has been little or no response from the FIs involved.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>According to Ms. Soentoro, women in particular have been negatively impacted by these 
projects, their loss of livelihood and increased poverty making them more vulnerable to sexual 
exploitation and violence.  Ms. Soentoro stated that FIs have an obligation to ensure that human 
rights violations committed by corporations do not happen in the projects they financially 
support.  She recommended that human rights protection be given priority over commercial 
development. 
</p>
<p>12. Karyn Keenan (Programme Officer, The Halifax Initiative) said that public financial 
institutions are key actors in the area of human rights and transnational corporations (TNCs).  
Export credit agencies (ECAs) have a responsibility to regulate and adjudicate the role of TNCs 
with respect to human rights.  As State organs, ECAs are bound by the international obligations 
of their State, including those concerning human rights.  International financial institutions 
(IFIs), in particular the International Finance Corporation (IFC), are critical to international 
cooperation efforts in the regulation of TNCs.  As intergovernmental organizations with 
international legal personality, IFIs are subject to international law, including those human rights 
that are recognized under customary law.  Although they have taken preliminary steps towards 
addressing human rights, they are far from discharging their human rights obligations.  Similarly, 
while one ECA has started to address responsibility for its international human rights 
obligations, others lag far behind.  Ms. Keenan encouraged the Special Representative to focus a 
level of attention on these institutions commensurate with their substantial influence over the 
operations of TNCs and to call for leadership from public financial institutions in the fulfilment 
of their human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>13. Herman Mulder (former Senior Executive Vice President, ABN AMRO, and senior 
advisor to the Global Compact and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development) 
stressed that the primary responsibility for human rights protection rests with States.  Business is 
not responsible for State failures.  However, business can play an important role in ensuring 
human rights and must respect human rights.  While human rights are universal, business must 
delineate for itself the &#8220;must&#8221;, &#8220;ought to&#8221; and &#8220;can&#8221; with regard to human rights, which may 
differ among different businesses and situations.  Business needs principles, guidance, case 
studies, and tools, and should actively embed human rights in its strategies, core processes and 
operations.  Public disclosure of standards and performance by business is crucial, such as 
through the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).  Other multi-stakeholder initiatives are important 
for incorporating human rights into the values and processes of financial institutions worldwide.  
Mr. Mulder emphasized that while the financial sector cannot be held responsible for its clients&#8217; 
actions, it is responsible for the selection of its clients and suppliers, and therefore active 
engagement by FIs is of the essence. 
</p>
<p><b>Discussion 
</b></p>
<p>14. The first part of the discussion focused on the degree of consensus and clarity on the 
human rights responsibilities of financial institutions.  There was general consensus among 
participants that financial institutions have human rights responsibilities, but a range of opinions 
as to the nature of those responsibilities and their application to specific FIs.  The challenge of 
translating international human rights standards into meaningful obligations for FIs in both the 
public and private sector was discussed at length, with concern expressed by some that human 
rights treaties and standards were being paraphrased and therefore diluted.  For example, 
international instruments often inspire company policies, but their interpretation may be </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>imprecise to the point of absurdity.  As another example, the IFC standards were seen as having 
undermined the principle that indigenous peoples should give &#8220;free, prior, and informed consent&#8221; 
for economic activities affecting their land or culture.  Some NGO participants advised 
companies to seek the guidance of human rights experts and draw upon actual jurisprudence, 
rather than relying on their own interpretation. 
</p>
<p>15. It was suggested that public sector financial institutions such as export credit agencies 
(ECAs) have human rights obligations as State agents.  However, this suggestion was considered 
by some to be an oversimplification of international law.  It was also stressed that the primary 
mandate of ECAs is to maximize exports, although they strive to support good projects. 
</p><p>16. There was debate over the scope of the human rights obligations of private financial 
institutions.  There was agreement that companies could not be put in the same position as 
States.  It was suggested that the obligation to protect and promote human rights rests with States 
and does not apply to private sector operators.  The State has a duty to protect citizens from 
violations by third parties, including private business.  It was stressed that the obligations of 
private sector financial institutions also derive from social expectations, for example that private 
business will not be complicit in human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>17. Some participants suggested that when financial institutions become aware of human 
rights violations in their investments, they should withdraw their support from those investments.  
A number of participants pointed out that if FIs withdraw, they have no leverage at all to 
improve the human rights impact of the project.  Withdrawal should be a last resort and it may 
lead to negative consequences, for example resettled populations not receiving adequate 
compensation. 
</p>
<p>18. Participants discussed the impact of the Equator Principles (the Principles).  Although the 
Principles are limited to project finance, they have catalyzed a process inside and outside banks 
that is merely the beginning of an effort to embed human rights into their core processes.  Some 
NGO representatives expressed pessimism about the perceived weakness in the Principles with 
regards to implementation, reporting, and their clarity and direction to financial institutions to 
comprehensively address human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>19. The discussion went on to consider human rights challenges faced by financial 
institutions, both as lenders and investors in other companies and as transnational corporations 
themselves.  Participants mentioned that capital has increasingly shifted to emerging economies, 
some in situations of current or recent conflict, which means that FIs are increasingly investing 
in riskier markets.  Transnational FIs are guests of the host Governments and must respect local 
customs, cultures and laws, and balance those with global standards.  It was also pointed out that 
in such markets, local financial institutions may be weak or corrupt. 
</p>
<p>20. There was discussion about the emerging market FIs who are increasingly active.  Some 
participants expressed concern that these new players may be lowering standards within the 
industry, for example through lack of transparency, and expressed the need for such players to be 
brought into consultations such as this one.  Examples were cited of such engagement beginning, 
and participants discussed the importance of multi-stakeholder initiatives in this regard. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>21. To illustrate the dilemmas arising from different standards within the industry, an 
example was shared where some banks terminated relationships with companies investing in a 
particular country following a United Nations report about human rights abuses in that country 
but competitor banks took over the business of the banks who withdrew.  It was suggested that if 
a transaction is economically feasible, it will find money - if not from a bank with environment, 
social and governance (ESG) standards, then from elsewhere.  Another example concerned a 
client in a developing country who had already secured money from a regional bank; the bank 
found deficiencies in the Environment and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) of the project but 
nonetheless chose to engage, since it would have no leverage if it did not participate at all.  The 
bank had the in-country assessor on the project work with an international firm, thereby building 
capacity in local markets. 
</p>
<p>22. There was discussion about the risk-based approach of the financial sector to protecting 
and promoting human rights, with some participants wondering whether that approach delivers 
the desired outcomes with respect to human rights.  A question was posed as to whether 
assessing risks to the potential financial outcome versus assessing risks to rights are 
fundamentally different approaches.  Financial and human rights perspectives of risk were 
considered by some to be incompatible; an example was shared of a company that chose not to 
recall a dangerous product because the cost of the recall would be more than the cost of potential 
litigation concerning lives lost. </p>
<p>23. Some participants posited that the issues faced by financial institutions are not only about 
risk, but must be considered in a<b> </b>broader context of potential new markets, their entire supply 
chains, and their reputation among current and potential employees and consumers.  It was 
suggested that financial institutions not be looked at in isolation, since their direct footprint is 
quite small, but instead in relation to their clients to understand the full scope of the potential 
influence and impact of the sector. 
</p>
<p>24. There was discussion about the obligations of financial institutions to respond to civil 
society inquiries.  FIs are expected to uphold principles of transparency with regard to 
information and provide processes for redress, but on the latter must be careful not to subvert the 
role of Government.  Some NGO participants shared responses to specific claims of abuses that 
they had received from FIs.  These included:  refusal to disclose any information; reliance on the 
partners of the FI for information; a decision to leave the investment; a positive response by the 
FI&#8217;s environmental officers who were then trumped by the finance officers; and a reliance on the 
judgement of the IFC.  There was a call for banks to demonstrate their commitment, including 
through increased transparency towards communities. 
</p>
<p><b>III.</b>  <b>PROJECT FINANCE:  WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED SO FAR? 
</b></p>
<p>25. The third session was moderated by Salil Tripathi (Senior Policy Adviser, International 
Alert) and aimed to review the understanding and initiatives to date regarding human rights 
issues specific to project finance. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>26. Project finance is a particular method of funding in which the lender looks primarily to 
the revenues generated by a single project, both as a source of repayment and as security for the 
exposure.  Project finance has been the focus of much discussion about human rights issues in 
the financial sector because of its allegedly high correlation with human rights abuses, despite 
the fact that it represents only a small percentage of total global lending and an even smaller 
percentage of the activities of the sector as a whole. 
</p>
<p>27. In June 2003, the Equator Principles (the Principles) were adopted by financial 
institutions as a banking industry framework for addressing environmental and social risks in 
project financing.  Signatory institutions agree to incorporate social and environmental concerns 
into their internal credit risk procedures and to require borrowers to observe standards as a 
condition for lending.  The Principles have now been adopted by over 40 institutions 
representing more than 80 per cent of global private project finance capacity.  Following the 
adoption of a new version of the IFC Safeguard Policies on which the Principles are based, a 
revised set of Principles were released in July 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>Panellist presentations 
</b></p>
<p>28. Motoko Aizawa (Head, Policy and Standards Unit, Environmental and Social 
Development Department, International Finance Corporation) outlined how the International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) supports human rights through project finance.  The IFC commits to 
addressing human rights in its sustainability policy framework and has an exclusion list that 
screens out investments in sectors such as arms and tobacco.  The IFC Performance Standards 
identify areas of risk in environmental and social development, with specific requirements on 
avoiding, mitigating, minimizing or compensating for adverse impacts in areas such as labour, 
use of security forces, indigenous peoples and cultural property.  Ms. Aizawa explained that the 
Performance Standards do not make borrowers directly responsible for international human 
rights standards, in part because these refer to State obligations.  Ms. Aizawa shared an example 
of how the IFC would investigate labour issues:  the project team uses country and sector screens 
to flag potential risks; questions are posed to the client using a sector-specific questionnaire, 
beginning a process of engagement that may include a site visit/labour audit, and will eventually 
lead to a corrective action plan that is included in the loan agreement and monitored, in some 
cases with third party verification.  Ms. Aizawa said that in project finance the most critical issue 
is the willingness of lenders to engage with clients, ask questions, demand that problems be 
corrected, and offer support to the borrower to improve the situation. 
</p>
<p>29. Robert Tacon (head of risk reporting, Group Risk Management and Reporting, Standard 
Chartered Bank) explained that financial institutions which adopt the Equator Principles are 
expected to embed these principles into their organizations through policies and procedures.  The 
Equator Principles is not an organization itself; there is no collective monitoring of FIs who have 
adopted the Principles by a central management body.  He noted that while in most cases project 
finance accounts for a very small percentage of the asset base of an FI which has signed up to the 
Principles, such projects can account for a disproportionate level of human rights concerns.  
Mr. Tacon said that while FIs which have signed up to the Principles account for a significant 
proportion of the financing of major projects, local and regional banks are increasingly entering 
the market.  FIs do not have expertise in environmental and social issues and therefore have to 
rely on external advice, which is often contradictory.  For example, at what point should an FI be 
comfortable that the human rights issues in a project have been adequately addressed: when, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>say, 80 per cent of those impacted have accepted the sponsor&#8217;s proposals?  He said that if FIs 
which have signed up to the Principles only finance projects with 100 per cent local acceptance, 
other projects will still go ahead financed by local or regional banks that do not follow Principles 
standards, potentially resulting in significantly greater risk to human rights. 
</p>
<p>30. Tadashi Maeda (Director General and Special Advisor for Energy and Resources, Japan 
Bank for International Cooperation) shared his experience introducing the 2002 environmental 
and social impact guidelines of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).  The 
standards were developed through an intensive one-year consultation process involving 
stakeholders including civil society, NGOs, and academia.  The standards prioritize proactive 
disclosure of information.  For example, the results of screenings, reviews of proposals and 
projects and environmental impact assessments are all posted on the JBIC website.  JBIC 
emphasizes that implementers must assume responsibility for the impact of their projects and 
consult with primary stakeholders, i.e. residents and local NGOs.  For high-risk projects, JBIC 
sends out questionnaires, visits the project site to confirm the answers they have received, 
sometimes hires an outside consultant to review the project, and incorporates the outcomes into 
the loan documents.  In one case the high level of site visits and engagement proved very costly, 
a cost that was ultimately charged to the taxpayers of Japan.  Mr. Maeda discussed the 
challenge for export credit agencies which do not have a mandate to ensure sustainable 
economic development, therefore the main discussion in the current Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) negotiations over the &#8220;common approach&#8221; is about 
ensuring a level playing field.  JBIC is committed to contributing to the OECD discussion and 
preventing a race to the bottom.  He also discussed the possibility of inviting non-OECD 
members into these discussions with special status. 
</p>
<p>31. Sheldon Leader (research coordinator, Human Rights Centre, University of Essex) said 
that when putting the Equator Principles and IFC Performance Standards to work, it is 
important to ask what risks to these standards are potentially created by the specific features of 
project finance itself and what might be done to avoid those risks.  A classic model of project 
finance is where a parent company, group of companies in a consortium, and project sponsors 
set up a project company or special purpose vehicle (SPV) that owns the assets of the project 
(e.g. a pipeline).  The controlling equity in the SPV will be held by the project sponsors, and a 
loan is made to the SPV without recourse to parent companies.  Pressures on human rights 
guarantees to local populations can arise from (a) insulating the parent from financial liability 
and focusing it on the subsidiary (SPV), e.g. inability of the SPV to meet large damages claims 
from local populations; (b) clauses in host Government agreements that freeze local law, opening 
a potential gap between the protection provided to project-affected people versus people 
elsewhere in the country; (c) an inclination to deal with damage to local populations via 
compensation after the damage has happened, rather than by slowing or stopping a project to put 
right any faults. 
</p>
<p><b>Discussion 
</b></p>
<p>32. The discussion focused on the issue of standards for project finance and the 
implementation of such standards.<b>  </b>Many participants acknowledged the need for greater 
harmonization of standards that relate to human rights in project finance, both across the finance 
sector and with existing international human rights standards and law (see also section II above).  
Harmonization is crucial as the industry has changed in recent years: because of the increase of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>available money and capacity, project finance is now often provided by emerging market players 
on their own or by large syndicates (in which an ECA might be approached in the later stages of 
a deal and given as little as 10 days for due diligence).  The Special Representative was 
encouraged to recommend to relevant organizations such as the IFC and OECD that they account 
for how they are implementing their standards.  There are currently a few discussions about 
coordination, for example between similar departments of different organizations and among 
multilateral institutions stating their intention to harmonize with the Principles. 
</p>
<p>33. There was also a discussion about the role of prescriptive standards or law in project 
finance.  It was suggested that if the Principles had been too prescriptive they might have 
attracted the attention of anti-competitive lawyers; instead, they had to be a set of principles that 
financial institutions could aspire to and adapt to suit their own risk appetite and culture.  
Reference was made to the recent adoption by the Berne Union<b>2</b> of a set of guiding principles, 
which are not binding but encompass OECD and non-OECD institutions.  It was also suggested 
that guidelines work only for the well-intentioned, so binding laws are necessary.  There was 
debate over whether scrutiny should be directed to principles themselves, the processes and 
mechanisms that underpin principles, FIs that adopt them, or FIs that have not adopted them. 
</p>
<p>34. There was a great deal of discussion about the impact on human rights of stabilization 
clauses in &#8220;host Government agreements&#8221;<b>3</b> for project finance.  The original intention of such 
clauses was to protect companies from discriminatory actions by host Governments, namely 
expropriation or punitive levies and taxes, but there was now concern that such clauses supersede 
existing and new legislation or may stifle both the ability of host Governments to introduce new 
measures to protect and promote human rights and access to justice for victims of human rights 
abuses.  It was stressed that these agreements must not be used to circumvent the local legal 
system.  Reference was made to a &#8220;human rights undertaking&#8221; by consortium members in a 
pipeline project whereby the consortium agreed not to resist local laws or claims from aggrieved 
citizens; and whereby the stabilization clause could be overridden in the case of the need to 
implement obligations under human rights, environmental, labour, or health and safety 
obligations.  It was suggested that States would not challenge stabilization clauses because 
(a) they are often equity holders in the project and therefore have an interest in steady revenues 
and (b) such a challenge would be an admission that they had made a mistake when they 
negotiated the clauses.  Participants agreed that more discussion and guidance on appropriate 
stabilization clauses and host Government agreements were necessary. 
</p>
<p>35. The question arose as to whether intermediary holding companies, established for project 
finance investments, could interfere with the protection and promotion of human rights.  Some 
participants suggested that such holding companies and tax havens should be scrutinized, as they 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  The Berne Union is an organization of the international export credit and investment insurance 
</p>
<p>industry. 
<b>3
</b>  A host Government agreement is a legal agreement between a foreign investor and the local 
</p>
<p>government which is designed to reduce financial and political risks posed to investors by 
sudden changes in national law. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>raise questions of ultimate ownership of a given project and therefore of accountability for its 
human rights impact.  Other participants asserted that holding companies have no impact on the 
risk of a project.   
</p>
<p><b>IV.  BEYOND PROJECT FINANCE 
</b></p>
<p>36. The fourth session, moderated by Paul Watchman (Partner, LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &amp; 
MacRae), explored issues and initiatives in the financial sector beyond project finance, including 
the perspectives of asset managers, the status of some voluntary initiatives, and the activities of 
export credit agencies.   
</p>
<p>37. Various initiatives have been launched to address the impact on human rights of various 
aspects of the financial sector, namely: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; United Nations Environment Programme Financial Initiative (UNEP FI)<b>4</b> works with 
over 160 financial institution signatories to develop linkages between the 
environment, sustainability and financial performance;  </p>
<p>&#8226; The &#8220;Who Cares Wins&#8221;<b>5 </b>initiative launched by the United Nations Global Compact 
convenes investment, asset management and brokerage houses to work on guidelines 
as to how financial analysts can better factor environmental, social, and corporate 
governance (ESG) issues into their work;  </p>
<p>&#8226; The Principles for Responsible Investment<b>6</b> were developed by a group of the world&#8217;s 
largest institutional investors; they are voluntary and aspirational, open to institutional 
investors, investment managers and professional service partners, and provide a menu 
of possible actions for incorporating ESG issues into mainstream investment 
decision-making and ownership practice;  </p>
<p>&#8226; Ethical Indices such as FTSE4Good and the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes list 
only companies that meet prescribed standards in the areas of human rights, 
environmental sustainability, and stakeholder engagement.   </p>
<p><b>Panellist presentations </b></p>
<p>38. Adam Kanzer (General Counsel and Director of Shareholder Advocacy, Domini Social 
Investments) stressed that investors have a critical role to play in advancing human rights 
through the use of human rights criteria to select holdings, principled use of proxy voting, and 
direct engagement with their holdings.  Corporations cannot be held accountable without 
information, and consistent, comparable and reliable data on human rights is generally not 
available.  A combination of voluntary and mandatory reporting is needed, and the concept of

<p>&#8220;materiality&#8221; must be viewed more broadly than &#8220;material to financial performance&#8221; if 
disclosure is to capture the true risks to stakeholders.  The Principles for Responsible Investment 
are a very important step forward, but present two broader concerns:  first, the human rights 
obligations of investors should not be limited by fiduciary duty, as they represent obligations to 
individuals other than shareholders; second, an exclusive focus on shareholder value may limit 
the ability of investors to address the most difficult human rights issues.   </p>
<p>39. Andreas Missbach (Steering Committee member, BankTrack, and Private Finance 
Programme, Berne Declaration), stressed that financial institutions have special responsibility 
with regard to human rights, in view of the strategic role that financing plays for their clients.  
Banks can be complicit by ignoring human rights violations committed by their clients while 
providing financial assistance for their activities.  It was submitted that the Equator Principles are 
not the solution, as they do not specifically address human rights issues and apply only to project 
finance, which is less than 5 per cent of capital raised through commercial lending and 
investment banking.  Mr. Missbach gave examples of the human rights impact of the financing 
of mines, dams and arms trading.  Banks should be urged to make their human rights policies 
more detailed, and to determine their levels of influence according to the various types of 
financial products and services they offer, and their relationships with clients.  In many 
instances, operations that violate human rights cannot proceed without the support of financial 
institutions.  It was suggested that the Special Representative could discuss the role of banks in 
his final report and call for a more comprehensive and transparent approach to human rights 
responsibilities in the banking sector.   
</p>
<p>40. David Allwood (Business Principles Adviser, Export Credits Guarantee Department 
(ECGD), United Kingdom) said that the Government of the United Kingdom considers that 
human rights are State obligations that do not fall to non-State actors.  It is, however, the 
responsibility of States to ensure that non-State actors, including business, respect human rights.  
ECAs do not usually have direct contact with a project, but only with their national exporters and 
banks.  They generally lack leverage, as a decision to withhold support from a particular export 
would rarely result in the overseas project to which that export was destined being changed; it 
would only result in that exporter losing the business to another exporter.  Nevertheless, ECGD 
takes some actions to provide assurance that human rights are being addressed.  Mr. Allwood 
explained that as part of its &#8220;Case Impact Analysis Process&#8221;,<b>7</b> ECGD identifies what human 
rights treaties and ILO conventions have been ratified by the host country where the overseas 
project is located.  ECGD then considers the details of the specific project and whether or not 
human rights abuses might be present.  On this basis, ECGD decides whether further enquiries 
are necessary.   
</p>
<p>41. Ivo Knoepfel (Managing Director, onValues Ltd., speaking on behalf of the 
United Nations Global Compact) presented two private sector-led initiatives developed in 
collaboration with the United Nations:  the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI); and 
the &#8220;Who Cares Wins&#8221; (WCW) Initiative.  The PRI provide a general framework for asset 
owners and investment managers to give appropriate consideration to environmental, social, 
and corporate governance (ESG) issues.  The initiative goes back to 2005 when the 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>7
  </b>See www.ecgd.gov.uk. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General of the United Nations invited a group of the world&#8217;s largest pension funds to 
join a process to develop the Principles.  The process was coordinated by the United Nations 
Global Compact Office and the UNEP FI.  Today more than 100 asset owners and investment 
managers accounting for more than US$ 5 trillion of assets have committed to the PRI.  
The WCW is a platform aimed at the implementation of principles such as the PRI in day-to-day 
business.  Its goal is to advance best practice and develop tools and methodologies, focusing on 
enabling investment managers, financial analysts and investment brokers to integrate ESG 
considerations in their daily work.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discussion 
</b></p>
<p>42. Discussion initially focused on the issue of the fiduciary duty of financial institutions and 
whether non-specialized investors who manage assets on behalf of their clients have the mandate 
to consider human rights issues.  A socially responsible investor may include human rights in its 
prospectus and therefore have a legal obligation to consider related issues, but it was suggested 
that fiduciary duty does not impose a barrier to other kinds of investors considering human rights 
issues.  For example, public pension funds have no such explicit mandate, but have deemed that 
there are no restrictions and that it is in fact appropriate to engage on labour and other human 
rights issues.   
</p>
<p>43. The concept of materiality of human rights issues was highlighted.  It was suggested that 
from an investor perspective, human rights was unlikely to comprise a significant risk variable in 
a large diversified public Western company, as opposed to a project-specific company in the 
developing world.   There was uncertainty among some participants about what enhanced 
analysis on human rights issues would yield, although examples were shared of research that 
showed links between human rights issues and financial performance.<b>8</b>  It was further suggested 
that human rights issues could be considered indicators of the quality of management, i.e. a good 
record on the environment and diversity indicates a strong management team.  However, 
examining human rights issues at the company level could have limited impact, as many 
investors now hold broad market indices and therefore do not consider the specific record of 
individual companies.  There was a warning against reducing everything to financial metrics, 
since it could lead to companies worrying more about other issues such as climate change than 
about human rights.   
</p>
<p>44. The role of<b> </b>rating agencies in human rights, for example with respect to the materiality 
issue, was highlighted, and reference was made to some rating agencies that are exploring ESG 
issues.   
</p>
<p>45. It was suggested that it is difficult to screen stocks on human rights criteria due to lack of 
data, which means that such issues are addressed more through engagement.  Companies can be 
influenced in many ways, for example proxy holding, and leverage is dynamic, i.e. a company 
may be encouraged to meet higher standards at one point in time, but investors can always sell 
their shares at a later date.  Some parts of the investor community do not screen companies but

</p>
<p>do incorporate ESG issues into their research and evaluation, and use their influence as a 
bondholder or shareholder to encourage companies to have appropriate policies and 
implementation systems.  In this context questions were raised about what impact investors 
could achieve with regard to human rights since they are two or three steps removed from the 
project, while lenders were closer but still not responsible for implementing the business.  With 
respect to due diligence carried out by export credit agencies (ECAs), it was noted that every 
case is handled individually, and that ECAs are unlikely to turn a project down on human rights 
grounds, preferring instead to engage and seek improvements.   
</p>
<p>46. Some participants asserted that existing voluntary initiatives could be improved or 
deepened to reflect a stronger commitment to international standards, while others stressed the 
need to broaden membership to emerging markets or to companies that do not have human rights 
policies.  It was suggested that there is no contradiction between broadening and deepening, and 
that the goal is to see meaningful standards at as many banks as possible; Equator Principles 
banks will still be criticized if they are involved in problematic projects, as will financial 
institutions that do not have any human rights standards.   
</p>
<p>47. There was a discussion about confidentiality:<b>  </b>While many participants hoped for greater 
transparency, participants from financial institutions in both the public and private sector argued 
that they often cannot disclose details of client transactions, including whether such transactions 
have negative or positive human rights impacts.   
</p>
<p><b>V.  HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS AND DECISION-MAKING 
</b></p>
<p>48. The fifth session was moderated by John Ruggie (Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
enterprises).  The session aimed to identify the prospects for enhancing the role of human rights 
in the activities of the financial sector.   
</p>
<p><b>Panellist presentations 
</b></p>
<p>49. Samuel Nguiffo (Director, Center for Environment and Development, Cameroon) said 
that while human rights abuses may occur as a result of company activities, there is often 
reluctance by transnational companies (TNCs) and the financial sector to address human rights 
as a matter of obligation.  The existing sets of principles and initiatives in relation to the financial 
sector constitute a positive step, but they need to be improved because of their limitations in 
terms of material scope (they do not cover all human rights), applicability and reach (not all 
companies are bound by them), and nature (they are voluntary as opposed to mandatory).  The 
increasing importance of financial institutions from emerging economies, with no or few such 
standards, creates a risk of a race to the bottom.  A shift from voluntary to mandatory rules 
seems necessary.  It would require the following:  independent monitoring of the implementation 
of existing schemes, with publication of results; means of redress for violations of rights; 
improved access to justice for potential victims of the activities of TNCs in host countries, 
including the prevention of restrictions to access to justice as side-effects of host Government 
agreements; and the strengthening of human rights protection by States from abuses by private 
actors.   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>50. Chris Bray (Head of Environmental Risk Policy, Barclays) discussed Barclays approach 
to human rights.  Barclays is a member of the Business Leaders&#8217; Initiative on Human Rights, 
which gathers companies from a variety of sectors to explore how to integrate human rights 
issues into business decision-making.  Issues addressed include managing workforces in 
different countries and managing human rights in supply chains.  Barclays developed a group 
statement on human rights in 2004; although not a policy, it is reflected in a range of other group 
policies.  Mr. Bray shared the origins of the new human rights work programme of the UNEP 
Finance Initiative:  in April 2006, financial institutions convened to discuss business drivers 
behind human rights and how those drivers were reflected in different organizations.  The FIs 
agreed the need to establish a common understanding of human rights - not to recreate 
information in the public domain, but to examine the components of human rights:  where the 
boundaries are for FIs; which issues are material and where they have impact; and to break down 
the issues into a practical format, so a front-line FI officer facing client meetings will be 
equipped with laymen&#8217;s terms for human rights considerations in different industries.  The 
guidance will be supplemented by a CEO briefing designed to inform and promote support from 
the senior management of financial institutions.   
</p>
<p>51. Peter Frankental (Economic Relations Strategy Adviser, Amnesty International - 
International Secretariat) stated that many financial institutions have shown willingness to 
address human rights issues when there is a regulatory requirement or a clear business case, or 
when steps can be taken that will not affect profitability.  The human rights community, on the 
other hand, expects companies to respect human rights and avoid complicity even when there are 
no such requirements.  Given this point of departure, what are the prospects for convergence? 
Mr. Frankental stated that the IFC Performance Standards and the Equator Principles are a step 
in the right direction, and that next steps should be to align these standards more closely with 
international human rights law and address their ambiguities.  He suggested that human rights 
impact assessments (HRIAs) can help bridge the gap between good intentions and practice, 
provided they address all human rights contained in the International Bill of Rights, ILO 
conventions and other relevant instruments.  They should be conducted at the feasibility stage of 
a project and inform the decision as to whether to invest, as well as the design of the project 
throughout its lifecycle, and their findings and recommendations should be embodied in a 
management plan that is monitored by an independent, competent body.   
</p>
<p>52. Paul Clements-Hunt (head of the secretariat, UNEP Finance Initiative) stated that human 
rights must be embedded in the &#8220;DNA&#8221; of a financial institution at every level.  Materiality in 
financial terms is key, and it is critical to focus attention where pools of capital are concentrated.  
Launching the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) at the New York Stock Exchange 
was an important signal to the market.  FIs that have endorsed the PRI now represent $6 trillion 
in assets and 150 institutions in 22 countries; the next phase of the initiative will focus on 
performance, monitoring, metrics, and governance.  The second concentrated pool of capital is 
the private banking community servicing ultra-high net worth individuals, which by 2010 will 
control 50 per cent of the world&#8217;s assets or US$ 44 trillion; only 2 to 5 per cent of their capital is 
currently managed on an ethical basis.  Mr. Clements-Hunt cited the case of a company having 
paid to settle a claim for environmental damage but publicly claiming &#8220;the strong support of its 
bankers&#8221;.  Mr. Clements-Hunt concluded by stating that voluntary initiatives can be used to 
create a framework of understanding to promote best practice with respect to human rights.  <b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Discussion 
</b></p>
<p>53. Participants discussed initiatives and tools that could strengthen human rights protection 
and the implementation of voluntary standards, such as accountability and monitoring 
mechanisms.  Specific actions by financial institutions were suggested, including ex ante 
assessments of their investments; ongoing independent monitoring of the human rights impact of 
their investments; and means of compliance and redress where investments do not uphold human 
rights standards.  Investigatory and sanctioning powers<b> </b>on the part of ombudsmen or monitoring 
units within a company were considered important, for example in reconciling community 
claims that damage occurred because of a company&#8217;s presence with company claims that the 
damage pre-dated them, particularly in the absence of baseline information.  Reference was 
made to the Extractive Industries Review of the World Bank Group.  Although the human rights 
recommendations were not accepted by the Bank, it was suggested that the Bank&#8217;s extractive 
industries clients should be required to adopt and demonstrate compliance with human rights 
standards.   
</p>
<p>54. Reporting and monitoring requirements were also discussed.  It was suggested that the 
reason the Equator Principles do not have a secretariat or public help desk is because no bank 
wants to be responsible for decisions by other banks; therefore the &#8220;teeth&#8221; in the Principles are in 
the annual reporting requirements.  Some NGOs considered the mechanisms of the Principles 
insufficient with respect to accountability.  Emphasizing the importance of indicators to measure 
performance, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) was recommended as a good starting point 
for companies wishing to report on their performance.  The GRI arose from an intensive 
multi-stakeholder process of identifying how organizations could measure their performance 
with respect to all human rights.  It was suggested that if an organization is reporting to that level 
of detail on human rights, it is likely to be working towards better human rights performance.   
</p>
<p>55. A number of participants cited the lack of human rights expertise in financial institutions 
and the need for outside monitoring and assessments with regard to human rights.  Some 
questioned whether a normative framework would compensate for that lack of expertise, while 
others noted that such a framework would be subject to interpretation.  <b> 
</b>56. Human rights impact assessments (HRIAs) were discussed as a potential point of 
convergence.  Reference was made to the forthcoming IFC HRIA tool, which outlines elements 
similar to the steps of an Environmental Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) but integrates the 
scope of the review with country risks and context analysis.  The IFC tool is to be flexible, 
although some participants wished to see a comprehensive HRIA as a mandatory inclusion in an 
action plan or contractual obligation.  It was suggested that a commitment to undertake HRIAs 
could be seen as refining current commitments to undertaking ESIAs.  One question raised was 
whether ESIAs and labour audits can address human rights issues, or whether there should be a 
complete assessment package under a human rights label.   
</p>
<p>57. The sector was urged not to start from scratch to develop frameworks and tools, but 
rather to work with recognized international standards<b>, </b>referring to the previous discussion on 
the danger of translating and thereby lowering standards (see section II above).  There was a 
need to ensure that corporate initiatives would add value and not detract from what is already in 
existence.  Reassurance was given that initiatives would not detract but rather try to decant that 
information to create mechanisms for financial institutions to implement in their own way.   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>58. Participants discussed the draft &#8220;Norms on the responsibilities of transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights&#8221;.<b>9</b>  One NGO participant 
stressed that the norms served three purposes at the time of their creation.  The first was to help 
companies identify gaps in human rights policies and understand the implications of 
international standards for their own responsibilities:  prior to the draft norms, companies would 
be referred only to the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.  The norms offer a better 
framework, notwithstanding debates around some of their principles.  The second purpose was to 
create a higher level of debate and concern over business and human rights.  Thirdly, the draft 
norms were meant to be the basis for an enforcement mechanism for direct application to 
companies, perhaps 20 years from now, as a result of a binding instrument on corporate 
accountability.  It was noted that the draft norms were not intended to be a framework for 
measuring impact or performance; in that respect the draft norms failed but the debate would 
clearly continue.  It was suggested that the norms could serve as a framework for HRIAs and the 
human rights policies of companies.   
</p>
<p>59. The obligations and role of States were also discussed at length.  Some participants 
questioned the focus on increasing voluntary standards for corporations, while the focus should 
be on State obligations.  It was suggested that the right to justice not be privatized, and that 
participants focus these discussions on helping Governments to better fulfil their obligations - to 
keep repeating that government capacity is weak may only reinforce the problem.  All efforts 
should support the long-term goal of building government capacity, not creating parallel 
systems, while addressing short-term issues.  There was a need to strengthen the human rights 
architecture at all levels of the United Nations system, a process that companies can support as 
advocates.   
</p>
<p>60. It was suggested that there should be more focus on the role of financial institutions in 
promoting greater enjoyment of human rights<b> </b>through banking and lending, for example in 
developing microfinance and lending and deposit activity for poor customers, and establishing 
property rights so that poor people would have collateral for loans.   
</p>
<p>61. Reference was made to the intent of multi-stakeholder initiatives in raising awareness of 
human rights beyond those engaged in project finance.  For example, most of the 160 members 
of UNEP FI will never be involved in project finance, but they have made a commitment and 
wish to take action to improve their human rights performance, which is what UNEP FI aims to 
support.  A newly established Justice and Human Rights Trust Fund at the World Bank was also 
discussed in this regard.   
</p>
<p>62. Participants came back to the importance of exploring synergies and bridging existing 
initiatives.  There was a suggestion that there could be collaboration between OECD and the 
Berne Union for instance, while others discouraged sole focus on OECD because of the 
importance of non-OECD players and the private sector.

</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUDING REMARKS 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Representative noted the impact of the deepening and expansion of capital 
markets and the complexity of human rights issues that have arisen thereby.  One result is that 
financial institutions have emerged at the forefront of debate over human rights and the role of 
the private sector.  The Special Representative said if the Human Rights Council agreed to 
extend his mandate by one year, he would continue to study private and public financial 
institutions, including export credit agencies.  He highlighted the fact that he has submitted a 
report to the Human Rights Council specifically on human rights impact assessments, and 
summarized his view on HRIAs by suggesting that ESIAs have an &#8220;inside-out&#8221; perspective in 
which a company tried to figure out its impacts, whereas an HRIA starts with the rights of people 
and communities and relates these to proposed corporate activity.  But at this point, he 
suggested, the distinction is largely hypothetical, as almost no companies have conducted fully 
fledged HRIAs and only one has made public even a summary of such an assessment.  Very little 
is known about how these work on the ground.  He also stressed the importance of moving past 
the voluntary vs. mandatory debate, and instead continuing to examine the nature of the 
commitments that companies make and holding them to account for those commitments.  On an 
operational basis, the concept of corporate spheres of influence cannot be disentangled from 
State duties, because the corporate sphere expands by default when States fail to fulfil their 
duties, potentially leading to strategic gaming by States, which we must resist.  This critical 
nexus requires greater attention, he concluded.  Finally, the Special Representative suggested 
that if his mandate is extended, he would return to many of the participants for recommendations 
and support.
