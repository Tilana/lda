DIVIDENDS
No dividends have been paid or will be recommended to be paid for the current year.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY
The principal activity of the Company is mineral exploration for gold and base metals.
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN STATE OF AFFAIRS
In the opinion of the directors, there were no significant changes in the state of affairs of the Company that occurred during
the year under review not disclosed in this report or in the financial statements.
MATTERS SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR
Subsequent to the end of the year, the Sale and Purchase of the Saxby Project entered into in December 2015 was completed.
The transfer of tenure to Strategic Energy Resources was approved and registered by the Queensland Department of Natural
Resources and Mines and the 3,000,000 consideration shares were allocated to Falcon.
RESULTS
The Company incurred an after tax operating loss of $484,778 (2015: Loss $306,577).
Further information on the likely developments and expected results of operations of the Company has not been included in
this report because the directors believe it would be likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the Company.
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
As noted last year, the Board decided to broaden its scope of enquiry to include non-resource related projects and investment
opportunities. To assist in its search for a suitable entity, the Company established a mandate with GTT Ventures, a
specialist corporate advisory and venture capital firm,
to identify new business opportunities for the Company’s
consideration. As part of the process, a capital raising was completed in August-September 2015 to ensure the Company
was appropriately financed to pursue such opportunities as well as provide working capital to maintain its current mineral
interests.
90,158,035 fully paid ordinary shares were issued via a Placement and Rights Issue and raised $811,421 (before costs). The
Company has at the date of this report 259,204,352 fully paid ordinary shares on issue. There are no Listed Options or Unlisted
Options on issue.
Proposed acquisition of Albion 3D Investments Pty Ltd
In December 2015, Falcon announced that it had agreed to acquire 51% of the share capital of Robo 3D, Inc (Robo 3D) via
the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Albion 3D Investments Pty Ltd (Albion 3D), subject to shareholder approval.
Robo 3D is a fast growing USA-based company (founded in 2012) that designs and markets a range of consumer focused
products in the emerging 3D printing industry. The key terms of the agreement are outlined in the ASX release dated 3
December 2015 (Falcon to acquire Robo 3D) and as revised in the ASX release dated 18 May 2016 (Update on Acquisition
of Albion 3D).
As the Transaction will constitute a significant change in the nature and scale of Falcon’s activities, the Company is required
to re-comply with the listing requirements set out in Chapters 1 and 2 of the ASX Listing Rules (including preparing a full
form prospectus). This re-compliance will be accompanied by a capital raising to provide additional working capital for the
new business.
The proposed transaction has not progressed as quickly as first hoped due initially in delays in commencing the audit of
Robo 3D and more recently delays attached to changes to the ASX listing rules and the need for the Company to seek
clarification from the ASX to a number of elements of the proposed transaction. The timetable for completion of the
transaction is later this calendar year.

FALCON MINERALS LTD ANNUAL REPORT 2016
_______________________________________________________________
DIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued)
Robo 3D is rated amongst the top-selling desktop 3D printers on amazon.com, the leading online 3D printer retailer. It plans to
launch two new printer models in late 2016. Robo 3D has experienced strong growth across its business, generating estimated
sales of c. US$4.6 million in the 12 months to June 2016, compared to c. US$2.4 million over the corresponding prior year
period (unaudited). Sales of US$2.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 (unaudited), c. 80% higher than
corresponding period last year.
Suspension of Falcon securities
The Company’s securities went into suspension in May 2016 following the release of a replacement term sheet for the
acquisition of Albion 3D that coincided with the ASX making amendments to its Suspension from Quotation policy, with
immediate effect. As a consequence, the Company’s securities were suspended by the ASX from the time of the
announcement of the replacement term sheet and will remain suspended until the Company has re-complied with the ASX’s
admission and quotation requirements.
The Company’s Mineral Assets
The Board intends to seek opportunities to divest the Company’s existing exploration assets. The Company currently
manages and operates one exploration project, namely the Collurabbie Project. It has an interest in three other projects which
are subject to sale or joint venture (Saxby, Windanning Hill & Deleta) and are managed by other parties.
Collurabbie Project (Ni-Cu), Duketon Belt, Yilgarn Block WA (100% Falcon)
The Collurabbie Project is the Company’s most advanced project and contains significant but to date sub-economic nickel
mineralisation (Olympia Prospect). The project is 200 km north of Laverton in the Duketon Greenstone Belt of Western
Australia. The Company and its former JV partners have been exploring the project area for more than a decade and have
completed airborne and ground geophysical surveys, surface geochemical surveys and a high volume of drilling. The
Company has a 100% interest in this project with BHPB retaining an option over the off-take rights to any ore or concentrate
produced.
The Company has previously outlined an Exploration Target for the Olympia Prospect based on a high volume of drilling.
The Exploration target is:
 Massive Zone: 150,000 – 200,000 tonnes at 1.5 – 2.0% Ni, 1.1 - 2.0% Cu, 2 - 3g/t PGE; and

Disseminated Zone: 600,000-700,000 tonnes at 0.45 - 0.55% Ni, 0.3 -0.4% Cu, 0.4- 0.6g/t PGE.
Cautionary Note: The term Exploration Target should not be misconstrued as an estimate of Mineral Resources and
Reserves and the term has not been used in that context. The term is conceptual in nature and it is uncertain if further
exploration will result in the determination of a Mineral Resource.
During the year, the Company surrendered a number of mineral leases deemed non-strategic. It has retained two exploration
licences that cover the most prospective ground. The Company has commenced preliminary discussions regarding the sale
of the project and expects to make a decision on the divestment in the coming months. Any sale will be subject to the
completion of the acquisition of Albion 3D.
Deleta Joint Venture, Duketon Greenstone Belt, Yilgarn Block WA (Falcon 20%)
Regis Resources Limited is the operator and manager of the Deleta Joint Venture (JV) which began in September 1998. The
JV consists of three mining titles. E38/1939 is immediately south of Falcon’s Collurabbie Project whilst E38/2005 and
M38/1091 are immediately north of Regis’s Moolart Well gold mine. Falcon retains a 20% free carried interest to
completion of feasibility study. The project is located within the northern parts of the Duketon greenstone belt and is
considered prospective for gold and nickel.
During the year,

37 aircore holes were drilled totalling 2,698m on E38/1939 to test the Hermans, Old Camp Granite, WUZ and
Evans Junction gold prospects. Anomalous gold was returned from each prospect and these are summarised in
Table 1.

24 aircore holes were drilled totalling 1453m to test regional gold targets on E38/2005 and M38/1091. No
anomalous gold results > 0.5g/t were reported from 4m composite samples.

Saxby Project (Cu-Au-U), Cloncurry District, Mt Isa Block QLD (Sold)
In December 2015, the Company announced that it had conditionally sold the Saxby Project (EPM 15398) to Strategic
Energy Resources Limited (Strategic) for 3,000,000 fully paid ordinary Strategic shares and a retained 1.5% net smelter
return royalty in the event that Strategic commences mining at the Saxby Project. The project is 165 km north-northeast of
Cloncurry in the Gulf Country of northwest Queensland and contains the Lucky Squid gold prospect. The prospect is hosted
by basement rocks of the Mt Isa Block that are buried beneath 400m of younger sedimentary cover.
Subsequent to the end of the year, the transfer of tenure to Strategic was approved and as a consequence the sale of the
Saxby Project was completed.
Windanning Hill JV, Yalgoo Greenstone Belt WA (Sold)
In May 2016, the Company agreed to sell its interest in the Windanning Hill Project to its joint venture partner Minjar
Gold Pty Ltd (Minjar Gold) for $112,500. The project is located 75km southeast of Yalgoo and consists of two Mining
Leases (M59/379 and M59/380) and includes the Keronima gold deposit. Falcon has not contributed to mineral exploration
on this project for several years and held a diluting interest which was approximately 19% at the time of the sale agreement.
Transfer of title to Minjar Gold and payment to Falcon is expected in the second half of the 2016 calendar year. Falcon will
retain no interest in the project.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial report is a general purpose financial report that has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting
Standards, Australian Interpretations, other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and
the Corporations Act 2001.
Falcon Minerals Limited is a listed public Company, incorporated and domiciled in Australia.
The financial report of Falcon Minerals Limited complies with all Australian equivalents to International Financial
Reporting Standards (AIFRS) in their entirety.
The following is a summary of the material accounting policies adopted by the Company in the preparation of the financial
report. The accounting policies have been consistently applied, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of Preparation
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all years presented, except as stated below.
Reporting Basis and Conventions
The financial report has been prepared on an accruals basis and is based on historical costs modified where applicable by the
revaluation of selected financial assets for which the fair value basis of accounting has been applied.
New and amended standards adopted by the Company
None of the new standards and amendments to standards that are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning
1 July 2015 affected any of the amounts recognised in the current period or any prior period.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations issued by the AASB which are not yet
mandatorily applicable to the Company have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. Those which
may be relevant to the Company are set out below. The Company does not plan to adopt these standards early.

AASB 9 Financial Instruments and associated Amending Standards (applicable for annual reporting period
commencing 1 January 2018)
The Standard will be applicable retrospectively (subject to the comment on hedge accounting below) and
includes revised requirements for the classification and measurement of financial
instruments, revised
recognition and derecognition requirements for financial instruments and simplified requirements for hedge
accounting.
Key changes made to this standard that may affect
the Group on initial application include certain
simplifications to the classification of financial assets, simplifications to the accounting of embedded
derivatives, and the irrevocable election to recognise gains and losses on investments in equity instruments
that are not held for trading in other comprehensive income.
Although the directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 9 may have an impact on the Company’s
financial instruments it is impractical at this stage to provide a reasonable estimate of such impact.

Other standards not yet applicable
There are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material impact
on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.

Accounting Policies
a)
b)
c)
d)
Principles of going concern
The Company has recorded a loss of $484,778 for the year ended 30 June 2016 and as at 30 June 2016 has net cash
and cash equivalents of $310,424. The financial report has been prepared on the going concern basis. The company
is acquiring Albion 3D and expects that the completion of acquisition and relisting on the ASX will occur towards
the end of the calendar year. As part of the relisting, the Company will undertake a capital raising of $4,000,000. The
Directors believe that its current cash reserves are sufficient to complete the transaction.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the
revenue can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is
recognised:
Interest Income
Interest income is recognised as it accrues.
Asset sales
The gross proceeds of asset sales not originally purchased for the intention of resale are included as revenue at the
date an unconditional contract of sale is signed.
Exploration and Evaluation Expenditure
Exploration and evaluation costs are written off in the year they are incurred apart from acquisition costs which are
carried forward where right of tenure of the area of interest is current and they are expected to be recouped through
sale or successful development and exploitation of the area of interest or, where exploration and evaluation activities
in the area of interest have not reached a stage that permits reasonable assessment of the existence of economically
recoverable reserves.
Where an area of interest is abandoned or the directors decide that it is not commercial, any accumulated acquisition
costs in respect of that area are written off in the financial period the decision is made. Each area of interest is also
reviewed at the end of each accounting period and accumulated costs are written off to the extent that they will not
be recoverable in the future.
Financial Instruments
Recognition
Financial instruments are initially measured at cost on trade date, which includes transaction costs, when the related
contractual rights or obligations exist. Subsequent to initial recognition these instruments are measured as set out
below.
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if
so designated by management and within the requirements of AASB 139: Recognition and Measurement of
Financial Instruments. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.
Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of these assets are included in the
profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market and are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Held-to-maturity investments
These investments have fixed maturities, and it is the Company’s intention to hold these investments to maturity.
Any held-to-maturity investments held by the Company are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method.

d)
Financial Instruments (Continued)
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets include any financial assets not included in the above categories. Available-for-
sale financial assets are reflected at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are
taken directly to equity.
Financial liabilities
Non-derivative financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, comprising original debt less principal payments
and amortisation.
Fair value
Fair value is determined based on current bid prices for all quoted investments. Valuation techniques are applied to
determine the fair value for all unlisted securities, including recent arm’s length transactions, reference to similar
instruments and option pricing models.
Impairment
At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial instrument has
been impaired. In the case of available-for-sale financial instruments, a prolonged decline in the value of the
instrument is considered to determine whether an impairment has arisen. Impairment losses are recognised in the
income statement.
e)
Impairment of Assets
At each reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying values of its tangible and intangible assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have been impaired. If such an indication exists, the recoverable
amount of the asset, being the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use, is compared to the
asset’s carrying value. Any excess of the asset’s carrying value over its recoverable amount is expensed to the
income statement.
Impairment testing is performed annually for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position comprise cash at bank and in hand, and short-term
deposits with an original maturity of 3 months or less.
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is determined by dividing the operating profit or loss after income tax by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary
shares issued during the year.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Leasehold
improvements are depreciated over the shorter of either the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful lives
of the improvements.
Plant and equipment, office furniture and computer equipment is depreciated using the diminishing value method
and straight line method at rates between 13% and 67%.

Property, Plant and Equipment (Continued)
Impairment
The carrying value of plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or
cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of plant and equipment
is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows
are discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds
and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the profit or loss in the period the item is derecognized.
i)
Income Tax
Current Tax
Current tax is calculated by reference to the amount of income taxes payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable
profit or tax loss for the period. It is calculated using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by reporting date. Current tax for current and prior periods is recognised as a liability (or asset) to the extent
that it is unpaid (or refundable).
Deferred Tax
Deferred tax is accounted for using the comprehensive balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary
differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements
and the corresponding tax base of those items.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable amounts will be available against which deductible
temporary differences or unused tax losses and tax offsets can be utilised. However, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are not recognised if the temporary differences giving rise to them arise from the initial recognition of assets and
liabilities (other than as a result of a business combination) which affects neither taxable income nor accounting
profit. Furthermore, a deferred tax liability is not recognised in relation to taxable temporary differences arising from
goodwill.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries,
branches, associates and joint ventures except where the consolidated entity is able to control the reversal of the
temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with these investments and interests are
only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the
benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period(s) when the
asset and liability giving rise to them are realised or settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax
consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the reporting date, to recover or
settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority
and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016 (CONTINUED)
i)
Income Tax (Continued)
Current and Deferred Tax for the Period
Current and deferred tax is recognised as an expense or income in the income statement, except when it relates to
items credited or debited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised directly in equity, or
where it arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, in which case it is taken into account in the
determination of goodwill or excess. Tax losses may be lost following the reverse takeover, a review of this will be
done once the reverse takeover transaction is completed.
j)
Employee Entitlements
Provision is made for the Company’s liability for employee benefits arising from services rendered by employees to
balance date. Employee benefits that are expected to be settled within 1 year have been measured at the amounts
expected to be paid when the liability is settled, plus related on-costs. Employee benefits payable later than 1 year
have been measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made for those benefits.
k)
Goods and Services Tax (GST)
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST incurred
is not recoverable from the Australian Tax Office. In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part of the cost of
acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of the expense. Receivables and payables in the statement of financial
position are shown inclusive of GST.
Cash flows are presented in the cash flow statement on a gross basis, except for the GST component of investing and
financing activities, which are disclosed as operating cash flows.
l)
Operating Leases
Lease payments for operating leases, where substantially all the risks and benefits remain with the lessor, are charged
as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.
Lease incentives under operating leases are recognized as a liability. Lease payments received reduce the liability.
m)
Interest in Joint Venture Operations
The joint ventures are not separate legal entities. They are contractual arrangements between the participants for the
sharing of costs and output and do not by themselves generate revenue and profit. The Company’s direct and indirect
interests in the joint ventures are included in the statement of financial position.
n)
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation, the future sacrifice of economic benefits is
probable, and the amount of the provision can be measured reliably.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present
obligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a
provision is measured using the cashflows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the
present value of those cashflows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third
party, the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that recovery will be received and the amount of
the receivable can be measured reliably.

o)
Share Based Payments
Equity settled transactions
The Company provides benefits to employees (including senior executives) of the Company in the form of share-
based payments, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled
transactions).
The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity
instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model, further details of which are given in the remuneration report.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions
linked to the price of the shares of Falcon Minerals Limited.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the
period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant
employees become fully entitled to the award (the vesting period).
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting date reflects:
(i)
the extent to which the vesting period has expired; and
(ii)
the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. No adjustment
is made for the likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is
included in the determination of fair value at grant date. The income statement charge or credit for a
period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that
period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is only conditional
upon a market condition.
If the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not
been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the
share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial
the date of
modification.
If an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not
yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled
award and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new award are treated
as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
Comparatives
Certain comparatives have been reclassified to be consistent with the current year’s disclosures.
to the employee, as measured at
Significant Accounting Estimates and Assumptions
The carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities are often determined based on estimates and assumptions of
future events. The key estimate and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting period are:
Share based payment transactions
The Company measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the
equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by an external valuer using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The Company measures the cost of cash-settled share-based payments at fair value at the grant date using the Black-
Scholes formula taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
Non-recognition of Deferred tax assets
The Company has decided at this stage that it does not want to include in the balance sheet the potential benefit of
deferred tax assets as the Company is still in exploration phase, and it is not probable that the assets would be
realised. Tax losses could potentially be lost following the reverse take-over, a review of tax losses carried forward
will be done once the reverse takeover is complete.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Company’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and short term deposits. The main purpose of the
financial instruments is to earn the maximum amount of interest at a low risk to the Company. The Company also
has other financial instruments such as trade debtors and creditors which arise directly from its operations. For the
year under review, the Company has not traded in shares or options and holds no such investments at 30 June 2016.
The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and credit risk. The Board
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these and other risks and they are summarised below:
Interest Rate Risk Exposures
a)
The Company is exposed to movements in market interest rates on short term deposits. The policy is to monitor the
interest rate yield curve out to 120 days to ensure a balance is maintained between the liquidity of cash assets and the
interest rate return. The Company does not have short or long term debt, and therefore this risk is minimal.
b) Credit Risk Exposures
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to
the Company. The Company has adopted the policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties and obtaining
sufficient collateral or other security where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from
defaults.
The credit risk on financial assets of the Company which have been recognised on the statement of financial
position, is the carrying amount, net of any provision for doubtful debts.
The Company is not materially exposed to any individual overseas country or individual customer.
c) Commodity price risk
The Company is not yet in production and is not exposed to any significant extent to commodity price risk.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF
FALCON MINERALS LIMITED
Report on the Financial Report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Falcon Minerals Limited, which comprises
the statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the statement of profit or loss and other
comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity and the statement of cash flows for the
year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information, and the directors’ declaration.
Directors’ responsibility for the Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a
true and fair View in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act
2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation
of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error. In note 1, the directors also state, in accordance with Australian
Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, that the financial statements
comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We ,
conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require
that we comply with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial report is free from material
misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial report, The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due
to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant ‘
to the company’s preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair View in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the company‘s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report.
Our audit did not involve an analysis of the prudence of business decisions made by directors or
management.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations
Act 2001.

Stontons International
Opinion
In our opinion:
(a) the financial report of Falcon Minerals Limited is in accordance with the Corporations Act
2001, including:
(i) giving a true and fair view of the Company's financial position as at 30 June 2016
and of its performance for the year ended on that date; and
(ii) complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations
2001.
(b) the financial report also complies with International Financial Reporting Standards as
disclosed in note 1.
Material Uncertainty Regarding Going Concern
Without qualification to the audit opinion expressed above, attention is drawn to the following
matters: ‘
As referred to in note 1(a) to the financial statements‘ the financial statements have been prepared
on a going concern basis At 30 June 2016 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of
$310,424 and a net working capital of $466,612. The Company had incurred a net loss for the year
ended 30 June 2016 of $484,778,
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and meet its administration costs and
other commitments is dependent upon the Company successfully completing its acquisition of ‘
Albion 3D Investments Pty Ltd and raising further working capital, and/or successfully exploiting its
mineral assets. In the event that the Company cannot successfully complete its acquisition of
Albion 3D Investments Pty Ltd and raise further equity or successfully exploit its mineral assets. the
Company may not be able to meet its liabilities as they fall clue and the realisable value of the
Company's non-current assets may be significantly less than book value.
Report on the Remuneration Report ‘
