(&#147;Hecla&#148;), and HL Idaho
Corp., an Idaho corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hecla (&#147;Merger
Sub&#148;), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of 
May&nbsp;23, 2016, as amended on June 29, 2016 and July 29, 2016 (as amended and
as it may be
further amended from time to time, the &#147;merger agreement&#148;) pursuant to
which Merger Sub will merge with and into Mines Management with Mines Management
surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hecla (the 
&#147;merger&#148;).
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:9pt; font-

stockholders will have the right to receive 0.2218 of a share of Hecla common 
stock for each share of Mines
Management common stock.&nbsp;Any stockholders entitled to receive a fractional 
share of Hecla common stock shall receive cash in lieu of such fractional share.
This exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price 
changes
prior to the closing of the merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-

number of shares of Mines Management common stock outstanding on the record date
for the special
meeting of Mines Management stockholders, Hecla expects to issue approximately 
9,024,790 shares of Hecla common stock to Mines Management stockholders in the 
merger. Upon completion of the transaction, it is projected that holders of 
Mines
Management common stock will own approximately 2.28% of Hecla&#146;s outstanding
common stock, while existing stockholders of Hecla will continue to own the 
remaining 97.72%. Mines Management common stock is currently listed for trading 
on the NYSE
MKT LLC under the symbol &#147;MGN&#148; and the Toronto Stock Exchange under 
the symbol &#147;MGT.&#148; Following completion of the merger, Hecla common

the proposed merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-

Management
stockholders, Mines Management stockholders will be asked to consider and vote 
on (i)&nbsp;a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement (the 
&#147;merger proposal&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;a proposal to adjourn the special
meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient
votes to approve and adopt the merger proposal (the &#147;adjournment

compensation that
may become payable to Mines Management&#146;s named executive officers in 
connection with the merger (the &#147;compensation proposal&#148;). Approval and
adoption of the merger proposal, the adjournment proposal and the compensation 
proposal each
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of 
Mines Management common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the 
special meeting and entitled to vote on the matter, and a quorum must be present
at the
special meeting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-

directed that the merger agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Mines 
Management for approval and adoption and determined that the terms of the merger
agreement and
the merger are advisable and in the best interests of Mines Management&#146;s

pursuant to which Mines Management will merge with Merger Sub, a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of
Hecla. Mines Management will continue its existence as the surviving entity and 
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hecla, but will cease to be a publicly 
traded company. This transaction is sometimes referred to throughout this proxy
statement/prospectus as the &#147;merger.&#148; Please see &#147;Proposal 1: The
Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement&#151;Effects of the Merger&#148; 
on page&nbsp;41 of this proxy statement/prospectus and &#147;Proposal 1: The

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times

vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement. Mines Management is holding a 
special
meeting of its stockholders to obtain such stockholder approval and adoption. 
Mines Management stockholders will also be asked to approve, on an advisory 
(non-binding) basis, the payments that will or may be paid by Mines Management 
to its named
executive officers in connection with the merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-

agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Mines Management for approval and 
adoption and determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the merger 
are advisable and
in the best interests of Mines Management&#146;s stockholders. The Mines 
Management board of directors accordingly unanimously recommends that the Mines 
Management stockholders vote &#147;FOR&#148; each of the merger proposal, the 
adjournment
proposal and the compensation proposal. See &#147;Proposal 1: The Approval and

each share of Mines Management common stock they hold at the effective time. Any
stockholders entitled to receive a fractional share of Hecla common stock shall

of the closing price of Hecla common stock on the NYSE on the trading day 
immediately preceding the closing date and 0.2218 will be cancelled without any 
payment being
made in respect thereof. At the effective time, each other option to purchase 
shares of Mines Management common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time (all of which are vested) will be cancelled in exchange for 
the right
to receive shares of Hecla common stock (without interest, and subject to 
deduction for any required withholding tax, with cash being paid in lieu of

closing price of Hecla common stock on the NYSE on the trading day immediately 
preceding the closing date and 0.2218 minus (b) the exercise price per share 
under such option multiplied by (ii) the number of shares subject to such 
option. At the
option of Hecla, in lieu of paying all or a portion of the amounts due to a 
holder of options with shares of Hecla common stock, Hecla may substitute for 
such shares an equivalent amount in cash. </P>

corporation with its shares of common stock traded on the NYSE under the symbol
&#147;HL.&#148; Hecla is a U.S.-based precious and base metals mining company 
engaged in the exploration, acquisition, development, production and marketing 
of silver, gold, lead and zinc. In business since 1891, Hecla is among the 
oldest U.S.-based
precious metals mining companies. Hecla produces both metal concentrates, which 
it sells to smelters, and unrefined gold and silver bullion bars (dor&eacute;), 
which is either sold as dor&eacute; or refined before sale to precious metals 
traders.
Hecla&#146;s executive offices are located at 6500 N. Mineral Drive, Suite 200, 
Coeur d&#146;Alene, Idaho 83815-9408, and its telephone number is (208) 769-

corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hecla. Upon completion of the 
merger, Merger Sub
will be merged with and into Mines Management, with Mines Management surviving 
as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hecla. Merger Sub has not conducted any 
significant activities other than those incidental to its formation and the 
matters contemplated
by the merger agreement in connection with the merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-

business of
acquiring and exploring, and if exploration is successful, developing, mineral 
properties, primarily those containing silver and associated base and precious 
metals. Mines Management was incorporated under the laws of the State of Idaho 
on
February&nbsp;20, 1947. Mines Management&#146;s principal mineral property 
interest, the Montanore Project, is held by its wholly-owned subsidiaries, 
Newhi,&nbsp;Inc. and Montanore Minerals Corp. Mines Management&#146;s 
properties, including the
Montanore Project, are currently in the exploration stage; none of its 
properties are currently in production. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-

Montanore Project is
located in northwestern Montana and from 1988 to 2002 was owned by Noranda 
Minerals Corporation (&#147;Noranda&#148;). During that time the project 
received an approved Environmental Impact Statement (&#147;EIS&#148;), Record of
Decision
(&#147;ROD&#148;) and all of its primary environmental permits, and conducted 
pre-evaluation construction activities on the property. From 1988 to 2002, Mines
Management held royalty rights to a portion of the deposit. In 2002, Noranda 
announced
that it was abandoning the project, and subsequently transferred to Mines 
Management by quitclaim deed the patented and unpatented mining claims that 
control the mineral rights, and all drill core and intellectual property 
including geologic,
environmental and engineering studies, relating to the Montanore Project. </P>

O&#146;Rourke v. Dobbs, et al., No. 16202116-1 (Spokane Cnty, Wash. June 6,

Factors Relating to Mines Management&#148; and elsewhere in this proxy 
statement/prospectus, Mines
Management is experiencing severe financial challenges. In an effort to address 
Mines Management&#146;s short-term liquidity needs, Hecla and Mines Management 
have entered into the Interim Credit Agreement, pursuant to which Hecla has 
agreed to
provide one or more secured loans to Mines Management in an aggregate amount not
to exceed $2,300,000. Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR 
plus 5% and will be due and payable on the earlier of September 30, 2016, the 
date the
merger is consummated or other specified events discussed in &#147;Proposal 1: 
The Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement&#151;Interim Credit 
Agreement&#148; beginning on page&nbsp;66. The loans are secured by 
substantially all of the assets
of Mines Management, including the Montanore Project, and the equity interests 
in Newhi, Inc., Montanore Minerals Corp. and Montmin Resources Corp.&nbsp;Even 
if Mines Management borrows the maximum amount available under the Interim 
Credit
Agreement, it currently expects that it would still run out of cash by the end

2013, Hecla&#146;s board of directors declared a special common stock dividend 
of $0.01 per
share, in addition to the minimum dividend of $0.0025 per share, for an

declared on Hecla&#146;s common stock since 1990. Hecla cannot pay dividends on 
its common stock if it
fails to pay dividends on Hecla Series B shares. The declaration and payment of 
common stock dividends, whether pursuant to the policy or in addition thereto,

December 31, 2015 and for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2016, selected 
per share
information for Mines Management common stock on a historical basis and, for the
year ended December 31, 2015 and for the six months ended June 30, 2016, 
selected per share information for Hecla common stock on a historical basis and 
unaudited pro
forma information using the acquisition method of accounting assuming (i) the 
merger occurred on the dates indicated, (ii) each option to purchase shares of 
Mines Management<B> </B>common stock outstanding on August&nbsp;4, 2016 that has
an exercise
price per share less than $1.42 was cancelled in exchange for the right to 
receive shares of Hecla common stock with a value of $6.61 per share, and 
(iii)&nbsp;all severance due to Messrs. Glenn Dobbs and Douglas Dobbs and Ms. 
Altenburg in
connection with the merger was paid in the form of Hecla common stock with a 
value of $6.61 per share. The Mines Management unaudited pro forma combined 
equivalents show how each share of Mines Management common stock would have 
participated in the
combined company&#146;s earnings (loss) from continuing operations and book 
value if the pro forma events had occurred on the relevant dates and were 
calculated by multiplying the corresponding Hecla unaudited pro forma combined 
data by the exchange
ratio of 0.2218. You should read the data with (i) the historical consolidated 
financial statements and related notes of Mines Management appearing elsewhere 
in this proxy statement/prospectus, and (ii)&nbsp;the historical consolidated 
financial
statements and related notes of Hecla contained in its Annual Report on 
Form&nbsp;10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in its quarterly report 
on Form&nbsp;10-Q for the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2016, which are 
incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement/prospectus. See &#147;Where You Can Find More 
Information&#148; beginning on page&nbsp;108. The pro forma information is 
presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of 
the operating results or
financial position of Hecla following the merger. </P> <P STYLE="font-

feasibility of the Montanore Project. Mines Management had approximately $0.4 
million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2016, which is insufficient
to fund
its business and operations through 2016. Mines Management anticipates that its 
expenses in 2016 would total approximately $1.6 million for regulatory and 
environmental monitoring activities and $2.0 million of general and 
administrative expenses,
assuming that Mines Management were able to obtain sufficient capital to 
continue operations. Mines Management estimates that, following the completion 
of environmental mitigation activities, the costs of completing the exploratory 
drilling program
at the Montanore Project will be approximately $20.0 to $25.0 million, plus 
general and administrative expenses during the period in which the drilling 
program is being conducted. Uncertainties surrounding the exploratory drilling 
program and the
permitting process could require the drilling program to take longer and cause 
costs to increase. Mines Management&#146;s cash on hand is not sufficient to 
continue its business through 2016 or to commence the exploratory drilling

its efforts to secure external financing but it presently does not have 
agreements from any source under which such financing will be received, and its 
recent efforts to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all, other than 
from Hecla in
connection with the merger, have been unsuccessful. There can be no assurance 
that Mines Management will be successful in obtaining external financing or 
entering into a sale of Mines Management, a sale or joint venture of the 
Montanore Project, or
other type of transaction that will permit it to repay amounts due to Hecla 
under the Interim Credit Agreement or continue its business, or that the terms 
of any such financing or transaction would not make future financings or 
transactions more
difficult or otherwise limit Mines Management&#146;s flexibility or 
opportunities in the future. There can be no assurance that any financing 
obtained will not be highly dilutive to existing stockholders. In addition, it 
is uncertain that the amount
of any&nbsp;financing that might be obtained would enable Mines Management to 
repay amounts due to Hecla under the Interim Credit Agreement or continue its 
business and operations for more than a few months. If no additional funding can
be secured,
Mines Management may not be able to remain in business or to complete a 
transaction with respect to the Montanore Project or any other transaction. 
Finally, the amounts owed to Hecla under the Interim Credit 
Agreement&#151;currently $1.4

mineral reserves with economic viability will be identified on that property. 
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-
size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to demonstrate the existence of
proven or probable
reserves under SEC guidelines, it would be necessary for Mines Management to 
advance the exploration of the Montanore Project by significant additional 
delineation drilling to demonstrate the existence of sufficient mineralized 
material with
satisfactory continuity. If successful, the results of this drilling program 
would provide the basis for a feasibility study demonstrating with reasonable 
certainty that the mineralized material can be economically extracted and 
produced. Mines
Management does not currently have sufficient data to support a feasibility 
study of the Montanore Project, and in order to perform the drilling to support 
such a feasibility study, Mines Management must first obtain external financing
and complete
environmental mitigation activities to continue its exploration efforts. It is 
possible that, even if Mines Management obtains sufficient geologic data to 
support a feasibility study on the Montanore Project, the data will lead it to 
conclude that
none of the identified mineral deposits can be economically and legally 
extracted or produced. If Mines Management cannot adequately confirm or discover
any mineral reserves of precious metals at the Montanore Project, it may not be

any revenues. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%;

mineral reserves at the Montanore Project in the future that can be economically
developed, the initial capital costs associated with development and production 
of any reserves found is such that Mines Management might not be profitable for 
a significant time after the initiation of any development or production. The 
commercial
viability of a mineral deposit once discovered is dependent on a number of 
factors beyond Mines Management&#146;s control, including particular attributes 
of the deposit such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure, as well as 
metal prices.
In addition, development of a project as significant as the Montanore Project 
will likely require significant debt financing, the terms of which could 
contribute to a delay of profitability. </P>

Project are
successful, a Preliminary Economic Assessment completed in November 2010 
indicated that it would cost approximately $550.0 million in additional 
financing to develop and construct the Montanore Project. If and when an updated
assessment is
completed, this amount could increase significantly. Sources of external 
financing could include bank debt financing, smelter offtake financings, equity 
financing or the sale of all or a portion of the Montanore Project. Even if a 
bankable
feasibility study is completed, commodity prices, the then-current state of 
financial markets or other factors may render financing for the development of 
the Montanore Project difficult or impossible. Financing has become 
significantly more
difficult to obtain in the current market environment. There can be no assurance
that Mines Management will commence production at the Montanore Project or 
generate sufficient revenues to meet its obligations as they become due or 
obtain necessary
financing on acceptable terms, if at all, and Mines Management may not be able 
to secure the financing necessary to begin or sustain production at the 
Montanore Project. If Mines Management cannot adequately finance its exploration
of the Montanore
property and its subsequent development, Mines Management will not be able to 
generate any revenues. In addition, should Mines Management incur significant 
losses in future periods, it may be unable to continue as a going concern, and

issued on February 12, 2016, additional permits will be required for advancement
of the Montanore Project. Obtaining these permits has been and continues to be a
complex and time consuming
process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involves additional work and 
studies, public hearings, litigation and other costly undertakings. Mines 
Management has been engaged in renewing or pursuing permits since early 2005. 
Obtaining
required permits for the Montanore Project has been and may continue to be more 
difficult due to its location within the Cabinet Wilderness Area and its 
proximity to a core habitat of certain protected species, including the grizzly 
bear and bull
trout. In addition, Hecla is seeking to permit its Rock Creek mining project 
near the Montanore Project, and the impact of that operation on the environment 
and on wildlife in the area was taken into consideration in Mines 
Management&#146;s
permitting determinations and has lengthened its permitting process and made 
those determinations more difficult. Private political groups have been active 
in opposing permitting of projects in and near the Cabinet Wilderness Area and 
have taken and
may in the future take actions to oppose or delay the Montanore Project. For 
example, Save Our Cabinets, Earthworks and Defenders of Wildlife filed a 
complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Montana 
against the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service (&#147;USFWS&#148;) challenging the issuance of the Montanore 
biological opinion. Two other lawsuits challenging the permitting of the 
Montanore Project have since been filed. See &#147;Information Regarding Mines
Management&#151;Legal Proceedings&#148; beginning on page 102. </P> <P

impacts for air,
water, vegetation, wildlife, cultural, historical, geological, geotechnical, 
geochemical, soil and socioeconomic conditions. Permits are required for, among 
other things, storm-water discharge, air quality, wetland disturbance, dam 
safety (for water
storage and/or tailing storage), septic and sewage and water rights 
appropriation, and compliance must be demonstrated with the Endangered Species 
Act and the National Historical Preservation Act. Permitting costs through March
31, 2016 have totaled
approximately $46.8 million, and it is possible that the costs and delays 
associated with compliance with such standards and regulations could become such
that Mines Management would be unable to raise sufficient funds to proceed with 
the further
exploration, development or operation of a mine at the Montanore Project. </P>

no production history, Mines Management has incurred losses since its inception,
and it
expects to continue to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. For
the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, Mines Management 
incurred losses of $2.8&nbsp;million and $6.5&nbsp;million, respectively. As of

font-family:Times New Roman">Although the Montanore deposit is held by patented 
mining claims, a significant portion of Mines Management&#146;s United States 
mineral and
surface use rights consist of &#147;unpatented&#148; mining and millsite claims 
created and maintained in accordance with the General Mining Law. Unpatented 
mining and millsite claims are unique U.S. property interests and are generally 
considered
to be subject to greater title risk than other real property interests because 
the validity of unpatented mining and millsite claims is often uncertain. This 
uncertainty arises, in part, out of the complex federal and state laws and 
regulations that
supplement the General Mining Law. Also, unpatented mining and millsite claims 
and related rights, including rights to use the surface, are subject to possible
challenges by third parties or contests by the federal government. The validity 
of an
unpatented mining or millsite claim, in terms of both its location and its 
maintenance, is dependent on strict compliance with a complex body of federal 
and state statutory and decisional law. In addition, there are few public 
records that
definitively control the issues of validity and ownership of unpatented mining 
and millsite claims. Mines Management has not filed a patent application for any
of its unpatented mining and millsite claims that are located on federal public 
lands in
the United States and, under current law and possible future legislation to 
change the General Mining Law, patents may not be available. Mines Management 
has obtained a title opinion on some of the patented mining claims covering the 
Montanore
deposit, but not on all of its patented mining claims. Mines Management has not 
obtained title opinions on any of its unpatented mining or millsite claims. </P>

exploration, development, mining and related
activities may also be impacted by administrative actions taken by federal 
agencies. With respect to unpatented millsites, for example, the ability to use 
millsites and their validity has been subject to greater uncertainty since 1997.
In November
of 1997, the Secretary of the Interior approved a Solicitor&#146;s Opinion which
concluded that the General Mining Law imposed a limitation that only a single 
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">five-acre</FONT> millsite may be claimed or 
used in
connection with each associated and valid unpatented or patented lode mining 
claim. Subsequently, however, on October&nbsp;7, 2003, the new Secretary of the 
Interior approved an Opinion by the Deputy Solicitor which concluded that the 
mining laws do
not impose a limitation that only a single <FONT STYLE="white-
space:nowrap">five-acre</FONT> millsite may be claimed in connection with each 
associated unpatented or patented lode mining claim. Current federal regulations
do not include the millsite
limitation. There can be no assurance, however, that the Department of the 
Interior will not seek to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-impose</FONT> the 
millsite limitation at some point in the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt;

including one action that is currently ongoing, against the Department of the 
Interior, the
Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the U.S. 
Forest Service (USFS), seeking to impose the <FONT STYLE="white-

claimants to pay fair
market value for their use of the surface of federal lands where those claimants
have not demonstrated the validity of their unpatented mining claims and

amendments to the
General Mining Law, as well as legislation that would make comprehensive changes
to the law. Although no such legislation has been adopted to date, there can be 
no assurance that such legislation will not be adopted in the future. If 
adopted, such
legislation, if it included concepts that have been part of previous legislative
proposals, could, among other things, (i)&nbsp;adopt the millsite limitation 
discussed above, (ii)&nbsp;impose time limits on the effectiveness of plans of 
operation
that may not coincide with mine life, (iii)&nbsp;impose more stringent 
environmental compliance and reclamation requirements, (iv)&nbsp;establish a 
mechanism that would allow states, localities and Native American tribes to 
petition for the
withdrawal of identified tracts of federal land from the operation of the 
General Mining Law, (v)&nbsp;allow for administrative determinations that mining
would not be allowed in situations where undue degradation of the federal lands 
in question
could not be prevented and (vi)&nbsp;impose royalties on silver and copper 
production or fees on tons of material moved from unpatented mining claims 
located on federal lands or impose fees on production or tons of material moved 
from patented
mining claims. If adopted, such legislation could have an adverse impact on 
earnings from Mines Management&#146;s operations, could reduce estimates of any

Newhi,&nbsp;Inc. and Montanore Minerals Corp. v. Tracie Fus et al., Cause 
No.&nbsp;DV <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">07-248</FONT> in Montana Nineteenth

a court
judgment against certain of the defendants that the unpatented mining claims of 
such defendants allegedly located above portions of Mines Management&#146;s adit
and overlapping certain of its patented and unpatented mining claims, millsites 
and
tunnel sites are invalid. The defendants then asserted trespass claims against 
Mines Management relating to Mines Management&#146;s use of certain of its
mining claims, millsites and the adit. The parties participated in a mediation 
in 2009, which
resulted in a settlement with seven of the ten defendants. In <FONT

(i)&nbsp;enforcing the settlement with seven of the ten defendants, 
(ii)&nbsp;enjoining Mines Management
from trespassing on certain mining claims owned by one of the defendants and 
(iii) finding that the mining claim of another defendant is valid and superior

Mines
Management was enjoined from trespass do not overlap the adit. The mining claim 
that the court determined was valid and superior to certain of Mines

area around
the Project. The USFS and the MDEQ continued to develop the Final EIS during 
2014 and issued the preliminary Final EIS during the third quarter of 2014. A 
second preliminary Final EIS was completed late in 2014. Several drafts of the 
ROD were also
completed during 2014 by the EIS contractor. The USFS and the MDEQ provided 
legal notice to the public on April 1, 2015 announcing the availability of the 
Final EIS and Draft ROD. Following a public objection and resolution process, 
the USFS and
MDEQ integrated clarifying comments into the Final EIS. In December 2015, the

Montanore Project in March 2015, Mines Management
initiated contact regarding financing, joint venture or business combination 
transactions with multiple private equity funds and exploration and mining 
companies and entered into confidentiality agreements with certain interested 
parties, including
Hecla, to enable those companies and institutions to conduct due diligence. 
Subsequently, in July 2015, Mines Management sent out requests for proposals to 
approximately fifty private equity funds and exploration and mining 
companies.&nbsp;As a
result of those efforts, Mines Management received two responses containing 
proposals.&nbsp;Of these two responses, one was from Hecla and the other was 
from an unrelated third party with which Mines Management entered into a 
confidentiality
agreement.&nbsp;After preliminary due diligence, the third party decided not to 
move forward with a proposal. Concurrently, Mines Management engaged a financial
advisor concerning a possible debt or equity financing.&nbsp;Mines Management 
ended the
engagement with the financial advisor in October 2015 due to a lack of interest 
in the possible debt or equity financing.&nbsp;In October 2015, in order to 
improve its cash position and continue its business, Mines Management sold 
mining equipment
for approximately $1.67 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-

average price (&#147;VWAP&#148;) and 30 day VWAP premiums paid in previous 
mining sector
transactions since 2013 (the &#147;Mining Premiums Database&#148;) to compare 
against the transaction. CG recognized that none of the precedent transactions 
is directly comparable to the transaction, and that each of the selected mining 
sector
transactions is: (i) unique in terms of size, geographic location, commodity 
mix, stage of development and transaction structure and (ii) reflective of the 
strategic rationale of both the respective acquiror and target. Nevertheless, 
the precedent
mining sector transactions were selected by CG because they are transactions 
that were announced since the start of 2013 and are reflective of recent 
&#147;en bloc&#148; premiums paid in the mining sector. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">CG reviewed available public information for 
selected precedent precious metal transactions involving target companies at a 
comparable
development stage as Mines Management. CG recognized that none of the 
transactions is directly comparable to the transaction, and that each of the 
selected precious metal developer transactions is: (i) unique in terms of size, 
resource quality,
geographic location, commodity mix, stage of development and transaction 
structure and (ii) reflective of the strategic rationale of both the respective 
acquiror and target. Nevertheless, the precedent precious metal transactions 
were selected
because they are transactions that were announced since the start of 2015 for 
projects at a similar stage of development as the Montanore Project in terms of 
resource development and released economic studies as well as financing status, 
and were
primarily projects in the Americas. The primary criteria used in analyzing these
transactions are enterprise value per attributable ounce of silver equivalent 
resource (&#147;EV/Resource&#148;) with the acquisition of Revett by Hecla (the
&#147;Revett Transaction&#148;) thought to be the most directly comparable to 
the transaction due to the geological, resource size and grade similarities 
between the Montanore Project and Revett&#146;s principal Rock Creek project 
located in close
proximity to each other in Sanders County, Montana. The other transactions have 
been provided as a secondary benchmark. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-

selected publicly traded precious metal companies that are at a comparable

Mines Management. CG recognized that none of the comparable companies is 
directly comparable to Mines Management, and that each of the selected precious 
metal companies is unique in terms of size, grade, geographic location, 
commodity mix and stage
of development. Nevertheless, the publicly traded comparable precious metal 
companies were selected because they were companies at a similar stage of 
development as Mines Management in terms of resource development and released 
economic studies as
well as financing status, were primarily projects in the Americas and were 
similarly of a low grade comparable to the Montanore Project, and, as a result, 
companies with higher grade resources were considered and rejected. The primary 
criteria used
in analyzing these transactions is EV/Resource after adjusting the average 
comparable company multiple for an assumed &#147;en bloc&#148; control premium 
so that it is comparable to the transaction. The control premium used to 
estimate &#147;en

determination, CG
considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any

based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual 
future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested

amended on April
18, 2016 and May 19, 2016, Mines Management engaged CG to act as its financial 
advisor in connection with the transaction and certain other transactions. 
Pursuant to the terms of this engagement letter, Mines Management has agreed to 
pay CG a
success fee currently estimated to be $712,000 if a change of control that 
relates to Mines Management is completed or a change of control that relates to 
Mines Management that is not supported by the Mines Management board of 
directors is fended
off. In addition, Mines Management has agreed to pay CG a fairness opinion fee 
in the amount of $200,000 for providing the fairness opinion. This fairness 
opinion fee is not contingent on a successful consummation of the transaction. 
Mines
Management, at its discretion, may pay the fees referenced above in the form of 
freely tradeable common stock of Hecla. In addition, Mines Management has agreed
to reimburse certain of CG&#146;s expenses and indemnify CG against certain

facts, representations, assumptions and exclusions set forth or referred to in 
such opinion,
the merger will qualify as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of 
Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Code. This opinion is based on representations, 
warranties and covenants contained in representation letters provided by Mines

customary factual assumptions. The opinion is not binding on the Internal 
Revenue Service or any court. Mines Management and Hecla have not sought and 
will not seek any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding any matters

applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Mines Management is required to submit a
proposal to its
stockholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation 
that may become payable to Mines Management&#146;s named executive officers in 
connection with the completion of the merger. This proposal, which we refer to 
as the

the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on the compensation 
that may be paid or become payable to Mines Management&#146;s named executive 
officers in
connection with the merger. This compensation is summarized in the table in the 
section entitled &#147;Proposal 1: The Approval and Adoption of the Merger 
Agreement&#151;Interests of Mines Management&#146;s Directors and Named 
Executive Officers in
the Merger&#151;Golden Parachute Compensation&#148; beginning on page 61,

Mines Management
board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-

The Mines Management board unanimously recommends that Mines Management&#146;s 
stockholders
approve, by advisory vote, the compensation that may become payable to Mines 
Management&#146;s named executive officers in connection with the completion of 
the merger. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The vote on the compensation proposal is a vote 
separate and apart from the vote on the merger proposal. Accordingly, you may 
vote to approve
and adopt the merger proposal and vote not to approve the compensation proposal 
and vice versa. Because the vote on the compensation proposal is advisory only, 
it will not be binding on either Mines Management or Hecla. Accordingly, if the 
merger
agreement is approved and adopted and the merger is completed, the compensation 
will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless 
of the outcome of the vote on the compensation proposal. </P>

town, by traveling east about two miles on State Highway 200, north about five 
miles on a secondary graveled road to the junction of the west and east forks of
Rock Creek,

any future mining of the deposit would take place underground and Mines 
Management has access to the deposit from outside the Cabinet Wilderness Area

strata-bound in the upper portions of the lower
Revett Formation. Copper and silver values are carried predominately in the 
minerals bornite, chalcocite, chalcopyrite and native silver in variable 
proportions and concentrations. Sulfide content of the mineralized rock rarely

crops out at the surface and extends down dip at least 12,000 feet to the north-
northwest. The
mineralization is open ended in the down dip direction. Mineralization occurs in
at least two sub-parallel horizons separated by a silver- and copper-deficient 
zone containing low-grade lead in the form of galena. The two horizons are 
identified as
the B1 for the upper zone and the B for the lower and more extensive zone. Both 
zones dip to the northwest between 15 degrees and 30 degrees, with an average of
just over 15 degrees. The width of the main (B)&nbsp;horizon, in plane view, is 
defined
by a fault on one side and a fold axis on the other, and varies from 804 feet to
3,540 feet. The property boundaries, however, limit the controlled portion of

draft report in May 2006 that included engineering optimization, engineering 
review, cost updates, mine planning and other aspects of the project. As part of
the mine
planning effort, Mines Management incorporated the geologic information 
developed by Noranda and another previous owner into a Vulcan mine modeling 
package, a 3-dimensional geologic model that should assist in further evaluating
mine planning
activities and projection of ore zones. Mines Management used this information 
to develop underground drilling targets for an evaluation drilling program. </P>

Mines Management reopened the adit and completed initial water testing to 
determine the treatment method for water discharged from the adit. In the fourth
quarter of

most of the mining equipment. In addition, Mines Management has worked to 
rehabilitate the
adit including sealing the walls, installing new roof bolts and extending power,
ventilation and dewatering infrastructure in the adit. Infrastructure in the 
adit includes a refuge chamber, mine power center and temporary pump station,

final EIS that assesses the environmental impacts of the Montanore Project to 
endangered
species, wetlands and water quality. After more than ten years of data 
collection, analyses and public involvement, the completed EIS describes the 
modifications to the proposed project that the agencies consider appropriate to 
minimize
environmental impact utilizing mitigation measures and monitoring requirements.

required to prepare a biological assessment for both terrestrial and aquatic 
life. The USFWS
reviewed these reports in connection with its biological opinion addressing the 
impact of the project on threatened and endangered species, including grizzly 
bear and bull trout. In the first quarter of 2014, the USFWS issued the final 
biological

discharges are regulated by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act which requires a 
permit for construction of the tailings facility. In 2012, the USACE completed a
jurisdictional
determination on the proposed tailings impoundment site, which required 
extensive aquatic habitat data. Mines Management completed a compensatory 
mitigation plan for aquatic resources affected by the proposed tailings

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">In December&nbsp;2010, Mines Management announced 
the completion of a Preliminary Economic Assessment (&#147;PEA&#148;) for the
Montanore
Project. The PEA was prepared to provide guidance on the potential viability of 
the Montanore Project and the basis for the continuation of exploration 
activities. Because of the uncertainties associated with any mineral deposit 
that, like the
Montanore Project, does not have reserves, the PEA should not be relied on to 
value the Montanore Project, nor should it be considered to be a feasibility or 
pre-feasibility study. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The PEA did not update the mineral resource 
analysis of the Montanore deposit completed in October 2005 by Mine Development 
Associates, Inc.
(&#147;MDA Report&#148;). Mineralized material, as set forth in the MDA Report, 
is 81.5&nbsp;million short tons of material grading 2.04 ounces per short ton 
silver and 0.75% copper with a cutoff grade of 1.0 ounces per short ton silver. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt;

trailing average at August 16, 2010 (i.e. $3.10 per pound for copper and $15.00 
per ounce
for silver) and developed cost estimates for development of the Montanore 
Project. Based on the effective date in the PEA report, the initial capital 
costs for the project were estimated to be $552.3 million (with a &plusmn; 35% 
accuracy). The PEA
assumed that the project would utilize conventional grinding and flotation 
processing techniques at an initial processing rate of 12,500 short tons per 
day.&nbsp;The PEA concluded that the Montanore Project demonstrated favorable 
economic potential,
which justified commencement of a resource evaluation program and subsequent 
pre-feasibility study. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-

judgment against certain of the defendants that the unpatented mining claims of

Libby adit and overlapping certain of its patented and unpatented mining claims,
millsites

claims, millsites and the adit. The parties participated in a mediation in 2009,
which resulted
in a settlement with seven of the ten defendants. On March&nbsp;21, 2013, the

licenses and technical services, including
environmental, engineering and permitting expense. Montanore Project Expense 
decreased by $0.5 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily because of the 
reduction in fees paid to the contractor working on obtaining and maintaining 
project
approvals and permits as well as a reduction in the baseline studies associated 
with the EIS. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%;

includes
general overhead and office expense, legal, accounting, compensation, rent, 
taxes and investor relations expense, decreased by $0.7 million during 2015 
compared to 2014. The following factors included within Administrative Expense 
are responsible
for the change: (i) a decrease in payroll expenditures of $0.2 million as a 
result of having fewer employees during 2015 and not paying employee bonuses, 
(ii) a decrease of $0.1 million in fees paid to members of Mines 
Management&#146;s board of
directors during 2015, (iii) a decrease of $0.2 million due to the lack of costs
in 2015 associated with the special proxy and stockholders&#146; meeting held 
during 2014 to approve the financing completed by Mines Management in 2014 and 
(iv) a
decrease of $0.2 million in legal, accounting and consulting fees primarily 
associated with a litigation matter described in &#147;Information Regarding 
Mines Management&#151;Legal Proceedings&#148; beginning on page 102. </P>

quarter
ended March&nbsp;31, 2016 compared to $1.5 million for the quarter ended March 
31, 2015.&nbsp;The most significant differences in operating expenditures 
between those two quarters include: (i) a $0.1 million decrease in general and 
administrative
expenses primarily due to a decrease in stock compensation and investor 
relations expenses during 2016, (ii) a decrease of $0.1 million in technical 
expenses in 2016 primarily due to the completion of the final EIS and issuance 
of the RODs, which
resulted in reductions in fees paid to the contractors working on obtaining and 
maintaining project approvals and permits as well as a reduction in the baseline
studies associated with the EIS, and (iii) a $0.3 million decrease in legal, 
accounting
and consulting fees primarily associated with the conclusion of a litigation 
matter in the third quarter of 2015&nbsp;as described in &#147;Information

of Mines Management. Also on May 23, 2016, Mines Management entered into the 
Interim

audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mines 
Management,&nbsp;Inc. and
subsidiaries (the Company) as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the 
related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, 
stockholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These 
consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is 
to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our 
audits. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audits in accordance with the 
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of 
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over 
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes 
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for
our opinion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; 
font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our opinion, the consolidated 
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the
consolidated financial position of Mines Management,&nbsp;Inc. and subsidiaries 
as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of their 
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with U.S.
generally
accepted accounting principles. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-
bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that 
the Company will
continue as a going concern. As described in Note&nbsp;1 to the consolidated 
financial statements, the Company has recurring losses from operations and does 
not have sufficient cash on hand to fund operations through the end of 2016. 
These matters
raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. 
Management&#146;s plans in regard to these matters are also described in 
Note&nbsp;1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any 
adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-

not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable
to continue as a going concern. The Company is an exploration stage company and 
has
incurred losses since the inception of its exploration stage. The Company does 
not have sufficient cash to fund normal operations beyond April&nbsp;2016 
without raising additional funds. The Company currently does not have a 
recurring source of
revenue sufficient to fund normal operations and its ability to continue as a 
going concern is dependent on the Company&#146;s ability to secure sufficient 
funding for its future exploration and working capital requirements, which may 
include the
sale of its equity or debt securities, and the eventual profitable exploitation 
of its mining properties. There can be no assurance that the Company will 
succeed in securing additional funding on terms acceptable to the Company or at 
all, or in
generating future profitable operations. These factors raise substantial doubt 
about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. </P> <P

Management,&nbsp;Inc. (the Company) is an Idaho corporation incorporated in

America. The Company&#146;s principal mineral property interest, the Montanore 
Project, is
held by its wholly owned subsidiaries, Newhi Inc. and Montanore Minerals Corp. 
The Company&#146;s properties, including the Montanore property, are currently 
in the exploration stage; none of its properties are currently in production. 
The Company
continues acquiring various permits for the Montanore Project and is determining
its feasibility for development. The Company&#146;s business, operations and 
financial condition are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, 
including failing
to secure additional funding to continue our business and execute our planned 
advanced evaluation and delineation drilling program at the Montanore Project.

STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New 
Roman">These
unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared by the Company in 
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;U.S. 
GAAP&#148;) for interim financial information, as well as the instructions to 
Form&nbsp;10-Q.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by 
U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the 
Company&#146;s management, all adjustments (consisting solely of normal 
recurring adjustments)
considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim financial statements
have been included. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-
size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The preparation of financial statements 
in
accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements 
are published,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the
preparation of the Company&#146;s condensed consolidated financial statements;
accordingly, it is possible that the actual results could differ from these 
estimates and assumptions, which could have a material effect on the reported 
amounts of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial position and results of 
operations.
Operating results for the three month period ended March 31, 2016 are not 
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year 
ending December 31, 2016. </P>

continue as a going
concern and do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the 
Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company is an exploration 
stage company and has incurred losses since the inception of its exploration 
stage. The
Company does not have sufficient cash to fund normal operations through the end 
of the second quarter of 2016 without raising additional funds. The Company 
currently does not have a recurring source of revenue sufficient to fund normal 
operations
and its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the 
Company&#146;s ability to secure sufficient funding for its future exploration 
and working capital requirements, which may include the sale of its equity or 
debt securities,
borrowing, or the sale of all or part of the Montanore project. There can be no 
assurance that the Company will succeed in securing additional funding on terms 
acceptable to the Company or at all, or in generating future profitable 
operations. These

financial institution. To date, the Company has not experienced a material loss 
or lack of
access to its invested cash or cash equivalents; however, no assurance can be 
provided that access to the Company&#146;s invested cash and cash equivalents 
will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. The total 
uninsured bank
deposit balance on the Company&#146;s bank statements was approximately 
$1,279,000 as of March 31, 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-

margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During July 
2014, the
Company sold to one investor 4,000 units consisting of one share of the 
Company&#146;s Series B convertible preferred stock, no par value, and a warrant
to purchase the Company&#146;s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a 
stated value of
$1,000 per unit. Each share of Series B convertible preferred stock is 
immediately convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion rate of 
approximately 1,271 shares of common stock for each share of Series B 
convertible preferred stock
(equivalent to a conversion price of $0.7866 per share of common stock). The 
conversion rate is subject to downward adjustment upon the Company issuing or 
selling shares of the Company&#146;s common stock for a per share price less 
than the
applicable conversion rate. The offering yielded gross proceeds, before offering
expenses, of $4.0 million (net proceeds of $3.5 million after deducting 
placement agent and investor fees and expenses and other offering expenses). The
preferred stock
has no voting rights but will entitle the holders to receive cumulative 
dividends at the rate of 6% per annum per share, payable quarterly. The
dividends are payable in either cash or common stock at the Company&#146;s 
discretion. As of March 31,
2016, 906.63 shares of the Series B 6% convertible preferred stock had been 
converted into 1,152,592 shares of common stock. Upon the occurrence of certain 
events the Company believes are within its control, the holders of the preferred
shares may
have the option to redeem or convert them into common shares or increase the 
dividend rate to 18% per annum. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-
bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Warrants:</I> Each 
warrant is immediately
exercisable and allows the holder to purchase approximately 636 shares of the 
Company&#146;s common stock. The warrants are not listed on a national 
securities exchange and do not have the rights or privileges of a holder of 
common stock, including
any voting rights, until the holder exercises the warrant. Upon the occurrence 
of a Fundamental Transaction, as defined in the warrant, the Company or its 
successor may be required to purchase the unexercised portion of the warrant 
from the warrant
holder. The following table sets forth the exercise price and expiration date of
the outstanding common stock purchase warrants as of March&nbsp;31, 2016. </P>

Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any 
written notice of cancellation of, premium increase with respect to, or 
alteration of coverage under, any of such Insurance Policies. All premiums due 
on such Insurance
Policies have either been paid or, if due and payable prior to Closing, will be 
paid prior to Closing in accordance with the payment terms of each Insurance 
Policy. The Insurance Policies do not provide for any retrospective premium 
adjustment or
other experience-based liability on the part of the Company. All such Insurance 
Policies (a) are valid and binding in accordance with their terms; (b) are 
provided by carriers who are financially solvent; and (c) have not been subject 
to any lapse
in coverage. There are no claims related to the business of the Company or its 
Subsidiaries pending under any such Insurance Policies as to which coverage has 
been questioned, denied or disputed or in respect of which there is an 
outstanding
reservation of rights. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in 
default under, and none of them has otherwise failed to comply with, in any 
material respect, any provision contained in any such Insurance Policy. The 
Insurance Policies
are of the type and in the amounts customarily carried by Persons conducting a 
business similar to the Company and are sufficient for compliance with all 
applicable Laws and Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or by
which it is bound. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-
