4.      
After carefully considering the Plea of both of you to be unequivocal, this Court found you guilty for two counts of Aggravated Robbery contrary to Section 311 (1) (a) of the Crimes Decree, and one count of Theft of a Motor Vehicle contrary to Section 291 (1) of the Crimes Decree No. 44 of 2009. 

5.      
Accused Laisenia Vuluma & Jolame Vunituraga you stand convicted for two counts of Aggravated Robbery and one count of Theft of a Motor Vehicle.

6.      
The maximum sentence for Aggravated Robbery is 20 years and Theft of a Motor Vehicle is 10 years.

7.      
The tariff for Aggravated Robbery is well settled now. 

8.      
In State v Rokonabete [2008] FJHC 226; HAC 118.2007 (15 September 2008) it was held by Hon. Mr. Justice Danieal Goundar that:

 "The dominant factor in assessing seriousness for any types of robbery is the degree of force used or threatened. The degree of injury to the victim or the nature of and duration of threats are also relevant in assessing the seriousness of an offence of robbery with violence. If a weapon is involved in the use or treat of force that will always be an important aggravating feature. Group offending will aggregate an offence because the level of intimidation and fear caused to the victim will be greater. It may also indicate planning and gang activity. Being the ring leader in a group is an aggravating factor. If the victims are vulnerable, such as elderly people and person providing public transport, that will be an aggravating factor. Other aggravating factors may include the volume of items taken and the fact that an offence was committed whilst the offender was on bail.

 The seriousness of an offence of robbery is mitigated by factors such as a timely guilty plea, clear evidence of remorse, ready co-operation with the police, response to previous sentences, personal circumstances of offender, first offence of violence, voluntary return of property taken, playing a minor part, and lack of planning involved."

9.      
In State v Manoa [2010] FJHC 409; HAC 061.2010 (6th August 2010) it was held by Hon. Mr. Justice Daniel Goundar that:

"The maximum penalty for robbery with violence under Penal Code is life imprisonment, while the maximum penalty for aggravated robbery under the Crimes Decree is 20 years imprisonment. Although the maximum sentence under the Decree has been reduced to 20 years imprisonment, in my judgment, the tariff of 8-14 years imprisonment established under the old law can continue to apply under the new law. I hold this for two reasons. Firstly, the established tariff of 8-14 years under the old law falls below the maximum sentence of 20 years under new law. Secondly, under the new law, aggravated robbery is made an indictable offence, triable only in the High Court, which means the Executive's intention is to continue to treat the offence seriously."

10.     
I take a starting point of 10 years for each of you for each count of Aggravated Robbery.

11.     
Aggravating factors;

(i)     
Robbery was well planned,
(ii)    
High value of the items.

12.     
I add 2 years for above and now your sentence is 12 years.

13.     
Mitigating circumstances of Laisenia Vuluma;

(i)     
You are a first offender at the age of 29 years,
(ii)    
Family depend on you,
(iii)   
You are remorseful .

14.     
Considering above, I deduct 2 years from your sentence, now your sentence is 10 years. 

15.     
I deduct further two years for the Guilty Plea. Now your sentence is 8 years. 

16.     
You were in remand for a period of 1 month 15 days. That period to be deducted from the sentence. Now your sentence is 7 years 10 months and 15 days.

17.     
Mitigating circumstances of Jolame Vunituraga;

(i)     
You are a father of 7 years old son and sole bread winner of the family,
(ii)    
You are remorseful.

18.     
I deduct 6 months for the above and now your sentence is 11 years and 6 months.

19.     
I deduct 2 years for your Guilty Plea. Now your sentence is 9 years 6 months.

20.     
You were in remand for 2 months. That period to be deducted from the sentence. Now your sentence is 9 years and 4 months.

21.     
 Acting under Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I fix a non-parole period of 6 years for Laisenia Vuluma and non-parole period of 8 years for Jolame Vunituraga.

22.     
Considering all, I order sentence of 9 months for the count of Theft of a Motor Vehicle for Laisenia Vuluma and sentence of 18 months for Jolame Vunituraga.

23.     
All these offences were committed in one transaction. Acting under Section 22 (1) of the Sentencing Penalties Decree, I order all sentences of each accused to run concurrently.
