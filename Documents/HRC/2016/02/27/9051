<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The independent expert on minority issues visited Greece from 8 to 16 September 2008, 
inter alia, to promote implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to 
National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. She travelled to different regions and 
conducted extensive consultations with senior government representatives and public officials at 
the national and regional levels. She consulted civil society organizations, religious leaders, 
academics and community leaders.  
</p>
<p> Greece recognizes only one minority, the Muslim religious minority in Western Thrace, 
which is protected by the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923. Greece does not recognize 
the minority status of other communities. The Government is convinced that the claims of the 
existence of other minorities are unsubstantiated and politically motivated. However, whether a 
State officially recognizes a minority is not conclusive with respect to its obligations toward 
minority populations. 
</p>
<p> The independent expert is concerned with matters solely within the domestic jurisdiction of 
the Government of Greece relating to its treatment of minorities and disadvantaged groups inside 
the country. Her concerns focus on the degree to which legislation, policy and practice fulfil 
obligations under international human rights law, including minority rights, which have 
precedence over bilateral treaties and agreements. The decision that a certain group should 
receive the protections due to minorities does not have implications for inter-State relations. 
Minorities are constituent groups of Greek society, not a foreign element.  
</p>
<p> The independent expert urges the Government of Greece to withdraw from the dispute 
over whether there is a Macedonian or a Turkish minority in Greece and focus on protecting the 
rights to self-identification, freedom of expression and freedom of association of those 
communities. Their rights to minority protections must be honoured in accordance with the 
Declaration on Minorities and the core international human rights treaties. Greece should comply 
fully with the judgements of the European Court of Human Rights, specifically those decisions 
that associations should be allowed to use the words &#8220;Macedonian&#8221; and &#8220;Turkish&#8221; in their names 
and to express their ethnic identities freely.  
</p>
<p> Discrimination against Roma exists in Greece as in other European countries. The 
independent expert visited Roma communities which lacked basic facilities and faced the 
constant threat of eviction. Many Roma children are either in segregated schools or do not have 
access to education owing to their identity. The independent expert commends government 
efforts to develop positive policies coordinated at the inter-ministerial level by the Minister for 
the Interior through the Integrated Action Programme on Roma. However, there are serious 
problems of implementation at the local level, particularly regarding living conditions and the 
segregation of Roma in certain public schools. The Government should continue its efforts to 
ensure that national policies are not subverted or defied by local authorities that are responsive to 
local prejudices. It should comply with European Court judgements with respect to the 
segregation of Roma children.   </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Independent Expert on minority issues visited Greece between 08 
and 16 September 2008, inter-alia to promote implementation of the Declaration on the Rights 
of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities (hereafter 
&#8220;the 1992 Declaration on Minorities&#8221;). She conducted extensive consultations with senior 
government representatives, including the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Interior and Justice, 
Parliamentarians and numerous public officials at the national and regional level. She consulted 
civil society organizations, religious leaders, academics and community leaders. The 
Independent Expert visited Athens and its environs, including Roma settlements, the region of 
Thrace and the city of Thessaloniki and the Prefecture of Florina in the Macedonia region of 
northern Greece.  
</p>
<p>2. The Government provided exemplary cooperation, support and openness throughout the 
preparation and conduct of the mission. Senior officials gave generously of their time and 
answered questions fully. Numerous individuals, non-governmental organizations and civil 
society groups provided valuable information, and facilitated additional aspects of her visit.  
</p>
<p>3. The Independent Expert&#8217;s evaluation of minority issues in Greece is based on 
the 1992 Declaration on Minorities and other relevant international standards, from which she 
has identified four broad areas of concern relating to minorities globally. These are: (a) the 
protection of a minority&#8217;s survival, through combating violence against them and preventing 
genocide; (b) the protection and promotion of the cultural identity of minority groups and the 
right of national, ethnic, religious or linguistic groups to enjoy their collective identity and to 
reject forced assimilation; (c) the guarantee of the rights to non-discrimination and equality, 
including ending structural or systemic discrimination and the promotion of affirmative action 
when required; and (d) the guarantee of their right to effective participation of members of 
minorities in public life, especially with regard to decisions that affect them.  
</p>
<p><b>II.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND IMPLEMENTING INSTITUTIONS 
</b></p>
<p>4. Greece is a state party to the major international human rights instruments of particular 
relevance to the rights of minorities including: the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the 
Prevention of the Crime of Genocide, and the International Convention on the Rights of the 
Child. Article 28.1 of the Constitution provides that international treaties ratified by Greece have 
supra-statutory force and take precedence over other Greek law.   
</p>
<p>5. Greece became a member of the European Union in 1981 and subject to its Race 
Directives<b>1</b> in regard to non-discrimination and equality. Greece is a member of NATO and of 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The Racial Equality Directive and the Employment Framework Directive, aim to prevent 
</p>
<p>people in the European Union from being discriminated against on grounds of race and ethnic 
origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.3 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>the Council of Europe (CoE) and has signed (in September 1997) but not ratified the Council of 
Europe&#8217;s Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. Greece has not 
signed or ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. 
</p>
<p><b>Anti-Discrimination Law, Law 927 of 1979 (racial hatred) 
</b>6. Article 5.2 of the Greek Constitution relating to non-discrimination states that: &#8220;All 
persons living within the Greek territory shall enjoy full protection of their life, honour and 
liberty irrespective of nationality, race or language and of religious or political beliefs. 
Until 2005, Greece&#8217;s anti-racism legislation was limited to Law 927/1979 (as amended by 
Law 1419/1984 and Law 2910/2001) of the Penal Code and aimed at the punishment of overtly 
discriminatory practices on racial, ethnic or religious grounds (incitement of racially/religiously 
discriminatory activities, expression of racially/religiously offensive ideas, racial/religious 
discrimination in the provision of services or goods by private persons). 
</p>
<p><b>Law 3304 
</b></p>
<p>7. In 2005, Parliament adopted Law 3304/2005 on the &#8220;Implementation of the principle of 
equal treatment regardless of race or national origin, religion or other beliefs, disability, age or 
sexual orientation&#8221;. The Law prohibits both direct and indirect discrimination and has a wide 
scope with regard to equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, 
while it focuses in the areas of employment and occupation with regard to equal treatment 
regardless of religious or other beliefs, disability, age or sexual orientation.<b>2</b> It strengthens the 
Greek Ombudsman&#8217;s Office with new competences. Law 3304 also provides for a Committee 
for Equal Treatment within the Ministry of Justice with responsibility for discrimination by 
private actors. The Labour Inspection Body (LIB), under the Labour Ministry, deals with issues 
and cases of discrimination by natural or legal persons (excluding public services covered by the 
Greek Ombudsman) in employment. 
</p>
<p><b>Ombudsman 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Greek Ombudsman is a constitutionally sanctioned Independent Authority founded in 
October 1998 and operating under Law 3094/2003. The Ombudsman provides free services to 
the public, and investigates individual administrative actions or omissions or material actions 
taken by government departments or public services that infringe upon the personal rights or 
violate the legal interests of individuals or legal entities. The Ombudsman only deals with 
individual complaints, but does have competence to promote the fight against discrimination 
generally. The Ombudsman cannot deal with complaints relating to the private sector, 
responsibility for which exists within the Ministry of Justice, Committee for Equal Treatment. <b>

</p>
<p><b>Commission on Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>9. Law 2667/1998 established the National Commission for Human Rights as a statutory 
national human rights institution (NCHR), having consultative status with the government on 
human rights issue. The NCHR is generally considered to carry out its functions in conformity 
with the Paris Principles relating to independent functioning. The NCHR&#8217;s substantive 
competences include: study of human rights issues raised by the government, NCHR members or 
non-governmental organizations; submission of recommendations and proposals, elaboration of 
studies, submission of reports and opinions for legislative, administrative or other measures for 
human rights protection; development of initiatives for the sensitization of public opinion on 
human rights; and the cultivation of respect for human rights in the national educational system.  
</p>
<p><b>III.  RELIGION, LANGUAGE, CULTURE AND NATIONAL IDENTITY 
</b></p>
<p>10. During the ancient Greek and Hellenistic periods, the Hellenic territories in the region and 
beyond were vast. Conquered territories became subject to strong Greek influence 
(Hellenization) for centuries until the gradual decline of the Empire under subsequent Roman 
and, after the Byzantine period, Ottoman empires. When Greece declared independence from the 
Ottoman Empire in 1829, its territory was only about one-third of the size it is today. The 
collapse of the Ottoman Empire and regional conflicts including the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913, 
shaped the territory and borders of modern Greece and created a legacy of diversity, despite 
periods of significant population exchange. The historical ebb and flow of Empires and the 
modern emergence of newly independent nation states in the Balkans struggling for territories 
and national identities, brought about ongoing disputes over borders, some of which continue 
today. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  The religious minority:  Muslims in Western Thrace 
</b></p>
<p>11. War between Greece and Turkey between 1919 and 1922 ended with negotiation of 
the 1923 Peace Treaty of Lausanne under which Greece and Turkey conducted a population 
exchange. Greek Orthodox Christians in Turkey, with the exception of those in Istanbul 
(Constantinople), G&#246;k&#231;eada (Imbros) and Bozcaada (Tenedos), were resettled in Greece. 
Muslims in Greece, apart from those in Western Thrace, were resettled in Turkey. According to 
Greek government sources, some 86,000 Muslims remained in Thrace, 39,000 of Turkish 
origin, 35,000 Pomaks (Slav-speaking Muslims), and 12,000 Roma.  
</p>
<p>12. Section III of the Treaty of Lausanne relates to the protection of minorities and establishes 
obligations for both Turkey and Greece for the protection of &#8220;non-Moslem minorities in Turkey 
and &#8220;the Moslem minority&#8221; in Greece. The &#8220;Moslem minority&#8221; is granted certain protections 
with respect to the practice of their religion and to education in their own language. The 
government of Greece continues to rely on the Treaty of Lausanne as the primary basis for its 
policies toward the Muslim minority in Western Thrace. Since the Treaty references only a 
Muslim minority, that is the only officially recognized minority in Greece. The government 
notes that, in addition to the Treaty of Lausanne, members of the minority are beneficiaries of 
numerous nation-wide programs including those on gender equality, equal access to education 
and economic development. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.3 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p><b>Recognition of Turkish ethnicity 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Independent Expert visited Western Thrace bordering Turkey in eastern Greece, 
including the cities of Xanthi and Komotini, where the Muslim minority resides. Many of the 
Muslim minority claim ethnic Turkish identity and desire to be recognized as a Turkish national 
minority. Community members argue that the Treaty of Lausanne does not prohibit collective 
ethnic identification as a Turkish minority. Many consider that their claim is misunderstood by 
the government as reflecting an irredentist movement under the political influence of Turkey.  
</p>
<p>14. The Government highlights that the Muslim minority in Western Thrace is not 
homogeneous and consists of three distinct groups whose members are of Turkish, Pomak and 
Roma ethnicity, each with distinct languages and cultural traditions. While acknowledging the 
Turkish origin of most, they claim that attempts to identify the entire Muslim community as 
Turkish are &#8220;not only unacceptable but [would] not correspond to existing realities and the actual 
composition of the Muslim minority, in accordance with objective criteria.&#8221;<b>3</b> They believe that 
the view of the minority as homogeneous is promoted for political reasons. Government 
representatives noted that its positive efforts to integrate the Muslim minority into Greek society 
are met with criticism from some circles which wish the minority to remain separate and clearly 
promoting their Turkish identity.   
</p>
<p>15. Many community members of Turkish ethnic origin firmly rejected the government 
position of identifying three groups within the Muslim minority. One stating: &#8220;<i>For us being 
Muslim and being Turkish are one and the same.</i>&#8221; However, the Independent Expert met 
individuals who self-identified as Pomak and Roma who described pressure to speak and learn 
Turkish instead of Pomak and to identify as Turkish. One described a climate of intimidation and 
pressure for their children to attend minority schools. Some stated that members of the Pomak 
and Roma community are discriminated against if they do other than describe themselves as 
Turkish. 
</p>
<p>16. Ethnic Turkish representatives state their freedom of association is violated by 
the 1987 Greek High Court decision that an association bearing the name &#8220;Turkish&#8221; must be 
dissolved. Several minority associations have ceased to function or function only informally. In 
February 2005, the Turkish Xanthi Union, established in 1927 was dissolved. The establishment 
of a Cultural Association of Turkish Women of Rodopi was rejected by the Greek Supreme 
Court. Community representatives stress the importance of associations for the preservation of 
community identity and culture. They note that Armenian associations function legally including 
the word &#8220;Armenian&#8221; in their names.  
</p>
<p>17. The European Court on Human Rights has consistently found against Greece when these 
issues have come before it,<b>4</b> concluding that Greece has violated Article 11 of the European 
Convention (right to freedom of association) and rejecting government attempts to justify the

</p>
<p>restriction by arguing that use of the word &#8220;Turkish&#8221; in the names of associations constitutes a 
threat to public order and territorial integrity. To-date, the associations have not been allowed to 
register under the names of their choice. 
</p>
<p><b>Religious practices 
</b></p>
<p>18. Representatives of the Muslim minority asserted that one highly contentious issue in 
Western Thrace is the content of the right to religious freedom protected by the Treaty of 
Lausanne and current international obligations. Under the relevant legislation, Sharia Law 
relating to family and inheritance issues functions alongside Greek civil law in the region. 
Jurisdiction over matters arising under Sharia Law in the above mentioned matters is to be 
exercised by a Mufti. The religious practice for Muslims in Western Thrace has been for the 
community to elect their Mufti.   
</p>
<p>19. The government asserts that, since they exercise judicial functions, Muftis must be 
appointed by the State.<b>5</b> Further, elections of Muftis by the community are invalid since they do 
not allow the participation of women in the electoral process, violating constitutional and 
international standards.  
</p>
<p>20. The Muslim community takes issue with the government appointment of religious officials 
and in defiance, they elect their own. Community elected Muftis in Xanthi and Komotini, in turn, 
are not recognized by the government. Consequently they have been prosecuted under the Penal 
Code for usurping functions of a religious minister. The European Court on Human Rights held 
that those prosecutions violated Article 9 of the Convention (freedom of religion).<b>6</b> Elected 
Muftis are supported financially and allegedly politically by the Turkish government via its 
Consulate in the region.  
</p>
<p>21. Muftis perform particular duties, including those relating to marriage, divorce, child 
support and inheritance. However an official religious marriage can only be conducted by the 
appointed Mufti. Marriages conducted by the elected Mufti are not legally recognized and 
subsequently must be officially registered with the municipality. These issues have created 
resentment among the minority which considers that elected Muftis should have officially 
recognized powers. They consider their religious functions in the community in relation to 
family law are deeply connected to Muslim religion. To refuse them these recognized functions 
is considered an infringement of religious autonomy. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  While the language of the Treaty of Lausanne is vague, an earlier Treaty of Athens details the 
</p>
<p>protection of the religious privileges of Muslims residing in Greece. It includes requirements in 
Article 11 related to the election of Muftis, and the bodies responsible for the management and 
administration of religious foundations. The Greek Government considers that, according to 
Greek case law, the provisions of the Treaty of Athens related to minority protection have been 
superseded by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. A Decree of December 1990 abolished previous 
legal procedures for election of muftis, in favour of government appointment procedures. 
<b>6
</b>  See <i>Agga v. Greece </i>(No. 2), Judgment 17/10/2002, (also No. 3 and No. 4). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.3 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>22. The government notes that, in family and inheritance matters, members of the Muslim 
minority can choose to use Sharia Law or the Greek Civil Code and address themselves to either 
local Muftis or the Greek civil courts. Sharia should be implemented only to the extent that its 
rules are not in conflict with fundamental values of Greek society and the Greek legal and 
constitutional order. In the field of gender equality, Article 5 (3) of Law 1920/1991 provides that 
the courts shall not enforce decisions of the Muftis which are contrary to the Greek Constitution, 
effectively banning polygamy, child marriage, marriage by proxy and biased inheritance laws.  
</p>
<p>23. The Greek National Commission on Human Rights noted cases involving the marriage of 
several minors aged as young as 11 condoned under Sharia Law.<b>7</b> The Greek civil courts were 
found to be ratifying such cases in conflict with Greece&#8217;s international obligations, allegedly 
under pressure not to offend the Muslim minority.   
</p>
<p><b>Education issues 
</b></p>
<p>24. Under of the Treaty of Lausanne, minorities can establish, manage and control schools at 
their own expense providing significant autonomy in minority education.<b>8</b> There are 
194 minority primary schools in Western Thrace with courses taught in both Turkish and Greek. 
Over 400 Muslim teachers are mostly graduates of the Special Pedagogical Academy of 
Thessaloniki. In addition, two minority secondary schools operate in Xanthi and Komotini, while 
two Koranic schools operate in Komotini and Echinos.   
</p>
<p>25. Community representatives claim that the quality of education in minority primary schools 
falls far below Greek public schools and that the schools do not serve the fundamental needs of 
the community. Teaching standards are allegedly poor and training courses for minority teachers 
have been reduced from four years to two, with subsequent lowering of teaching standards. Low 
quality language teaching means that children are not proficient in either Greek or Turkish on 
leaving primary school. Problems have reportedly led some families to prefer their children to 
attend Greek public schools.  
</p>
<p>26. A commonly stated problem is the absence of bilingual kindergartens for the Muslim 
minority. This would allow better knowledge of both Turkish and Greek from an early age 
therefore providing benefits in terms of integration, and enabling greater choice of whether to go 
to minority or Greek public primary school.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  Hellenic Republic National Commission For Human Rights, Report 2006, English Summary,

<p>p. 61.

</b>  Article 40 state that: &#8220;they shall have an equal right to establish, manage and control at their 
</p>
<p>own expense, any charitable, religious and social institutions, any schools and other 
establishments for instruction and education, with the right to use their own language and to 
exercise their own religion freely therein.&#8221; Article 41 additionally establishes that, in towns and 
districts where there is a considerable proportion of Greek nationals belonging to Moslim 
minorities, these minorities shall be assured an equitable share in the enjoyment and application 
of the sums which may be provided out of public funds under the State, municipal or other 
budgets for educational, religious, or charitable purposes. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/11/Add.3 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>27. Elected Muftis and other community representatives commonly voiced dismay 
that 240 Imams or Islamic teachers required to teach the Koran in schools and lead prayers, 
would be appointed by a Committee of five orthodox Greeks with no Muslim members. While 
this law (Bill 3536) has yet to be implemented, they consider this an inappropriate intervention 
in the affairs of the Muslim community and religion.  
</p>
<p>28. The government highlights significant progress in regard to minority education. It is 
systematically improving the content of education with respect to different religions and cultures, 
renewing building infrastructure and equipment, and modernizing the institutional framework. A 
special quota of 0.5 percent for the admission of students from the Muslim minority to 
universities entered into force in 1996 with very positive results. In 1996, 67 students were 
admitted, rising to 495 in 2007/8. Community sources welcomed a quota of 0.5 percent of public 
sector employment for minorities passed into law, but yet to enter into practice. Since 2006, the 
Turkish language has been introduced into Greek public schools in Thrace as an elective 
language.   
</p>
<p><b>B.  Minority religions 
</b></p>
<p>29. The dominant religion in Greece is the Eastern Orthodox Church of Christ, since a large 
majority of the Greek population identify as Christian Orthodox. Article 13 of the Greek 
Constitution provides for freedom of religion. The Independent Expert held a forum in Athens to 
hear the views of people belonging to different religious faiths, attended by representatives of the 
Baha&#8217;i faith, the Catholic Church, the Johova&#8217;s Witnesses, the Jewish Community and Muslims.  
</p>
<p>30. Participants commonly noted the considerable influence of the Greek Orthodox Church 
(GOC) in Greek society and political life and that the Church receives state funding. They stated 
that there is no specific domestic law to protect freedom of religion<b>9</b> and that members of other 
religions face animosity, verbal and sometimes physical aggression. Issues relating to places of 
worship and burial sites were of concern to many participants.  
</p>
<p>31. The Orthodox Church and Judaism are the only religions deemed &#8220;legal persons under 
public law&#8221;. Other religious groups are only able to register as &#8220;associations&#8221;, considered 
inappropriate to their religious status. Legal personality would enable religions to represent 
themselves at court or appropriate authorities as a religious community. Participants stated that 
religious communities should be required to submit their bylaws and function legally and register 
with the Tax office. Religious communities should be exempt from taxation for religious 
activities. They should not require a permit to operate but simply register with the competent

<p><b>9
</b>  Criminal anti-discrimination Law 927/1979, as subsequently amended, has been, until the 
</p>
<p>enactment of Law 3304/2005, the only statutory legislation expressly offering protection from 
religious discrimination in Greece. In addition, there is a substantial body of case-law, in 
particular of the Council of State, that supplements the above legislation in the area of the 
protection of religious discrimination. See http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/ 
fundamental_rights/pdf/aneval/religion_el.pdf. </p>

</p>
<p>32. Participants noted the possibility of a Bill to go before Parliament allowing official 
registration under the Ministry of Education and Religion, which is considered positive if 
enacted. The recent removal of religion from national identity cards is felt to have been an 
important and positive development.  
</p>
<p>33. The Roman Catholic Church is not legally recognized<b>10</b> despite an 
estimated 250,000 Greek Catholics, although the government notes that the matter is under 
review and scheduled for a determination within 2009. The Catholic Cathedral was damaged in 
the 1999 Athens earthquake. Despite financial assistance to other damaged places of worship, no 
assistance has been provided for urgent repairs to the Cathedral. Following a visit to Greece by 
the Pope in 2001, ecumenical dialogue to reunite the churches has more clearly established the 
closeness of Catholics and Greek Orthodox beliefs with subsequent greater acceptance and 
freedom of expression. However problems of underlying prejudice and vocal anti-Catholic 
sentiment including by politicians and religious leaders continue.  
</p>
<p>34. Representatives of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses welcomed progress in regard to treatment of 
conscientious objectors who are now permitted to do non-military national service. However 
they object that the duration is double that of military service. In regard to proselytization, 
previously a crime punishable with a prison sentence, European Court judgments against Greece 
have had significant impact on domestic treatment. It is no longer a criminal offence other than 
in extreme conditions of coercion. However anti-proselytization laws of 1936 and 1939 have not 
been rescinded. Proselytization cases have been rejected by the courts, however participants 
claimed that cases of harassment occur each month on the basis of defunct proselytization laws.  
</p>
<p>35. The Baha&#8217;i faith was established in Greece in 1912 yet lacks official recognition. It does 
not have houses of worship, and requires only administrative structures, yet the law requires 
permission even for a &#8220;meeting place&#8221;. Representatives described undue obstacles and 
restrictions imposed as a form of petty harassment. Baha&#8217;i representatives also highlighted 
problems regarding burial places for Baha&#8217;i. Cemeteries are administered by the Greek Orthodox 
Church and permission must be sought to bury those of other faiths. In one incident, a Bishop 
granted permission but on seeing the gravestone with Baha&#8217;i inscriptions, allegedly threatened to 
destroy the grave. 
</p>
<p>36. The Muslim minority is only officially recognized in Western Thrace, however, over 
recent years large numbers of Muslims have migrated to Greece and settled in other areas where 
they face challenges to religious freedoms. In Athens there are no recognized Mosques and no 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  In December 1997 the European Court of Human Rights ruled<b>10</b> that Greece was in violation 
</p>
<p>of the European Convention since denial of legal personality placed a real restriction on the 
Church to bring complaints to a domestic court. In response, in 1999 Parliament enacted 
legislation that extends legal recognition as a private entity to Roman Catholic churches and 
related entities established prior to 1946. The Catholic Church unsuccessfully has sought 
government recognition of its canon law since 1999. It has also sought unsuccessfully for a legal 
procedure to recognize its religious institutions built after 1946. </p>

</p>
<p>Muslim cemeteries. Mosques function &#8220;underground&#8221; and illegally. They call for the legalization 
of Mosques and note that legislation allowing for a Mosque and Islamic Centre met with strong 
objections from the Greek Orthodox Church and Athens residents. When a Muslim dies the body 
is sent to the country of origin or to Thrace for burial. The Greek Orthodox Church reportedly 
donated land for a Muslim cemetery however progress has been slow.  
</p>
<p>37. Jewish representatives described a dwindling community of only two thousand. A member 
of the Jewish community participating in the Inter-religious forum, described harassment and 
continuing incidents of anti-semitism, which is &#8220;<i>so engrained in society that people don&#8217;t 
recognize it</i>&#8221;.<b>11</b> Incidents of desecration and Anti-Semitic attacks continue to be reported. The 
government notes the success of positive measures to confront Anti-Semitism and prosecute 
criminal acts. Jewish representatives raised concerns over anti-semitic views expressed in the 
extreme right wing press and in mainstream newspapers and by public figures.  
</p>
<p>38. The Greek National Commission on Human Rights notes some successes in religious 
freedoms in the face of opposition from the Greek Orthodox Church. The decision to delete 
references to religion from identity cards was one such controversial decision that the GNCHR 
supported. The Minister of Education and Religion has issued a circular in 2008 stating that 
students from minority religions in public schools who don&#8217;t want to take religion classes, no 
longer have to justify their choice. The GNCHR notes that the issue of the Islamic headscarf has 
not emerged as a problem in Greece.  
</p>
<p>39. The government notes that there is no system of official recognition of particular religions 
in Greece. A fairly large part of the population are atheist or agnostics, on ideological or political 
grounds. It states that acts of animosity towards members of other religions are a fringe 
phenomenon not tolerated both by society at large and the Administration. The government 
highlights a substantial body of case law that supplements legislation in the area of the protection 
from religious discrimination. With respect to burial practices, Article 35 of Law 3448/2006 
permits the cremation of foreigners or Greeks whose religious convictions allow it. An effort to 
map the presence of Muslims nationally has been launched in 2008 by an inter-ministerial Task 
Force to establish a stable and open relationship with the Muslims living in Greece and to cater 
properly to their needs. Law 3512/2006 provides for the construction of a Mosque near the 
center of Athens, funded by the State to be built on a plot of land ceded by the State. Projects for 
the Central Mosque and a Muslim cemetery are progressing slowly due to the size and budgets 
of such projects.   
</p>
<p><b>C.  Ethnic identity in the region of Florina 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Kingdom of Ancient Macedonia is part of the Hellenic historical and cultural heritage, 
reclaimed by modern Greece, and with a population of primarily ethnic Greeks, despite 
linguistic variations due to historical influence. The government points to the archaeological 
sites including Vergina, where tombs of King Phillip II and Alexander IV dating back to

</p>
<p>the 3rd Century BC were unearthed in the 1970s. Artefacts including these tombs display ancient 
Greek inscriptions considered by the government to confirm that the region and its people are 
historically Greek.<b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>41. The Government does not recognize the existence of a Macedonian ethnic minority living 
in Central and West Macedonia. They vehemently deny it and attribute political motives to those 
who claim it. Successive governments have pursued a policy of denial of the ethnic Macedonian 
community and the Macedonian language. Many consider this a modern day version of Tito&#8217;s 
efforts to create a myth of a Macedonian nation giving support to his expansionist claims against 
that region of Greece. The response of earlier Greek governments was to suppress any use of the 
Macedonian language and cultural activities. In recent times the harsh tactics have ceased but 
those identifying as ethnic Macedonian still report discrimination and harassment. They consider 
it of crucial importance for their continued existence that their ethnic identity and distinctiveness 
is respected. The Macedonian language is not recognized, taught, or a language of tuition in 
schools.  
</p>
<p>42. In the 1920s and 30s laws required the replacement of non-Greek names of towns, villages, 
rivers and mountains with Greek names. The family names of the Macedonian-speaking 
population were also required to be changed to Greek names. Individuals seeking to re-instate 
Macedonian family names have had their petitions refused by authorities on administrative 
grounds. Community representatives note that traditional names continue to be in common usage 
and call for reinstatement and the official usage of a dual nomenclature e.g. Florina/Lerin.   
</p>
<p>43. Representatives claim denial of the right to freedom of association, citing unsuccessful 
efforts since 1990 to register the organization &#8220;Home of Macedonian Culture&#8221; in Florina. The 
Greek courts refused to register the organization on the grounds that its objective was to promote 
the idea that &#8220;there is a Macedonian minority in Greece, which is contrary to the national interest 
and subsequently contrary to law&#8221;. In 1998 the European Court of Human Rights found Greece 
in violation of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights<b>13</b> relating to freedom of 
association. Subsequent domestic court decisions have failed to conform to the European Court 
finding and the Home of Macedonian Culture remains unregistered. The government notes that 
the application for registration of the association remains pending before the Supreme Court.  
</p>
<p>44. Community representatives highlight discriminatory laws affecting thousands who fled 
Greece during the Civil War (1946-1949) who were stripped of their citizenship and property. A 
1982 Ministerial Decision (Law no. 106841) stated that &#8220;Free to return to Greece are all Greek 
by Genus who during the civil war of 1946-1949 and because of it have fled abroad as political 
refugees&#8221;. This decision excludes those identifying as ethnic Macedonians and is therefore 
considered discriminatory. Law no. 1540 of 1985 allowed political exiles to reclaim confiscated

include different parts of geographic Macedonia.

<p>property, again establishing that only &#8220;Greeks by Genus&#8221; qualify. Those claiming Macedonian 
identity allegedly experience difficultly obtaining visas for visits to Greece to see relatives or 
attend funerals. The Greek authorities respond that visas are granted without problems and that 
pensioners receive their visas gratis. 
</p>
<p>45. The Independent Expert met numerous individuals identifying as ethnic Macedonian. 
Some described themselves as fluent in the Macedonian language, having learned it within their 
families as it is not taught at school. Others described frustration that they lack fluency due to the 
lack of learning opportunities. They claim to have made numerous approaches to the Greek 
Ministry of Education regarding language education, which have never been acknowledged.   
</p>
<p>46. Some described pressure not to display their Macedonian identity or speak Macedonian, 
previously banned in some villages. Despite their claim of the existence of distinct Macedonian 
villages, they described a general fear to demonstrate their identity. It was acknowledged that the 
situation had improved from a previous era, however they described a &#8220;softer discrimination&#8221; 
manifested in general hostility and pressure on the part of authorities and the media. 
One participant stated: &#8220;<i>I am a Greek citizen&#8230;but I am Macedonian when talking about my 
village, my language and my identity.</i>&#8221; </p>
<p>47. Some recounted personal experiences of harassment including aggressive interrogation at 
borders. Another described being physically attacked allegedly due to his ethnic identity and 
membership of the Rainbow party. Another representative stated: &#8220;<i>Greece does not trust the 
people who live here because they don&#8217;t feel Greek - they don&#8217;t speak Greek</i>&#8221;<i>. </i>Participants 
described experiencing problems in performing songs in the Macedonian language and 
traditional dances. The government states that festivities and cultural events regularly take place 
in the region of Florina unhindered which at times include people from the bordering state.  
</p>
<p>48. The emergence in 1991 of the newly independent State on Greece&#8217;s northern border 
initiated a dispute regarding it&#8217;s name, which Greece considers inappropriate in view of the 
Greek geographical region of Macedonia. The United Nations admitted The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) in 1993. The &#8220;name dispute&#8221;<b>14</b> has resulted in the 
appointment of a Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations, to 
propose solutions in negotiation with both parties. No mutually agreeable solution has been 
achieved to-date. The Independent Expert has no involvement whatsoever in these negotiations.   
</p>
<p>49. Mayors from towns in the region protested the idea that people within their constituencies 
consider there to be a Macedonian ethnicity. The government dismisses such claims as 
misleading and not corresponding to existing realities. The government asserts that Macedonia 
was historically Greek and its inhabitants direct descendants of Ancient Hellenes. It refers only 
to those speaking a &#8220;Slavic dialect or oral idiom&#8221;, confined to family or colloquial use. They 
point out that this dialect has similarities with the language spoken in the neighbouring former

</b>  Security Council Resolutions 817 (1993) and 845 (1993) mention that &#8220;a difference has arisen

<p>Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.<b>15</b> The government emphasizes: &#8220;that there are two and a half 
million Greeks who identify themselves as Macedonians (Makedones) in the regional/cultural 
context and that attempts to usurp the name and national and cultural identity by using the term 
&#8220;Macedonian&#8221; to describe a so-called minority are unacceptable.&#8221;<b>16</b> The government suggests 
that &#8220;insignificant&#8221; numbers of votes gained by the Rainbow political party is evidence of a lack 
of popular support for their claims.   
</p>
<p><b>IV.  DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE ROMA 
</b></p>
<p>50. Discrimination against Roma is experienced in Greece as in other European countries, 
although some Roma are relatively well integrated into society. Community members described 
a high level of societal discrimination in all fields of life including education, housing and 
employment.  
</p>
<p>51. The Government does not consider the Roma a minority within Greece, rather a vulnerable 
social group consisting of 250,000 to 300,000 persons. It notes that this viewpoint is shared by 
Roma who consider themselves an integral part of Greek society. Government officials revealed 
a widely held belief that Roma are responsible for many of the problems that they face. 
One official noted: &#8220;<i>The Greek State would like to integrate Roma fully, but they don&#8217;t like that a 
different style of life is imposed on them.</i>&#8221; 
52. The Independent Expert visited three Roma settlements: near Spata, Aspropyrgos, and in 
the municipality of St. Varvara.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Housing and employment 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Roma settlement near Spata is located on a hill top five kilometers from the town, 
accessible only via a rough track. The community was relocated by the local government in 2000 
after being evicted from a previous location on the outskirts of the town. It is therefore a 
temporary State sponsored settlement on land ceded by the State. Prefabricated housing units 
were provided from the State budget. Currently over 20 families including about 20 children of 
primary school age, live on the site. Unverified claims suggest that the site was previously used 
for disposal of toxic waste.  
</p>
<p>54. The settlement is not serviced with electricity, running water or regular garbage/waste 
collection services. It relies on generators and two water storage tanks provide water for washing 
and drinking. Community members described problems including lack of adequate quantities of 
water and poor water quality due to mould inside the storage tanks. Human waste is stored in 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>15
</b>  The government notes that scholars in international linguistic conferences have sought to 
</p>
<p>avoid confusion caused, by using the term &#8220;Slav Macedonian&#8221; instead of &#8220;Macedonian 
language&#8221;, whenever they refer to the language of the former Yugoslav of Macedonia, in order to 
preserve the distinction of the Macedonian language of the Ancient Macedonians, as well as to 
underline the Slavic character of the language of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

</p>
<p>cess pits that should be cleared frequently. Community members noted that they frequently 
overflow causing health risks including cases of Hepatitis A, while confirming they do have 
access to health care.  
</p>
<p>55. Families are not permitted to extend prefabricated homes provided by the State beyond the 
original 25 square meters, regardless of the number of occupants. Families have no documents to 
establish legal residence in the settlement. Some families (reportedly 3 or 4) had applied to a 
government housing loans scheme for Roma families. However since families survive by 
scavenging, salvaging and begging, it was considered highly unlikely that any would meet 
income criteria. The government subsequently informed the Independent Expert that 
five families have been granted loans of 60,000 Euros each.   
</p>
<p>56. The settlement of Psari, Aspropyrgos is home to approximately 230 Roma families. It is 
considered an illegal settlement on privately owned land despite reportedly existing for about 
35 years. Shacks made from scavenged materials provide one or two room accommodation for 
large families. The settlement lacks access to electricity and requires generators. There is no 
running water and community members fill containers from a water tap in a public park which is 
regularly locked by the municipality to stop Roma from using it. Most Roma in the settlement 
earn irregular incomes from scavenging and collection of scrap metals.  
</p>
<p>57. The settlement is the subject of legal eviction proceedings by private land owners. 
Community representatives claim that land owners have no direct interest in the eviction but are 
pushed to pursue it by the municipal Mayor. Representatives stressed good relationships with the 
police, that they are fair with them and have protected them in the past including from 
demonstrators. The government notes that during implementation of the housing assistance 
program at least 31 loans have been granted to Roma families living in the Municipality of 
Aspropyrgos while others are pending approval.   
</p>
<p>58. The European Roma Rights Center has accused Greece of failing to implement 2004 
and 2006 European Committee of Social Rights findings that Greece&#8217;s treatment of Roma in the 
field of housing violates 3 aspects of the European Social Charter. In June and September 2007, 
civil society groups reported that 135 Roma families were forcibly evicted, some twice in a few 
days, in Athens, Patras and Halkida, without the relevant procedural safeguards being respected 
and that hundreds of Roma families are threatened with similar evictions in Greater Athens, 
Patras, Crete and Rhodes.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>59. The Municipality of St. Varvara, provides a positive example of integration of the Roma 
community into mainstream society. Approximately 8-10 percent of the population are Roma, 
who play an active role in the community. Municipal representatives described the relative 
success of Roma in the community and higher than usual Roma success in education, including 
some university entrants. Roma managed to open numerous small businesses. Local authorities,

<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>17
</b>  On 20 July 2007, the Independent Expert sent a joint letter of allegation to the Government in 
</p>
<p>regard to evictions of Roma minority communities in locations including Patras 
(A/HRC/7/16/Add.1). A reply was received on 22 August 2008 providing further details of the 
situation and actions taken by the government. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.3

</p>
<p>including Roma, described a high level of social integration while acknowledging some 
problems. The Roma live in all parts of the town, rather than in isolated communities. 
Community intermediaries play an important role and the Roma do not require specialized 
services. Roma representatives acknowledged that they had not always felt comfortable but 
described an enlightened neighborhood that is an example to others.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Education 
</b></p>
<p>60. During the visit to the Spata area it was highlighted that none of the children living in the 
Roma settlement currently attend school. Following a visit by European Parliamentarians in 
2003, a bus was provided to take about 18 children to school, however it ceased operation 
reportedly due to lack of funds. The settlement is some five kilometers from the nearest school 
making it extremely difficult for young children to attend without transport provision. One 
mother stated that her children were refused registration, reportedly on the grounds that the 
school was full and there are no special facilities for Roma children. She was told that the 
children should have been registered previously, but she had never been informed of this 
requirement.  
</p>
<p>61. In Psari, Aspropyrgos, education for the settlement&#8217;s children remains a highly 
controversial issue and the subject of a European Court of Human Rights judgment,<b>18</b> In 2004 
Roma children from the Psari, Aspropyrgos Roma settlement were refused registration to attend 
a local school. Following brief attendance, non-Roma parents objected to the extent that all 
Roma children were placed in special afternoon classes. After further parent protests, Roma 
students were removed to a prefabricated annex distant from the main school. In 2006/7 the 
annex was defaced with racist slogans and destroyed by fire and a Roma pupil was attacked 
resulting in withdrawal of Roma children from any classes. In June 2008 the European Court of 
Human Rights ruled that the conditions of school enrolment for Roma children and their 
placement in an annex for special preparatory classes because of their Roma origin, constituted a 
violation of Articles 14 (prohibition of discrimination) in conjunction with article 2 of Protocol 1 
(right to education), and 13 (right to an effective remedy) of the European Convention. To date, 
Greece has not satisfactorily resolved the situation in compliance with the European Court 
ruling. 
</p>
<p>62. The Independent Expert visited the annex which consists of a fenced, concrete, compound 
with two metal prefabricated units, one of which is used for teaching. At the beginning of the 
school year the teaching unit had been repaired following vandalism and had no teaching 
facilities such as desks and chairs. A permanent security presence is required to guard against 
further vandalism. It is important to stress that the vandalism was not carried out by the Roma 
themselves. 
</p>
<p>63. At the time of the Independent Expert&#8217;s visit, Roma children did not have full and equal 
access to education. The Roma children have been placed in the same &#8220;annex&#8221; of the main 
school that was the subject of the European Court judgment, reportedly due to lack of places in

</p>
<p>the main school and lack of specialist teachers and preparatory facilities for Roma. Community 
members and civil society representatives believe that pressure from parents and the local 
authorities, are a significant factor in the children&#8217;s exclusion.  
</p>
<p>64. Ministry of Education representatives acknowledge continuing problems regarding 
education of Roma. They agreed that significant challenges stem from local authorities and from 
communities that do not want the Roma to attend mainstream schools, resulting in some cases in 
&#8220;branches&#8221; of schools being opened for Roma. They noted their belief that a degree of separate 
and specialist &#8220;catch up&#8221; schooling is required prior to Roma children joining the mainstream 
school system, since there is not a culture of going to school among some communities and 
children may need assistance to integrate fully.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Denial of justice 
</b>65. Endemic problems were identified regarding access to justice for Roma by legal and 
human rights groups including, police brutality, discriminatory and racist attitudes and treatment 
by prosecutors, and excessive delays in dealing with cases brought by Roma. Increasing numbers 
of cases have reached the European Court of Human Rights due to the failure of domestic 
remedies. European Court cases in which violations have been found relating to ill-treatment or 
injury by the police, absence of effective investigation and non-investigation of racial motive 
include: Bekos &amp; Koutropoulos vs Greece (application 15250/02), Karagiannopoulos vs Greece 
(application 27850/03), and Petropoulou-Tsakiri vs Greece (application 44803/04).   
</p>
<p>66. Senior Ministry of Justice officials rejected allegations of discrimination and noted that 
police are often falsely accused of discrimination. Government representatives stated that if cases 
of police mistreatment arise they are investigated and dealt with swiftly and appropriately. In 
responding to questions about the lack of Roma prosecutors or judges, they pointed out that 
Roma lawyers could take exams to become prosecutors and judges but that Roma are not 
interested in such achievements.  
</p>
<p><b>D. Integrated action plan regarding Roma under the 
Ministries of the Interior and Education 
</b></p>
<p>67. In 2002 an Integrated Action Plan (IAP) for the social integration of Greek Roma was 
established within a wider National Action Plan for the inclusion of socially vulnerable groups. 
The State has initiated policies and measures, described as &#8220;positive discrimination&#8221; targeted 
towards Greek Roma in housing and service provision. The IAP is coordinated by the Ministry 
of the Interior in collaboration with an Inter-Ministerial Committee.  
</p>
<p>68. The top priority is housing as a means of improving living conditions and combating 
social exclusion. A key component is a housing loans programme providing 9,000 loans 
of 60,000 Euros to Greek Roma currently living in low standard accommodation. Loans are 
provided to purchase or build a property or engage in organized town building in cooperation 
with local authorities. Favorable interest conditions are provided and loans can be repaid 
over 22 years. To-date 8,785 housing loans have been allocated.  
</p>
<p>69. Problems with the housing programme identified by civil society, include: loans can be 
divisive for communities in which many living in similar conditions apply but only few are </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.3 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>successful. No benefits from the scheme accrue to existing Roma settlements and wider 
communities since grants are generally family based. Given the extent of funding, major 
settlement rehabilitation could have been foreseen with benefits to whole communities, including 
purchase of land and provision of numerous low cost housing units. Since most Roma lack 
regular income families may be unable to repay loans with negative implications for the whole 
Roma community. Allegations suggest that a high proportion of loans go to well integrated, 
relatively prosperous Roma.   
</p>
<p>70. The Ministry of Education and Religion highlights that its aim &#8220;is to integrate Gypsy 
children in the existing educational system (without establishing separate classes), to increase 
school attendance in primary and secondary education and to decrease school drop-outs, as well 
as to manage diversity in the classroom&#8221;. A range of measures include: reduced administrative 
requirements for school enrollment; student allowances; educational support and pedagogical 
monitoring including pre-school courses and support classes; a network of mediators; teacher 
training; revised and appropriate education materials to assist Roma and teachers; and projects to 
sensitize local communities. The government acknowledges that some initiatives, including 
itinerant student cards, have failed.  
</p>
<p>71. The Ministry of Labour and Social Protection described planned projects, in consultation 
with Roma, that account for Roma lifestyles, priorities and preferences in employment and 
recognize that Roma rarely have formal qualifications. Recognizing that Roma favor establishing 
small enterprises over salaried employment, a new initiative will support 500 Roma 
entrepreneurs firstly in the Northwest region. Grants of 20,000 Euros will enable small 
businesses in areas including market trading, mobile vending and transport. Vocational training 
initiatives will also provide Roma with remuneration for course attendance in areas including IT, 
cooking, sales, and plumbing. The Ministry acknowledges poor Roma participation in 
employment schemes and the need for targeted projects.   
72. Despite positive initiatives at the national level, problems of local government 
implementation continue. Some commentators noted that government credit lines that could 
benefit the Roma exist but are not taken up by municipalities. Reportedly the Roma bought land 
close to Spata but the Municipality &#8220;revolted&#8221; and did not allow the settlement, allegedly arguing 
that there should not be a Roma settlement on the road to the airport. One commentator noted: 
&#8220;<i>Mayors lose votes by helping Roma ... they don&#8217;t want to give them the conditions that would 
enable them to stay</i>.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>V.  EXCEPTIONAL ISSUES FACING MINORITY WOMEN 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, in its January 2007 
report noted measures taken to enhance integration of minority women into Greek society, but 
&#8220;remains concerned that women from ethnic minority groups, in particular Roma and Muslim 
women, continue to face multiple forms of discrimination with respect to access to education, 
employment and health care.&#8221;<b>19</b> The situation of women within some Roma and Muslim 
communities is cause for particular concern and requires dedicated attention.

</p>
<p>74. Muslim women experience severe inequalities in access to education and consequent 
disproportionately high levels of illiteracy and unemployment. The application of Sharia law in 
some instances subjects Muslim women to norms incompatible with the Greek constitution, 
legislation and international standards, particularly with respect to child marriages. This practice 
evidently continues with serious implications for the health, well being and life choices of 
minority women, but regularly goes un-challenged by Greek authorities. Women brought up in 
the Muslim minority of Turkish heritage not speaking Greek, described being confined to their 
homes and villages with few opportunities for employment or social interaction. Examples were 
given of intimidation against women who attempted to establish women&#8217;s associations. Divorce 
leaves Muslim women particularly vulnerable considering their unequal status to men in regard 
to inheritance under Sharia law. 
</p>
<p>75. Roma women confront multiple grounds of discrimination, as women in Greece, as Roma, 
and as women within their communities. Many live under appalling living conditions while 
exercising an extremely heavy burden of care for children within highly patriarchal family and 
community structures. Young Roma women typically marry and have several children at a very 
early age, reportedly as young as 13.<b>20</b> Child marriage is considered a tradition, but is also a 
consequence of lack of education and alternative opportunities. Girls have particularly high 
school drop out and illiteracy rates, as it is common for them to leave school upon marriage. 
Young Roma women often beg with their children since most men have irregular incomes. 
Reportedly high levels of divorce and domestic violence leave Roma women highly vulnerable 
and subject to abuse with little if any recourse via the justice system. Surveys highlighted by 
civil society groups<b>21</b> undertaken in 2003/4 reveal disturbing trends relating to the general 
and maternal health of Roma women. 40 percent gave birth to their first child at the age 
of 12-16 years and 30 percent of births take place in tents or shacks within Roma settlements.   
</p>
<p><b>VI.  POLITICAL PARTICIPATION OF MINORITIES 
</b></p>
<p>76. In Western Thrace, community representatives highlight that no members of the Muslim 
minority are represented in senior public posts, as public prosecutors, in the police or in the 
judiciary. They claim that, despite the election of two Muslim Members of Parliament in the 
opposition party, no Muslims hold senior posts in ministries. They discussed a lack of trust that 
exists between the minority and the Greek authorities which must be overcome for relations to 
improve.

<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>20
</b>  Many Roma marriages are not legal and not registered, with implications including in regard 
</p>
<p>to the registration of children and fathers.

</p>
<p>77. Political participation of minorities, particularly the Roma community is generally very 
poor. In areas where Roma are well integrated, some Roma do achieve local government office. 
Such cases have demonstrated the positive outcomes achieved when Roma have a role in 
decision making. However Roma are extremely poorly represented even at the Municipal level 
and are unrepresented in National Parliament. ASPIDA-ROM, is a political party established by 
Greek Roma in 2006 to campaign for the rights of the Roma and better representation in 
Parliament and local government.  
</p>
<p>78. Those claiming minority Macedonian identity are represented by the Rainbow political 
party. This party does not have a seat in the national Parliament. The party is active in 
Macedonia and participates freely in Greek political life but has not obtained sufficient support 
to obtain a seat in Parliament. Representatives note difficulties in establishing the party and 
continuing hostility towards it due to its support for political recognition of the Macedonian 
minority in Greece, and the preservation of its culture, language and customs.  
</p>
<p>79. Two members of the Muslim minority are currently in National Parliament both from the 
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) party and actively advocate for the rights of the 
Muslim minority. In 2006 Municipal and Prefectural elections approximately 280 Muslims were 
reportedly elected to municipal and prefectural councils, including as mayors and a vice-prefect. 
The Muslim minority is always represented at the Hellenic Parliament. However representation 
at the most senior government levels has not been achieved. Notwithstanding the woman 
vice-Mufti in Xanthi, women&#8217;s political participation is poor within the Muslim minority. Only 
the male head of households are permitted to vote in community elections for Muftis, which are 
not recognized by the State.  
</p>
<p><b>VII.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Independent Expert notes the history of turbulent inter-State relations, conflict 
and bi-lateral treaties between Greece and her immediate neighbors. Such factors continue 
to exert influence on minority issues in Greece. However, the Independent Expert is 
concerned with matters solely within the domestic jurisdiction of the Greek government 
relating to it&#8217;s treatment of minorities and disadvantaged groups within Greece. This 
report has focused on the degree to which legislation, policy and practice fulfill obligations 
under international human rights law, including minority rights, which take precedent 
over bi-lateral treaties and agreements.   
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Greek government&#8217;s interpretation of the term &#8220;minorities&#8221; is too restrictive to 
meet current standards: it focuses on the historical understanding of &#8220;national minorities&#8221; 
created by the dissolution of empires or agreements concluded at the end of wars; the 
so-called Minority Treaties. This historical paradigm limits the definition to those 
communities identified in specific bi-lateral treaties that may also delineate the obligations 
to the beneficiary community, in some cases tying those benefits to reciprocal 
arrangements for kinship communities in the other state. Treatment of the identified 
minorities, therefore, is a matter of inter-state treaty relations. Greece does not recognize </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/10/11/Add.3 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p><b>the minority status of other communities, stating that those claims are unsubstantiated and 
politically motivated. To some degree, however, the government seems concerned that such 
recognition would <i>ipso facto</i> implicate the foreign policy of the Greek state toward a 
neighboring state. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>One also senses an interest in promoting a singular national identity. This approach 
may leave little room for diversity. It can contribute to a climate in which citizens who wish 
to freely express their ethnic identities face government blockages and in some instances, 
intimidation from other individuals or groups. In the northern part of the country some 
people expressed their view that the term &#8220;minority&#8221; implies &#8220;foreign.&#8221; Some consider 
those who want to identify as a person belonging to a minority ethnic group to be 
conspirators against the interest of the Greek state.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Greece recognizes only one minority, that is the Muslim Religious Minority in 
Western Thrace, which is protected by the terms and protocols of the 1923 Treaty of 
Lausanne which also provides reciprocally for the protection of the Greek Orthodox 
minority living in Turkey. Matters relating to the Muslim minority and the full observance 
and implementation of the Treaty of Lausanne, are handled by the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. While members of the Muslim minority are fully citizens of Greece, Turkey is 
allowed to have a Consulate in the region of Western Thrace and to involve itself in matters 
relating to the Muslim minority relevant to the Treaty of Lausanne. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Greece does not recognize differing ethnic or linguistic minorities, although it 
acknowledges that groups, like the Roma, are disadvantaged or vulnerable groups. So, 
Roma (those who are not Muslims), Muslims who are not from Western Thrace, those who 
claim a Macedonian ethnicity and more recent but settled immigrant communities are 
limited with respect to the full enjoyment of their rights of self-identification and the 
particular enhanced protections that they may be due as minorities. Muslims in Western 
Thrace face limitations on the full enjoyment of their right to have their Turkish ethnicity 
acknowledged. Further, those who identify as belonging to an ethnic Macedonian minority 
face social pressures and a challenge to their motives by the government. Associations have 
been denied registration because their desired name includes the words &#8220;Turkish&#8221; or 
&#8220;Macedonian.&#8221; Their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of association as 
protected under Article 19 and Article 22 of the ICCPR respectively have been infringed. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>In both Western Thrace and the region of Central and West Macedonia, the debate 
over issues of recognized identities has been contentious. Tensions persist and there have 
been credible reports of intimidation.   
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>While noting the historical origins of the Greek government&#8217;s obligations toward the 
Muslim minority in Western Thrace and the political history of the Balkans, the 
Independent Expert urges Greece to consider its obligations with respect to minority 
populations as arising within the post-1945 legal framework of modern human rights 
treaties and jurisprudence based on the principle that protection of human rights and  </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.3 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p><b>fundamental freedoms, including those of persons belonging to minorities, is the 
responsibility of the State in which the persons and/or minority groups reside. These rights 
are universal and are elaborated in multi-lateral treaties and other documents that 
constitute core aspects of human rights law, including minority rights.22 In this regard, 
states should no longer be guided merely by bi-lateral agreements with specific countries, 
although within the context of respect for the rights of non-discrimination and equality 
before the law, bi-lateral arrangements could offer enhanced entitlements over the 
minimum obligations. 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> In the modern paradigm, while minority issues are a legitimate interest of the 
international community, they should not be seen as tied to or implicating specific 
inter-state relations that may threaten the principle of territorial integrity. A 
determination that a certain group should receive the protections due to minorities does 
not carry implications regarding inter-state relations.23 Minorities are constituent groups 
fully within the Greek society - not a foreign element.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The absence of formal recognition by the state of a particular societal group as 
constituting &#8220;a minority&#8221; is not conclusive.24 Rather, the existence of a group to which a 
state owes minority protections is a matter of objective facts and exercise of the right of 
self-identification by persons belonging to the group.25 A number of criteria have been used 
in the past. A distinct shared religion, a language or distinctive dialect, race or ethnicity, 
cultural expressions, or a common national heritage. The Permanent Court of 
International Justice in the <i>Greco-Bulgarian </i>case made reference to a group of people 
&#8220;united in a sentiment of solidarity.&#8221;

<p>89. <b>Further, persons belonging to minority groups also enjoy all other civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights, including the rights to non-discrimination and 
equality before the law. But full protection of those rights is not a substitute for protection 
of their minority rights.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The government should retreat from the dispute over whether there is a Macedonian 
minority or a Turkish minority and place its full focus on protecting the rights to 
self-identification, freedom of expression and freedom of association of those communities. 
The Greek government should comply with the judgments of the European Court on 
Human Rights that associations should be allowed to use the words Macedonian or Turkish 
in their names and to freely express their ethnic identities. Those associations denied in the 
past must be given official registration promptly. Their further rights to minority 
protections must be respected as elaborated in the Declaration on Minorities and the core 
international human rights treaties.  
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The government should guarantee the right to personal security and freedom from 
intimidation or discriminatory actions by private or public actors on the grounds of the 
exercise of their right to self-identification. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The government is commended for the positive practices that it has adopted with 
respect to improving the quality of education available for the Muslim minority in Western 
Thrace, including in minority schools and the guarantee that 0.5% of university entrants - 
a quota which entered into force in 1996 - will be reserved for students from the Muslim 
minority.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Those efforts should be strengthened by providing for bi-lingual instruction in the 
pre-school level, which is now mandatory nationally; by guaranteeing that the quality of 
educational outcomes for those students who choose to go to the minority schools is 
comparable to graduates from the non-minority schools; ensuring that the teaching staff in 
the minority schools have the same training and qualifications as teachers in the 
non-minority schools and that the University of Athens special intervention program to 
upgrade the minority schools in Western Thrace gets sufficient funding. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The government should quickly implement its program of positive measures to 
ensure that 0.5% of all government jobs are filled by persons belonging to the Muslim 
minority. A similar program of positive measures should also be put in place with respect 
to other under-represented groups. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The appointment by government of religious officials, such as Muftis, infringes on the 
right of persons belonging to the Muslim minority to effectively participate in the 
decision-making processes that affect their daily lives. It is also an infringement on freedom 
of religion. On the other hand, it is also not an option to impose Shari&#8217;a Law in a fashion 
that violates the right to equality of women guaranteed in the constitution and under 
international law. Religious leaders should be chosen by their religious communities, but 
must be restricted to religious duties that do not infringe fundamental rights. </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.3

</p>
<p>96. <b>With respect to the Roma population the government is displaying admirable good 
will in developing positive policies coordinated at the inter-Ministerial level through the 
&#8220;Integrated Action Programme on Roma.&#8221; While some of those policies may raise 
questions of viability or appropriateness at a conceptual level, significant problems of 
implementation exist at the local level. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Many Roma remain in squalid living conditions with their children either in 
segregated schools or unable to access educational opportunities due to their identity. 
Roma face severe impediments to their rights to housing and against forced evictions. 
Their access to public services - from public transportation to clean drinking water - is 
denied by discriminatory actions by local officials. Discrimination in employment 
circumscribes their job possibilities to the most menial and dirty in the informal sector. 
The European Court of Human Rights has recently issued judgments against Greece in 
cases where the Court found failures to grant to Roma access to justice as defined by 
international standards and failure to guarantee the right of Roma children not to be 
unlawfully segregated into inferior schools. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The government must ensure that national policies are not subverted or defied by 
local authorities who find it more convenient to be responsive to local prejudices. With 
respect to international legal obligations including rights of non-discrimination and 
equality, domestic constitutional arrangements such as decentralized authority or 
devolution of powers, do not mitigate state responsibility for violations of human rights. 
The government should consider models which recognize the principle of national 
government pre-emption of local authority in matters of compelling state interest such as 
fundamental rights. Alternative models deny funding to non-compliant localities. The 
European Commission against Racism and Intolerance has recommended sanctions &#8220;on 
municipal councilors who make racist remarks or do not comply with the regulations and 
decisions that bind them.&#8221; The government must display a stern political will that localities 
have no option other than to comply with positive national policies. National ministries 
must then effectively monitor implementation on the local level.  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The government must take steps immediately to guarantee that universal standards 
of equality before the law, due process and the right to speedy trials are respected fully 
with regard to Roma defendants and litigants. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The unique issues faced by women from the Roma and the &#8220;Muslim&#8221; minority are 
failing to gain the special focus they require. Roma and Muslim women suffer 
disproportionately high levels of illiteracy and unemployment and are often subjected to 
norms incompatible with the constitution and international standards - like child 
marriages and denial of inheritance rights under Sharia Law. Additionally, gender-based 
violence is not being effectively addressed. Efforts in this regards must be well-grounded in 
a consultative process with the affected women. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Greek civil courts must exercise effective monitoring of Mufti judicial decisions 
to guarantee faithful adherence to the guarantees in constitutional and international 
human rights law. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/10/11/Add.3 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>102. <b>The Government is urged to comply fully with the CEDAW Committee 
recommendation to &#8220;take effective measures to eliminate discrimination against minority 
women, including awareness-raising programmes, to sensitize public opinion at large, and 
particularly the police, on the issue of minority women. It also urges the State party to 
address the forms of discrimination, including with regard to access to education, by 
minority women through its legal, administrative and welfare systems.  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The history of the Greek state and the majority conception of &#8220;the national identity&#8221; 
are tightly intertwined with the Greek Orthodox religion. Minority religions therefore have 
had to struggle to establish and maintain sufficient space for the full exercise of their 
identities in the civic sphere. Recent positive steps have been taken by the government. 
However, issues persist with the erection of houses of worship, burial practices and sites 
and general biases in public attitudes, including incidents of anti-Semitism. Bias also exists 
within the law to the extent that only the Greek Orthodox and the Jewish religions are 
recognized as having distinct legal personality as religious entities. The other religions are 
governed by the laws relating to secular associations giving rise to issues of equality with 
respect to protection of the right to freedom of religion. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The minority religions should be governed by a legal framework that recognizes their 
religious character and grants them legal personality appropriate to that status. All 
religions should have equal recognition under the law. Additionally, the law banning 
proselytizing, which has not had recent application, should be formally revoked.
