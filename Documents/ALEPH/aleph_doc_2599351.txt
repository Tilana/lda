Independent Accountants Review Report
To the Board of Directors
Demand Financial International, Ltd.
Toronto, Ontario, CANADA
We have reviewed the balance sheet of Demand  Financial  International,  Ltd. (a
development  stage  company) as of March 31, 2001 and  December 31, 2000 and the
related statements of operations and cash flows for the three months ended March
31, 2001 and 2000 and the cumulative  amounts from December 31, 1996 (inception)
to March 31, 2001. These statements are the responsibility of management.
We  conducted  our  reviews in  accordance  with  standards  established  by the
American  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants.  A  review  of  interim
financial information consists principally of analytical procedures to financial
data and making  inquiries of persons  responsible  for financial and accounting
matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance
with  generally  accepted  auditing  standards,  the  objective  of which is the
expression of an opinion  regarding the financial  statements  taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material  modifications that should
be made to the aforementioned  financial statements for them to be in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.
The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been presented  assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has not established source
of revenue and this raises  substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a
going  concern.  The financial  statements do not include any  adjustments  that
might result from outcome of this uncertainty.

                                   (Unaudited)
1.       GENERAL
The accompanying  unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in conformity  with the accounting  principles  stated in the audited  financial
statements  for the year ended  December  31, 2001 and  reflect all  adjustments
which are, in the opinion of  management,  necessary for a fair statement of the
financial  position as of March 31, 2001 and the results of  operations  for the
periods presented. These statements have not been audited but have been reviewed
by the Company's independent certified public accountants. The operating results
for the interim periods are not  necessarily  indicative of results for the full
fiscal year.
The notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in the Company's Annual
Report as filed on SEC Form 10-SB for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999
should be read in conjunction with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-QSB.
2.       NOTES PAYABLE
During the quarter  ended March 31, 2001,  the Company  received  various  loans
totaling  $1,644 from a shareholder  in order to pay operating  expenses.  These
promissory notes bear 8% simple interest and are due one year from the date that
the loans were made.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
When  used  in this  Form  10QSB  and in  future  filings  by  Demand  Financial
International,  Ltd. with the Securities and Exchange  Commission,  the words or
phrases  "will  likely  result,"  "management  expects,"  or we  expect,"  "will
continue," "is  anticipated,"  "estimated," or similar  expression or use of the
future tense,  are intended to identify  forward looking  statements  within the
meaning of the Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995.  Readers are
cautioned not to place undue  reliance on any such  forward-looking  statements,
each of which speak only as of the date made.  These  statements  are subject to
risks and  uncertainties,  some of which are  described  below  and  others  are
described  in  other  parts  of this  Form  10QSB.  Actual  results  may  differ
materially  from  historical   earnings  and  those  presently   anticipated  or
projected. We have no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions
that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect anticipated events
or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.
BUSINESS
Demand  Financial  International,  Ltd.,  intends  to  develop a caviar  lounge,
restaurant and piano bar business  situated high a-top famous  skylines in North
America.  Demand  Financial  is a  company  in  the  development  stage.  Demand
Financial  was  incorporated  in the State of Nevada on December 31, 1996.  From
incorporation  until  December  31,  2000,  Demand  Financial  had  no  business
operations of any kind.
We currently do not have capital to implement  the business plan and must obtain
funding.  If we do not receive funding, we will have to discontinue our business
plan. The independent auditors of Demand Financial have issued a qualified audit
opinion that raises  substantial  doubt as to our ability to continue as a going
concern. To fund our operations, we intend to seek either debt or equity capital
or both, or the possibility of a merger with a business with ongoing  profitable
operations, among other things. Until such time as we have adequate funding, the
stockholders,  officers and  directors  have  committed to advance the operating
expenses of the company.
We  have  no  commitments  for  funding  from  unrelated  parties  or any  other
agreements that will provide working capital.  We cannot give any assurance that
we will locate any funding or enter into any  agreements  that will  provide the
required operating capital.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
Our plan is to design and operate a successful,  high-end food and entertainment
chain which  combines a caviar  lounge,  restaurant  and piano bar. As a part of
this plan, we focus on the creation of a  sophisticated  and relaxed  atmosphere
within  well-known   high-rise  towers  in  major  cities  offering  dining  and
entertainment for professionals from businesses and high-end social communities.
We are currently  searching for a suitable  location for our first  operation in
the Toronto, Canada area. Our intent is to find a location in close proximity to
the financial  community.  If our initial  operation is  successful,  we plan to
expand into other large cities such as New York City,  Los Angeles,  Chicago and
Houston.  The  goal of our  establishments  will be the  creation  an  exclusive
environment  in which our  customers  may  conduct  business  meetings or simply
relax.  We intend for the  establishments  to be  upscale,  the  products of the
highest quality, and the service exemplary.
Our products will focus on a selection of high quality  caviar,  fresh  seafood,
vintage wines,  quality liquors and liqueurs,  a skyline view and piano bar. Our
intent is to earn a reputation as a premier cosmopolitan  restaurant and lounge.
Our sources of revenues principally will be from food and beverage sales.

PRODUCTS
We plan to offer  caviar as our  featured  item.  Our menu  will also  include a
high-quality  selection  of fresh  shellfish  and seafood,  gourmet  sandwiches,
salads, hors de oeuvres, and a variety of meals with a light and healthy appeal.
We will also  offer an  extensive  wine list and a  collection  of fine  cognac,
scotch and exclusive liqueurs.
We  believe  that  featuring  caviar is ideal for many  reasons.  First,  caviar
appeals to many  up-scale  consumers  who  appreciate  its quality and enjoy the
social  status it has  acquired.  Second,  caviar is rapidly  becoming a popular
consumer product.  Third,  caviar can be enjoyed alone as an appetizer or can be
incorporated into a fine meal.  Finally, a large percentage of today's consumers
have a preference for lighter, healthy foods instead of heavy dining. We believe
that today's restaurant patron prefers quality to quantity.
Our  management  and staff will be committed to providing our clientele  with an
exceptional level of service and professionalism.
We believe  that there will be an ample  supply of the products we plan to offer
in each of the cities that we have targeted for expansion.
MARKETING
The strategy behind our marketing  program will be to create consumer  awareness
of our establishments.  We plan to focus on a clientele with a preference for an
upscale social environment,  and quality products and services. To generate this
awareness we intend to devote a great deal of attention  to the  atmosphere  and
the  decor of the  facilities.  Attention  to  details,  including  the style of
furniture,  the artwork,  the  interior  design and the indoor  waterfall,  will
enable us to create an overall relaxing environment for our clientele.  The main
attraction of our  restaurant/lounge is intended to be the experience it offers;
extraordinary views of the city,  ambience,  and unique cuisine. We believe that
the location  with  accompanying  views is an integral  part of  attracting  the
patrons we are targeting.
Advertising will be the significant ingredient of our marketing program and will
initially  be focused in the  greater  metropolitan  area in which the lounge is
located.  Thereafter,  we plan to expand  the  awareness  marketing  to  defined
segments such as business  travelers and high-end  vacationers.  Our advertising
plan includes  utilizing radio,  television,  print, bulk mailings and any other
form of advertising  that we believe will create consumer  awareness that we are
seeking.  We also  intend to contact  other  media  outlets  such as  magazines,
newspapers,  television  programs and travel guides to obtain  exposure  through
food and restaurant reviews.
Many of our  marketing  plans have been  successfully  used in the past by other
restaurant/lounge establishments; however, there is no assurance that we will be
able to use them successfully to create the clientele base we are targeting.
COMPETITION
The  hospitality  industry  is very  competitive.  All over  North  America  new
restaurants open up on a daily basis.  Our goal is to offer something  different
and exciting for up-scale  consumers.  There are several factors that will allow
us to obtain our goal. First will be the extraordinary view each restaurant will
offer  from high  a-top  office  towers.  This  offers an  advantage,  as 99% of
restaurants  are  located  on  ground  level.  The  second  factor  is our  menu
selections  which will be different,  light and refreshing.  The third factor is
our service, which must be exemplary. All service personnel must treat the guest
with hospitality.  The fourth key factor is the atmosphere. Our atmosphere focal
point will be the piano and lounge.  From  classical to jazz greats,  we believe
live music will lift the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Other  enhancements will
include an indoor waterfall, comfortable seating, specialized lighting, and fine
art. We believe  that  setting a new trend for the  high-end  niche  market will
allow us to differentiate ourselves from other high-end restaurants.
Our ability to compete  will be dependant on the level of quality and service we
provide for our  consumers.  There can be no assurances  that we will be able to
accomplish our goals or compete on a profitable basis within our target market.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION
OVERALL OPERATING RESULTS:
We had no revenues for the quarter  ended March 31, 2001 or since our  inception
(December 31, 1996).
Operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 were $11,800 as compared
to $0 for the prior  year  quarter.  In  January  2001 we  incurred  $9,000  for
consulting services rendered by our current president and chairman of the board,
Mr. Mitchell Geisler.  Mr. Geisler received 9,000,000 shares of our common stock
(90% of our current issued and outstanding  shares) for these services.  We also
incurred  $1,200 for legal and accounting  services  rendered in connection with
the filing of Form 10-SB with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.  Other
operating  expenses amounted to $1,600 and were incurred for supplies and filing
fees.
We have incurred a cumulative net loss since inception of $16,800.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:
We do not currently  have any working  capital with which we can fund our future
operations.  Our  auditors  have  issued a  going-concern  opinion  that  raises
substantial doubt as to our ability to continue operations. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to continue our operations without adequate funding.  We do
not have any assets.  Our total  liabilities  were $2,800 as of March 31,  2001.
Total stockholders' deficit at March 31, 2001 was $2,800.
PLAN OF OPERATION
We plan to seek capital to fund our  operations  through a private  placement of
our  securities.  We may also  seek  acquisition  or merger  opportunities  with
operating companies. We have not identified or pursued any potential acquisition
or merger  prospects at this time. We estimate  that we will need  approximately
$1,000,000  to fund our  operations  and  implement our business plan during the
first year. We have no financing  commitments  or  acquisition  arrangements  or
prospects  at this  time.  We  anticipate  needing  capital  for  the  following
purposes:
We believe that the average  start-up costs for a restaurant  ranges from $80 to
$125 per square foot.  As we are  targeting  the high-end  market,  an exclusive
location,  and classic,  upscale decor, we have budgeted start-up costs based on
$200 per square foot. Our budget includes all costs  associated with the design,
architecture,   engineering,  contracting,  legal  fees,  restaurant  equipment,
assets, fixtures, initial staff training and salaries, and primary inventory.
Initial marketing and promotion                                       $ 50,000
Start-up costs (based on a budget of $200 per square foot)             600,000
Initial cash outflow (based on 3 pay periods)                          115,000
First and last, plus 3 additional months of lease payments*             93,750
Contingency funds for working capital                                  141,250
                                                                    ----------
Total                                                               $1,000,000
* Property Lease Payments are based on a premium of $75, Gross, per Square Foot
We  believe  that we will  require  additional  financing  (over  and  above the
aforementioned financing) in the future for the funding of expansions into other
cities.  We cannot  assure you that we will be  successful in raising any of the
capital needed to fund our operations.
Once we open one or more locations, we anticipate generating sufficient revenues
with which we will be able to cover operating  costs. To the extent our revenues
exceed  operating  costs, we will use these funds for business  expansion.  Many
restaurants  are not profitable for a considerable  time after their opening and
many restaurants fail within the first and second year after opening.  We cannot
give any assurances  that our lounge and food format will attract  customers who
spend an amount that will cover expenses or provide a profit on operations.  The
owning and  operating  of  restaurants  is  considered  a risky  enterprise  and
investment returns are often significantly less than in other investments.

EMPLOYEES
Currently we employ one person on a part time basis. Mr. Geisler is working on a
gratis  basis while the  company is in the  development  stage.  At the onset of
building the restaurant, it is expected Demand Financial will hire two full-time
employees.  One will  help  oversee  the  construction  and  building  phase and
initiate  pre-employment  needs,  while the  second,  a head  chef,  will  begin
preparation of the  operation's  menu and recipes.  When the restaurant is ready
for  opening,  we  anticipate  employing  between  15 and 20 full and  part-time
hospitality  staff and management  associates.  We will also need accounting and
general administrative personnel.
DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES
The offices of the company are located at 141 Adelaide Street West,  Suite 1004,
Toronto, Ontario, M5H 3L5. The telephone number is 416-428-5647.
Pursuant to an oral  agreement,  we are entitled to use office  space  otherwise
provided to our executive officer. In addition,  we are provided office services
as may be  required  from time to time.  We do not pay any amount for the office
space or services.  Any costs of this office are  considered  immaterial  to the
financial  statements and  accordingly  are not reflected.  We believe that this
facility is adequate to meet our corporate needs in the foreseeable future.
We believe each Demand  Financial caviar lounge and restaurant will be comprised
of  approximately  3,000 square feet in a high-rise  building  with  appropriate
views, and include a piano bar and indoor waterfall as the main  centerpieces as
well as a kitchen and comfortable  seating. We cannot assure you that we will be
able to locate suitable restaurant space that meets our business plan.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
We have adopted FASB  Statement 128. It is not expected that we will be impacted
by other recently  issued  standards.  FASB Statement 128 presents new standards
for  computing  and  presenting  earnings  per share  (EPS).  The  Statement  is
effective for financial  statements  for both interim and annual  periods ending
after December 15, 1997.
FASB  Statement  131 presents  news  standards  for  disclosures  about  segment
reporting.  We do not believe that this accounting standard applies to us as all
of our operations are  integrated  for financial  reporting and  decision-making
purposes.
INFLATION
The  Company's  results of  operations  have not been  affected by inflation and
management  does  not  expect  inflation  to have a  significant  effect  on its
operations in the future.
