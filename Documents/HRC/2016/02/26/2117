women&#8223;s political participation. This area requires investment. Recognizing the importance 
of strengthening the rule of law, Governments spend a significant amount on legal and 
judicial development and human rights. However, targeted funding for gender equality 
remains low, and gender budgeting initiatives are primarily focused on providing financial 
resources within State institutions.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 15/23. 
In section II, the Working Group summarizes its activities since its last report to the Human 
Rights Council up until 26 March 2012. In section III it addresses the topic of eliminating 
discrimination against women in political and public life with a focus on political transition.  
</p>
<p>2. For the preparation of this report, the Working Group has availed itself of a wealth 
of information elicited through various means. In December 2011, it circulated a 
questionnaire to Governments requesting information highlighting legislative and policy 
reforms for the advancement of women&#8223;s rights and gender equality in times of political 
</p>
<p>transition, and received 57 replies. It received inputs from various stakeholders, including 
the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-
Women), non-governmental organizations and academic experts. Five regional background 
papers and a global summary were commissioned to further help inform the report. The 
Working Group wishes to express gratitude to States and other stakeholders for the 
information provided and will make the materials publically available on its website 
(www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/WGWomen/Pages/WGWomenIndex.aspx).  
</p>
<p>3. On the basis of this information, the Working Group has identified good practices 
that will contribute to the compendium of good practices mandated in paragraph 18 (b) of 
Human Rights Council resolution 15/23. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Sessions 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Working Group held three sessions during the reporting period. At its fourth 
session (23&#8211;27 July 2012), it engaged with a number of stakeholders, including UN-
Women, relevant parts of the United Nations Secretariat and other experts on various issues 
related to women in public and political life. It also exchanged views with the Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on, inter alia, ways to ensure close 
coordination, avoid duplication and strengthen information exchange between the two 
mechanisms. At its fifth session (1&#8211;5 October 2012), the Working Group continued to 
exchange views with experts, focusing on region-specific information. It also met with 
Member States to seek views on different legal systems and their integration into its work. 
At its sixth session (14&#8211;<footnote name="1">0. From 17 to 19 April 2012, the Chairperson of the Working Group attended a 
meeting in Addis Ababa on gender and enforced disappearances convened to inform a draft 
general comment by the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances.  
</footnote>8 January 2013), the Working Group consolidated the regional 
and global information gathered to inform the present report.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>

<p><b> C. Communications and press releases  
</b></p>
<p>7. Communications sent to Governments during the reporting period, either 
individually or jointly with other mandates, concerned a wide array of issues falling within 
its mandate.1 These included, for example, allegations of violence against women in the 
context of protests, cases of women sentenced to death by stoning for adultery, and cases of 
women and girls allegedly victim of forced religious conversion and forced marriage. The 
Working Group also sent communications in relation to draft constitutions.  
</p>
<p>8. The Working Group issued press statements, either individually or jointly with other 
mandate holders, on, inter alia, gender equality provisions in draft constitutions, on the 
criminalization of adultery whose enforcement leads to discrimination and violence against 
women, and at various occasions, such as for the first International Day of the Girl Child 
and for International Women&#8223;s Day.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Commission on the Status of Women  
</b></p>
<p>9. On 11 March 2013, the Vice-Chairperson of the Working Group addressed the 
Commission on the Status of Women at its fifty-seventh session, during an interactive 
dialogue between the Commission and special procedures mandate holders. Her statement 
focused on violence against women as a cross-cutting issue in the four thematic areas the 
Working Group has established as its conceptual framework.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Other activities 
</b></p>

<p>in the protection of women&#8223;s and girls&#8223; human rights (Amman, 4&#8211;7 November 2012), and 
side events during the fifty-seventh session of the Commission on the Status of Women.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Thematic analysis: eliminating discrimination against women 
in political and public life with a focus on political transition 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International and regional context 
</b></p>
<p>14. In 1981, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women (the Convention) entered into force. Article 7 of the Convention articulates 
women&#8223;s right to equal participation in political and public life as encompassing the right to 
</p>
<p>vote in all elections and public referenda and to be eligible for election to all publicly 
elected bodies; to participate in the formulation of government policy and the 
implementation thereof and to hold public office and perform all public functions at all 
levels of government; and to participate in non-governmental organizations and 
associations concerned with the public and political life of the country. Article 8, in 
addition, refers to State obligations to take all appropriate measures to ensure to women, on 
equal terms with men and without any discrimination, the opportunity to represent their 
Governments at the international level and to participate in the work of international 
organizations. The Convention thus specified and expanded the State obligations set out 
under articles 2, 3 and 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which 
require a guarantee of the equal right to take part in the conduct of public affairs, including 
direct participation as well as participation through freely chosen representatives. 
</p>
<p>15. Since the introduction of the Convention, the world&#8223;s political landscape has gone 
through substantial changes. These have been marked, variously in different regions and 
States, by the dismantling of long-standing totalitarian regimes, democratization and the 
emergence of new forms of authoritarianism. This period has also witnessed armed 
conflicts both between and within States, the creation of refugee populations and 
international involvement in conflict resolution and peacebuilding. Technological leaps in 
the field of information and communications, particularly the Internet, have created a new 
public and political space, with revolutionary impact on the development and the exercise 
of human rights, allowing new forms of political expression and mobilization, and 
facilitating political communication and organization for men and women globally.2 
</p>
<p>16. At the same time, international commitment to fulfilling women&#8223;s equal right to 
political participation has grown substantially. The 1993 World Conference on Human 
Rights and its outcome document, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 
whose twentieth anniversary is being commemorated in 2013, gave recognition to women&#8223;s 
rights as human rights. In 1995, the Fourth World Conference on Women and its outcome 
document, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, became the catalyst for 
governments around the world to introduce special measures, such as quotas for women&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>political representation, and propelled the doubling of the global average of such 
representation in less than two decades.3 Further, the Security Council made an historic 
breakthrough in 2000 when it adopted its resolution 1325 (2000), with a view to enhancing 
the role of women and the gender perspective in conflict resolution and peacebuilding. 
</p>

<p>17. Yet, despite decades of efforts, the Working Group notes that, in 2012, the General 
Assembly expressed its concern at the reality that women in every part of the world 
continued to be largely marginalized from the political sphere and saw it necessary to again 
dedicate a resolution to promote women&#8223;s political participation.4 In 2012, the Committee 
on Women&#8223;s Rights and Gender Equality of the European Parliament indicated its alarm at 
the underrepresentation of women in the European Union legislative council and leadership 
positions, and at the stagnation of women&#8223;s representation at one third or less in parliaments 
across the region.5 In 2011, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) 
reported on the &#8220;inequitable and sluggish&#8221; progress made in women&#8223;s political 
</p>
<p>representation at different levels of government in the Americas.6 In 2012, the World Bank 
found that in the Asia-Pacific region, rapid growth and economic development, with the 
highest female labour force participation rate in the developing world, have not been 
enough to attain gender equality, including in the area of political agency and 
representation.7  
</p>
<p><b> B. </b>Targets and achievements in women&#8217;s representation<b> 
</b></p>
<p>18. General recommendation No. 23 (1997) of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women refers to political and public life as encompassing the 
exercise of legislative, judicial, executive and administrative powers; covering all aspects of 
public administration and the formulation and implementation of policy at the international, 
national, regional and local levels; and including civil society, such as public boards and 
local councils and the activities of organizations such as political parties, trade unions, 
professional or industry associations, women&#8223;s organizations, community-based 
organizations and other organizations concerned with public and political life (para. 5). The 
Beijing Platform for Action, in its paragraph 182, referred to the scant progress made 
towards achieving by 1995 the 30 per cent target for women in decision-making positions. 
Global progress in achieving the goals for women&#8223;s political representation set by the 
</p>
<p>international community continues to be excruciatingly slow and is far from being met 18 
years after the target date.  
</p>
<p>19. In the legislative branch, the current global average of women in national 
parliaments is 20 per cent.8 While this achievement marks a first in history, the climb has 
been slow, revealing a global average increase of less than 1 per cent per year.9 Only 33 
countries out of 149 have national parliaments where women constitute 30 per cent or more 
of the members.10 With parity as the ultimate measure of equality, then a mere two 
countries have reached this point. Furthermore, there are wide divergences among States, 
with women accounting for less than 10 per cent of representatives in 45 States.

</p>

<p>20. The right to representation in the legislative branch includes the right to vote in all 
elections and public referenda. This condition has gradually been fulfilled during the course 
of the twentieth century and is now almost universally implemented. Nevertheless there 
remain some discriminatory laws and practices, such as kinship voting practices. In one 
State, women have still have not been granted the right to vote.  
</p>
<p>21. In the executive branch, only 17 women are Heads of State/Government.11 Women&#8223;s 
representation in Governments is far lower than their representation in parliaments. Good 
practice where women occupy more than 40 per cent of Government positions were found 
in only a small number of States: six in the region of Western European and other States, 
two in sub-Saharan Africa and three in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Working 
Group notes that the obligation of States to secure women&#8223;s equal representation includes 
the executive branch, and draws attention to the good practice in different regions which 
has demonstrated the feasibility of female-headed States and gender-balanced 
Governments.  
</p>
<p>22. In the judicial branch, women account for only 27 per cent of judges worldwide.12 
There is wide divergence among States as regards the numbers of women in the judiciary, 
with some States in the Eastern European region having a majority of women judges. Even 
in countries that have a higher representation of women in the judiciary, the numbers of 
women decrease at higher levels. There are few women in the highest courts, including 
supreme courts, and rarely are the presidents women. In most religious courts women are 
excluded from holding office. There is, however, good practice in the Asia-Pacific region: 
in one country, women judges have been part of the religious courts since the institution 
was created in the 1950s, reaching a participation rate of 20 per cent in 2011;13 in another, 
female judges were appointed to the Sharia court pursuant to the removal of its reservation 
to article 7 (b) of the Convention.14 
</p>
<p>23. In other public bodies<b> </b>there is no systematic data regarding women&#8223;s representation 
which covers the whole spectrum of political and public life as defined by the Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women: public administration, local 
government, political parties, trade unions, professional or industry associations, women&#8223;s 
organizations, community-based organizations and other organizations concerned with 
public and political life.  
</p>
<p>24. Within the United Nations system, the Secretary-General set a target, endorsed in 
the Beijing Platform for Action, of 50 per cent of managerial and decision-making positions 
for women by 2000. Gender parity was achieved at the lowest two levels (P1 and P2) in 
2011; the percentage of women at the professional levels was 40.7; but only 27.4 to 30.2 
per cent at the highest decision-making levels (D-1, D-2 and Under-Secretary-General).15

The category of Under-Secretary-General also includes Assistant Secretary-General positions. </p>


<p>25. In peacebuilding processes, studies made a decade after the adoption of Security 
Council resolution 1325 (2000) show that only 16 per cent of 585 peace agreements 
referenced women.16  
</p>
<p>26. The focus of the Working Group on political transition has been carried out through 
its communications, country visits and regional and global expert input. Experience in 
countries in transition has varied greatly. In the Russian Federation and Eastern Europe 
during the 1990s, as in some of the recent political transitions in the Middle East and North 
Africa, there was backsliding on key gains for gender equality and/or the numerical 
representation of women was reduced. In contrast, in some political transitions in various 
countries in many regions, the introduction of quotas facilitated a significant rise in 
representation of women, producing, for instance in sub-Saharan Africa, some of the 
highest percentages of women members of parliament. Good practice in these States 
included the active engagement with the international community in the peacebuilding 
process and an emphasis on democracy, human rights and women&#8223;s rights as human rights.  
</p>
<p>27. The Working Group observes that the impact of political transitions on gender 
equality in public and political life is inherently related not only to the nature of regime 
change but also to the political will of the incoming Government to guarantee women&#8223;s 
human rights, including the right to equal representation, and requires a responsive political 
leadership with respect to gender equality concerns, including as raised by autonomous 
women&#8223;s movements. The Working Group notes the urgency for women&#8223;s equal and full 
</p>
<p>participation in peace negotiations and in decision-making in all transitional authorities, 
mechanisms and processes.   
</p>
<p>28. The Working Group is concerned that the knowledge gap remains on the whole 
spectrum of women&#8223;s participation in political and public life. This undermines the capacity 
to move to gender-responsive inclusive democracy, development and peace. Most available 
data is not sufficiently disaggregated to allow the understanding of the intersectionality of 
gender with other grounds of discrimination, in the light of Committee on the Elimination 
of Discrimination against Women general recommendation No. 28 (2010) according to 
which &#8220;discrimination against women based on sex and gender is inextricably linked with 
other factors that affect women, such as race, ethnicity, religion or belief, health, status, 
age, class, caste and sexual orientation and gender identity&#8221; (para. 18). Evidence-based 
knowledge is weak on the extent of violence against women in political and public life and 
its impact on women&#8223;s capacity to exercise their right to political participation.  
</p>
<p><b> C. </b>Women&#8217;s political participation, democracy and human rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>29. Democracy and human rights are mutually reinforcing. Women&#8223;s rights are human 
rights and hence are an integral element of the democracy and human rights axis. The 
General Assembly, in its resolution 59/201 (para. 1), declared the &#8220;essential elements of 
democracy&#8221; to consist of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, 
freedom of association and peaceful assembly and of expression and opinion; the right to 
take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives; 
to vote and to be a candidate in free elections by universal and equal suffrage; a pluralistic 
system of political parties and organizations; respect for the rule of law; the separation of 
powers; the independence of the judiciary; transparency and accountability in public 
administration; and free, independent and pluralistic media.

</p>
<p>and agreements&#8221; (Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, March 2011), p. 7. </p>


<p>30. These essential elements of democracy are a necessary condition for women&#8223;s 
substantive equality in public and political life. The Working Group would like to 
emphasize that there can be no true democracy without women&#8223;s full and equal 
participation in all its institutions and that women&#8223;s substantive equality in political and 
</p>
<p>public life can be fully realized only in conditions of democracy. 
</p>
<p>31. There is growing recognition of the Internet as a key means by which individuals 
can exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression (A/HRC/17/27, para. 20). 
Through initiatives on e-government and e-democracy and the innovative use of 
information and communications technologies (ICTs) by civil society, there is also a rising 
awareness of the Internet&#8223;s role in expanding the concept of citizenship online. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group welcomes the work by the International Telecommunication Union, the 
World Bank and civil society organizations, and encourages them to continue such work so 
as to deepen the knowledge on gender differences in the use of the Internet and other ICTs. 
</p>
<p>32. Political transitions present an opportunity for States to democratize and to advance 
women&#8223;s equal representation in the reformed State institutions. However, they can also 
pose a danger of undermining or reversing human rights and women&#8223;s gains in public and 
</p>
<p>political life achieved under the previous regime. In some political transitions, women who 
had been pro-democracy activists have been excluded from formal political processes 
negotiating the new division of power. 
</p>
<p>33. The conflict and post-conflict experience leads to an increased awareness of the 
different conditions of States, including weak, fragile, failed and/or hybrid States, and an 
increasing focus on State-building processes. State-building is understood as &#8220;purposeful 
action to develop the capacity, institutions and legitimacy of the state in relation to an 
effective political process for negotiating the mutual demands between state and societal 
groups&#8221;.17 Such processes reveal the complex and critical roles and relations of State and 
non-State actors in the renegotiation of the balance of power, the allocation of resources 
and entitlements, and the formation of the identity of whole nations. Contestations over 
national identity are heightened during times of political change and present new 
vulnerabilities for those women whose values, roles and behaviours do not fit the power 
elite&#8223;s idealized imagery of womanhood. Where identity politics are predominant, women&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>movements defending universal standards of gender equality risk marginalization and 
stigmatization, especially when such standards are characterized as unwanted external 
influence and a source of threat.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. W</b>omen&#8217;s equal enjoyment of fundamental freedoms and human rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>34. For women to have the capacity to participate in political and public life on equal 
footing with men, including to build autonomous movements for their own empowerment, 
they must be able to exercise their rights to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, 
expression, movement and association. It is imperative to recognize and secure these rights 
as individual rights for women&#8223;s effective participation in political and public life, in the 
light of the complex tensions between collective rights and women&#8223;s rights.  
</p>
<p>35. Women&#8223;s right to enjoy their cultural rights as equals is an integral part of their right 
to participation in political and public life. In the light of the persistent use of cultural and 
traditional values to justify resistance to women&#8223;s political and public roles, women&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>capacity for equal participation depends on their autonomous agency regarding cultural life. 
As articulated by the Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, this involves:

offprint, p. 14. </p>


<p>The freedom to create new communities of shared cultural values around any 
markers of identity they want to privilege, new cultural meanings and practices 
without fear of punitive actions, including any form of violence. This means that 
women must be able to embrace or reject particular cultural practices and identities 
as well as to revise and (re)negotiate existing traditions, values or practices, 
regardless of their provenance. Active engagement in the cultural sphere &#8230; helps to 
build central traits of democratic citizenship.18 </p>
<p>36. In times of political transition when political life is highly volatile and polarized, 
women&#8223;s equal and full participation in political and public life depends on the effective 
</p>
<p>protection of their fundamental freedoms and human rights, particularly those mentioned 
above. National human rights institutions (NHRIs) and other independent monitoring 
bodies play a particularly crucial role for women during these times.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Integration of women in public and political institutions  
</b></p>
<p>37. The participation of women in public and political institutions is crucial for their 
equality in citizenship and for empowering them to have an impact on and integrate a 
gender perspective into policy and decision-making.  
</p>
<p>38. Special measures, including quotas for women and other temporary measures, as 
required under article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention and general recommendations No. 
23 (1997) and No. 25 (2004) of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women, are necessary to achieve equality between men and women in political and public 
life, in order to contend with the underlying structural disadvantaging of women. The most 
significant increase in the numbers of women in national parliaments over the years has 
occurred in countries where special measures, such as gender quotas, have been effectively 
constructed and implemented. The use of quotas to advance women&#8223;s political 
</p>
<p>representation and participation has increased in the past three decades and produced 
significant results when properly adapted to specific electoral and political systems.  
</p>
<p>39. Many of the quota systems were adopted as part of the rebuilding of political 
systems and institutions after years of conflict and/or authoritarianism.19 Quotas work best 
when accompanied by sanctions and closely monitored by gender-responsive independent 
bodies, including national electoral bodies and human rights institutions. Research has 
shown that, in general, women&#8223;s chances of winning seats in parliamentary elections 
increase in proportional representation systems.20 
</p>
<p>40. Quotas introduced at the local level are rare but important for equality outcomes on 
the ground. In one country in South Asia, for example, a constitutional amendment 
mandated the representation of women, reserving one third of the seats within each council 
and women taking one third of the leadership positions as head.21 Research has shown that 
after a decade of implementation, women are more likely to stand for, and win, elected

</p>
<p>Programme (UNDP) initiative, one third of the countries that have achieved percentages of 33 per 
cent or higher in women&#8223;s representation in national parliaments are considered countries in transition 
(see DFID and IDRC, summary (footnote 9), p. 3).

</p>

<p>positions in councils.22 The requirement of female leadership changes voter attitudes and 
improves perceptions of female leadership effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>41. Effective political participation of women requires not only admission to political 
institutions but also integration into their decision-making forums. Women&#8223;s full 
participation requires concerted action to overcome the de facto segregation of women&#8223;s 
political participation in sectors which are stereotypically associated with women&#8223;s gender 
</p>
<p>roles. It requires that women be integrated into positions with decision-making power 
across the spectrum of issues dealt with by the institutions to which they have been elected 
or appointed. During political transitions, the same applies to all transitional authorities and 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>42. The Working Group welcomes a general trend in recent years to extend special 
measures or positive action to other areas of public life beyond legislative bodies. Positive 
action encompasses actions to promote women&#8223;s participation in public life by such tools as 
media campaigns and training opportunities, which are not legally binding quotas, and new 
generation transformative measures setting out an overriding objective of equal power of 
women and men to shape society and their own lives.23  
</p>
<p>43. The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), in its 2013 Plan of Action for Gender-
sensitive Parliaments, has drawn attention to the need for gender sensitivity in the 
composition, structures, operations, methods and work of parliaments. In the plan, it noted 
that &#8220;gender-sensitive parliaments remove the barriers to women&#8223;s full participation and 
offer a positive example or model to society at large&#8221; (p. 8). The Working Group considers 
the IPU plan of action to be adaptable for other public and political institutions in which 
women&#8223;s equal representation must be secured. 
</p>
<p>44. The election and appointment of women to public and political office is a necessary 
condition for equality in public and political life, but the number of women in office is 
insufficient for advancing gender equality in society. Evidence shows that women who are 
appointed or elected to public office do not necessarily promote gender-equality agendas. 
Policy outcomes that advance substantive equality between men and women involve larger 
processes of public debate, alliance-building across political divides, and activism by 
autonomous women&#8223;s movements based on universal standards of equality, non-
discrimination, human rights and inclusive democracy. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. </b>Women&#8217;s <b>agency and autonomous movements 
</b></p>
<p>45. The whole spectrum of women&#8223;s engagement and activism in political and public 
life, through all State institutions, the wide range of organizations in civil society and the 
diversity of public discourse, is integral to democracy, development and peace.  
</p>
<p>46. Women&#8223;s participation in political and public life remains dynamic, multifaceted, 
and resilient, including in gaining access to power through alternative structures, as 
recognized in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Even as the glass ceiling in 
formal political institutions stays mostly intact, women actively open new spaces for 
discourse, build networks across long-standing divides and create new communities of 
engagement. Through the autonomous movements they build at the local to global levels, 
women&#8223;s political engagements develop across formal administrative boundaries and are 
</p>
<p>transnational in reach based on the universality of women&#8223;s right to equality, challenging

<p>unequal power relations, demanding accountability, defending rights and achievements, and 
advocating for systemic and cultural change in societies, institutions and States. Women&#8223;s 
autonomous civil society organizations are crucial to women&#8223;s participation in public and 
political life. 
</p>
<p>47. Women&#8223;s rights advocates engage actively in different normative regimes, including 
religious communities and indigenous or customary groups. They do so, among others, by 
initiating hermeneutic projects within their respective religions. In their cultural 
communities, women express their opinions on politics also through the arts, including 
writings, music and plays, and their works have been attacked, criminalized and condemned 
by State and non-State actors. In certain contexts, economically independent women 
playing leadership roles are stigmatized and attacked as witches.24 Lesbian, bisexual and 
transgender women who defend their human rights are vulnerable to attacks on their civil 
rights and personhood25 where there is a climate of intolerance arising from their perceived 
challenge to established norms of gender identity, gender roles and sexuality.26 
</p>
<p>48. The new space and opportunities created by revolutionary developments in ICTs 
have enabled women to initiate or enhance their participation in political and public life. 
Women who are confined in private homes have used ICTs as a means to break out of their 
isolation and take part in collective action. Women who live under threat of attack because 
of their sexual orientation have found safety in the anonymity of the Internet, which allows 
them to freely speak out, establish virtual communities and participate in public debates. 
During moments of political unrest, women have utilized SMS, micro-blogging and social 
networking to provide &#8220;bodyguard&#8221; protection to each other on the ground.27 
</p>
<p>49. In the negotiation of political settlements during political transitions or in law 
reform, the inclusion of women&#8223;s civil society organizations and women leaders or 
spokespersons from sectoral or minority communities is crucial to ensure the equal benefit 
of reform to all citizens. As political transitions do not always lead to inclusive democracy, 
the empowerment of autonomous women&#8223;s movements is of equal priority to the process of 
</p>
<p>state-building and the reform of political institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Democratic deficit 
</b></p>
<p>50. The democratic deficit undermines women&#8223;s substantive participation in political 
and public life. Patronage politics, corruption, and undemocratic local government reduce 
women&#8223;s effectiveness in the political arena, as they prevent transparency and 
accountability in decision-making and in the distribution of resources. Gender 
discriminatory policies and regulations have been applied by autonomous local 
governments even when national or federal laws mandate gender equality. Empowering 
women&#8223;s participation in political and public life from the community level up helps build a 
culture of accountability, as it broadens the constituency for democratic decision-making, 
and is crucial to the effective application of good governance at all levels. 
</p>
<p>51. The delegation of political or public power to religious institutions or indigenous 
communities that are exempt from the requirement to include women in their leadership 
and decision-making bodies cancels women&#8223;s right to participate in significant aspects of

</p>

<p>public and political life; in such cases, the boundaries of women&#8223;s rights are defined 
unilaterally by decision-makers of patriarchal social orders.  
</p>
<p>52. The democratic deficit also expresses itself in the lack of capacity by States to 
address perpetual insecurity in all its different dimensions, including militarism and the 
culture of violence, especially, but not only, in situations of conflict and transition, in which 
women are primary victims.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Eliminating structural and societal discrimination against women in 
</b></p>
<p><b>political and public life 
</b></p>
<p>53. Guarantees of women&#8223;s rights to education, decent employment and access to 
economic resources are preconditions for women&#8223;s equal and effective participation in 
</p>
<p>political and public life. A coherent set of gender-responsive social and economic policies 
is necessary to overcome the multifaceted structural barriers that women face. 
</p>
<p>54. Poverty and social exclusion, including women&#8223;s high levels of illiteracy and poor 
health, lock women into a persistent state of dependence and deprivation and often make 
long-term participation in political and public life an unviable option. Programmes 
addressing poverty and social exclusion and containing strong empowerment components 
for marginalized women, including those who face multiple discrimination, enhance the 
opportunity and capacity for these particular women to participate meaningfully in political 
and public life.  
</p>
<p>55. Political will of States is the key element to ensure gender equality outcomes, 
combined with persistent support, pressure and scrutiny by women&#8223;s movements, whose 
autonomy should be protected by the State 
</p>
<p>56. While women are situated in different locations, each with distinct vulnerabilities 
and assets, their participation in political and public life is commonly constrained by 
structural and societal discrimination in the family, in caregiving responsibilities, in 
violence against women, and marginalization by political parties and other non-State public 
institutions. The obligation of States to remove these barriers is clearly mandated in article 
2 (f) of the Convention and has been repeatedly advocated by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Discriminatory family status 
</b></p>
<p>57. The institution of family is one of the foundations of whole political systems, and 
family law is core to women&#8223;s citizenship and public life. Women&#8223;s right to equality in the 
</p>
<p>family shapes opportunities and constraints for women&#8223;s agency and autonomy and also 
</p>
<p>regulates access to land, income, education and health, including reproductive health, 
thereby determining a woman&#8223;s capacity to fully engage in all aspects of life.28 The right of 
women to equality in the family was established in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and elaborated in 
articles 2 and 16 of the Convention.  
</p>
<p>58. Patriarchal and discriminatory family law or practice may limit women&#8223;s freedom of 
occupation and freedom of movement in the public space. In some countries, men are still 
regarded by law as the head of household, barring women from representing their families 
in official decision-making processes on public affairs, including on development projects

<p>and issues of good governance, which have an impact on women and their families. The 
system of heads of household has been abrogated in many countries&#8223; legal systems.29 
</p>
<p>59. Women belonging to minority groups are often victims of dual discrimination, as 
they must address discrimination against minorities and within their own communities. 
Providing special measures of education, leadership training and economic assistance for 
women and awareness-raising for men in patriarchal communities are some of the good 
practices by which States can address such multiple discrimination.  
</p>
<p>60. Many States have entered reservations to articles 2 and 16 of the Convention, on 
equality in the family, almost all in deference to religious family law, and in so doing 
perpetuate the structural impediment of inequality in the family to women&#8223;s full and 
effective participation in political and public life.30 The Working Group regards the 
elimination of discrimination in the family as central to women&#8223;s capacity to participate in 
</p>
<p>political and public life on equal terms with men and the withdrawal of these reservations 
as imperative.   
</p>
<p>61. Reform of family laws provides a firm basis to overcome structural and cultural 
impediments to women&#8223;s equal and full participation in political and public life. Family 
</p>
<p>laws have been the focus of reform throughout history, as part of whole movements of 
States and societies towards modernity. In most cases, religious hermeneutic projects, 
particularly when initiated as part of broader reforms during times of political transition, 
have been an integral part of making these changes possible, with a prominent role played 
by women&#8223;s rights movements, as in the case of Morocco, which achieved significant 
reform on many fronts in the family code (Moudawana),31 and by reform-minded religious 
institutions. The political will for these reforms, in State-sponsored modernization projects 
and social engineering agendas, has existed in diverse contexts of colonial power, the post-
colonial State and communist regimes.32  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Unequal caregiving responsibilities  
</b></p>
<p>62. Caregiving responsibilities in the family are disproportionately in the hands of 
women. Both the reality and the a priori belief that this is the way it should be put women 
at a structural disadvantage in entering and participating sustainably in political and public 
life. The long hours of work and heavy travel demands make it difficult for women with 
caregiving responsibilities to maintain consistent engagement in political and public life 
without adequate support for the caring responsibilities. At the same time, women who 
carry out full-time engagement in politics and public affairs are often harassed and 
stigmatized, as they are perceived to undermine traditional family values.  
</p>
<p>63. Good practice regarding the work-life balance for public and political participation 
includes both childcare support and institutional family-friendly scheduling. The highest 
performing countries in terms of proportion of women in public office have the most 
generous entitlements for maternal and parental leave. This reflects States&#8223; effectiveness in 
creating better options for women to reconcile the balance between work and family life, 
promoting a better balance of responsibilities between men and women in the home and

significant cultural change in society&#8223;s views of gender roles, which is itself a culmination 
</p>
<p>of decades of responsive social policies.33 Good practices regarding gender-sensitive 
parliaments are found in some Western European and other States that have changed the 
scheduling of parliamentary session to allow a work-life balance for Members of 
Parliament who have parental responsibilities. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>64. Violence against women in all its forms, whether in the private or the public space, 
undermines women&#8223;s capacity to effectively engage in political and public life.  
</p>
<p>65. Stigmatization, harassment and outright attacks have been used to silence and 
discredit women who are outspoken as leaders, community workers, human rights 
defenders and politicians. Sexual harassment against female political candidates has been 
reported as a tactic to discourage women from exercising their right to vote and run for 
elections.34 Women defenders are often the target of gender-specific violence, such as 
verbal abuse based on their sex, sexual abuse or rape; they may experience intimidation, 
attacks, death threats and even murder by community members. Violence against women 
defenders is sometimes condoned or perpetrated by State actors, including through police 
harassment of female demonstrators.35   
</p>
<p>66. The Internet has become a site of diverse forms of violence against women, in the 
form of pornography, sexist games and breaches of privacy. For women who engage in 
public debate through the Internet, the risk of harassment is experienced online, for 
example, an anonymous negative campaign calling for the gang rape of a woman human 
rights defender, with racist abuse posted in her Wikipedia profile.36 Female ICT users have 
publicly protested about sexist attacks.37  
</p>
<p>67. Domestic violence is public as well as private in its debilitating impact on women. It 
can also be used directly as a form of punishment by resentful husbands or other family 
members against wives or female relatives who become leaders in their community.  
</p>
<p>68. In 2012, recognizing the importance of eliminating violence against women in 
public and political life, the General Assembly, in its resolution 66/130, called for an 
environment of zero tolerance for violence against women elected officials and candidates 
for public office. In the Latin American and Caribbean region, the Inter-American 
Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women 
explicitly recognizes the right of women to be free from violence in both the public and the 
private spheres and the impact that violence can have on civil, political and economic, 
social and cultural rights.38 In this region, there are examples of legislation prohibiting 
gender-based harassment and violence against a woman candidate as well as pressure on a 
female candidate&#8223;s family.39 In the African region, the African Commission on Human and

<p>Peoples&#8223; Rights recently issued a decision on the failure of States in protecting women 
during acts of political protest, including in a case concerning violence against women 
journalists.40 In an environment where sexual violence continues to go unpunished, this 
decision makes a valuable contribution towards ensuring that States are held to account 
when they fail to protect women from violence.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Stereotypes  
</b></p>
<p>69. Stereotypes41 of women&#8223;s capacities and roles that negatively affect women&#8223;s 
effective participation in political and public life persist around the world. Despite evidence 
of women&#8223;s important contributions in other fields of life, including in the labour market, 
stereotypes of female inadequacy in politics continue to be used as a basis for their 
marginalization and segregation in decision-making positions, with care and distributive 
tasks such as health and social welfare allocated to women, while men are assigned to 
economic and defence affairs, distorting the power structure and resource allocation.42 
</p>
<p>70. Women who belong to vulnerable groups, based on race, class, ethnicity, religion or 
belief, health, status, age, class, caste and sexual orientation and gender identity, are 
effectively barred from political and public life based on multiple stereotyping. In its 
concluding observations, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women has expressed concern about stereotyped media portrayals of women&#8223;s roles within 
the family and society. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Working Group notes that negotiation by international, regional and State 
agencies with sectoral or minority groups is negatively influenced by gender stereotyping 
when conducted solely with the male community leadership, thereby making women&#8223;s 
leadership effectively invisible and further marginalizing women.  
</p>
<p>72. Particularly during times of political transitions, in highly polarized discourse 
regarding national identity, gender stereotypes can be magnified and undermine progress in 
eliminating discrimination against women. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Marginalization by political parties  
</b></p>
<p>73. Political parties are key determinants of women&#8223;s political empowerment and 
women&#8223;s participation in politics, as political parties recruit and select candidates for 
elections.43  
</p>
<p>74. Political parties, which function as gatekeepers in political decision-making, tend to 
be exclusionary towards women. Women also frequently lack access to political party 
funding and financial resources for their election bids and campaigns. Some political parties 
exclude women on religious ideological grounds. Both a national court and the European 
Court of Human Rights found that a confessional political party&#8223;s exclusion of women from 
its parliamentary candidate list, because &#8220;differences in nature, talents and place in society 
means that, although women are not inferior to men as human beings, they should not be

<p>eligible for public office&#8221;, was in violation of the State&#8223;s Constitution and article 7 of the 
Convention.44 
</p>
<p>75. The most effective strategies for women&#8223;s political empowerment involve reforms to 
incorporate rules that guarantee women&#8223;s representation within political parties.45 Some 50 
countries have adopted legislation on electoral quotas in order to ensure that a certain 
proportion of candidates for political office are women. Hundreds of political parties in 
another 20 countries have voluntarily adopted their own gender quotas.46 In some countries 
the quota system is established by the constitution. One constitution in the Latin American 
and Caribbean region includes the principle of parity in all policymaking mechanisms, 
including elections, ministries, the justice system and political parties, and stipulates that 
political parties&#8223; &#8220;organization, structure and functioning shall be democratic and shall 
guarantee the rotation of power, accountability, and parity membership between women 
and men on their governing boards&#8221;.47 In the Maghreb, one new constitution mandates the 
establishment of a mechanism for parity (see A/HRC/20/28/Add.1). Women&#8223;s movements 
were intensely involved in these constitutional processes, illustrating the importance of 
activism to exert pressure for the creation of a constitutional framework that supports 
women&#8223;s right to representation. 
</p>
<p>76. The Working Group notes that good practices of States include a legislative, and 
preferably constitutional, requirement that political parties place women in realistic 
positions for election, apply quotas, guarantee the rotation of power, accountability and 
parity membership between women and men on their governing boards and condition the 
funding of political parties on their integration of women in realistic positions on their 
candidate lists. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Eliminating discrimination in law 
</b></p>
<p>77. The obligation of States to advance women&#8223;s equality and empower women in 
public and political life requires legal measures at all levels: constitutional, legislative and 
judicial. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Constitutional guarantees  
</b></p>
<p>78. National constitutions define the framework for eliminating discrimination against 
women in law and practice and articulate the principles and ways by which historical power 
asymmetries are redressed.48 Constitutions provide important clarity on the relationship 
between distinct normative regimes which are adhered to and practiced de facto by different 
sections of society. A constitutional guarantee of equality for women, in line with 
international standards, most especially the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, and regional standards, is essential in order to establish a 
universal imperative of equality for women on which the entire chain of justice within the 
State will rest. Increasingly, in different regions, women&#8223;s rights and non-discrimination 
clauses have been incorporated into new constitutions or are part of constitutional reform

<p>efforts.49 This transnational constitutional pattern can be attributed to ratification of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
concluding observations of the Committee, together with campaigning by women&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>activists.  
</p>
<p>79. In order to ensure effective access to justice for women, the constitutional 
requirements for gender equality should be specific.50 Research on constitutional provisions 
that specifically grant or protect the rights of women has shown that while women&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>protection clauses cannot be shown to be the exclusive cause of improved legal protection 
of women, they are associated with gains in women&#8223;s rights.  
</p>
<p>80. Model examples of constitutional design can be found in recent constitutions in 
different regions. Since 1981, in many countries in the Western region, constitutions have 
been amended to include provisions permitting the use of temporary special measures to 
promote the participation of women in political and public life. One recently established 
constitution in the Maghreb confers systematically, throughout its provisions, constitutional 
rights expressly on women as well as men, and seeks to ensure parity between them; in 
Latin America and the Caribbean there is a constitution which contains approximately 34 
references to the rights of women, including the right to political participation.51  
</p>
<p>81. The inclusion of any clause in the constitution that derogates from the guarantee of 
gender equality, by deferring to contradictory precepts in other orders of justice such as 
traditional and religious principles, undermines the equality standards of international 
human rights law. Similarly, constitutions that have an override clause, which excludes 
plural legal systems, religious or customary courts or alternative dispute settlement 
procedures from the obligation to respect the gender equality guarantee, violate the equality 
standards of the Convention. Many of the countries that have derogation or exclusion 
clauses in their constitutions have entered reservations to the human rights treaties, and 
these reservations have been addressed within the concluding observations of the treaty 
bodies, which have required their removal.  
</p>
<p>82. Effective constitutions for gender equality and non-discrimination provide clarity in 
a hierarchy of competing laws, legal provisions which establish compliance with universal 
standards of human rights, and coherence throughout national legal frameworks. There are 
good practices to be found in different regions, where recognition of the autonomy of 
customary or indigenous communities is nevertheless subject to the requirement that they 
respect women&#8223;s human rights. For instance, in the sub-Saharan region, one constitutional 
provision mandates that &#8220;laws, cultures, customs and traditions which are against the 
</p>
<p>dignity, welfare or interest of women or any other marginalised group &#8230; or which 
undermine their status, are prohibited by this Constitution&#8221;, and in Latin America and the 
Caribbean one constitution provides far-reaching recognition of both gender equality and 
indigenous rights, guaranteeing women&#8223;s participation and decision-making in indigenous 
governance and justice systems.52

</p>

<p>83. Constitutional guarantees of gender equality will be operative only if there is 
provision for effective judicial review of legislative and governmental action and women 
are empowered to process their claim for equality through the courts. Beyond State courts, 
the possibility of recourse to international and regional mechanisms opens access to 
interpretation of the constitutional provisions in line with the international and regional 
State obligation to respect, protect and fulfil women&#8223;s right to equality.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Nationality laws 
</b></p>
<p>84. Elimination of discrimination against women in political and public life necessitates 
reform of nationality laws. Women&#8223;s capacity to participate in political and public life is 
</p>
<p>defined by their citizenship and nationality, but nationality laws often discriminate against 
women, particularly when they require a single nationality in a family and the wife&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>nationality is treated as dependent on her husband&#8223;s. In effect, women lose their nationality 
</p>
<p>upon marriage with a foreign husband, particularly if both countries of the spouses follow 
the principle of dependent nationality. If the country of the husband does not follow this 
principle, then the wife is at risk of becoming stateless, denying her the right to legitimately 
participate in the political and public life of any country.53 Laws which require women to 
seek permission from their husbands, or other family members traditionally defined as their 
guardians, in acquiring passports and other identity documents also potentially undermine 
women&#8223;s capacity to equal participation in political and public life, including through 
</p>
<p>limited freedom of movement. 
</p>
<p>85. In recent years, many countries have repealed or amended discriminatory nationality 
provisions to allow women to transfer nationality to their children, and, albeit to a lesser 
extent, to foreign husbands, or to reduce the occurrence of statelessness. Some countries 
have lifted their reservations to article 9 of the Convention, mostly in relation to women 
passing on nationality to children (art. 9, para. 2). Nationality laws which discriminate 
against women have been challenged in the courts of many countries and in international 
human rights mechanisms, resulting in a number of positive court decisions.54  
</p>
<p>86. Women and girls belonging to minority communities, rural and indigenous women, 
migrant women, refugee women and those seeking asylum, and poor women face 
discriminatory practices in the implementation of laws on nationality and citizenship. They 
face prejudicial attitudes as well as structural obstacles which limit access to formal 
registration of births, marriage, residence and other citizenship documents as well as to 
relevant information on their rights as citizens. Women who are de facto heads of 
households, including those who have been abandoned by their husbands, whose divorce is 
not legally registered, or whose husbands have been forcibly disappeared and do not have 
death certificates for their husbands55, are denied recognition of their status in official 
documents. Without such access, women from these communities become 
disproportionately vulnerable in exercising their full and equal rights as citizens.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Preventing violence against women  
</b></p>
<p>87. For all women to have the capacity to exercise their right to equal and full 
participation in political and public life, States must provide a comprehensive legal 
framework to eliminate all forms of violence against women, including domestic violence, 
gender-based violence in conflict situations and under current or past dictatorships, and 
</p>
<p>  
 53  See A/HRC/23/23, paras. 19&#8211;20. 
 54  Ibid. 
 55  See, for example, Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons, <i>Half Widow, Half Wife? 
</i></p>
<p><i>Responding to Gendered Violence in Kashmir</i> (2011). </p>


<p>violence directed at women who speak out and play leadership roles during times of war 
and peace. As articulated in the agreed conclusions of the fifty-seventh session of the 
Commission for the Status of Women, these laws must provide for multidisciplinary and 
gender-sensitive preventive and protective measures, such as emergency barring orders and 
protection orders; the investigation, submission for prosecution and appropriate punishment 
of perpetrators to end impunity; and support services that empower victims and survivors, 
as well as access to appropriate civil remedies and redress.  
</p>
<p>88. Transitional justice mechanisms should provide accountability for gross violations 
of human rights affecting women, a comprehensive analysis of gender-based violence and 
abuse by past regimes, the means for transformative reparations for women victims, and the 
foundation for a gender-responsive reform of the political and legal institutions as part of 
the guarantee of non-recurrence.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Implementation and enforcement of law 
</b></p>
<p>89. Effective elimination of discrimination against women in political and public life 
relies on the capacity to implement legal guarantees of equality between men and women in 
this field. National women&#8223;s machineries set up within the executive bodies of States have 
been consistently underresourced and are therefore disadvantaged in carrying out their 
functions. Autonomous women&#8223;s movements which promote universal standards of 
</p>
<p>equality and non-discrimination are key players, both for maintaining the continued 
existence of these national machineries as well as for promoting their effectiveness. The 
equal participation of women from minority, indigenous and other marginalized 
communities in decision-making positions is the measure of a full implementation of legal 
guarantees and measures. 
</p>
<p>90. NHRIs play a crucial role in providing human rights protection and access to redress 
for politically active women at risk. Given the complex obstacles deeply rooted in structural 
inequalities and multiple intersections of social-cultural exclusion, women&#8223;s effective 
participation in political and public life can be achieved only when they have equal and full 
access to all mechanisms of independent human rights monitoring and redress, particularly 
in contexts where the risks are high. Gender responsiveness and gender balance in NHRIs 
and other human rights institutions at the regional and international levels are imperative. 
</p>
<p>91. However, there are no international standards for NHRIs to integrate gender and 
women&#8223;s rights into their work, resulting in the uneven responsiveness of NHRIs to the 
</p>
<p>specific protection needs of women in political and public life, including women human 
rights defenders and female politicians at the local level. Specialized NHRIs on women&#8223;s 
human rights exist in some countries, but no mechanism guarantees coordination between 
specialized and the main national human rights bodies, resulting in serious gaps and the risk 
of fragmented national human rights systems. 
</p>

<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> </b>For women&#8217;s participation in political and public life to be meaningful it mus<b>t 
be on equal footing with that of men, covering all aspects of political and public life, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and effective in achieving substantive outcomes on equality between men and women 
</b></p>
<p>in all fields of life. Women&#8217;s economic independence and the economic viability of 
</p>
<p><b>their enterprises and collective actions are crucial, and the conditions necessary for 
</b></p>
<p><b>this to be achievable is distinct for differently located women, defined by the unique 
</b></p>
<p><b>intersections of multiple forms of discrimination experienced by them. Political 
</b></p>
<p><b>transitions do not always lead to inclusive democracy and long-lasting peace, and 
</b></p>
<p>require the effectiveness of autonomous women&#8217;s movements to ground universal 
</p>
<p><b>standards of human rights in political and public life. 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> </b>Women&#8217;s capacity for equal participat<b>ion in all aspects of political and public 
life depends on a coherent set of social and economic policies directed at the family, 
</b></p>
<p><b>workplace and marketplace. It also requires their capacity to engage in complex issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>such as peace and security, state-building, and extreme poverty and all forms of social 
</b></p>
<p><b>exclusion. Positive action is needed to empower women to produce knowledge and 
</b></p>
<p><b>engage actively and creatively in these fields. As women act collectively to overcome 
</b></p>
<p><b>the structural barriers they face, sustainable access of these groups or communities to 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate resources, including financial, is critical.  
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> The right mix of special measures, both temporary and permanent, is required 
</b>to address reported stagnation in the rise in women&#8217;s participation in pub<b>lic office. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Partial and selective application of gender quotas and other temporary special 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures must be replaced by a comprehensive system-wide approach, in permanent 
</b></p>
<p><b>as well as ad hoc institutions of governance, peace, development and human rights, at 
</b></p>
<p><b>the local, national and global levels. The emerging framework for global governance 
</b></p>
<p><b>of information and communications technologies (ICTs) is particularly important, 
</b></p>
<p><b>considering the crucial role that ICTs are playing in the political and public life of 
</b></p>
<p><b>women. 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> The Working Group recommends that States: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Take concrete steps towards achieving parity in political decision-
</b></p>
<p><b>making and leadership at all levels through a multifaceted approach that is responsive 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the different obstacles faced by women, including in dealing with multiple 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination. States should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Strengthen the legislative foundation towards parity, including through 
</b></p>
<p><b>constitutional provisions and other legislative measures for positive action, such 
</b></p>
<p><b>as quotas, to overcome structural barrie</b>rs to women&#8217;s political participation;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) P</b>rovide effective policy measures to increase women&#8217;s electability for 
</p>
<p><b>public office and in key institutions of political and public life, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>political parties; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Address any indication of stagnation and segregation in the progress 
</b></p>
<p><b>towards parity by designing and implementing innovative strategies to 
</b></p>
<p><b>overcome specific barriers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Develop strategies to support capacity development for women in public 
</b></p>
<p><b>office, including through national and international cooperation among peers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Enhance the capacity to consistently and regularly monitor progress at 
</b></p>
<p><b>all levels of decision-making across the whole spectrum of institutions of public 
</b></p>
<p><b>and political life; </b></p>


<p><b>(b) Create the enabling conditions for public recognition and acceptance for 
</b></p>
<p><b>women in positions of leadership and decision-making through public campaigns and 
</b></p>
<p><b>educational programmes which are responsive to multicultural settings, including by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) G</b>iving recognition to the diversity of women&#8217;s engagements in politi<b>cal 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Providing a positive image of diverse women, including minority women, 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous women, women with disabilities, and other historically marginalized 
</b></p>
<p><b>women, in leadership and decision-making positions; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Providing youth and children with a wide range of relevant role models 
</b></p>
<p><b>and career paths for women, including through mentoring programmes for 
</b></p>
<p>young women&#8217;s participation in political and public life<b>; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Develop a bottom-up approach to building democratic and accountable 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>the sectoral fields, with the active participation of institutions and organizations in 
</b></p>
<p>which women&#8217;s leadership <b>is located and growing; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) </b>Support and ensure women&#8217;s equal participation in and b<b>enefit from all 
</b></p>
<p><b>areas of political decision-making during times of political transition. States should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Apply special measures to ensure the equal and full participation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>women in all transitional authorities and mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Ensure, including through constitutional provisions, a coherent system-
</b></p>
<p><b>wide framework for equality between men and women in all fields of life; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Engage women in meaningful and sustainable ways in the development 
</b></p>
<p><b>and implementation of policies to achieve lasting peace and security, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>by promoting a culture of peace through formal and informal education in a 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) </b>Ensure women&#8217;s effective participation in all initiatives to secure 
</p>
<p><b>accountability for past abuses, including transitional justice processes, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that the guarantee for non-recurrence incorporates overcoming the root 
</b></p>
<p><b>causes of gender-based violations in everyday life and institutions; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) </b>Create a coherent institutional architecture for women&#8217;s human rights 
</p>
<p><b>and gender equality, including by:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Securing the gender balance and gender-responsive capacity of national 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights institutions (NHRIs) and other independent monitoring bodies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Institutionalizing gender responsiveness as part of the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards for effective NHRIs;

</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Overcome the knowledge gap regarding </b>women&#8217;s participation in 
</p>
