<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the right to food has the honour to submit to the Human Rights 
Council the present report on his official mission to Bolivia from 29 April to 6 May 2007. 
</p>
<p> Despite the fact that Bolivia is a country rich in mineral resources - natural gas, oil, and 
metals including silver, gold, iron, zinc and tin - the vast majority of its people have not 
benefited from this natural wealth and remain poor and malnourished. Chronic malnutrition 
affects more than one in four Bolivian children. Over 65 per cent of Bolivians live below the 
national poverty line. Around 35 per cent, mostly indigenous peoples, live in extreme poverty, so 
poor that they cannot afford the <i>canasta basica</i> or the minimum amount of calories needed every 
day to sustain a healthy life. 
</p>
<p> Inequalities deepened under the economic model pursued by recent administrations and 
Bolivia now has one of the highest levels of inequality in the world. A small urban elite, mostly 
of Spanish and mixed descent, has traditionally dominated economic and political power, but this 
is now changing, following deep social crisis. Since 2000, social protests have reached critical 
levels in the &#8220;water wars&#8221; in Cochabamba and El Alto, and the &#8220;gas war&#8221; against plans to export 
Bolivia&#8217;s natural gas reserves. After protests were forcibly repressed, at least 59 people were 
killed during the gas war in September and October 2003, leading to the collapse of the 
administration of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada.<b> 
</b></p>
<p> Elections in December 2005 marked the beginning of a new era as Bolivians  
elected Evo Morales Ayma, the first indigenous President in Latin America. Evo Morales 
won 54 per cent of the vote, an unprecedented absolute majority in Bolivian elections. 
President Morales has publicly committed to make the fight against malnutrition, food 
insecurity, and poverty the key element of his agenda. Since coming to power, he has already 
succeeded in renegotiating contracts with foreign investors in gas and oil, generating a massive 
injection of extra revenue into the Government budget. His administration is also adopting a 
&#8220;Zero Malnutrition Programme&#8221; as well as programmes focused on investing in small-scale 
agriculture, food sovereignty, land reform, social infrastructure and protecting the rights of 
indigenous peoples. The drafting of a new constitution by the Constituent Assembly has also 
served to entrench this new approach by recognizing the fundamental right to food and the right 
to water for all Bolivians. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the situation of malnutrition and food insecurity 
in Bolivia remains grave, so he welcomes the new approach of the administration of  
President Morales. He believes that this offers the possibility of fundamental change for the large 
majority of Bolivians, especially indigenous peoples, who have for so long been excluded from 
such simple freedoms as the freedom from hunger and poverty. 
</p>
<p> The report ends with a series of recommendations by the Special Rapporteur regarding the 
realization of the right to food. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food visited Bolivia from 29 April to 6 May 2007. 
He expresses his great appreciation to the Government of Bolivia for the open and cooperative 
way in which his mission was received. He would like to thank Ambassador Angelica Navarro 
and her team at the Permanent Mission of Bolivia to the United Nations in Geneva for 
facilitating his mission. He welcomes the election of Bolivia to the new Human Rights Council 
and congratulates Bolivia on its cooperation with human rights mechanisms, including Special 
Rapporteurs. During his visit to Bolivia, he appreciated the help of the United Nations country 
team, especially Antonio Molpeceres, Resident Coordinator, Elisa Panades, representative 
of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Vitoria Ginja, representative of the 
World Food Programme (WFP). He would also like to thank the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) for assistance in organizing the mission. He is 
also grateful to Ambassador Rafael Daus&#224; Cespedes of Cuba. Finally, he would like to thank the 
head of the Swiss Development Cooperation in Bolivia, Marco Rossi, and Charg&#233; d&#8217;Affaires a.i. 
Jacques Gremaud of Switzerland for their warm hospitality. 
</p>
<p>2. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was honoured to be received by the President of 
the Republic, Evo Morales Ayma. He greatly benefited from meetings with the Minister for 
Rural Development and Agriculture, Dr. Susana Rivero, the Minister of Health and Sport, 
Dr. Nila Heredia, and senior staff of the Ministry of Water, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the 
Head of the National Insitute for Agrarian Reform. He also met with the Vice-President and 
other members of Bolivia&#8217;s Constituent Assembly and appreciated the valuable insights from his 
meeting with Waldo Albarracin, the <i>Defensor del Pueblo</i>, Bolivia&#8217;s human rights ombudsman. 
3. The Special Rapporteur also appreciated meetings with a wide range of representatives 
from social movements, indigenous movements and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 
The Special Rapporteur and his team visited rural communities and urban areas in the 
departments of La Paz and Oruro, and held meetings, inter alia, with communities in the urban 
areas of El Alto and miners and peasant communities in Oruro. He would particularly like to 
thank the non-governmental organizations <i>Centro de Investigaci&#243;n y Promoci&#243;n del 
Campesinado</i> (CIPCA) and Emmaus Bolivia, as well as FAO and WFP for assisting in the 
organization of these visits. 
</p>
<p>4. The objectives of the mission were to examine the realization of the right to food in 
relation to Bolivia&#8217;s international and national commitments to respect, protect and fulfil the 
human right to adequate food. Bolivia is the second poorest country in Latin America and has 
one of the highest levels of child malnutrition and under-nourishment in the continent. However, 
today Bolivia is in an historic moment of transition under the new Government of Evo Morales, 
who became Bolivia&#8217;s first indigenous President in January 2006. Morales has promised to make 
the fight against malnutrition and extreme poverty the key focus of his administration. 
</p>
<p>5. Landlocked in the middle of South America, Bolivia ranges across the high altiplano and 
the Andes Mountains, to the tropical hills of the Yungas, the expansive forests of the Amazon 
and the lowland grassy plains of Santa Cruz. Nearly half of Bolivia&#8217;s territory is covered by 
forest, and another third is semi-desert or arid. Its climate faces extreme variations of 
temperatures in the high altiplano as well as the hot humid temperatures of the Amazon 
lowlands, and it faces frequent natural disasters, especially droughts and floods. A country </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/5/Add.2 
 page 5 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>of 9.1 million people, the population is predominantly indigenous, with large populations of 
Quechua (30 per cent) and Aymara (25 per cent), and smaller ethnic groups, as well as mixed 
descent (30 per cent) and white populations (15 per cent), making Bolivia one of the most 
ethnically diverse countries in Latin America. Bolivia&#8217;s economy has long been dependent on 
the export of minerals (especially silver and tin) and agricultural commodities (soya beans, 
sugar, wood) and more recently on natural gas and oil. However, despite the fact that Bolivia is a 
country rich in mineral resources, including natural gas and oil, and metals including silver, gold, 
iron, zinc and tin, the vast majority of its people have not benefited from this natural wealth and 
remain very poor. Millions still struggle to survive as subsistence farmers, agricultural labourers, 
informal miners and small traders or artisans in the informal sector, on incomes insufficient to 
meet basic food needs. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  MALNUTRITION AND FOOD INSECURITY IN BOLIVIA 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The current situation of malnutrition and food insecurity in Bolivia 
</b></p>
<p>6. Chronic malnutrition affects more than one in four Bolivian children. The highest levels of 
malnutrition are amongst Bolivians living in rural areas, especially in the high plains of the 
altiplano regions of Potosi and Chuquisaca, but also in the valleys and tropical lowland 
departments of Beni and Pando. 
</p>
<p>7. Malnutrition levels are much higher amongst the poorest families.<b>1</b> Children in the poorest 
households have levels of malnutrition six times that of children born into the richest 20 per cent 
of households.<b>2</b> Families of indigenous Quechua, Aymara, Guaran&#237; and other peoples are far 
more affected by chronic malnutrition (28 per cent) than non-indigenous children (16 per cent).<b>3</b> 
Many of Bolivia&#8217;s minorities, such as the 38,600 <i>afro-bolivianos</i> are also particularly affected by 
high levels of malnutrition. More than half of Bolivian children suffer from micronutrient 
deficiencies, particularly of iron, iodine and Vitamin A, and 80 per cent of children between 6 
and 23 months suffer from anaemia. Child mortality levels remain high, but regional disparities 
are severe - a baby born in the richer department of Tarija is three times more likely to live to see 
its first birthday than a baby born in the poorer department of Oruro.<b>4</b>

<p>8. Although Bolivia has vast natural wealth from mineral and energy resources, the majority 
of the population is still extremely poor. Nearly two thirds of Bolivians live below the national 
poverty line.<b>5</b> Around 35 per cent, mostly indigenous peoples, live in extreme poverty without 
access to a minimum <i>canasta basica</i>. This means that they cannot afford even the minimum 
amount of calories every day to sustain a healthy life.<b>6</b> Poor families spend a large proportion of 
their total income on food and have limited access to adequate, sufficiently nutritious food. 
As a result of changing trade patterns, many have become dependent on cheap, low quality 
imported noodles, rather than nutritionally rich Bolivian staples such as quinoa (a highly 
nutritious indigenous grain). Extreme poverty is concentrated amongst indigenous communities 
(49 per cent), rather than non-indigenous people (24 per cent) and poverty levels are much 
higher in rural areas. The poorest are mostly subsistence farmers who struggle to survive on 
small plots of land or as agricultural labourers on pitiful wages. However, there are also high 
levels of urban poverty, as rapidly increasing rural-urban migration over the last 30 years has 
pushed millions into the cities, especially to El Alto. 
</p>
<p>9. The poorest regions are the altiplano and the central and southern valleys, where 
indigenous populations and <i>campesinos</i> (peasant farmers) are dominant. The poorest 
departments are Potosi and Chuquisaca, followed by Beni, La Paz and Oruro. More than 
60 per cent of the largely indigenous populations of Potosi and Chuquisaca are extremely poor 
and suffering from hunger, compared to fewer than 25 per cent of people living in Santa Cruz.<b>7</b> 
Santa Cruz and Cochabamba have the lowest levels of poverty, but rural and indigenous 
people in these areas remain very poor. Overall, the situation of the poor improved during the 
mid-1990s, but started to deteriorate again in 1999 and poverty levels are now back to those 
of 1990.<b>8</b> A sharp increase in inequality since the mid-1990s means that in Bolivia it is now 
amongst the greatest in the world, similar to levels seen in Brazil.<b>9</b> Nine out of ten Bolivians feel 
that such great inequality is socially unjust, and is the source of rising social conflict.<b>10</b> 
10. In Bolivia&#8217;s <i>Occidente</i> (or west), the poor and hungry are mostly indigenous people, 
living in rural areas and struggling to survive from small-scale and subsistence farming on the 
cold, windy plateau of the altiplano. The lands of the altiplano are difficult to cultivate given

<p>extremely high altitudes of 3,500-4,000 metres. Agriculture is dependent on uncertain rainfall 
and relies on crops that can survive the harsh climate. Most people have very small landholdings, 
barely large enough for subsistence. Landless families in rural areas are even poorer and work as 
sharecroppers or wage labourers, if they cannot afford to rent land. Most agricultural work is 
done by hand with little access to machinery even to plough the fields, and there has been little 
investment in irrigation and other infrastructure that would allow increased production. Highland 
families grow potatoes, oca (another edible tuber), fava beans and quinoa. Many keep animals 
such as sheep or llamas, but many of their products are sold rather than eaten, because of the 
need to generate income. This has resulted in very high levels of malnutrition, especially 
micronutrient malnutrition, amongst altiplano families because their diet is inadequate. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur found that the reason why many altiplano families are so poor is 
because the prices they receive for their crops are often below the cost of production. Unable to 
afford transport to markets, most are therefore dependent on intermediary traders who come to 
the villages with a truck to buy their milk or crops, but pay extremely low prices, while making 
large profits by selling the products in the cities.<b>11</b> The lack of transport for many remote 
families, widely dispersed across the altiplano is a serious obstacle to food security, as is the lack 
of inputs that would allow them to better utilize the land. Altiplano farming families are also 
vulnerable to a very uncertain climate. Whole crops can be wiped out by one heavy frost, 
hailstorm or summer drought. Climate change and the El Ni&#241;o phenomenon appear to be causing 
an increase in extreme climatic events, with less rain and higher temperatures affecting 
productivity.<b>12</b> The Special Rapporteur and his team spoke with Aymara families of Jintamarca 
near Guaqui, close to Lake Titicaca, who lost their entire potato crop after three days of heavy 
frost. As this is their staple food, they worried how they would survive and how they would be 
able to afford seeds to plant for the next harvest. 
</p>
<p>12. The harsh agricultural conditions, and past failures to invest in small-scale agriculture, 
account for the rapid urbanization of Bolivia, as millions have migrated to the cities, or abroad. 
Many also leave the land to toil in Bolivia&#8217;s mineral mines - the Special Rapporteur saw at first 
hand the intolerable working conditions in the cooperative mines of Oruro, where both men and 
women miners work long shifts. Others leave in search of new lands in the tropical hills or 
lowlands of the Yungas and the valleys. These migrants or <i>colonizadores</i> clear small patches of 
forest for subsistence agriculture, growing crops adapted to the warmer climate, including yuca, 
rice, maize, bananas, cacao, coffee and coca. However, efforts to eradicate coca have also been 
accompanied by much violence and have angered many indigenous Bolivians, who see coca 
eradication not only as depriving them of livelihoods when the alternatives are bleak, but also as 
an attack on their cultural heritage.

<p> 
</p>
<p>13. The difficult conditions of subsistence agriculture stand in strong contrast to the modern 
agro-industrial plantations and cattle ranches that dominate Bolivia&#8217;s eastern lowlands. Whilst 
the vast majority of small farmers have low-quality landholdings of between less than half a 
hectare and five hectares, landholdings in the <i>Oriente</i> are characterized by huge extensions of 
over 5,000 hectares, concentrated in the hands of a few powerful families. These extensions are 
highly developed, often highly mechanized and are focused on export-oriented agricultural 
production, including soya, sugar cane, sunflower oils and cattle. Mechanization means that 
these extensions provide much lower employment than small-scale farming and agricultural 
labourers are paid very low and insecure wages.<b>13</b> The Special Rapporteur was shocked to hear 
that many agricultural workers on large estates still work in feudal conditions of semi-slavery, or 
debt-bondage, particularly the Guaran&#237; indigenous population of the Chaco. According to the 
<i>Defensor del Pueblo</i>, these workers are held in debt bondage or bound by duties to landholders 
and do not receive salaries for their work. 
</p>
<p>14. Although Bolivia does not suffer from a shortage of land,<b>14</b> inequalities in landholdings 
have been a key factor in deepening social conflict across the country. The vast majority of 
poor small-scale farmers together own only 1.4 per cent of the cultivated land, while the 
wealthiest 7 per cent of Bolivian landlords own 85 per cent of the cultivated land.<b>15</b> Although a 
1953 agrarian reform programme broke up the traditional feudalistic <i>haciendas</i> in the highlands 
and the valleys, this system re-emerged in the eastern lowlands as huge tracts of land were 
granted to powerful political supporters of the regimes in power between the 1960s and 
the 1990s.<b>16</b> Inequalities of land ownership are particularly high in the southern state of Tarija, 
where 92 per cent of land is owned by 8 per cent of agricultural producers, while 80 per cent of 
the region&#8217;s <i>campesinos</i> have no land title.<b>17</b> In the eastern lowlands, lands have been granted to 
indigenous peoples within the Tierra Comunitaria de Or&#237;gen (TCO) framework, but this has also 
been complicated and has not always provided secure tenure, given overlapping claims by 
settlers and large landowners which have generated further conflict. 
</p>
<p>15. Bolivia is also frequently faced with natural disaster. Many people interviewed by the 
Special Rapporteur suggested that Bolivia is increasingly affected by unpredictable natural 
disasters as a result of climate change. In early 2007, Bolivia faced its worst floods in 25 years. 
Whilst drought, hail and freezing temperatures devastated staple crops in the highlands, torrential

</p>
<p>rains and overflowing rivers caused serious floods in eight of Bolivia&#8217;s nine departments, 
resulting in the deaths of 54 people and affecting the lives and livelihoods of over 
450,000 people.<b>18</b> In the worst affected areas in Beni and Santa Cruz, at least 71,000 hectares of 
crops were destroyed and more than 11,000 cattle were lost in the rising water; at least 
16,000 people were displaced from their homes in Santa Cruz. The Government declared a 
national emergency on 18 January 2007 and requested support from the international community 
on 7 February 2007. At the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur, the floods had mostly 
receded, but thousands of people were left to rebuild their homes and livelihoods. 
</p>
<p>16. Millions of Bolivians continue to lack access to safe drinking water, as well as water for 
subsistence agriculture. The situation is particularly severe in rural areas, where up to 43 per cent 
of the population has no access to safe drinking water and 75 per cent have no sanitation,<b>19</b> the 
vast majority of whom are indigenous peoples.<b>20</b> The quality of existing drinking water is also 
problematic, given a continued lack of adequate water treatment. Water privatization under 
Bolivia&#8217;s previous administrations aimed to improve the water quality and provision but gave 
rise to serious social conflict. In Cochabamba, water prices rose by 100-200 per cent just weeks 
after a private, foreign-owned company, Aguas del Tunari owned by the London-based 
multinational International Water Ltd took over the concession.<b>21</b> For many families, this meant 
that up to half of their monthly income went on paying for water. Massive public protests 
broke out in February 2000, but the then President declared martial law and called for a state of 
emergency for 90 days. During this period, most civil rights were suspended, permitting the 
arrest and confinement of protesters without a warrant, restrictions on travel and political activity 
and a curfew, banning gatherings of more than four people and severely limiting freedom of the 
press. After persistent public protests, the Government was forced to back down and to break its 
contract with Aguas del Tunari. In a similar case of privatization in El Alto, a concession of 
Aguas del Illimani to the Suez des Eaux multinational company was halted in 2007, following 
widespread protests after communities were deprived of access to sufficient water as a result of 
increases in water prices and connection fees.

<p><b>B.  Social crisis and recent developments in Bolivia 
</b></p>
<p>17. The recent social crisis in Bolivia has its roots in a long history of extreme poverty and 
social exclusion of the majority of Bolivia&#8217;s population. The history of colonial exploitation is 
still etched in the minds of Bolivia&#8217;s poor, especially the indigenous population. Much of the 
Spanish empire&#8217;s wealth was financed by Bolivia&#8217;s rich deposits of silver and tin, mined by 
indigenous people forced to work as slaves. Thousands of indigenous peoples were also forced to 
work under nearly feudal conditions on large agricultural estates, denied the right to freely 
chosen work, the right to education and the right to vote. Even today, the vast majority of 
Bolivians are still extremely poor and struggling to feed their families and they question why 
they do not seem to benefit from Bolivia&#8217;s wealth of natural and mineral resources. Recent 
protests have centred on opposition to privatization which is perceived as a new form of 
colonialism and the appropriation of Bolivia&#8217;s wealth by foreign investors. 
</p>
<p>18. Bolivia&#8217;s wealth of mineral resources includes silver, tin, zinc, tungsten, antimony, iron 
and gold, as well as oil and natural gas. Since the discovery of vast reserves in the 1990s, natural 
gas now dominates the country&#8217;s exports (43 per cent of total exports in 2006). Natural gas and 
oil production have been increasing. Bolivia produces about 355 billion cubic feet of natural gas 
and has the second largest reserve of natural gas in South America, after Venezuela (with 
reserves estimated at between 24 and 53 trillion cubic feet).<b>22</b> More than 85 per cent of these 
natural gas reserves are located in the department of Tarija, with a further 10.6 per cent in 
Santa Cruz and 2.5 per cent in Cochabamba. Bolivia also has substantial oil reserves of at least 
440 million barrels (proven reserves as of 2006) and produces about 64,000 barrels per day. 
Most of the oil is also located in south-western Bolivia, with 80 per cent in the department of 
Tarija. Rising international prices of natural gas and oil promise rising revenues, but the 
privatization of oil and gas reserves under the Sanchez de Lozada Government in the mid-1990s 
led to a decline in revenues accruing to the State. Following privatization, the Brazilian 
company, Petrobras, and Spanish Repsol-YPF became the dominant producers of both oil and 
natural gas in Bolivia, but the French company, Total, Exxon of the United States of America, 
British Petroleum and British Gas, and other consortia are also involved in Bolivia. 
</p>
<p>19. However, growing public disillusionment with privatization led to protests against plans to 
export natural gas to the United States and Mexico via a Chilean pipeline and escalated into the 
&#8220;gas war&#8221; of September and October 2003. During a month of social protests and blockades, 
social movements, representing indigenous peoples, peasant farmers and workers, fought street 
battles against the authorities. These protests were forcibly repressed and at least 59 people were 
killed in September and October 2003.<b>23</b> President Sanchez de Lozada was forced to resign from 
office and his Vice-President Carlos Mesa assumed the Presidency. Social movements drew up a 
list of demands called the October Agenda. They demanded the establishment of a Constituent

<p>Assembly to draw up a new constitution to re-establish participatory democracy as well as 
demanding the nationalization of Bolivia&#8217;s national resources so that Bolivian wealth could 
finally benefit the Bolivian people. 
</p>
<p>20. Mesa acceded to these demands, including revising the constitution and holding 
a binding referendum on the export of natural gas. The Bolivian people voted overwhelmingly in 
the referendum for the development of oil and gas resources and for the imposition of 
a 50 per cent tax on extraction on all multinational companies. In May 2005, Congress passed 
the 2005 Hydrocarbons Law which introduced a direct tax on hydrocarbons of 32 per cent, 
adding to the 18 per cent royalty already paid and requiring a total tax contribution of 
50 per cent. This led to huge increases in revenue to the Bolivian State, as the new tax was 
imposed across the industry. However, when more than 80,000 protestors surrounded the 
presidential palace to demand the full nationalization of the gas industry, Mesa was in turn 
forced to resign.  
</p>
<p>21. The elections of December 2005 marked a turning point as Bolivians elected Evo Morales 
Ayma with an absolute majority of almost 54 per cent, unprecedented in Bolivian elections.<b>24</b> 
He was sworn in on 22 January 2006, the first indigenous President in a nation with a majority 
indigenous population. Morales promised fundamental change for the large majority of 
Bolivians, especially indigenous peoples, long excluded from such simple freedoms as the 
freedom from hunger and poverty. He promised that 500 years of colonialism were now over and 
that sovereignty would be re-established over resources for the benefit of the Bolivian people. 
On 1 May 2006 he announced the renationalization of the oil and natural gas industries. Under 
the terms of this 2006 nationalization decree (Decree 28701), foreign companies are not allowed 
to own the reserves (ownership is reserved for the State), but will be permitted to operate the 
fields for the Government. This affected mainly the production of Brazil&#8217;s Petrobras in the 
largest gas fields of San Antonio and Sabalo, Spain&#8217;s Repsol which operates the Margarity field, 
France&#8217;s Total in Itau, and Britain&#8217;s British Gas which operates in the La Vertiente, Escondido 
and Los Suris fields. Under new operational agreements signed in November 2006, the resources 
will formally lie in the hands of the Bolivian State gas company, Yacimientos Petrol&#237;feros 
Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB), but the foreign companies will operate as providers of services to 
YPFB and will be subject to new tax arrangements. Tax and royalties of 50 per cent of the 
income will be paid directly to the State, as well as a further tax, taking the total tax bill up to a 
maximum of 82 per cent, although when this is calculated after deduction of costs and 
investment, it is estimated that total tax bills will not exceed 60 per cent. All the foreign 
corporations have agreed to these demands and will continue to operate in Bolivia. 
</p>
<p>22. Under these new agreements successfully negotiated by the Government of 
President Evo Morales, there has been a massive increase in State revenues, which reached 
US$ 1.3 billion in 2006 and may reach US$ 1.5 billion in 2007, an enormous increase on 
revenues of only US$ 220 million in 2003.<b>25</b> This means that State revenues from oil and gas

</p>
<p>amounted to 9.7 per cent of GDP in 2006, compared to only 2.8 per cent in 2003.<b>26</b> The massive 
injection of revenue into State resources has already allowed the President to reverse a spiralling 
public deficit, reduce public debt and will allow increased investments in fighting hunger and 
poverty. Despite strong opposition from the traditional white and <i>mestizo</i> elites of the <i>Oriente</i>, 
Morales has publicly committed to make the fight against malnutrition, food insecurity, and 
poverty the key element of his agenda. Morales has announced that new expenditure will give 
priority to the Zero Malnutrition Programme. The 2007 National Development Plan also reflects 
commitments to sharply increase public expenditure, up to 14 per cent of GDP for the five-year 
period 2007-2012, compared to 10.5 per cent in 2006.<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p>23. Development expenditures at the local level will also increase as, under decentralization 
and the 2005 Hydrocarbons Law, two-thirds of the proceeds of taxes and royalties from oil and 
gas will be transferred directly to Bolivia&#8217;s regional departments (municipalities and 
<i>prefecturas</i>), which will see revenues rise to US$ 782 million in 2007 (compared to 
US$ 140 million in 2004).<b>28</b> The 2005 Law expressly establishes that resources from the 
hydrocarbon tax should be directed to health, education, roads and local development for 
employment generation. However, so far, there has been very little concrete investment at the 
local level and huge resources remain in bank accounts. There is a risk that under this 
decentralized revenue distribution, the central Government will not be able to ensure that 
municipalities prioritize expenditure on the Zero Malnutrition Programme or other programmes 
to meet the needs of the poorest. There is also a risk that the current distribution of these 
resources could contribute to increasing inequalities and conflicts between the regions. 
At present, the La Paz region receives only US$ 16 per capita compared to Pando which receives 
US$ 407 per head.<b>29</b> Allocating larger revenues to the producing regions may also generate 
conflict, as Tarija and Santa Cruz will receive larger revenues than any other region. Distribution 
of the hydrocarbon tax between regions is therefore a central and hotly debated issue which can 
only be resolved within the Constituent Assembly. Providing for transparency of expenditures 
and permitting participatory budgeting processes for expenditure decisions at the municipal and 
<i>prefectura</i> level will be essential. 
24. These massive increases in government revenue will allow Bolivia, which has traditionally 
been dependent on international aid for its development, to finally take charge of its destiny and 
offer new hope to millions of poor and indigenous Bolivians that have remained excluded from 
Bolivia&#8217;s wealth for so long.

<p><b>II.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE RIGHT TO FOOD IN BOLIVIA 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International obligations 
</b></p>
<p>25. Bolivia is party to the main international treaty that protects the right to food, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and is therefore committed to 
realizing the right to food of all its people. The Special Rapporteur notes that Bolivia has not 
reported recently on its realization of these rights to the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights and welcomes the Government&#8217;s commitment to report soon to the Committee, 
with the support of international technical assistance. Bolivia has also ratified all the other key 
international human rights treaties relevant to the right to food, including the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (art. 6), the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(arts. 24 and 27), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women (arts. 12 and 14) and the Additional Protocol to the American Convention on 
Human Rights in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (&#8220;Protocol of San Salvador&#8221;) 
(art. 12). This means that the Government of Bolivia is fully committed under international law 
to respect, protect and fulfil the right to food of all children, women and men in its territory. 
</p>
<p>26. The right to food is the right to have physical and economic access to sufficient adequate 
food at all times.<b>30</b> It is closely linked to the idea of food security, as it is primarily about the 
right to be able to feed oneself through access to sufficient productive resources, including land, 
water and seeds, or employment. By becoming party to the international human rights treaties, 
the Government of Bolivia has the obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the right to food 
without discrimination.<b>31</b> The obligation to respect means that the Government should not take 
actions that arbitrarily deprive people of their right to food. The obligation to protect means that 
the Government should adopt and enforce appropriate laws to prevent third parties, including 
powerful individuals and corporations, from violating the right to food of others. Finally, the 
obligation to fulfil (facilitate and provide) means that the Government should take positive steps 
to identify vulnerable groups and implement appropriate policies/programmes to ensure their 
access to adequate food and water by facilitating their ability to feed themselves. As a last resort, 
the Government is required to provide adequate food and water to those who cannot feed 
themselves for reasons beyond their own control. To fulfil the right to food, the Government 
must use the maximum of its available resources and in every circumstance it must ensure the 
minimum essential level required to be free from hunger. Participation, accountability, 
transparency, empowerment and access to effective remedies must be ensured at all levels of the 
implementation of policies and programmes. 
</p>
<p>27. Bolivia is also party to the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169 
on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples (1989) which specifically protects the rights of indigenous 
peoples. Under this Convention, the Government is required to respect the rights of indigenous

</p>
<p>peoples to land and territories (arts. 13 to 17), including their collective aspects. These articles 
also require that indigenous peoples are not displaced from their lands, and that their rights to 
natural resources on their lands are safeguarded, including their right to participate in the use, 
management and conservation of these resources, and their right to be consulted and to assess 
any exploitation of resources on the land they own or possess. In Bolivia, Convention No. 169 
has been adopted as part of domestic legislation (law 1257, 1991), like other international 
instruments. At the end of 2007, Bolivia was the first country to recognize as part of its domestic 
law the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the 
General Assembly in resolution 61/295. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Domestic constitutional and legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p>28. A Constituent Assembly was elected in July 2006, composed of 255 members, 
including 88 women, with the mandate to elaborate a new constitution. The new constitution was 
adopted by the Constitutional Assembly on 14 December 2007 and a referendum will be 
organized in 2008, allowing the people to accept or reject it. The drafting of this new constitution 
represented a unique opportunity for Bolivia to reaffirm the rights of those who have been 
historically excluded and oppressed. As the Vice-President &#193;lvaro Garc&#237;a Linera stated: &#8220;this is 
the best moment to recreate and reinvent a new legal community in which all Bolivians will feel 
included&#8221;.<b>32</b> It also represented a unique opportunity for the right to food to be recognized as a 
fundamental human right of all Bolivians. 
</p>
<p>29. The new constitution recognizes the right to food and the right to water as fundamental 
human rights of all Bolivians, with the correlative obligation of the State to guarantee food 
security, through safe, sufficient and adequate food for the whole population (art. 16). It also 
recognizes the direct applicability of all human rights, including the rights to health, housing, 
labour, basic services and social security, the specific rights of the most vulnerable, including 
children and the elderly, and the rights of the original indigenous and peasant people and nations, 
including their collective rights to land and territories. It also states that public expenses and 
national investments will be allocated, through participatory mechanisms, on a priority basis to 
social issues including food policies (art. 321); that genetically modified organisms are 
prohibited (art. 256); and that international human rights instruments proclaiming more 
favourable rights than the constitution shall take precedence (art. 257). 
</p>
<p>30. Bolivia&#8217;s existing constitution also sets out very important principles that have been 
reaffirmed in the new constitution. It recognizes the diversity of the population of Bolivia, its 
multi-ethnicity and multiculturalism (art. 1). It prohibits any form of discrimination and 
guarantees equality between men and women (art. 6). It also recognizes that the rights to life, 
health and security, the right to a fair remuneration, sufficient to ensure a dignified existence for 
the worker and his/her family, and the right to a healthy environment are fundamental human 
rights (art. 7). It also provides that the State must recognize, respect and protect the economic,

<p>social and cultural rights of indigenous people living in Bolivia, in particular their rights to lands 
of origin (under the Tierra Comunitaria de Or&#237;gen framework), to the sustainable use of natural 
resources, to identity, values, customs and institutions (art. 171). 
</p>
<p>31. Bolivia&#8217;s legislative framework does not include a national law on the right to food or on 
food security, which would be important in determining the objectives and responsibilities of the 
relevant ministries and ensuring their coordinated activities. However, there are a large number 
of other laws, decrees and regulations that are of particular relevance for the realization of the 
right to food. This includes the <i>Ley de Reconducci&#243;n Comunitaria de la Reforma Agraria </i>(2006) 
which outlines the system for regulating collective land titles for indigenous territories and 
indigenous communities, land for small farmers, and land for industrial farming (<i>empresa 
agropecuaria</i>). The law also established the National Institute for Agrarian Reform (INRA), 
charged with identifying and reclaiming unproductive or illegally obtained landholdings for 
redistribution to the landless. The <i>Ley del Medio Ambiente</i> (1992) protecting natural resources 
and the rights of indigenous people and farming communities against the negative activities of 
industrial and extractive companies and the <i>Ley de Fomento de la Lactancia Materna y 
Comercializaci&#243;n de sus Suced&#225;neos </i>(2006) promoting exclusive maternal breastfeeding for 
children under six months and prohibiting marketing of substitutes, in accordance with the 
International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, are also of particular relevance for 
the protection of right to food. 
</p>
<p>32. On the issue of water, the Government promulgated the <i>Ley de Promoci&#243;n y Apoyo al 
Sector de Riego para la Producci&#243;n Agropecuaria y Forestal</i> in October 2004, better known as 
the <i>Ley de Riego</i>. This law recognizes traditional water rights and uses and guarantees the right 
to water for irrigation for indigenous and farming communities. In February 2006, the new 
Government created a Ministry of Water to coordinate and oversee water issues through 
Law No. 3351. The Ministry is in the process of drafting framework legislation on drinking 
water and sanitation systems which would expressly recognize access to water and water 
services for human consumption as basic human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Access to justice and human rights institutions 
</b>33. Bolivia has a complex legal system, which includes State law and courts at the municipal, 
departmental and national levels, as well as customary law and traditional justice in areas of 
indigenous peoples. The Constitutional Tribunal has a special mandate to protect and enforce the 
constitution. The existing constitution, as well as the new constitution, guarantees free access to 
justice for the poor (art. 16) and victims of a violation of a fundamental right can use the 
procedure of <i>amparo</i> (right to request a review of the constitutionality of a judgement or act) to 
claim their rights before the superior courts at the departmental level and the Constitutional 
Tribunal (art. 19). In practice, however, access to justice for victims of violations of human 
rights, including the right to food, is limited.<b>33</b> Problems include the non-application of 
international human rights treaties and conventions by judges, corruption and the lack of

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>independence of the judiciary. Indigenous peoples have particular difficulties in obtaining access 
to justice, given discrimination, the lack of legal interpreters, and the non-recognition of 
customary law and indigenous legal authorities. The compatibility and complementarity of 
modern and customary laws and systems of justice could be improved by the adoption of the 
draft law on the administration of justice of the original indigenous people and peasants 
community, in discussion at the national Congress, and by the adoption of the new constitution, 
which is very progressive in terms of access to justice in cases of violations of human rights. 
34. In 1997, reforms to improve the efficiency and accountability of the judiciary and to 
broaden access to justice led to the establishment of three new institutions: the Constitutional 
Tribunal, the Judicial Council and the Office of the Ombudsman (<i>Defensor del Pueblo</i>). 
The Office of the Ombudsman is independent and is currently headed by the courageous and 
outspoken Ombudsman, Waldo Albarrac&#237;n S&#225;nchez. The Ombudsman has improved protection 
for vulnerable groups and individuals through mediation, conciliation, quasi-judicial decisions 
and legal assistance, as well as monitoring violations. His office has also put a special emphasis 
on many issues related to the right to food, including the right to land, labour rights, the right to a 
healthy environment, the rights of indigenous people, the rights of children and the rights of 
women. In view of the prospect of a new constitution that recognizes the right to food and the 
right to water as fundamental human rights, the Special Rapporteur hopes that this focus will 
continue and that the office will be provided with adequate human and financial resources. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR THE RIGHT TO FOOD 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Government policies and institutions 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the personal commitment of President 
Evo Morales to the realization of the right to food. Fighting malnutrition has been made a key 
priority of his Government, through its Zero Malnutrition Programme, as well as other initiatives 
to promote food security and food sovereignty, land reform and the rights of indigenous peoples 
that should contribute to the realization of the right to food for all Bolivians. 
</p>
<p>36. The Zero Malnutrition Programme focuses on eradicating malnutrition amongst children 
under the age of five (with special emphasis on children up to the age of two, as well as pregnant 
women in poor areas), aiming to arrest the vicious cycle of malnutrition that limits their physical 
and intellectual development. The Ministry of Health is charged with implementing the 
programme, using a multisectoral approach which recognizes the multiple causes of malnutrition 
and food insecurity. This will address all the factors that limit physical and economic access to 
food - including lack of nutritional information, the high prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases given 
the lack of access to safe drinking water, discrimination and the lack of access to land and other 
productive resources. In April 2006, the institutional framework for fighting hunger was 
strengthened through the establishment of an intersectoral coordinating technical body of the 
National Council for Food and Nutrition (CONAN), which brings together all the relevant 
Ministries. CONAN&#8217;s technical committee has made the promotion of the right to food one of its 
key priorities, elaborating new projects, such as the new draft <i>Ley del Desayuno Escolar</i>, to be 
implemented by departmental and municipal authorities. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts of the Government to attempt 
to redistribute revenues in favour of the poorest groups of society, including children and the </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/5/Add.2 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>elderly. The Government&#8217;s Supreme Decree No. 28899 of October 2006 set up a social 
programme called <i>Bono Juancito Pinto</i> which grants 200 bolivianos per school year to 
schoolchildren so that they can buy school materials. This programme aims to support poor 
families, allowing them to supplement their meagre budget to buy additional foodstuffs. It is 
reported that in 2007 this programme benefited more than 1 million children from over 
13,000 schools. In addition, the Government recently approved the establishment of a social 
programme for the elderly, called <i>Renta Vitalicia Dignidad</i>, to be financed from the income tax 
from hydrocarbons. This programme aims to grant 200 bolivianos to each person over the age 
of 60 not currently receiving any type of pension. It is envisaged that the programme will reach 
approximately 800,000 persons. 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur found that there was no comprehensive food security policy yet in 
place, but the Ministry of Agriculture has been charged with developing policies and regulatory 
legislation on food security and food sovereignty. The Minister of Agriculture informed the 
Special Rapporteur that there will be a new focus on food sovereignty. This will prioritize 
local production and will invest in small-scale family agriculture. The Minister believes that this 
will be the first time in Bolivia&#8217;s history that the Government&#8217;s efforts will focus primarily on 
small-scale agriculture, rather than on measures to support large-scale agro-industry. The 
Special Rapporteur believes that, given the importance of agricultural livelihoods to millions of 
Bolivia&#8217;s poor, this new focus will have a positive impact on the realization of the right to food 
for Bolivia&#8217;s small farmers. 
</p>
<p>39. In May 2006, the Government also launched a programme to revitalize land reform in 
Bolivia under the responsibility of INRA (<i>Instituto Nacional de Reforma Agraria</i> or National 
Agrarian Reform Institute). This will improve access to land for <i>campesinos</i>, communities and 
rural families. It will also give priority to eliminating the feudal practices of bonded labour 
(which still exist in the <i>Oriente</i>), as well as recognizing traditional forms of land tenure and 
restituting the lands of indigenous communities. The programme aims to speed up the process of 
land regularization to clarify existing land titles. In addition, INRA has been granted new powers 
to allocate existing public lands to landless <i>campesinos</i>, and to expropriate land for redistribution 
if this is unproductive and held for no productive economic or social use. 
</p>
<p>40. In June 2006, the Government also presented a new National Development Plan that is 
focused on reducing extreme poverty and inequality and redressing centuries of social exclusion 
and discrimination against indigenous peoples. The Plan sets concrete objectives, including 
reducing the percentage of the population living in poverty, from 58.9 per cent to 49.7 per cent 
and those living in extreme poverty from 34.5 per cent to 27.2 per cent by 2011, as well as 
reducing inequality. The minimum wage was also increased by 18.6 per cent to address 
extremely low salaries, although this is very difficult to enforce as 66 per cent of Bolivia&#8217;s 
workers are engaged in the informal sector. 
</p>
<p>41. The institutional and policy framework for access to water has also been substantially 
strengthened with the creation of the new Ministry of Water. Given widespread social protests 
against privatization, the establishment of this Ministry is seen as key for elaborating a coherent 
national water strategy, even though municipalities will retain responsibilities in their regions. 
A new National Water Plan has been elaborated and the Government has announced concrete 
objectives to ensure access to drinking water for 1.9 million people and sanitation for 2 million 
people by 2010. The framework legislation governing access to drinking water and sanitation </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/5/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>currently being developed will explicitly recognize access to water and water services for human 
consumption as a human right. The new law will also set out mechanisms to regulate the quality 
of water and sanctions for water pollution caused by industry or mining. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  United Nations specialized agencies and bilateral assistance 
</b></p>
<p>42. The United Nations country team has also agreed in its development assistance framework 
(UNDAF) to support the Government&#8217;s Zero Malnutrition Programme and other programmes 
that promote the right to food within the framework of its support to food sovereignty.<b>34</b> A joint 
programme on malnutrition brings together WFP, FAO, UNICEF (the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the United Nations Population Fund 
(UNFPA) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and 
emphasizes nutritional education, supplementary feeding with fortified food and access to water, 
as well as promoting food security and food sovereignty. FAO is developing a specific 
programme to support the right to food. WFP is also providing emergency food assistance to 
victims of the recent floods and other emergencies and, in accordance with Government 
guidelines, 80 per cent of WFP&#8217;s food aid is purchased locally. The Special Rapporteur visited 
one impressive WFP and FAO programme which works with the municipality of El Alto on 
nutritional security, constructing family vegetable greenhouses, and promoting appropriate 
technologies that allow plants to flourish at an altitude of 4,000 metres, even in freezing winters. 
</p>
<p>43. Bolivia also receives important assistance from bilateral development agencies. 
Switzerland&#8217;s bilateral assistance programme for example, through the Swiss Development 
Cooperation, has made working with Bolivia a key priority and has dedicated CHF 26 million to 
a variety of programmes, including projects on food security and malnutrition. Cuba assists 
Bolivia through financing the building of 26 hospitals in the poorest regions. Cuban doctors have 
also been sent to assist thousands of poor Bolivian families who have not previously had access 
to medical treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Social movements and non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>44. Social movements, indigenous movements, women&#8217;s movements, trade unions and civil 
society organizations are a powerful force in Bolivia and have been the driving force behind 
public protests for greater social justice and equal rights for all Bolivians. Civil society 
movements and organizations have pushed for more direct forms of participation in government 
where the people have a greater voice and role in policymaking. This has become possible with 
the election of President Evo Morales who has committed to opening up policymaking to 
participation and focusing on eradicating extreme poverty and malnutrition. 
</p>
<p>45. Human rights organizations have also had an important impact, with the <i>Cap&#237;tulo 
Boliviano de Derechos Humanos, Democracia y Desarrollo </i>and the <i>Asamblea Permanente de 
Derechos Humanos de Bolivia </i>(APDHB) monitoring human rights in Bolivia. Until recently 
most human rights organizations have not traditionally worked on economic, social and cultural

</p>
<p>rights, but this is now changing as human rights and development organizations have come 
together in putting forward proposals to the Constituent Assembly. For example, a network of 
125 organizations under the umbrella of the <i>Asociaci&#243;n de Instituciones de Promoci&#243;n y 
Educaci&#243;n</i> (AIPE) has drawn up a proposal to include the right to adequate food in the new 
constitution, after conducting awareness-raising and consultations across the country. 
Organizations working with <i>Agua Sustentable</i> have also advocated national laws on water issues 
and the inclusion of the right to water in the constitution.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p>46. There are also many social and development non-governmental organizations contributing 
to the realization of the right to food in Bolivia. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to 
visit two schools in Oruro which provide 280 children aged between 5 and 12 from extremely 
poor families with access to daily food and basic education. The schools are directed by Julia 
and Fernando Sandalio who receive financial support from Emmaus France and Emmaus 
Switzerland. The French NGO <i>Voix Libre</i> finances daily food and basic education for more 
than 15,000 children from poor mining families so that they are not forced into child labour in 
the mines. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  MAIN FINDINGS AND CONCERNS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Progressive realization of the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>47. Given its commitments under international and domestic law to the right to food, the 
Government of Bolivia has a legal obligation to ensure the progressive realization of the right to 
food over time, to the maximum of its available resources. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the positive progress made in reducing malnutrition and 
poverty, but is concerned that the situation of malnutrition and food insecurity in Bolivia remains 
grave. Chronic malnutrition of a large proportion of Bolivia&#8217;s infant children is of most concern, 
as they may be permanently affected by stunted physical and intellectual development. 
Malnutrition levels fell from 28.3 per cent to 24.2 per cent between 1994 and 2003, but there 
have been recent signs of regression, particularly in the departments of Potosi, Beni and Pando.<b>36</b> 
Although infant mortality rates have fallen, Bolivia still has the second-highest infant mortality 
rate in Latin America.<b>37</b> High levels of extreme poverty affecting about 35 per cent of the

<p> 
</p>
<p>population (and more than two thirds of people living in some regions) means that millions of 
Bolivians remain so poor that they cannot afford sufficient food to meet daily calorific 
requirements. Although there has been some progress over the last 10 years, it has been very 
slow. In some regions the situation is far worse, such as in Potosi and Chuquisaca, where the 
number of people living in extreme poverty remains well above 60 per cent. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur was also concerned to find that before 2006, the maximum of 
available resources had not been invested in guaranteeing the right to food for all Bolivians. 
Expenditure has not focused on effective nutritional programmes or improving the productivity 
of small-scale agriculture. Therefore the Special Rapporteur particularly welcomes the 
commitment of this Government to devoting greater resources to fighting malnutrition, food 
insecurity and poverty. The Special Rapporteur is very encouraged by the new tax arrangements 
under the Hydrocarbon Law in 2005 and the 2006 Presidential Decree, given the massive 
increases in revenue that have swelled the Government budget and the fact that the Zero 
Malnutrition programme, along with other similar programmes, will be a priority for 
expenditure. Given decentralization and the fact that local municipalities and <i>prefecturas</i> receive 
60 per cent of this tax directly, the Special Rapporteur would encourage a coherent strategy 
across the different regions to encourage all municipalities to ensure that priority for expenditure 
is given to addressing malnutrition and food insecurity. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Violations of the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>50. Given its commitments to the right to food, Bolivia has the obligation to respect, protect 
and fulfil the right to food, without discrimination. The Special Rapporteur was concerned to 
receive verbal reports from a number of organizations on violations of the right to food, 
particularly related to the displacement and eviction of families from their lands, the persistence 
of bonded labour and failure to pay minimum wages, and the pollution of water resources and 
contamination of fish stocks. However the Special Rapporteur was surprised that he received 
information on very few documented cases of specific violations during his visit. He believes 
that this may be due not so much to the lack of cases, but rather because most cases are not 
recorded as there are still very few organizations working from a right to food perspective in 
Bolivia. This suggests an urgent need for training to develop a better understanding of the right 
to food within the broader context of economic, social and cultural rights. The Special 
Rapporteur did receive details of a number of documented cases from the Office of the 
Ombudsman and civil society organizations relating to specific cases of violations, as detailed 
below. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Failure to prevent contamination of water sources and agricultural lands 
</b></p>
<p>51. In the departments of Potosi and Oruro, several communities are reported to have 
complained officially since 2002 of the water contamination affecting their land and livestock, as 
a result of the activities of the Inti Raymi company and its mining project Kori Kollo. Acid 
drainage and heavy metals deriving from mining operations have severely contaminated water 
resources. High levels of cyanide have been recorded in the soil, reportedly contributing to high 
levels of mortality and malformation in sheep and the contamination of soil, reducing the </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/5/Add.2 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>productivity of the land.<b>38</b> This has reportedly resulted in the loss of 50 per cent of livestock, 
affecting the livelihoods of farming communities dependent on selling milk and cheese products. 
Although local state authorities ordered an environmental impact assessment to be carried out, 
this order was still to be implemented when the Special Rapporteur visited Bolivia.<b>39</b> This may 
amount to a violation if the Government has failed in its duty to protect communities against the 
activities of third parties that have negatively affected the rights of these communities to 
adequate food. 
</p>
<p>52. Approximately 100 indigenous communities in the departments of Potosi, Chuquisaca and 
Tarija are also reportedly affected by the contamination of the basin of the Pilcomayo River by 
the extractive industry. Affected communities have reported that the impact of such water 
contamination over the years has caused 80 per cent loss of agricultural production, 60 per cent 
loss of livestock and 90 per cent loss of fish, greatly affecting people&#8217;s access to sufficient and 
adequate food and means for its procurement.<b>40</b> The Special Rapporteur has been informed that 
the Office of the Ombudsman will conduct an inquiry into the contamination of the basin of the 
Pilcomayo River and recommend the appropriate remedial measures to be taken by the 
Government. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Failure to eliminate conditions of bonded labour 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur received reports that forced labour, including situations of debt 
bondage, is still practised in some sectors in Bolivia, including the sugar cane industry, the 
Brazil nut industry and on private ranches (<i>haciendas</i>) in the region of the Chaco. The majority 
of labourers are held in some form of debt bondage. Estimates indicate that in 2003 there were 
approximately 21,000 forced labourers, including women and children, in the sugar cane 
industry in the Santa Cruz area and between 5,000 and 6,000 people became forced labourers on 
a permanent or semi-permanent basis in the Brazil nut industry in the Pando and Beni (province 
of Vaca Diez) regions.<b>41</b> Of particular concern is the situation of forced labour that the 
Guaran&#237; people have to endure on some private ranches in the provinces of Santa Cruz, 
Chuquisaca and Tarija in the Chaco region. The ILO estimates that 7,000 people from the 
Guaran&#237; indigenous group are held in forced labour although the Government&#8217;s figures in 1999 
referred to 3,179 people (578 families living on 106 ranches). They are held in debt bondage and 
in some cases threats and violence are common to prevent them from leaving the ranches. As

<p>they are paid extremely low wages which do not cover their basic living costs, they are forced to 
rely on credit from their employers. In addition, women and children are expected to work but 
are not paid at all. The Guaran&#237; families on these ranches are rarely given any land to cultivate 
their own crops.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>3.  Failure to regulate advertising of milk formulas 
</b></p>
<p>54. While national law and policy promote breastfeeding to fight under-nutrition of babies and 
infants, this is reportedly being undermined by aggressive marketing by corporations (including 
Nestl&#233;) promoting milk formulas that suggests that these formulas are more nutritious than 
breast milk. The Special Rapporteur received documented information of the persistence of 
aggressive marketing which contravened the national <i>Ley de Fomento a la Lactancia Materna y 
Comercializaci&#243;n de sus Suced&#225;neos </i>as well as the international standards encoded in the 
International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed that much of the obvious publicity by corporations would be banned after the adoption 
of the new regulation concretizing the national law. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Failure to provide adequate food and nutrition in prisons 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur visited the prison of San Pedro in La Paz. He was alarmed by the 
nutritional status of many detainees in the prison, as the nutritional quality of the food does not 
meet international standards. The Government reached the same conclusion after a report was 
issued recognizing that many people in the prisons of San Pedro, Miraflores, Chonchocoro 
and Obrajes are underweight. Recently, the Government increased the daily payment for food 
per prisoner from 3.5 to 4.5 Bolivianos per day. This should improve the situation, but it is still 
essential to improve the nutritional value of the food distributed to prisoners. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Obstacles to the realization of the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>56. Clear obstacles to realizing the right to food of all Bolivians include discrimination, social 
exclusion and high levels of inequality, as well as the legacies of a colonial social structure. 
Previous administrations have prioritized an exclusionary economic model that has marginalized 
the poor and indigenous and failed to challenge the structures of clientelism and patronage of the 
traditional ruling elite. Bolivia has undertaken more economic reforms in line with the 
Washington Consensus than almost all developing countries.<b>42</b> However, the economic reforms 
and shock therapy policies imposed since 1985 have focused on generating export-led economic 
growth, rather than on poverty reduction. Liberalization, privatization and fiscal reform have 
been successful in controlling inflation, but have not delivered on the promises of trickle down to 
the majority of Bolivians. Most economic growth and foreign investment has occurred in export 
sectors such as oil, gas, mining and agro-industry, but these provide little employment in the 
economy and therefore have not contributed sufficiently to poverty reduction. Oil and gas now

</p>
<p>account for over 50 per cent of Bolivia&#8217;s export earnings, but employ only 1 per cent of the 
population.<b>43</b> The approval of the hydrocarbons tax will therefore allow for greater equity in the 
distribution of Bolivia&#8217;s natural wealth. 
</p>
<p>57. The promotion of investment in the export-oriented agro-industry has also failed to benefit 
the vast majority of small subsistence farmers. Despite the importance of small-scale agriculture 
in generating employment, there has been little investment in this kind of agriculture, particularly 
in the altiplano. Trade liberalization has also left small farmers facing unfair competition from 
the dumping of highly subsidized imports, including wheat, driving rapid urbanization over the 
last 30 years.<b>44</b> The lack of a human rights culture that recognizes the economic, social and 
cultural rights of all Bolivians appears to be behind the demands of social movements for a new 
constitution. The adoption of a new constitution that protects the human right to adequate food 
and all human rights for all will therefore mark a new start. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>The Special Rapporteur found that Bolivia was in a dramatic moment of transition. 
Concrete change is essential to resolve serious social crisis and past failures to eradicate 
malnutrition and extreme poverty. He was impressed by the efforts of the current 
Government to focus attention on the tragedy of malnutrition and extreme poverty that 
affects such a large proportion of the population. He welcomes the President&#8217;s success in 
increasing the budget of the Government to ensure that all Bolivians benefit from its oil 
and gas exports. Redistribution of some of the benefits of Bolivia&#8217;s natural wealth should 
enable the Government to begin to redress expanding inequalities and help to realize the 
right to food for all Bolivians. The adoption of the new constitution that recognizes the 
right to food of all Bolivians would be an important step towards this change.</b>  
</p>
<p>59. <b>Finally, the Special Rapporteur would like to offer some recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The new constitution, recognizing the right to food and the right to water as 
fundamental rights, should be adopted. It would provide a useful framework for the right 
to food in Bolivia. The practical implications of its main principles, such as the recognition 
of the direct applicability of all human rights, including the rights to food and water, and of 
the international human rights treaties, should be explained through a national campaign. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Framework laws on the right to food and the right to water should be adopted 
to fully entrench these rights, and allow for the identification of concrete goals, monitoring 
mechanisms and the allocation of responsibilities across all relevant ministries. Due 
consideration should be given to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
general comment No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food (art. 11) and the FAO 
Voluntary Guidelines to support the progressive realization of the right to adequate food in

<p><b>the context of national food security. All relevant actors should participate in this process, 
including the Government, the Office of the Ombudsman, civil society, including social 
movements, and all the United Nations agencies. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Mechanisms of empowerment and accountability, and the possibility for victims 
to have access to effective remedies in case of violations of the right to food should be 
strengthened. The administration of justice should be more transparent and available for 
victims, including indigenous communities. The Office of the Ombudsman should create a 
special unit working on the right to food and the right to water, provided with adequate 
human and financial resources. The Government should take due account of all the 
recommendations of the Ombudsman. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) A comprehensive national development strategy for food security and food 
sovereignty, framed around the right to food, should be elaborated and implemented. The 
strategy should reflect the obligations of the State to respect, protect, and fulfil the right to 
food without discrimination. The strategy should focus on eradicating malnutrition and on 
reversing the extreme inequality that has resulted from export-orientated trade in 
agriculture, by investing in small-scale peasant agriculture, implementing effective 
agrarian reform and protecting the rights of peasants and indigenous peoples over their 
land, water and own seeds. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The Government should accord the maximum of available resources to ensure 
that constant progress is made in combating the tragedy of malnutrition and extreme 
poverty. This must include directing new resources from the hydrocarbon tax directly to 
the Zero Malnutrition Programme and the programme <i>Renta Vitalicia Dignidad</i>, both at 
the national level and at the municipal level. As 60 per cent of the increased State revenues 
from the direct hydrocarbon tax is allocated directly to municipalities and <i>prefecturas</i>, 
these regional administrations must be encouraged to direct these funds towards these 
programme priorities. The progressive realization of the right to food should be monitored 
as part of the Government&#8217;s national policy. Indicators should include not only statistics on 
malnutrition, but also statistics on under-nourishment, poverty and inequality. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The eradication of slave-like conditions of bonded labour must be a priority and 
all labourers should be freed from their debt or other forms of bondage. The programme 
of agrarian reform should also be speeded up to regularize land titles, improve protection 
of the lands of indigenous communities and improve access to land for <i>campesinos</i>, 
communities and rural families.
