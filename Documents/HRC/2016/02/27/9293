<p><b>I. INTRODUCTION</b> 
 
</p>
<p>1. The mandate of the independent expert on minority issues as established in 
Commission on Human Rights Resolution 2005/79, requires the independent expert <i>inter alia 
</i>to &#8220;promote the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to 
National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities (Henceforth the 1992 Declaration on 
Minorities), including through consultations with Governments, taking into account existing 
international standards and national legislation concerning minorities&#8221; (para. 6 (a)).  
 
</p>
<p>2. In pursuance of the above requirement, the independent expert receives information 
from diverse sources including UN Member States and non-governmental organizations 
regarding challenges to implementation of the 1992 Declaration on Minorities and alleged 
violations of the rights of persons belonging to minority groups. She also seeks information 
regarding good practice in regard to legislation, policy and practice to respect, promote and 
protect the rights of persons belonging to minorities. On the basis of information received, 
and in order to solicit additional information from relevant States, the independent expert 
consults with governments through sending communications in the form of letters of 
allegation, urgent appeals and thematic communications. 
 
</p>
<p>3. This addendum to the report of the independent expert is the first such addendum to be 
presented to the Human Rights Council by the independent expert. It therefore provides 
summaries of letters of allegation and urgent appeals sent by the independent expert from 29 
July 2005 (the date of the appointment of the independent expert by the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights) to 25 December 2007 as well as summaries of Government replies 
received. In addition it presents thematic communications sent to UN Member States over the 
same period and notes responses received.  
 
</p>
<p>4. The independent expert&#8217;s criteria for her communications are based on the 1992 
Declaration on Minorities and other relevant international standards, from which she has 
identified four broad areas of concern relating to minorities globally. These are: (a) the 
protection of a minority&#8217;s survival and existence within a territory or state, including through 
combating violence against them, forced expulsion and  genocide; (b) the protection and 
promotion of  the cultural identity of minority groups, and the right of national, ethnic, 
religious or linguistic groups to enjoy their collective identity and to reject forced 
assimilation; (c) the guarantee of the rights to non-discrimination and equality, including 
ending structural or systemic discrimination and the promotion of affirmative action when 
required; and (d) the guarantee of the right to effective participation of members of minorities 
in public life, especially with regard to decisions that affect them.  
 
</p>
<p>5. In March 2007 the independent expert&#8217;s report to the fourth session of the United 
Nations Human Rights Council focused on minorities, poverty and the Millennium 
Development Goals (document A/HRC/4/9). A thematic addendum to that report &#8220;Achieving 
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for Minorities: A Review of MDG Country 
Reports and Poverty Reduction Strategies&#8221; (A/HRC/4/9/Add.1) sought to provide a deeper 
analysis of the MDG reports and selected Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers of 50 States in 
order to identify good practices of States in all regions as well as continuing challenges to 
ensuring that the MDG&#8217;s are met for minorities.  
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/23/Add.1

</p>
<p>6. On 17 April 2007 the independent expert sent a letter to each of the 50 States 
surveyed1.  The letter sought further consultation with Governments, in order to gain their 
views and further information on policies and practice relating to minorities, poverty and the 
MDGs. The objective was to highlight successful practices, identify challenges and 
possibilities for technical cooperation, and benefit from the useful experiences of these 
Governments. The independent expert wishes to thank the Government of Sudan for its 
response and encourages other States to provide additional information as requested.  
 
</p>
<p>7. On 6 and 7 December 2007 the independent expert convened an expert consultation 
on the issue of the discriminatory denial or deprivation of citizenship as a tool for the 
exclusion of minorities.  The seminar served as a means to benefit from the knowledge and 
experiences of affected communities, regional experts, UN bodies and agencies, 
representatives of regional inter-governmental institutions and civil society. The outcomes of 
this seminar form the thematic focus of the annual report of the independent expert to the 
Human Rights Council seventh session in March 2007 (A/HRC/7/23). In accordance with her 
mandate requirements to consult with States and identify best practices, on 15 October 2007 
the independent expert also sent a letter and questionnaire to all UN Member States 
requesting information on issues related to minorities and citizenship.  
 
</p>
<p>8. The independent expert wishes to thank the following States for their responses to this 
questionnaire and notes that such responses will be included on her website: Albania, 
Argentina, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Boznia and Herzogovina, 
Canada, Colombia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Djibouti, Ecuador, El Salvador, 
Estonia, Georgia, Germany, Guatemala, Guyana, Hungary, Ireland, Iraq, Italy, Japan, 
Mauritius, Norway, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, Romania, Russian Federation, Singapore, 
Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Turkey, Uruguay, Uzbekistan.  
 
</p>
<p>9. During the period covered by this addendum, the independent expert sent 26 
communications to 19 countries and to the United Nations Mission in Kosovo2 (UNMIK). 
The independent expert has received 9 replies to letters of allegation and urgent appeals sent 
during the period under consideration. All of the letters of allegation and urgent appeals sent 
by the independent expert were joint communications undertaken with other Special 
Procedures mandate holders as indicated in the summary of communications below. By 
joining the communications of other mandate holders, the independent expert seeks to 
highlight that many rights violations that fall within the purview of other mandates have as 
their impetus discrimination against or the repression of minority groups identified by 
ethnicity, religion or language.   
 
</p>
<p>10. To avoid duplication, the independent expert has briefly summarized the joint 
communications sent and replies received and provided references to the reports of other 
mandate holders where full details are provided.

<p><b>II. SUMMARIES OF CASES TRANSMITTED AND REPLIES RECEIVED 
</b>

<p><b>Bangladesh 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal  
 
</b></p>
<p>11. On 10 August 2007, the independent expert sent a joint urgent appeal to the 
Government of Bangladesh regarding reported proceedings initiated against the President of 
the Dhaka Chapter of the Human Rights Congress for Bangladesh Minorities (HRCBM), a 
human rights defender and member of the Hindu minority community in Bangladesh. This 
urgent appeal was sent by the independent expert jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing<b> </b>as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders<b>.</b> The independent expert expressed concern that proceedings brought against this 
individual may be in retaliation for his work in the defense of the rights of a minority group. 
Further details of this communication are available in the report of the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living 
(A/HRC/7/16/Add.1). 
 
</p>
<p><b>Government reply 
</b> 
</p>
<p>12. By letter dated 15 January 2008, the Government of Bangladesh informed the 
independent expert that the allegations of relating to the rights of the stated individual, 
including the right to freedom of expression and allegations of torture practiced against him 
were unfounded. Concerning the eviction at the Bhananipur Temple, the Government 
reported that this individual was not present when it occurred. Furthermore, no allegations of 
torture practiced against this individual were submitted to the Court in this case. 
 
</p>
<p>13. The Government further informed the independent expert that the arrest was 
connected to another incident. According to the Government, he was accused of having 
allegedly threatened the local Upazilla Nirbahi Officer. An investigation was carried out and 
on completion this investigation was submitted to the Court. The President of the Dhaka 
Chapter of the Human Rights Congress for Bangladesh Minorities appeared before the Court 
voluntarily and was then granted bail on appeal. The Government further asserts that the 
allegations concerning threats directed against this individual are equally unfounded. Neither 
was he arrested. Further details of this response are provided in the report of the Special 
Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living 
(A/HRC/7/16/Add.1).

</b></p>
<p>30. By letter dated 3 August 2007, the Government denounced the allegations as 
unwarranted and in contradiction with international reports noting the progress made through 
the poverty alleviation programs, assisting rural ethnic groups, including the Hmong ethnic 
group. The Government claimed that the Lao PDR Government takes pride in maintaining a 
high degree of ethnic diversity. 
 
</p>
<p>31. The Government informed the independent expert that the Lao PDR Government has 
a long-term socio-economic development strategy with a view to moving the country out of 
least developed status by the year 2020. This strategy aims to achieve the overall policy 
objectives of the Lao PDR to bring about wealth and prosperity to all Lao ethnic people 
without any discrimination, which strategy according to the Government has been successful 
in reducing poverty and in line with its National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy. 
The Government explained that he adopted 11 major programs and 111 projects to implement 
this strategy. The Government further informed the independent expert about the Prime 
Ministerial Decree on the Establishment of Villages and Communes for Development, issued

<p><b>Government reply 
 
</b></p>
<p>33. On 11 October 2007, the Government informed the independent expert that upon 
examining the allegations the Government concluded that the information was unfounded and 
that discrimination based on tribal, ethnic or religious status does not exist in Libya. 
According to the Government, Libyan society has a cohesive structure and all citizens enjoy 
their rights on the basis of equality, as provided in the Great Green Document on Human 
Rights in the Age of the Masses and the Promotion of Freedom Act. All citizens are equal 
before the law in respect of their rights and obligations. 
 
</p>
<p>34. The Government further explained that the claim that people are prevented from using 
their tribal names is also unfounded. According to Decision No. 3 of 2007 issued by the 
Secretariat of the General People&#8217;s Committee and judgments handed down in 
implementation of Act No. (24) 1369 MWR [from the death of the Prophet], it is permitted to 
register the names of ascendants, names conveying meanings that are authentically Libyan or 
names that are passed down from ascendants to descendants in keeping with recognized 
Libyan traditions and customs. The allegation that persons who work for the defense of the 
Berber community, culture and identity are harassed and ill-treated is groundless. If it were 
true, then the names of those subjected to such treatment would have been provided. If such 
acts occurred, Libyan legislation would punish them. Further details of this response are 
provided in the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance (A/HRC/7/19/Add.1, Para.113-117).

</p>
<p><b>Government reply 
 
</b></p>
<p>42. On 20 February 2007, the Government replied to the communication of 25 October 
</p><p>2006. It indicated that the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and the 
Federal Migration Service exercise the authority to prevent and put a stop to administrative 
offences, enforce public order and monitor compliance by foreigners and stateless persons 
with the rules governing residence and temporary sojourn in the Russian Federation. They 
apply the law without exception to all foreigners irrespective of their citizenship, and, 
consequently, there is no emphasis placed on detecting violations of federal law by Georgian 
citizens in particular. In this regard, it was pointed out that Georgians constitute nowhere near 
the majority of the illegal migrants deported from Russia; migrants from Central Asia, for 
example, are far more numerous. 
 
</p>
<p>43. The Government provided information on the case of the deportation and death of Mr

States to the former SFRY, pensions, the retroactive effect of the right of residence.  
 
</p>
<p>46. As far as immigrant Roma are concerned, the Government noted that they have the 
same rights and obligations as Slovenian citizens provided they hold this status. Some 
important rights, especially for Roma, are also granted on the basis of permanent residence 
(e.g. social subvention, which is allocated to approximately 90 per cent of Roma living in 
Slovenia). Otherwise, they enjoy the rights applicable to them as aliens, in conformity with 
international rules and national legislation. They also may exercise some additional rights
