of their liberty and to inform the Working Group of the steps they have taken; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Encourages</i> all States: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To give due consideration to the recommendations of the Working Group;

<p> (<i>b</i>) To take appropriate measures to ensure that their legislation, regulations and 
practices remain in conformity with the relevant international standards and the applicable 
international legal instruments; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To respect and promote the right of anyone who is arrested or detained on a criminal 
charge to be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorized by law to exercise 
judicial power and to be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To respect and promote the right of anyone who is deprived of his/her liberty by 
arrest or detention to be entitled to bring proceedings before a court, in order that the court may 
decide without delay on the lawfulness of his/her detention and order his/her release if the 
detention is not lawful, in accordance with their international obligations; </p>

<p> </p>
<p> 2 
</p>

in mind relevant recommendations of the Working Group; 
</p>

asylum-seekers are protected from arbitrary arrest and detention and to take action to prevent any 
form of arbitrary deprivation of liberty of immigrants and asylum-seekers, and notes with 
appreciation that some States have successfully implemented alternative measures to detention 
for undocumented migrants; 
</p>

consideration to responding favourably to its requests for visits so that it may carry out its 
mandate even more effectively;

to the urgent appeals addressed to them by the Working Group on a strictly humanitarian basis 
and without prejudging its possible final conclusions; 
</p>

the Working Group and responded to its requests for information, and invites all States 
concerned to demonstrate the same spirit of cooperation; 
</p>

some of the individuals whose situation has been brought to its attention, while deploring the 
many cases that have not yet been resolved;

necessary assistance, particularly with regard to the staffing and resources needed for the 
effective fulfilment of its mandate, especially in respect of field missions;

work.
