</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the objectives of countering violent extremism and countering 
</p>
<p>terrorism and of the protection and promotion of human rights, fundamental freedoms and 
</p>
<p>rule of law are mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p><i>Looking forward with interest</i> to the upcoming plan of action of the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General on preventing violent extremism, and reaffirming that the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>has a complementary role to play in supporting the implementation of the United Nations

</p>
<p>States, and convinced that there is no justification for violent extremism, whatever the 
</p>
<p>motivation, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that while there can be no excuse or justification for violent extremism, 
</p>
<p>abuses and violations of human rights may be among the elements that contribute to

<p>creating an environment in which people, especially youth, are vulnerable to radicalization 
</p>
<p>that leads to violent extremism and recruitment by violent extremists and terrorists,

</p>
<p>international law, in particular human rights and international humanitarian law, including 
</p>
<p>any deliberate destruction of relics and monuments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that, as affirmed in the Preamble to the Charter, the practice of tolerance is 
</p>
<p>one of the principles to be applied to attain the ends pursued by the United Nations of

</p>
<p>all human rights and fundamental freedoms of all persons, as well as tolerance, the

</p>

</p>
<p>impunity, in accordance with international law, 
</p>

</p>
<p>awareness of, and addressing the numerous and diverse conditions conducive to, the spread 
</p>
<p>of violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that States may seek to integrate poverty eradication as part of their national 
</p>
<p>strategies to address one of the conditions conducive to the spread of violent extremism, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 16/18 of 24 March 2011 on combating 
</p>
<p>intolerance, negative stereotyping and stigmatization of, and discrimination, incitement to </p>


<p>violence and violence against, persons based on religion and belief, and recalling also the 
</p>
<p>Rabat Plan of Action on the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred

</p>
<p>society approach, involving government, civil society, local and religious leaders and the 
</p>

</p>
<p>factor in governmental efforts to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms while 
</p>
<p>preventing and countering violent extremism, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that acts, methods and practices of violent extremism in all their 
</p>
<p>forms and manifestations are activities that aim to threaten the enjoyment of human rights 
</p>
<p>and fundamental freedoms, and democracy, and threaten the territorial integrity and 
</p>
<p>security of States, and destabilize legitimately constituted Governments, and that the

<p>law;

</p>
<p>5. <i>Encourages </i>States to engage with local communities and non-governmental

</p>
<p>and terrorism and address the conditions conducive to the spread of violent extremism, 
</p>
<p>including by empowering women, religious, cultural, education and local leaders, engaging 
</p>
<p>members of all concerned groups in civil society and from the private sector, adopting 
</p>
<p>tailored approaches that incorporate human rights and fundamental freedoms to prevent and 
</p>

</p>
<p>cohesion; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Stresses</i> the need to empower youth, including by means of targeted youth
