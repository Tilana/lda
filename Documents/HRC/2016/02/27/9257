</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced 
persons, Walter K&#228;lin, carried out an official mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
from 12 to 22 February 2008, at the invitation of the authorities. 
</p>
<p> Following his visit, the Representative concluded that the eastern part of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo is experiencing a situation involving a serious protection crisis and a 
serious humanitarian crisis, highlighted inter alia by the very large numbers of displaced persons. 
It is estimated that there are over 1 million such persons in the country&#8217;s four eastern regions, 
including about 800,000 in North Kivu and over 300,000 in South Kivu. In 2007 alone, more 
than 500,000 persons are reported to have been displaced, the highest number since the end of 
the civil war in 2003. 
</p>
<p> In most cases, people have been forced to leave their homes owing to clashes between the 
Congolese armed forces and the various armed groups which are present in the east of the 
country, or clashes between different armed groups. The widespread insecurity and violence 
which are prevalent in certain provinces, as a result of the abuses and human rights violations 
committed against civilians both by the armed groups and by members of the national security 
forces, have also forced many Congolese to move.  
</p>
<p> The situation in which displaced persons are living gives cause for great concern. 
According to information received by the Representative, most of the displaced persons are 
living with host families and, to a lesser degree, in informal camps or sites mostly located in 
North Kivu. The displaced persons are living in absolute poverty, in many cases having lost their 
homes, without access to drinking water or health care or education for their children. In many 
cases they are suffering from considerable food insecurity. A large number of them have lost the 
voters&#8217; cards which serve as identity cards in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and this 
increases their vulnerability.  
</p>
<p> The Representative is particularly concerned about the situation of women and children. 
Women continue to suffer from near-systematic sexual violence, while children are victims of 
forcible recruitment into the ranks of certain rebel armed factions. 
</p>
<p> The recent political developments which led to the statements of commitment signed at the 
Conference for Peace, Security and Development in North and South Kivu, held in Goma from 
6 to 23 January 2008, as well as the November 2007 Nairobi communiqu&#233;, potentially offer 
genuine opportunities for stabilization, and, for the displaced persons, a possible return home. 
Nevertheless, the process of implementation of these agreements appears complex and difficult, 
the situation remains unstable and displacements continue following localized clashes. In this 
context, there are many challenges to be met before the durable return of displaced persons 
safely and with dignity can be contemplated, even if returns have occurred in some specific 
regions. 
</p>
<p> The Representative calls on all those involved to implement the statements of commitment 
signed at the Conference for Peace, Security and Development in North and South Kivu and the 
Nairobi communiqu&#233; without delay and with unfailing political commitment. In particular, he 
recommends the adoption of a strategy focusing on the pursuit of political dialogue between the </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/6/Add.3 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p>Government, the various armed groups and the other groups concerned, as well as the boosting 
of humanitarian assistance and protection activities for the displaced population. He also 
recommends the implementation of early recovery measures where returns are already under way 
or can be contemplated 
</p>
<p> The Representative draws the attention of the Government to the need to respect the 
fundamental distinction between combatants and civilians when planning and carrying out 
security operations, and to refrain from any act prohibited by international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law. Where such violations are committed, the Representative 
recommends redoubled efforts to combat impunity by means of investigations and by bringing 
the main perpetrators of such violations to justice and guaranteeing the right of victims to justice 
and redress.  
</p>
<p> In the context of the search for durable solutions to the problem of displacement, the 
Representative recommends that the Government should engage in the following activities, with 
substantial support from the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo (MONUC): 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Reconciliation, in particular between ethnic communities 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Transitional justice and efforts to combat impunity 
&#8226; Settlement of land-related disputes 
</p>
<p> The Representative also reminds the armed groups of their obligation to respect 
international humanitarian law, in particular the fundamental distinction between combatants and 
civilians, and refrain from any act prohibited by international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p> The Representative encourages the international community to continue to provide 
substantial and sustained support to the displaced persons assistance and protection programmes 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to embark proactively on activities for economic 
reintegration, relaunching of basic services and development in regions of return. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced 
persons carried out an official mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 
12 to 22 February 2008. In keeping with his mandate, as extended by Human Rights Council 
resolution 6/32, the Representative&#8217;s mission fell within the framework of the dialogue he is 
seeking to pursue with government authorities, non-governmental organizations and all those 
concerned in order to improve the protection of the human rights of displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>2. In visiting the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Representative sought to gain a 
clearer idea of the situation of displaced persons. He also wished to work with the Government 
and all those involved to size up the challenges they are facing while endeavouring to provide 
aid and assistance to displaced persons and to explore possible durable solutions to the problem 
of internal displacement using a human rights-based approach. 
</p>
<p>3. In Kinshasa, the Representative met the ministers handling issues relating to internal 
displacement, and specifically the Minister of Justice and Human Rights, the Minister of 
Humanitarian Affairs, the Deputy Minister of the Interior, the Chef de Cabinet of the Minister 
for Foreign Affairs and the Independent Electoral Commission, as well as the representatives of 
the United Nations system and representatives of civil society. In order to gain a more immediate 
idea of the situation on the ground, the Representative travelled to the east of the country to the 
provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu and the district of Ituri, where he met representatives of 
the local authorities and humanitarian organizations, including non-governmental organizations. 
In each of the areas he visited the Representative talked to displaced persons and in some cases 
returnees and host families, so as to learn from those primarily concerned of the challenges they 
face. 
</p>
<p>4. The Representative wishes to express his gratitude to the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo for its invitation and the frank and constructive dialogue in which he was 
able to engage with the authorities he met. He also thanks the other persons he met, in the 
United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), the 
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), 
for the support he received in organizing this mission. Lastly, the Representative wishes to 
convey special thanks to all the displaced persons he had the honour to meet during his stay, who 
kindly recounted to him their stories, the difficulties they face and their dreams of hope for 
themselves and their families but also their country. 
</p>
<p>5. On the basis of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, which have been 
recognized by States as constituting an important international framework for the protection of 
internally displaced persons,<b>1</b> the Representative wishes to remind the Congolese authorities that

<p>A/HRC/8/6/Add.3

</p>
<p>States have the primary duty and responsibility to provide assistance and protection to all 
displaced persons under their jurisdiction. This responsibility stems both from treaty norms and 
from customary law, and displaced persons are granted guarantees on the same footing as any 
other persons living in the national territory. Displaced persons do not lose the rights enjoyed by 
the rest of the population as a result of their displacement. Moreover, like every other citizen, 
they have the right to demand of their Government that such protection should be provided 
(Principle 3).  
</p>
<p>6. The Representative of the Secretary-General also wishes to emphasize, with reference to 
Principle 25, that in the event of the authorities being unable to fulfil their obligations towards 
displaced persons, either because of insufficient resources or because they are unable to exercise 
control throughout the territory, it is incumbent upon them to invite other actors, in particular the 
specialized agencies and related bodies of the United Nations system, to assist them. 
</p>
<p>7. At the same time, the Guiding Principles also apply to non-State actors effectively 
controlling part of the territory, when this affects the rights of displaced persons. Thus, 
Principle 2 provides that all groups must observe the Guiding Principles and apply them without 
discrimination to displaced persons located in the area under their control and allow those who 
wish to return home to do so safely and with dignity, without this affecting their legal status. 
</p>
<p>8. The Representative considers that the principle of protection goes beyond the need to 
ensure the survival and physical integrity of displaced persons, but covers all the guarantees set 
out in international human rights law and, where applicable, in international humanitarian law.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  GENERAL CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. The phenomenon of internal displacement in the Democratic Republic  
of the Congo: background, causes and scale of the phenomenon 
</b></p>
<p>9. The recent history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is notable for two major 
armed conflicts during which millions of people lost their lives, and which displaced people on 
an unprecedented scale. The first war, which took place between 1996 and 1997, was the direct 
result of the genocide in Rwanda. Thousands of Rwandese took refuge in the eastern part of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo; they included many people who had participated in the 
genocide and who rapidly took over certain refugee camps. Intervention by the armed forces of 
the neighbouring countries and the military operations which followed displaced half the 
population of some regions, temporarily at least. Many of these people were able to return to 
their villages after a few weeks, but in mid-1997 an estimated 150,000 people were still 
displaced.<b>3</b>

</p>
<p>10. In 1998, a second war began in which several countries in the region were involved. In 
January 2000, the Secretary-General, in his report to the Security Council on MONUC, 
estimated the number of displaced persons at nearly 960,000.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>11. In January 2001, President Kabila was assassinated and replaced by Joseph Kabila. 
In 2002, a peace agreement was signed with the main rebel leaders, and a transitional 
government was installed. The period of transition which followed the signing of the agreement 
in Sun City (South Africa) made it possible to improve security considerably in most of the 
regions, creating a favourable context for the adoption of a new constitution in 2005 and the 
holding of Presidential and parliamentary elections in 2006. 
</p>
<p>12. The stabilization of the political and security situation in some regions, in particular 
the district of Ituri in Orientale province, has enabled some 850,000 people to return home 
since 2004. In Katanga, around 1 million people have returned, and it is now considered that 
there is no displacement problem. 
</p>
<p>13. However, tension remains high in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, and on the eve of the 2006 elections, dissidents led by General Nkunda had already 
resumed attacks against the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC). 
Despite the signing of an agreement with Nkunda for the integration of his troops into mixed 
brigades, fighting broke out again in August 2007, leading to further massacres and new waves 
of displaced persons. The year 2007 was considered by analysts as having seen the largest 
number of displaced persons since the end of the war in 2002: over 500,000 persons displaced, 
principally in the two Kivu provinces.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>14. In the opinion of the Representative, the signing of the Nairobi communiqu&#233; in 
November 2007 and the new developments which culminated in the statements of commitment 
signed at the Conference for Peace, Security and Development in North and South Kivu, held in 
Goma from 6 to 23 January 2008, potentially offer genuine opportunities for stabilizing the 
country which may allow the displaced persons a possible return home. Nevertheless, the process 
of implementation of these agreements appears complex and difficult, as the situation remains 
unstable in a number of regions. In the words of an observer of the situation whom the 
Representative met: &#8220;Peace agreements do not create peace. What is important is what follows 
from such agreements.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>15. Currently the Democratic Republic of the Congo is considered to be among the countries 
with the highest number of displaced persons. OCHA estimates the number at around 1.3 million 
in the country&#8217;s eastern regions. The situation is particularly disturbing in North Kivu, with an 
estimated total population of 4.2 million, and where the number of displaced persons is estimated

</p>
<p>at 800,000, or 58 per cent of the total number of displaced persons in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo. The deterioration in the security situation in this region between November 2006 and 
December 2007 often forced population groups to move more than once; the number of further 
displacements during this period is estimated at 448,000. In South Kivu, the number of displaced 
persons is estimated at nearly 330,000. As the security situation in some areas of South Kivu 
improved, some 280,000 persons were able to return to their villages during 2007. 
</p>
<p>16. In most cases, people were forced to leave their homes owing to clashes between the 
FARDC and the various armed groups which are present in the east of the country, or following 
clashes between different armed groups. The widespread insecurity and violence which are 
prevalent in certain provinces, as a result of the abuses and violations of human rights committed 
against civilians, also forced many Congolese to move. The Representative has learned of cases 
of massacres, arbitrary executions or the looting of houses and the near-systematic holding of the 
population to ransom, but also very many cases of rape, sometimes committed in a systematic 
manner, arbitrary detention and forcible recruitment of children. According to information 
received from the majority of those he met, including many displaced persons, this violence is 
mainly caused by the armed groups and bandits located in the relevant regions of North and 
South Kivu and Ituri. In North and South Kivu, the violence stems mainly from clashes 
between the FARDC and the troops of the dissident general Nkunda, who claims to be a 
protector of the interests of the Tutsi communities, on the one hand, and on the other between 
Mai-Mai groups (self-protection militias) and the Forces D&#233;mocratiques pour la Lib&#233;ration du 
Rwanda (FDLR), who are accused of harbouring in their ranks persons responsible for the 
genocide in Rwanda. However, the Representative has also been informed of many violations 
committed by the FARDC, in particular against women, which have fostered a climate of 
violence.  
</p>
<p>17. Lastly, and to a lesser degree, population displacements have also been caused by the 
natural disasters which have struck various regions of the country. For example, the recent 
earthquakes in the region of Bukavu in January 2008 or the drought and food insecurity in the 
Ruzizi plain in South Kivu in 2007 led to the displacement of a number of families. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  
</b></p>
<p>18. As the Secretary-General indicates in his latest report to the Security Council,<b>6</b> the situation 
of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains a source of concern. Many 
reports refer to summary executions, torture and cruel and degrading treatment committed by the 
FARDC and the Congolese police. In addition, cases of the forcible recruitment of children by 
armed groups in the east continue to be reported, and rapes and other forms of sexual violence 
perpetrated by combatants from various armed groups, FARDC and, increasingly, individual 
civilians are legion, and very few leaders have been obliged to answer for their actions in the 
courts.

</p>
<p>19. The question of impunity continues to be considered one of the major concerns in terms of 
protection of human rights. Although there are some encouraging signs, such as the authorities&#8217; 
efforts to cooperate with the International Criminal Court, the Representative considers that the 
conclusions reached by the Human Rights Committee on the topic remain pertinent, in particular 
when we read that &#8220;despite the information from the delegation on several criminal proceedings 
against human rights violators, the Committee notes with concern the impunity with which many 
serious human rights violations have been and continue to be committed in the territory of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, even though the identity of the perpetrators of these 
violations is often known&#8221;.<b>7</b> More recently, the Security Council, in resolution 1794 (2007), 
deplored &#8220;the persistence of violations of human rights and international humanitarian 
law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in particular those carried out by the FDLR, 
ex-FAR/Interahamwe and the dissident militia of Laurent Nkunda, as well as other militias and 
armed groups and elements of the [Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(FARDC)], the Congolese National Police (PNC) and other security and intelligence services&#8221;, 
and stressed that the Council considered it important for those responsible for these crimes to be 
brought to justice. 
20. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a party to the principal human rights 
conventions: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the first Optional 
Protocol to the Covenant, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and its two optional protocols. It is also a party to the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>21. At the regional level, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a party to the African 
Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the OAU Convention governing the Specific Aspects 
of Refugee Problems in Africa. In addition, it has ratified the Pact on Security, Stability and 
Development in the Great Lakes Region and the related protocols, in particular the Protocol on 
Protection and Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons, which sets out an important 
conceptual framework for the protection of the human rights of internally displaced persons. 
However, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has not yet ratified the African Charter on the 
Rights and Welfare of the Child, and is not yet a party to the Protocol to the African Charter on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa. 
</p>
<p>22. Where international humanitarian law is concerned, the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo is a party to the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the additional protocols 
of 8 June 1977. 
</p>
<p>23. Although the Democratic Republic of the Congo has not issued an open invitation to the 
special procedures, the Representative notes with interest that the Congolese authorities have 
invited certain mandate-holders for official visits. In addition to the independent expert on the 
situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Special Rapporteur on

<p>violence against women, its causes and consequences, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers carried out official visits in July and April 2007 respectively 
(their reports were issued under the symbols A/HRC/4/25/Add.3 and A/HRC/7/6/Add.4).<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p><b>II. RESPONSES TO THE PHENOMENON  
OF INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Response of the national authorities 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Representative welcomes the fact that the authorities are aware of the scale of the 
phenomenon of internal displacement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the 
challenges they face in responding adequately. In particular, he notes with interest the 
importance attached to this issue by the Minister of Humanitarian and Social Affairs, with whom 
he held talks, whose Ministry bears the heavy responsibility of handling assistance to displaced 
persons. In particular he welcomes the fact that, as soon as he took up his office in 2006, the 
Minister commissioned a study on the humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, which deals extensively with issues related to internal displacement. 
</p>
<p>25. According to this study, a National Commission for Humanitarian Coordination has been 
set up with the cooperation of other ministries with the aim of defining strategies for responding 
rapidly to humanitarian problems. However, during his mission, the Representative did not 
receive any information on the implementation of this Commission&#8217;s tasks, its activities or the 
financial resources available to it. 
</p>
<p>26. At the provincial level, governors bear responsibility for organizing protection and 
assistance for displaced persons. In Goma, the Representative met the Deputy Governor, who 
outlined to him the challenges posed by the issues of displacement in the region and informed 
him of the establishment of a humanitarian unit to handle those issues, to be run jointly with 
the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs. Equally in this case, the Representative did not receive 
any detailed information on the activities of this unit. In Bukavu, the Governor emphasized 
the inability of the government authorities to provide the displaced persons with adequate 
assistance. 
</p>
<p>27. The Representative shares the view of the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, which was 
also expressed by the local authorities and many other persons to whom he spoke, concerning the 
fact that the Congolese Government currently lacks the capacity to respond on its own to the 
protection and assistance requirements of the displaced persons under its jurisdiction. 
Nevertheless, he wishes to remind the country&#8217;s authorities that they have the duty and 
responsibility to assist displaced persons. In this context, and while taking account of the limited 
resources of a country in the middle of a transition, the Representative regrets the lack of a legal

<p>framework, a government strategy and clearly demarcated areas of competence. He also regrets 
the lack of focal points in the central Government and in the provinces, as well as the lack of the 
resources needed for activities aimed at displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>28. The Representative points out in this context that the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
has recently ratified the Protocol on Protection and Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons, 
which was adopted at the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region. This Protocol 
requires the States parties to incorporate the Guiding Principles in their legal systems and to 
adopt a legislative framework for their implementation. The Protocol also echoes the Guiding 
Principles in pointing out that the primary duty and responsibility for providing protection and 
assistance to internally displaced persons within their jurisdiction lies with national authorities.<b>9</b> 
The Representative considers that the implementation of the Protocol offers a unique opportunity 
to develop, in close cooperation with the international community, the legal and institutional 
framework required to enable the authorities to take on this responsibility. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Response of the international community 
</b></p>
<p>29. The mandate of MONUC falls under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, and 
currently comprises four elements: 
</p>
<p> (a) The protection of civilians, humanitarian personnel and personnel and installations of 
the United Nations, particularly MONUC, should contribute to the improvement of the security 
conditions in which humanitarian assistance is provided and assist in the voluntary return of 
refugees and displaced persons; 
</p>
<p> (b) Security of the Democratic Republic of the Congo; 
</p>
<p> (c) Disarmament and demobilization of foreign and Congolese armed groups; in 
particular, MONUC should support operations led by the integrated brigades deployed in the 
eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in accordance with internationally 
recognized norms on human rights and international humanitarian law, with a view to disarming 
local and foreign armed groups and preventing the provision of support to illegal armed groups; 
</p>
<p>(d) Security sector reform.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>30. As far as humanitarian institutions are concerned, the Representative was informed that 
from the outset they provided emergency assistance to displaced persons to the extent of their 
abilities. In particular, he was informed of the role played by UNICEF, which was already in the 
field, in organizing assistance for displaced persons. On their initiative, two multisectoral tools

</p>
<p>were developed. First, a rapid response mechanism (RRM) was set up throughout the country, 
and particularly in North Kivu and South Kivu and Ituri, with the aim of enhancing the capacity 
of the humanitarian community to respond to acute humanitarian crises linked to displacement, 
natural disasters or health emergencies. This mechanism is jointly run by UNICEF and OCHA, 
with the support of non-governmental organizations. Activities in 2007 included water treatment, 
deliveries of water by lorry, construction of latrines and showers, but also the supply of 
emergency shelters and non-food items. Under the programme for expanded assistance to 
returnees (PEAR), launched by UNICEF at the end of 2006, the needs of returnees were assessed 
and a response prepared. Rapid and, where necessary, multisectoral assessments are organized in 
returnee areas for the purpose of devising better-targeted assistance from humanitarian agencies. 
PEAR has provided additional material for the discussions and analyses carried out, for example, 
in the working group on reintegration and early recovery. In 2007, the PEAR partners carried 
out 290 rapid assessments and 64 multisectoral assessments in 294 localities in North Kivu and 
South Kivu, Ituri and Katanga.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>31. Since 2006, the cluster approach has been introduced in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo in pursuance of the reform of the humanitarian sector and with the aim of making the 
humanitarian response more effective and predictable. In this context, UNHCR has been 
entrusted with the protection mandate, with particular responsibility for the working group on 
protection, jointly with MONUC. This working group on protection meets in Kinshasa at the 
national level, and devolved units have been set up in various provinces. The Representative was 
able to attend a meeting of the national group on protection and met the members of the other 
protection groups in Goma and Bukavu. He was able to observe that the work of the protection 
group was essentially, if not exclusively, focused on protection against violence and exploitation. 
</p>
<p>32. One of the principal aspects of the work of the protection group is its close relations with 
the military wing of MONUC, designed to ensure that protection issues are brought to the 
attention of the armed forces, and thereby to influence the deployment of troops and improve the 
protection of civilians. According to an assessment of its operations in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo carried out in September 2007, UNHCR concluded that this approach led to 
genuine results, in particular the deployment of mobile MONUC brigades to places where 
violations had been reported, or which had been identified as risk areas from the viewpoint of 
protection of individuals. Moreover, this close dialogue has also made it possible to sideline 
certain FARDC commanders who committed human rights violations against civilians, but also 
to establish security and facilitate access by humanitarian organizations to the areas in which 
military operations were taking place. This positive assessment was confirmed by many people 
to whom the Representative spoke during his mission. 
</p>
<p>33. The Representative also found that the human rights division of MONUC was largely 
inactive in relation to the protection of displaced persons. In reply to his questions on this 
subject, he was told that the civilian affairs section represented MONUC in this framework, in 
keeping with a distinction drawn between large-scale violations and individual violations of

</p>
<p>human rights. The fact that the working group on protection had no access to the information 
held by the human rights division and its expertise was a problematic consequence of that 
distinction. 
</p>
<p>34. The Representative was able to observe during these discussions with various parties, 
particularly representatives of international civil society, that the fact that, in keeping with the 
mandate given to the United Nations mission, MONUC was associated with the FARDC, who 
are responsible for a large share of violations of human rights, particularly those of women, 
could become a source of difficulties. It was mentioned that the fact that MONUC is jointly 
heading the working group on protection might have an impact on the ability of the working 
group to take independent decisions in relation to advocacy. In addition, although specific 
examples were not brought to its attention, the impartiality of humanitarian activities might, in 
the view of some observers, be called into question when one of the parties involved provides 
support to one of the warring parties. Furthermore, in the event of a deterioration in the situation, 
some humanitarian personnel might become victims of this confusion in categories. 
</p>
<p>35. Following his mission, the Representative concluded that the working group on protection 
is operational both at the central and at the local level. He noted that, in keeping with its mandate 
to protect the civilian population, MONUC, through the deployment of troops, has in many cases 
facilitated or even enabled humanitarian access and stabilized the security situation, thus making 
an extremely important contribution to the protection of civilians, including displaced persons 
and returnees. In general, he considers that the working group on protection should continue to 
support the protection activities of the military wing of MONUC and cooperate with it. 
However, he wishes to emphasize the need to uphold the fundamental distinction between 
humanitarian action and military action at all times, and encourages all practices aimed at 
broadening protection activities, on the operational level, beyond this coordination with the 
armed forces. In this regard, he considers that greater involvement by the MONUC human rights 
division would certainly help to provide a fuller view of these issues. 
</p>
<p>36. With regard to humanitarian assistance, the Representative notes the presence of a 
considerable number of international humanitarian organizations and the important work they are 
accomplishing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He also takes note of the humanitarian 
action plan for 2008 which specifies five areas for priority action - mortality and morbidity, 
nutrition, protection, internally displaced persons and returnees. This flexible strategy makes it 
possible to respond to the humanitarian crises throughout the country and concentrate the still 
very limited resources on immediate needs. He also noted that, although the vast majority of 
displaced persons are living with host families (the estimated proportion in South Kivu is 
97 per cent), the aid is mainly sent to the displaced persons&#8217; camps, whether informal or 
organized. The host communities and families receive comparatively little aid, although many of 
them are overwhelmed by the burden of supporting the new arrivals, and are often unable to do 
more. 
</p>
<p>37. Lastly, having received information concerning displaced persons to whom the 
humanitarian organizations had not yet had access, as in the mountains around Minova, in the 
north of South Kivu, the Representative considers that the humanitarian agencies have a duty, 
taking into account MONUC&#8217;s particularly substantial logistical capabilities, to do their utmost </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/6/Add.3 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>to provide the persons concerned with assistance and protection. Although the presence of 
humanitarian personnel and the support of donors for humanitarian assistance are important, 
access to many displaced persons is often interrupted and sometimes impossible owing to a lack 
of roads or insecurity in certain regions. In South Kivu, for example, only 60 per cent of the 
identified beneficiaries received assistance in 2007, and many of these received food aid only 
once. It is also generally recognized that there are an unknown number of displaced persons who 
are thought to be eligible for assistance, but that they have not been identified because of the 
inaccessibility of much of the province. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  PROTECTION OF DISPLACED PERSONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Protection against displacement 
</b></p>
<p>38. Following the Conference for Peace, Security and Development in North and South Kivu, 
the Representative was informed of a period of calm in the security situation in the eastern 
regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Nevertheless, the ceasefire, which is an 
integral part of the statements of commitment signed in January 2008, remains fragile, and 
stability has not yet been assured. The Representative was informed of new displacements 
following localized clashes. For example, it was reported that, in the night of 11-12 March 2008, 
seven civilians were killed during an attack on their village of Kibabi in the area of Masisi in 
North Kivu. Six other persons, including two children, are said to have been wounded during the 
attack, and an unknown number of local inhabitants fled the area. 
</p>
<p>39. The Representative is also concerned at reports received from other regions of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo where there is a risk that intercommunal violence will 
generate new waves of displacement. In the province of Bas-Congo, for example, over 24 people 
lost their lives in clashes between the members of a religious sect and the security forces. The 
Representative is particularly disturbed at the fact that humanitarian personnel were unable to 
gain access to these groups and assess their need for assistance. 
</p>
<p>40. The climate of insecurity prevailing in these regions, the conduct of the security forces and 
in particular the still near-total impunity they enjoy are also factors which trigger further 
displacements. In this context, the Representative points out that every human being has the right 
to be protected against being arbitrarily displaced from his or her home or place of habitual 
residence, and that arbitrary displacements are prohibited. It is incumbent on the authorities to 
respect their obligations under international human rights law and international humanitarian 
law. Armed groups are also bound by the fundamental principles of humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>41. The extent of the territory, logistical difficulties in a country where road infrastructure is 
almost non-existent, but also security issues, make it difficult to maintain a United Nations 
presence throughout the areas concerned so that the civilian population can be effectively 
protected. Nevertheless, expanded deployment of the mobile brigades and the broadening of 
their areas of action, which currently often seem to be limited to the main highways, as well as a 
boosted presence of international and local humanitarian personnel and the civilian/human rights 
component of MONUC in the high-risk areas would make it possible to regularly monitor local 
situations and violations, and perhaps to prevent further displacements. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/6/Add.3 
 page 15 
 
</p>
<p>42. In the medium term, the Representative is concerned at the potentially devastating impact 
of military operations undertaken in the context of the implementation of the Nairobi 
communiqu&#233; on the protection of population groups. This communiqu&#233;, which deals essentially 
with the situation of foreign groups which are located on Congolese soil, makes provision for 
efforts to persuade the members of these armed groups to return to their countries of origin, or, 
as a last resort, the disbandment of the groups. If this last option were to be implemented, the 
Representative is concerned about the consequences for civilians and further displacements 
which would certainly be triggered by an offensive against the FDLR, for example. Many of the 
persons to whom the Representative spoke, mainly in humanitarian circles but also among the 
displaced population, expressed their concern in this regard. They repeatedly emphasized that the 
implementation of the Nairobi communiqu&#233;, but also the Goma statements of commitment, 
should be based on a constructive dialogue and be limited to peaceful means. This dialogue 
demands first and foremost political will on the part of all those involved, including the FDLR. 
The Representative is particularly concerned at the threats that the FDLR would turn on the 
civilian population if military operations were to be conducted against them. Such behaviour 
would not only breach Principle 6 of the Guiding Principles, but would also constitute a war 
crime and a crime against humanity. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Protection during displacement 
</b></p>
<p>43. Following this first mission, the Representative notes that the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, and particularly the eastern regions, are experiencing a serious protection crisis and a 
serious humanitarian crisis. Most of the displaced persons (some 70 per cent) are living in host 
families or communities, but observers have noted the recent emergence of informal sites. 
OCHA estimates that in North Kivu, 30 per cent of the newly displaced persons are living in 
informal sites or in more organized camps. This phenomenon stems from the large-scale arrival 
of newly displaced persons during 2007, but also the longer duration of displacement and the 
fact that the absorption capacity of the host families has diminished markedly. 
</p>
<p>44. Traditionally, displaced persons found refuge within a radius of 15 to 30 kilometres from 
their original homes. Recently, as a result of the violence and fighting, civilians have fled further 
and further away in search of refuge and safety. Many people have had to run away several times 
as the fighting has drawn closer. The Representative met a teacher in Goma who explained that 
after first fleeing his village in Masisi in 1997 as a result of inter-ethnic tensions, in the next 
10 years he had fled in succession from clashes between Kabila and the Interahamwe, between 
the Mai Mai and the Interahamwe and between the dissident general Nkunda and the government 
forces.  
</p>
<p><b>1. Rights related to security and physical integrity 
</b></p>
<p>45. Apart from the risk of finding themselves in the midst of the fighting when attacks occur, 
displaced persons are exposed to attacks by armed groups but also by the FARDC, who in some 
cases try to steal their meagre possessions. For example, the Representative was told that last 
November, displaced persons who had found refuge in camps around Goma, and who had fled 
once again from heavy FARDC gunfire during an FARDC operation, discovered on their return 
that the few possessions they had, in particular plastic tarpaulins donated by humanitarian 
organizations, had been stolen by the national security forces.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/6/Add.3 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>46. For fear of being intercepted and ill-treated by the members of armed groups and 
sometimes the FARDC, many displaced persons hide in the forest in appalling conditions. In 
general such displacements are short-lived and the persons concerned return to their villages 
once the hostilities have ceased. However, in some localities, the continued presence of armed 
groups, especially foreign groups, prevent the displaced persons from returning. According to 
statements by several displaced persons, deaths have occurred in these circumstances, in 
particular because of malnutrition and the unavailability of medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>47. The very location of some camps presents substantial threats to the physical safety of 
displaced persons. MUGUNGA II camp, close to Goma, which houses nearly 200,000 persons, 
is located a few kilometres below an FARDC position, and hence runs the risk of being caught in 
crossfire. 
</p>
<p>48. The question of the preservation of the civilian character of the displaced persons&#8217; camps 
and sites is also of considerable importance, in the Representative&#8217;s view. He is concerned at 
reports of the presence of members of the FARDC and armed groups in the camps. In the 
MUNGUNGA I and II camps, some reports indicate that displaced persons are sometimes forced 
to carry soldiers&#8217; belongings and build camps for them, and that displaced children are obliged to 
bring them water. Cases of forcible recruitment of children and young people have also been 
reported. It is said that women regularly fall victim to rape and other sexual violence when they 
go to look for wood, for example. 
</p>
<p>49. Displaced persons living in host families also face specific security problems. The 
Representative was told that in the area of Rutshuru, displaced persons had left the families with 
whom they were living as a result of growing tension stemming in particular from lengthy 
cohabitation and lack of space, but also because of competition for resources. In other 
communities, displaced persons are reported to have been accused of collaboration with armed 
groups. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Rights related to basic needs and other economic and social rights 
</b></p>
<p>50. According to reports reaching the Representative, most of the displaced persons live in 
host families, and to a lesser extent in informal camps or sites, located for the most part in 
North Kivu. As the Representative was able to observe during his visits to the field, displaced 
persons are living in complete destitution, in many cases having lost their homes and with no 
access to drinking water, health care or decent clothing. The displaced persons often have no 
access to health infrastructure, either because of the distance involved or because of economic 
constraints. In addition, the health system has been severely affected by the successive wars, and 
many health centres have been destroyed or looted by the warring parties. 
</p>
<p>51.  In many cases, the displaced persons are living in conditions of considerable food 
insecurity, in particular because often they no longer have access to their fields. Several harvests 
have been lost as a result of the conflict. Agricultural output is estimated to have dropped by 
around 35 per cent in North Kivu. Moreover, when they do have access to food aid, such aid is 
distributed only for a limited period of three months, renewable once, with no prospect of 
alternative options. In some areas, cases of severe malnutrition have reappeared and 60 per cent 
of the total population suffer from malnutrition. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/6/Add.3 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>52. Where housing is concerned, the Representative is concerned about the vulnerable 
conditions in which displaced persons are living, especially in spontaneous settlements. 
For example, in Minova, the huts are made of mud and straw and measure barely four or 
five square metres. They provide no protection against the rain in a region well known for its 
high rainfall. 
</p>
<p>53. Because of their special vulnerability, the loss of their possessions, their inability to farm 
their land or the loss of jobs or any other income-generating activities, displaced persons suffer 
particularly from the growing impoverishment which is affecting the whole of Congolese 
society, and especially host families and communities. In this regard, the Representative regrets 
that little has been done to enable displaced persons to take their fate into their own hands and 
thereby lighten the burden on host families. 
</p>
<p>54. Where education is concerned, school courses have been seriously disrupted. In addition, 
many schools have been taken over by displaced persons. The Representative&#8217;s attention was 
also drawn many times to the economic constraints encountered by displaced persons in this 
area. Even if education is officially free in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, parents are 
expected to contribute to teachers&#8217; salaries, and displaced persons often cannot afford such 
expenses. In addition, no schools have been set up in the camps so as to encourage contacts and 
dialogue with the host communities and present excessive marginalization of the displaced 
persons. However, economic difficulties and often considerations of distance mean that many 
displaced children living in camps have no access to education.  
</p>
<p>55. The Representative reminds the Government that, in accordance with the Guiding 
Principles, all displaced persons have the right to an adequate standard of living and that at the 
minimum, the authorities must provide them with, or ensure access to, essential food, housing, 
decent clothing and essential medical services and sanitation (Principle 18). 
</p>
<p><b>3. Civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p>56. A considerable number of displaced persons in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
have lost the voters&#8217; cards which also serve as identity cards. Displaced persons who do not have 
these cards are much more vulnerable as a result and regularly suffer harassment at the hands of 
the security forces at checkpoints. They are sometimes arrested illegally or accused of belonging 
to the armed groups. 
</p>
<p>57. In addition, looking forward to the local elections scheduled for 2008, this situation, 
combined with the fact that many displaced persons will have been unable to return to their 
homes, threatens to deprive the displaced persons of the opportunity to exercise their right to 
vote or the right to register on the electoral rolls and thus participate in taking decisions 
concerning their future and that of their country. According to Guiding Principle 20, every 
human being has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law, and to give 
effect to this right, the authorities concerned shall issue to displaced persons the documents they 
need. And Principle 20 adds that displaced persons have the right to vote and to participate in 
governmental and public affairs, including the right to have access to the means necessary to 
exercise this right. The Representative recommends, as a transitional measure, that consideration </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/6/Add.3 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>should be given to the possibility of distributing duplicate voters&#8217; cards. If this suggestion was 
adopted, it would of course need to be accompanied by an information campaign directed at 
displaced persons explaining how to obtain the duplicates. 
</p>
<p>58. The fact that neither the State nor the administration have any presence in many areas also 
has adverse consequences for displaced persons. In particular, the lack of access to the judicial 
system in some localities fosters the culture of impunity in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Protection in the context of the search for a durable solution 
</b></p>
<p>59. In keeping with Guiding Principle 28, which is cited in the Great Lakes Protocol on 
protection and assistance to internally displaced persons, the authorities have the duty and 
responsibility to establish conditions which allow displaced persons to return voluntarily, safely 
and with dignity, or to resettle voluntarily in another part of the country. Principle 29 adds that 
the authorities have the duty and responsibility to assist returnees and/or resettled persons to 
recover, to the extent possible, their property and possessions which they left behind or were 
dispossessed of upon their displacement.  
</p>
<p>60. All those with whom the Representative held discussions, and particularly the displaced 
persons, emphasized the determination of all displaced persons to return to their places of 
habitual residence. The Representative is encouraged to note that some (nearly 1 million persons 
according to estimates by the international community) have already returned in Katanga, Ituri 
and to a lesser extent in the regions of Kivu. Nevertheless, in the regions of Kivu in particular, 
many displaced persons he met said that for the time being the conditions have not been met, 
especially in terms of security, which would allow them to contemplate returning home. Many of 
the people he met, particularly displaced women, mentioned not only the risk of being subjected 
to acts of violence, including rape, but also the lack of infrastructure in the areas of return, 
including schools for their children&#8217;s education. The destruction of houses, the special situation 
of certain displaced persons such as female heads of families, but also the lack of official 
machinery, especially in the judicial field, should also be taken into account. 
</p><p>61. Although the Representative recognizes that, in the current situation in the east of the 
country, it is not possible to envisage large-scale returns, he considers that the signature of the 
Goma statements of commitment might potentially open the way to pacification of these regions, 
and thus to the possible return of those displaced persons who so wish to their original localities. 
In that regard, the Representative wishes to state that experience has shown that, if the return of 
the displaced persons is to be successful, three conditions must necessarily be met: security, the 
restitution of property and the creation of an environment which will enable those concerned to 
live in decent conditions. In this context, he welcomes the fact that the Goma statements of 
commitment and the Amani programme derived from them provide for the establishment of a 
humanitarian and social subcommission to deal, inter alia, with the issues facing internally 
displaced persons, as well as a technical commission for stabilization and reconstruction with the 
task of mobilizing human, material and technical resources for the implementation of the plans 
for the reconstruction of the provinces of North and South Kivu. However, he also notes that 
these documents do not contain any specific provisions concerning the search for durable 
solutions for the displaced persons. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/6/Add.3 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>62. The Representative welcomes the fact that in MONUC there is also a resolve to do 
everything possible to create an environment where the population would feel at ease and the 
displaced persons encouraged to return home.<b>12</b> In particular, the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for the Democratic Republic of the Congo recently announced that MONUC, 
in cooperation with its United Nations partners, had drawn up a support strategy for security and 
stabilization in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Nevertheless, the 
Representative wishes to encourage all concerned to work as hard as possible to coordinate 
activities planned under the various initiatives for the implementation of durable solutions for the 
displaced persons. A joint plan for return and early recovery which contains clear objectives and 
systems for the evaluation of its implementation should also be planned. 
</p>
<p>63. Pending the implementation of this ambitious programme, the Representative considers 
that voluntary return is already possible in some cases, and he urges the competent authorities, in 
close cooperation with the humanitarian organizations, to support this process in particular 
through the granting of transitional humanitarian aid and implementing projects for early 
recovery and development in the communities concerned. Considering that at this stage efforts in 
support of the returnees are inadequate, in particular owing to the lack of funding in this area, the 
Representative calls on all concerned, especially the donors, to boost their efforts to this end. The 
Representative considers that without substantial support for the return or resettlement of the 
displaced persons, it may be difficult to find durable solutions for their situation, which might 
lead to adverse consequences in terms of the process of peacebuilding. It is therefore vital to 
strengthen the presence of the agencies and organizations working in this field. In this context, 
greater involvement by the development agencies, and particularly the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), should be given serious consideration. 
</p>
<p>64. The Representative also wishes to underline the importance of consulting the displaced 
persons in the search for durable solutions to their situations. The Government should encourage 
and facilitate their participation in the planning and implementation of programmes designed to 
meet their needs, and this would also greatly enhance the effectiveness of such programmes. 
</p>
<p>65. Lastly, the Representative has noted that in some regions - in particular Ituri and the 
territory of Masisi - there is a high risk of intercommunal tension linked in some cases to the 
resurgence of land-related problems. He strongly recommends, in order that the return should be 
sustainable, that efforts directed towards reconciliation and transitional justice should be 
undertaken.

<p>population. In addition, they are denied certain rights which are specific to children, such as the 
right to education. The Representative is particularly concerned at reports of the forcible 
recruitment of children and young people by armed groups. He himself spoke to two young 
teenagers he met in Bohimba camp, near Goma, who told him how members of the group led by 
the dissident general Nkunda had surrounded a school for the purpose of forcibly recruiting the 
pupils. During the attack, some of them were killed and others wounded. 
</p>
<p>67. The Representative notes that the Goma statements of commitment, reiterating the 
principles of humanitarian law set out in Principle 13, for example, strictly forbid the recruitment 
of children. In this context, he encourages the parties to the conflict to respect this provision and 
calls on all concerned to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and 
urgently embark on the demobilization of children and refrain from any attempt to recruit them 
into armed groups. He calls on the international organizations concerned to assign priority to this 
issue. 
</p>
<p>68. Where women are concerned, the Representative joins all those who have already 
expressed their concern at the near-systematic acts of sexual violence which they continue to 
suffer. For example, there were 5,470 cases of sexual violence in South Kivu in the first half 
of 2007, and 4,997 victims of sexual violence were identified in 2007 in Ituri. Displaced women 
whom the Representative met, particularly in the three camps he visited near Goma, confirmed 
that many cases are not reported, owing to the social stigma attached to victims and the 
prevailing impunity in the country. 
</p>
<p>69. The forcible recruitment of children and the number of rapes not only cause forced 
displacement and pose a risk for the women and children concerned, but also constitute a major 
obstacle preventing displaced persons from returning home. 
</p>
<p>70. The Representative wishes to point out that the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women submitted a detailed report to the Human Rights Council following the mission she 
carried out in July 2007 (A/HRC/7/6/Add.4). 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS </b></p>
<p>71. <b>Following this first mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the 
Representative concludes that this country is experiencing a serious protection crisis and a 
serious humanitarian crisis, particularly in its eastern region, highlighted inter alia by the 
very large numbers of internally displaced persons. He considers that the adoption of 
peaceful solutions to the present conflicts, the renunciation of violence, scrupulous respect 
by all concerned for human rights and the guarantees set out in humanitarian law and an 
unfailing commitment to combat impunity are essential in order to put an end to the 
serious violations of human rights suffered by the displaced persons in the eastern part of 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Representative calls on all the parties to implement without delay and with 
unfailing political commitment the statements of commitment signed at the Conference for 
Peace, Stability and Development in North and South Kivu, held in Goma from 6 to 
23 January 2008, as well as the November 2007 Nairobi communiqu&#233;. In particular, he </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/8/6/Add.3 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p><b>considers that continued dialogue is the only way out of the conflict affecting the country, 
and that any resort to arms would lead to disastrous consequences for the civilian 
population, especially the hundreds of thousands of persons who have already been 
displaced or who would be forced to flee as a result of such operations. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>In order to provide displaced persons in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with 
assistance and protection in the context of a durable solution to the issue of displacement in 
this country - a prerequisite for peacebuilding - the Representative recommends a strategy 
focusing simultaneously on continued political dialogue between the Government and the 
various armed groups and the other parties concerned and the strengthening of 
humanitarian assistance and activities for the protection of the displaced population, as 
well as early recovery measures where returns are already under way or can be 
contemplated. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Representative points out that, in keeping with the Guiding Principles, the State 
has primary responsibility for protecting its citizens, and that it is incumbent upon it to 
take all measures to ensure the protection of the civilian population. He also draws 
attention to the role and responsibility of the international community in supporting the 
Government in its efforts. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>In particular, he makes the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Addressed to the Government: 
(i) The Representative emphasizes the need to respect the fundamental 
</b></p>
<p><b>distinction between combatants and civilians when planning and carrying 
out security operations, and to refrain from any act prohibited by 
international humanitarian law and international human rights law. In 
this context, he encourages the authorities to launch without delay a 
systematic programme, supported by MONUC, to promote training and 
awareness in international humanitarian law and human rights for 
members of the security forces, especially the rights of displaced persons 
as contained in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Given the many violations of human rights of which certain members of 
the armed forces are accused, particularly where violence against women 
is concerned, the Representative recommends more vigorous efforts to 
combat impunity, by means of investigations and by bringing the main 
perpetrators of such violations to justice and guaranteeing the right of 
victims to justice and reparation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) The Representative recommends that the Government, with substantial 
support from MONUC, should engage in the following activities: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Reconciliation, in particular between ethnic communities </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/8/6/Add.3

</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Transitional justice and efforts to combat impunity 
</b>&#8226; <b>Settlement of land-related disputes 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) The Representative calls on the Government to take the necessary steps so 
that all displaced persons can participate in the local elections scheduled 
for this year, in particular by ensuring the replacement of voters&#8217; cards 
lost during displacement, the transport of displaced persons to their 
original localities, the organization of voting in the place of displacement 
or any other step in keeping with international standards which will 
enable the displaced persons to exercise their right to vote. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) The Representative recommends that, in keeping with the Protocol on 
Protection and Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons adopted at the 
International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, the Guiding 
Principles on Internal Displacement should be incorporated into their 
legal systems and that, with support from MONUC and the organizations 
concerned, a legislative framework, a strategy and a plan of action for the 
implementation of the obligations stemming from those Principles should 
be drawn up. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Addressed to the armed groups: 
(i) The Representative points out that the armed groups have an obligation to 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect international humanitarian law, in particular the fundamental 
distinction between combatants and civilians, and should refrain from any 
act prohibited by international humanitarian law, such as making use of 
the civilian population as a base for their actions, recruiting children into 
their ranks and exposing the civilian population to the risk of reprisals.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) The Representative calls for the disarming and immediate rehabilitation 
of child soldiers. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Addressed to the international community and donors: 
(i) The Representative encourages the international community to continue to 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide substantial and sustained support to assistance and protection 
programmes for displaced persons in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo. He encourages the humanitarian organizations to broaden the 
support provided to host communities which are overwhelmed by the 
presence of displaced persons. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) The Representative recommends proactive engagement in activities for 
economic reintegration, relaunching of basic services and development in 
regions of return. In this context, he emphasizes the importance of 
sustainability of returns and its economic and developmental aspects as a 
key contribution to reconciliation and peacebuilding. </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/8/6/Add.3 
 page 23 
 
</p>
<p><b>(iii) The Representative also encourages efforts to boost the activities of the 
humanitarian agencies in the field, in particular by using all means to 
strengthen the humanitarian presence and gain access to the displaced 
groups which are located furthest from the centres, many of whom are 
highly marginalized and have been unable to benefit from humanitarian 
aid. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) The Representative recommends that, as far as possible, humanitarian aid 
should be better adapted to the needs of the displaced populations, in 
particular by taking into account the specific food requirements of young 
children. Where non-food items are concerned, an additional effort should 
be made, in particular by supplying tools and seeds so as to enable the 
displaced persons to continue farming, and by developing other activities 
related to early recovery. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) The Representative recommends cooperation with the Government to 
train and heighten the awareness of the security forces, in particular as 
concerns international humanitarian law, human rights and the Guiding 
Principles on Internal Displacement. At the same time, he encourages 
MONUC to launch a systematic programme to train and foster awareness 
among its military contingents concerning international humanitarian law 
and human rights, in particular the rights of displaced persons as 
contained in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vi) The Representative recommends that the working group on protection 
should continue to support the protection-related activities of the military 
wing of MONUC and cooperate with it, but at the same time to uphold the 
distinction between humanitarian action and military action and not limit 
its protection activities to such coordination, but strive to better 
operationalize the protection of displaced persons and returnees in 
non-military fields.
