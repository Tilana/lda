</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Secretary-General submitted to the Commission on Human Rights and 
subsequently the Human Rights Council an annual report on technical cooperation in the 
field of human rights, reflecting the discussions of the Board of Trustees of the United 
Nations Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights. The 
Council, in its decision 2/102, requested<b> </b>the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to continue with the fulfilment of their activities, in accordance with all 
previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, and to update the 
relevant reports and studies. The present report is therefore submitted as an update of the 
previous report,1 and focuses on the work of the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund in 
2009. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for 
Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights 
</b>2. The members of the Board of Trustees are appointed by the Secretary-General to 
advise the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
on streamlining and rationalizing the working methods and procedures of its technical 
cooperation programme. Its current members are William Schabas (Canada), Chairperson; 
Monica Pinto (Argentina); Deepika Udagama (Sri Lanka); Fatima Mbaye (Mauritania); and 
Sozar Subari (Georgia). Ms. Mbaye and Mr. Subari were appointed by the Secretary-
General in 2009 at the successful conclusion of the mandates of Mary Chinery-Hesse 
(Ghana) and Viacheslav Bakhmin (Russian Federation). 
3. The work of the Board has evolved in recent years, from detailed revision of 
individual projects to advising OHCHR on policy orientation and providing global vision 
and strategy on technical cooperation at a broader programme level. The change in the role 
played by the Board has been appreciated by the Office, which has greatly benefited from 
the Board&#8217;s experience and wisdom of the Board members, particularly following the 
recent reforms within the United Nations and OHCHR, including strengthened country 
engagement. 
</p>
<p>4. The Board holds its meetings twice a year in Geneva. Its thirtieth session was held 
from 20 to 23 April 2009 and its thirty-first session from 27 to 30 October 2009. During its 
sessions, the Board examined various components of the United Nations Human Rights 
Programme on Technical Cooperation funded by the Voluntary Fund and received regional 
updates and presentations on the development of the thematic areas of priority for 
implementation of the OHCHR strategic management plan 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p>5. The Board participated in interactive dialogues with the Deputy High Commissioner 
who expressed her and the High Commissioner&#8217;s gratitude to the Board members for their 
guidance for the work of the Voluntary Fund and warmly welcomed the newly appointed 
members, Mr. Subari and Ms. Mbaye.  
</p>
<p>6. The Deputy High Commissioner noted that the Board members were present at a 
crucial time in the planning cycle of OHCHR work and expressed her confidence that the 
Board&#8217;s engagement provided fruitful policy guidance, while acknowledging the important 
role played by external experts in analysing the evolution of the Office. The Board

 A/HRC/10/57 and Corr.1. </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-10528 
</p>
<p>highlighted its appreciation for and satisfaction with the Office&#8217;s technical cooperation 
activities.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Financial status of the Voluntary Fund 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Finance and Budget Section and the Donor and External Relations Section of 
OHCHR provided the Board of Trustees with an update on the status of donors, the 2009 
financial situation of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation and its functioning in 
the overall funding system. As at 30 September 2009, the total estimated income of the 
Voluntary Fund was $19,800,317, which represented an encouraging increase. The 
following documents were provided to the Board and are contained as annexes to the 
present report: estimated statement of income and expenditure of the Voluntary Fund for 
Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights for the period from 1 January 2008 to 
30 September 2009; list of donors to the Voluntary Fund; graph on income of the Voluntary 
Fund versus OHCHR other extrabudgetary resources 2000&#8211;2009; graph on expenditure of 
the Voluntary Fund versus OHCHR other extrabudgetary resources 2000&#8211;2009; and status 
of 2008&#8211;2009 expenditure by country. 
</p>
<p>8. The Board was pleased to note that the Voluntary Fund was in good health, and 
provided a very important source of financial support to the technical cooperation activities 
of the United Nations in the field of human rights. Despite the economic crisis, Member 
States and other contributors have generally maintained their levels of contribution. The 
Board expressed its gratitude and thanks for all donations to the Voluntary Fund, including 
the support from OHCHR and Member States, which manifests their confidence in the 
work of the Board of Trustees. It reiterated the importance of receiving funds from a wide 
range of donors, including from countries that benefit from the Fund, and encouraging even 
modest contributions as an important sign of support. 
</p>
<p>9. The Board reiterated its support of the continued policy set up by the High 
Commissioner to finance through the Fund human rights advisers within United Nations 
country teams, human rights components of United Nations peace missions and 
country/stand-alone offices with technical cooperation components. The Board underlined 
the general value of unearmarked funding for OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. High Commissioner for Human Rights: Strategic 
Management Plan (2010&#8211;2011) 
</b>10. The Board was updated on the High Commissioner&#8217;s Strategic Management Plan 
2010&#8211;2011 and policies, operational framework and programmatic trends, including the 
process of implementing the OHCHR performance monitoring system at national, regional 
and global levels. The Board was briefed about the main challenges and expected 
accomplishments outlined in the Strategic Management Plan, which covers planning tools, 
indicators of achievements and the management process.  
</p>
<p>11. The Board was informed that the strategic management planning and the 
development of priorities entailed a consultative and participatory process using, for the 
first time, a bottom-up approach to planning. The importance for OHCHR of partnerships 
in the field was underlined, given that they enabled the field presences to accomplish 
activities with limited financial resources. 
</p>
<p>12. This process involved organizing workshops with staff to provide further guidance 
on how to develop the Office-wide expected accomplishments and indicators and thematic </p>


<p>GE.10-10528 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>strategies, which were presented to the OHCHR senior management team for review and 
recommendation to the High Commissioner for Human Rights for approval.  
</p>
<p>13. The six thematic priorities approved were as follows: &#8220;Protecting human rights in 
the context of migration&#8221;; &#8220;Countering discrimination, in particular racial discrimination, 
discrimination on the grounds of sex, religion and against others who are marginalized&#8221;; 
&#8220;Pursuing economic, social and cultural rights and combating inequalities and poverty, 
including in the context of the economic, food and climate crises&#8221;; &#8220;Protecting human 
rights in situations of armed conflict, violence and insecurity&#8221;; &#8220;Combating impunity and 
strengthening accountability, the rule of law and democratic society&#8221;; and &#8220;Strengthening 
human rights mechanisms and the progressive development of international human rights 
law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>14. Noting the complex and challenging nature of the development of the priorities and 
recognizing their rich potential to improve the Office&#8217;s activities in the field of technical 
cooperation, the Board pointed out that OHCHR needs to keep in mind its portfolio and the 
budget on which it can rely. The importance of partnerships for OHCHR in the field, i.e., 
within the United Nations system, was underlined, enabling the field presences to 
accomplish activities with limited financial resources. 
</p>
<p>15. The Board was also informed of the 11 Office-wide expected accomplishments for 
the 2010&#8211;2011 biennium,2 which place emphasis on ensuring management efficiency in the 
operations of the Office, in line with the recommendations of the Office of Internal 
Oversight Services report to the General Assembly.3 The Board further received a 
presentation on the detailed process that OHCHR undertook to develop the six thematic 
priorities at the country, regional and global levels, and noted the complex and challenging 
nature of the process and recognized its rich potential to improve the Office&#8217;s activities in 
the field of technical cooperation.  
</p>
<p>16. The Board was briefed on the thematic strategy on &#8220;Protecting human rights in the 
context of migration&#8221; and noted that the challenge posed by the theme would be how to 
take into consideration the human rights dimension in migration and the different roles 
played by both developed and developing countries. The Board highlighted the OHCHR 
comparative advantage and the High Commissioner&#8217;s advocacy role, i.e., in dealing directly 
with human rights issues in migration vis-&#224;-vis other organizations working in the field of 
migration. 
</p>
<p>17. The Board was informed about the thematic strategy on &#8220;Countering discrimination, 
in particular racial discrimination, discrimination on the grounds of sex, religion and 
against others who are marginalized&#8221; which provides a global orientation to the Office&#8217;s 
work and thus permits the participation of all field presences. The recommended categories 
of persons to be included in the definition of marginalized groups were outlined, as were 
the development of expected results and indicators of achievement. The Board noted the 
challenge in implementing the strategy, underlining the importance of including all 
stakeholders &#8212; particularly the private sector &#8212; in legislation reforms. 
</p>
<p>18. The Board was briefed on key elements in the process of formulating the thematic 
strategy on &#8220;Pursuing economic, social and cultural rights and combating inequalities and 
poverty, including in the context of the economic, food and climate crises&#8221;, including the 
challenge of articulating the strategy so that it encompasses not only those human rights 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 The 11 expected accomplishments were defined by small task forces with guidance provided by the 
</p>
<p>Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Section of OHCHR during a workshop held on 15 July 
</p><p>2009.

</p>
<p>related to poverty but also a broader spectrum of human rights issues. Considering the 
challenge the Office would be facing in implementing the broad theme, the Board 
recommended that OHCHR take the lead in setting minimum standards with clear 
guidelines to be attained by all States in achieving human rights.  
</p>
<p>19. The Board was further briefed on the work done by the Office to strengthen its 
capacities on economic, social and cultural rights, including the priority areas of work, the 
achievements made by special procedures, standard-setting, research and conceptualization, 
as well as the development of tools such as workshops, CD-ROMs, training sessions, 
reports and assessment missions. The Board congratulated the Office on the work done and 
encouraged it to work more in the areas of policymaking and advocacy. 
</p>
<p>20. The Board was updated on the planning process undertaken by OHCHR to develop 
the thematic strategy on &#8220;Protecting human rights in situations of armed conflict, violence 
and insecurity&#8221; and the strategic actions to be undertaken by the Peace Missions Support 
and Rapid Response Section. The Board noted the importance of strong partnerships in the 
field following an update on the humanitarian action work undertaken by OHCHR, 
including the cluster coordination by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee.4 The Board 
was further informed about the planned workshop (December 2009) on enhancing the 
Office&#8217;s engagement in humanitarian action through increased involvement in humanitarian 
planning and access to funding for humanitarian action, in coordination with United 
Nations country teams and donors. 
</p>
<p>21. The Board was updated on the development of the thematic priority on &#8220;Combating 
impunity and strengthening accountability, the rule of law and democratic society&#8221;. The 
Board was informed that combating impunity and strengthening the rule of law would 
continue to be a priority for the Office in all regions. OHCHR will work to strengthen the 
conditions of accountability for violations of all rights &#8211; civil, political, economic, social 
and cultural. The Board was informed of a public information campaign thereon and the 
issuing of a best practices study that examines available accountability mechanisms for 
human rights violations and lessons learned. The Board noted the complementary roles of 
OHCHR and the International Criminal Court in combating impunity.  
</p>
<p>22. The Board was given information on the thematic strategy on &#8220;Strengthening human 
rights mechanisms and the progressive development of international human rights law&#8221;, 
including the important role it played in all other thematic priorities and the challenges 
faced when focusing on the development of human rights law and the follow-up procedures 
for the recommendations of treaty bodies. It was also informed of the challenges faced in 
developing realistic and measurable indicators of achievement in relation to the expected 
accomplishments and harmonizing working methods in the field. The Board acknowledged 
that, although some traditional elements needed to be adhered to in ensuring reporting 
compliance with treaty body requirements, OHCHR played a leading role in the progressive 
development of human rights law where new instruments are elaborated. 
</p>
<p><b> V. OHCHR technical cooperation: capacity- and institution-
building activities 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Board members acknowledged the improved cooperation in the field between 
OHCHR and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), as well as other United 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 The Inter-Agency Standing Committee is the funding mechanism for inter-agency coordination of

country teams represented good progress towards achieving OHCHR objectives at the 
ground level. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Africa region 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Board was updated on the situation of field presences in the Africa region. It 
learned about the situation of these countries, the projects and activities funded by the 
Voluntary Fund, as well as strategies, partners, budget constraints, regional priorities and 
areas of work within the context of technical cooperation. The Board acknowledged that 
almost all of the OHCHR thematic priority areas would be addressed in the Africa region. 
</p>
<p>25. The Board was briefed on the situation of human rights components of United 
Nations peace missions in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Sudan; on the situation 
of human rights advisers in Guinea, Kenya, Niger, Rwanda and Somalia; and on the 
situation of country offices in Togo and Uganda. The Board acknowledged the challenges 
faced in the different subregions and welcomed the achievements realized. It highlighted 
the importance of working to develop justice and accountability mechanisms in the region 
and emphasized the coordination role to be played by human rights advisers in United 
Nations country teams, including relations with Governments. The Board expressed 
concern about the capacity-building in the region to deal with all the challenges of 
migration, discrimination, pursuit of economic, social and cultural rights, conflict, violence 
and insecurity, and combating impunity. 
</p>
<p>26. The Board took note of the successful cooperation with regional mechanisms, in 
particular the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States. The 
Board was also informed of the creation of the Africa Branch within the OHCHR Field 
Operations and Technical Cooperation Division, which was a positive development and 
would increase the Office&#8217;s capacity to engage with Governments and United Nations 
counterparts in senior-level policy discussions.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Middle East and North Africa region  
</b></p>
<p>27. The Board received an overview of the situation of human rights field presences in 
the Middle East and North Africa region. It learned about the projects and activities funded 
by the Voluntary Fund, including strategies and challenges within the context of technical 
cooperation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.  
</p>
<p>28. The Board was updated on the negotiations on establishing a regional office in North 
Africa, as well as the opening of the United Nations Human Rights Training and 
Documentation Centre for South-West Asia and the Arab Region in Qatar in May 2009. 
The Board welcomed the establishment of the OHCHR office in Mauritania and noted the 
challenge OHCHR technical cooperation would face in upgrading the judiciary, given that 
graduates from religious schools are serving as judges in the country. The Board was also 
updated on emerging human rights mechanisms by the Arab League and the Organization 
of the Islamic Conference. The Board was further interested in the issue of impunity, 
freedom of expression and association and information in the region, welcoming the efforts 
made despite the challenges faced. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Asia-Pacific region 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Board was updated on human rights developments in the region, especially the 
situation of the field presences, projects and technical cooperation activities funded by the </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-10528 
</p>
<p>Voluntary Fund, including the challenges to be addressed. It was briefed on the situation of 
human rights components of United Nations peace missions in Afghanistan and Timor-
Leste and on the situation of human rights advisers in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and 
Sri Lanka. OHCHR highlighted the successes achieved in Timor-Leste and Papua New 
Guinea. The Board was also updated on the challenges faced in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri 
Lanka and Indonesia. The Board reiterated its support and expressed its satisfaction for the 
effective human rights field presences in the region, highlighting the need for OHCHR to 
further develop specific intervention strategies and the importance of improving relations 
with United Nations country teams and UNDP representatives.  
</p>
<p>30. The Board was also informed of the process and thematic priorities developed by the 
Asia-Pacific region for the 2010&#8211;2011 biennium. The Board welcomed the continued 
support by the OHCHR Regional Office for South-East Asia (Bangkok) for the efforts of 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to establish a human rights body in accordance 
with the Association&#8217;s Charter, adopted in 2007. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Europe and Central Asia region 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Board noted the recent developments in the field presences in the Europe and 
Central Asia region, as well as the challenges &#8212; including political, human, financial and 
administrative constraints &#8212; to the implementation of priorities in the region. With regard 
to the financial situation, the Board was informed that work across this richly diverse region 
had been designed to fit the constraints.  
</p>
<p>32. The Board was briefed on the situation of human rights advisers in Georgia, 
Moldova and the Russian Federation and on the situation of the field presence in Kosovo. It 
learned about daily contact with counterparts in the field and the new projects that were 
implemented in 2009. In the Russian Federation, OHCHR had facilitated establishment of a 
human rights masters programme at leading Russian universities and the OHCHR 
fellowship programme for indigenous people in the Russian language. The Board was 
further informed of the recently opened Regional Office for Europe in Brussels and noted 
that it was a positive development for the Office&#8217;s work in the region on important thematic 
issues. The Board supported the work on national human rights action plans in the context 
of follow-up to universal periodic review (UPR), so long as those plans were dynamic 
documents whose implementation OHCHR could help realize. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Americas region 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Board was updated on field presences, projects, activities, strategies, partners 
and regional priorities within the context of technical cooperation in the Americas, as 
funded by the Voluntary Fund. It was briefed on the situation of the human rights 
component of United Nations peace missions in Haiti, human rights advisers in Ecuador 
and Nicaragua and country offices in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Colombia, 
Guatemala and Mexico, as well as regional offices in Chile and Panama. The Board was 
also informed of the successes achieved in Nicaragua and the steps taken to establish a 
human rights adviser in Honduras together with UNDP. The Board acknowledged the 
challenges faced and welcomed achievements realized.  
</p>
<p>34. The Board was also briefed on the objective for the next biennium to engage more 
with the English-speaking Caribbean in order to increase the level of ratification of 
international instruments in these countries, improve reporting status, increase open 
invitations to special procedures and enhance knowledge of the UPR mechanism. The 
Board was informed of the conditions of the national human rights institutions and the state </p>


<p>GE.10-10528 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>of the justice systems; it advised that the challenge would be to find the best strategy for 
impact in strengthening national institutions through international standards reinforcing the 
accountability mechanisms. The Board acknowledged the important efforts conducted in 
the region in establishing relations with Governments and local authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Human rights components of United Nations peace operations 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Board received an overview of human rights components in peace missions, 
their functions, activities, challenges and their relationship with other United Nations 
partners, in particular with regard to the mainstreaming of human rights. The Board was 
briefed on capacity- and institution-building in United Nations peace missions. It was 
updated on the OHCHR Peace Missions Support and Rapid Response Section in the Field 
Operations and Technical Cooperation Division. The aim of the section is to have sufficient 
funds for emergency situations, establish a roster of voluntary staff to be deployed in 
conflict areas and support the work of humanitarian agencies in the field. 
</p>
<p><b> G. National human rights institutions and regional mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Board was updated on the issues related to national human rights institutions 
(NHRIs), including the technical assistance provided to NHRIs, and recent developments 
within the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion 
and Protection of Human Rights and its Accreditation Committee, including regional 
trends. The Board noted the importance of ensuring the effective independence of NHRIs 
and the strategic value of developing and investing in NHRIs as part of broader United 
Nations efforts to strengthen national human rights protection systems. The Board 
recognized and emphasized the strategic importance of cooperation between OHCHR and 
UNDP at the country level by all types of field presences and stressed the value of 
partnership with regional human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>37. The Board was kept abreast of the new structure of the OHCHR National 
Institutions and Regional Mechanisms Section in the Field Operations and Technical 
Cooperation Division, which would, as mandated by the Human Rights Council, enhance 
and further systematize its relations with regional human rights organizations and 
mechanisms, including by regularly organizing workshops on regional arrangements for the 
promotion and protection of human rights. These workshops are intended to be used for 
further sharing of information and elaboration of practical proposals on how to strengthen 
cooperation between the United Nations and regional human rights arrangements. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Translation of human rights themes into the OHCHR 
Technical Cooperation Programme and Policy 
recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Board received an update on the status of UPR follow-up at the country level, 
including experiences drawn from the annual meeting with OHCHR heads of field 
presences. The Board welcomed the positive developments regarding the UPR. It also 
inquired about the status of existing and new donor contributions to the Voluntary Fund for 
Financial and Technical Assistance and noted that discussion on the criteria for using the 
funds were still under consideration. The Board suggested that the experience of the 
Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation should be taken into account when 
administering the UPR funds and reaffirmed that the activities under the Voluntary Fund 
for Financial and Technical Assistance to assist countries implementing recommendations </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-10528 
</p>
<p>emanating from the UPR should remain complementary to the Voluntary Fund for 
Technical Cooperation. 
</p>
<p>39. The Board noted that, with limited funds, there was need for an articulated follow-up 
and standard approach on the UPR recommendations. The Board acknowledged the 
successful acceptance of the UPR process by a large number of countries and welcomed the 
strategic partnerships with UNDP and other stakeholders in the field. It highlighted the 
challenges but also the potential of the UPR mechanism, pointing out that the review by the 
Human Rights Council of the UPR mechanism in 2012 could be an appropriate occasion to 
analyse and discuss the positive as well as the negative developments in the process in its 
first cycle.  
</p>
<p>40. The Board was kept abreast on the Durban Review Conference, its outcome and 
follow-up. It noted the challenges posed to OHCHR in bringing consensus to assist States 
and civil society in their endeavour to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, 
exclusion and related intolerance. The Board noted that OHCHR would continue in the next 
biennium to service the Durban mechanisms, undertake research aimed at developing a 
database on racism and intolerance, help States and other stakeholders to develop national 
action plans as required by the Durban documents and promote strategic partnerships. 
</p>
<p>41. The Board was updated on the outcome of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and related communication strategy. It was informed that this 
had been the largest media campaign undertaken by OHCHR and had been largely 
successful in its global outreach to promote the Office&#8217;s work. The Board also 
acknowledged the usefulness of the materials that had been produced for promoting the 
work of OHCHR to a wide audience and urged the Office to explore the latest technology 
and media in promoting its work. 
</p>
<p>42. The Civil Society Unit of OHCHR expressed its gratitude at being given an 
opportunity to meet with the Board members, who were informed of work by OHCHR to 
involve the broadest possible cross section of civil society elements in the work of OHCHR 
and the United Nations human rights system. The Board was updated on the production of 
<i>Working with the United Nations Human Rights Programme: A Handbook for Civil 
Society</i>, which would be available in all official United Nations and other languages and 
was to be disseminated broadly. The Board acknowledged the important role played by 
civil society in promoting human rights and the new opportunities provided by the UPR 
mechanism for civil society engagement. 
</p>
<p>43. The Board was briefed on the collaboration that the Millennium Development Goals 
Unit of OHCHR had developed with the United Nations system as a whole in 
mainstreaming human rights within the framework of the inter-agency programme. The 
Board was heartened to learn about the work of the system-wide United Nations 
Development Group joint task forces and acknowledged that partnerships and cooperation 
were integral to the advancement and effectiveness in the work of OHCHR. It hoped that 
the human rights capacity of United Nations country teams would be further expanded and 
strengthened, including through the follow-up to the Action 2 Global Programme and the 
&#8220;delivering as one&#8221; process. This will include providing substantive advice to United 
Nations country teams, backstopping and deploying human rights advisers, and 
contributing to the work of relevant inter-agency mechanisms in Geneva and New York.  
</p>
<p>44. The Board also received an update from the OHCHR Methodology, Education and 
Training Unit on working with the thematic priorities of the OHCHR headquarters and 
regional offices to provide training, human rights assessment tools, guidance on human 
rights monitoring and investigations, and advice to Governments on national development 
action plans. The Board was also interested to hear about the new area of work on 
knowledge management for the Organization in improving its effectiveness. </p>
