<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 6/13, preserved the Social Forum as a 
</p>
<p>unique space for interactive dialogue between the United Nations human rights machinery 
</p>
<p>and a variety of relevant stakeholders, underlining the importance of coordinated efforts at 
</p>
<p>the national, regional and international levels for the promotion of social cohesion based on 
</p>
<p>the principles of social justice, equity and solidarity; to address the social dimension and 
</p>
<p>challenges of globalization; and issues linked with the national and international 
</p>
<p>environment required for  the promotion of the enjoyment of all human rights by all.

</p>
<p>2. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 26/28, the Social Forum was 
</p>
<p>held in Geneva from 18 to 20 February 2015 and considered access to medicines in the 
</p>
<p>context of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
</p>
<p>physical and mental health, including best practices in that regard. The President of the 
</p>
<p>Council appointed Faisal bin Abdulla al-Henzab, Ambassador and Permanent 
</p>
<p>Representative of Qatar to the United Nations Office at Geneva, as the Chairperson-
</p>
<p>Rapporteur of the Forum. 
</p>
<p>3. The programme of work2 was prepared under the guidance of the Chairperson, with 
</p>
<p>inputs from relevant stakeholders. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 26/28, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 8, background reports made available by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) informed the discussions (A/HRC/23/42, 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/17/43 and A/HRC/11/12). The present report contains a summary of the 
</p>
<p>proceedings as well as conclusions and recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Opening of the Social Forum 
</b></p>
<p>4. In his opening remarks, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Social Forum called on 
</p>
<p>participants to identify and promote concrete, progressive and action-oriented approaches to 
</p>
<p>improve access to medicines. Noting the particular significance of that issue to the State 
</p>
<p>and people of Qatar, he advocated greater international cooperation to guarantee access to 
</p>
<p>medicines, which was critical for health, well-being and development for all and a matter of 
</p>
<p>social justice. Therefore inequities, including high costs borne by patients in many low and 
</p>
<p>middle-income countries, must be eliminated. To that end, the international community 
</p>
<p>should support innovation and local production, use of flexibilities under the Agreement on 
</p>
<p>Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), policy coherence among 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations and international trade and investment regimes, and active 
</p>
<p>engagement of all stakeholders, including the private sector, to save the lives of millions 
</p>
<p>who do not have access to medicines.  
</p>
<p>5. Jane Connors, Director of the Research and Right to Development Division, 
</p>
<p>OHCHR, described access to medicines as a critical and timely issue, particularly in the 
</p>
<p>light of the emerging post-2015 development agenda. OHCHR had consistently advocated 
</p>
<p>that the agenda be underpinned by human rights law, which obliged States to respect, 
</p>
<p>protect and fulfil the right to health. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights required States to take steps, to the maximum of their available resources, 
</p>
<p>towards realization of the right to health, prohibited retrogressive measures, and required 
</p>
<p>immediate fulfilment of minimum core obligations. According to the Committee on 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, access to medicines was a core obligation. 
</p>
<p>Medicines must be affordable, acceptable, accessible, of good quality, and made available </p>
<p>without discrimination. Yet, 2 billion men, women and children had no access to essential 
</p>
<p>medicines. Ms. Connors called on the international community to take immediate steps to 
</p>
<p>rectify that tragedy, including by building production capacity in developing countries, 
</p>
<p>allowing access to generic drugs and enhancing research and development relating to 
</p>
<p>treatment for neglected diseases.  
</p>
<p>6. Joachim R&#252;cker, President of the Human Rights Council, affirmed his support for 
</p>
<p>the Social Forum as a subsidiary body of the Council, bringing together multiple 
</p>
<p>stakeholders including Member States, civil society and others. The Forum provided a 
</p>
<p>unique space enabling constructive engagement to discuss practical solutions to real life 
</p>
<p>problems including at the grass-roots level. He called for immediate action to strengthen 
</p>
<p>health systems, establish universal health coverage and ensure access to safe and 
</p>
<p>efficacious medicines. Recent tragedies, like the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, illustrated 
</p>
<p>the need for immediate measures to strengthen health systems with rights-based solutions 
</p>
<p>that affirmed peoples&#8217; dignity and ensured their well-being. In moving forward, including 
</p>
<p>on access to medicines in the post-2015 development agenda, respect for human rights must 
</p>
<p>be the ultimate foundation upon which rested the legitimacy of the actions of governments, 
</p>
<p>international institutions and corporations. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Summary of proceedings</b>3<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Keynote speakers and general statements 
</b></p>
<p>7. Deqo Mohamed, Chief Executive Officer of the Dr. Hawa Abdi Foundation in 
</p>
<p>Somalia, described its work. With limited resources, it had provided health care to over a 
</p>
<p>million people in a war-torn, rural setting. She advocated a holistic approach to health-care 
</p>
<p>delivery by improving access to clinics (roads and infrastructure), training medical 
</p>
<p>personnel and building health facilities. The Foundation also developed the skills of grass-
</p>
<p>roots communities. The Hawa Abdi Village that had grown around the clinic represented a 
</p>
<p>bastion of security and community. While international non-governmental organizations 
</p>
<p>contributed to programmes, their roles were often temporary, leaving a vacuum following 
</p>
<p>their departure. Support was required to establish a functioning public health system, 
</p>
<p>including through training community health workers and improved use of technology. 
</p>
<p>Mobile phones, for example, could facilitate communication between patients and health 
</p>
<p>personnel, where physical access was difficult. A renewed focus on sustaining access to 
</p>
<p>medicines was needed, including by empowering people through education designed to 
</p>
<p>promote their independence. 
</p>
<p>8. Jorge Bermudez, Vice-President of Health Production and Innovation, Funda&#231;&#227;o 
</p>
<p>Oswaldo Cruz, Ministry of Health, Brazil, discussed the impact of international trade 
</p>
<p>agreements on access to medicines and the need to integrate right to health considerations 
</p>
<p>in negotiations. The TRIPS Agreement should not impede the realization of the right to 
</p>
<p>health. In its negotiations, Brazil advocated measures to uphold the right to health. It had 
</p>
<p>explicitly embraced that right in its domestic laws and policies, including by guaranteeing 
</p>
<p>universal access to health care and linking health and development. Brazil had used public-
</p>
<p>private partnerships to reduce medicine costs and develop local expertise. It had also 
</p>
<p>employed price regulation, essential medicines lists and other domestic policies. Those 
</p>
<p>

<p>efforts had resulted in substantially lower prices for antiretroviral therapies. Nevertheless, 
</p>
<p>affordability remained a major problem. He called for national, regional and global action 
</p>
<p>to address the human rights implications of the intellectual property regime, including 
</p>
<p>expansion of TRIPS flexibilities, increased use of voluntary licensing mechanisms and 
</p>
<p>international support to promote progress towards trade agreements that improved access. 
</p>
<p>9. Stephen Lewis, Co-Director of AIDS-Free World, discussed affordability and the 
</p>
<p>responsibilities of pharmaceutical companies. He decried a system that allowed companies 
</p>
<p>to charge tens of thousands of dollars for treatment with a production cost of only around 
</p>
<p>100 dollars, wherein companies intensively lobbied governments to protect the status quo. 
</p>
<p>Emphatic that balance sheets must not be prioritized over human lives, Mr. Lewis recalled 
</p>
<p>the recommendation of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law to convene a neutral 
</p>
<p>high-level body to develop a new intellectual property regime for pharmaceutical products, 
</p>
<p>and to place a moratorium on patent protection of medicines in future free-trade 
</p>
<p>agreements. He proposed five steps to increase access to medicines: (a) use the proposed 
</p>
<p>sustainable development goals, especially goal 3.8, to put pressure on governments; 
</p>
<p>(b) litigate against pharmaceutical companies; (c) integrate right to health considerations in 
</p>
<p>trade negotiations; (d) form alliances to raise awareness of cost and accessibility issues; 
</p>
<p>(e) support OHCHR in its efforts to encourage governments to fund health care.  
</p>
<p>10. In the general statements segment, representatives of Brazil, Chile, China, 
</p>
<p>Colombia, Cuba, India, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the Bolivarian 
</p>
<p>Republic of Venezuela, the Holy See, the Ariel Foundation International and Autistic 
</p>
<p>Minority International intervened. States highlighted measures at the national level for 
</p>
<p>ensuring access to medicines. They emphasized that health concerns must prevail over 
</p>
<p>intellectual property rights and commercial interests and called for flexibility in the TRIPS 
</p>
<p>Agreement. Other issues raised included: quality of medicines; production of generics; 
</p>
<p>supporting local capacity; inequality between States and the resulting impact on access; 
</p>
<p>mental health; overprescription; international cooperation; public-private partnerships; 
</p>
<p>benefits of healthy populations to development; links between health costs and poverty; 
</p>
<p>investment and innovation; mobilizing resources to combat disease in developing countries; 
</p>
<p>medication for children; youth participation in relevant discussions; black markets; health-
</p>
<p>care laws and policies. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Overview of access to medicines in the context of the right to health 
</b></p>
<p>11. Martin Khor, Executive Director of the South Centre, described access to medicines 
</p>
<p>as a cornerstone of the enjoyment of the rights to health and life. Key barriers included 
</p>
<p>investment treaties and regional agreements limiting TRIPS flexibilities, reduced 
</p>
<p>government revenues owing to economic situations, and conditions that prevented the 
</p>
<p>establishment and continued functioning of generic companies. To address those 
</p>
<p>challenges, he suggested: (a) promoting the use of TRIPS flexibilities; (b) renewing TRIPS 
</p>
<p>exceptions for least developed countries for as long as they retained that status; 
</p>
<p>(c) permitting TRIPS exceptions for middle-income countries; (d) amending investment 
</p>
<p>treaties that threatened the right to health; (e) eliminating TRIPS-plus provisions and other 
</p>
<p>clauses in free-trade agreements that might jeopardize access to medicines and the right to 
</p>
<p>health; (f) protecting public health services even in times of economic crisis; (g) building 
</p>
<p>capacity to produce generic medicines; (h) promoting universal access to newly developed 
</p>
<p>medicines; (i) prioritizing development of medicines for drug-resistant diseases; 
</p>
<p>(j) promoting publicly funded and shared research and development; (k) providing financial 
</p>
<p>and technological assistance to developing countries. 
</p>
<p>12. Zafar Mirza, Coordinator, Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property, 
</p>
<p>Department of Essential Medicines and Health Products, World Health Organization </p>


<p>(WHO), presented an overview of the WHO work on access to medicines which was one of 
</p>
<p>its six leadership priorities. Access to medicines could be rendered sustainable in the 
</p>
<p>context of universal health coverage and functioning health systems. It was an unequivocal 
</p>
<p>part of the human right to health and a complex issue involving multiple stakeholders, 
</p>
<p>determinants and perspectives. WHO strived to promote universal access to safe, effective 
</p>
<p>and high quality medicines that were prescribed and used rationally, and monitored by 
</p>
<p>appropriate regulatory mechanisms. Access to existing medicines (generic and patent) 
</p>
<p>should be improved and research and development for new essential medicines should 
</p>
<p>focus on improving health outcomes, not only returns on investment. The medical needs of 
</p>
<p>the most vulnerable must be met. Litigation on the right to health promoted access to 
</p>
<p>medicines. 
</p>
<p>13. Dainius P&#363;ras, Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
</p>
<p>highest attainable standard of health, denounced widespread and crippling inequalities in 
</p>
<p>access to health services and medicines that had left 2 billion people without access to the 
</p>
<p>health products they needed. Ill health was both a cause and consequence of poverty and 
</p>
<p>access to medicines was a particularly pertinent problem in the developing world. States 
</p>
<p>must ensure that medicines were affordable and accessible on a non-discriminatory basis. 
</p>
<p>That required improved procurement and distribution globally, especially in developing 
</p>
<p>countries. Research and development in medicines for neglected diseases must be 
</p>
<p>improved. Although States had the primary responsibility for ensuring access to medicines, 
</p>
<p>including through domestic health policies, intellectual property laws and donor country 
</p>
<p>policies could also have major impacts. He discussed problems of medicine overuse and 
</p>
<p>misuse especially in relation to mental illness. Prescription of medicines, particularly 
</p>
<p>psychotropic medicines, should be part of a holistic approach to treatment.  
</p>
<p>14. During the interactive dialogue, representatives of India, the Indian Council of South 
</p>
<p>America, the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care and Rencontre 
</p>
<p>africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme took the floor. The speakers highlighted 
</p>
<p>issues such as lack of access to effective pain relief medicines, the slow response to the 
</p>
<p>Ebola crisis, the failure of the intellectual property regime to protect traditional knowledge 
</p>
<p>from exploitation by pharmaceutical companies, and differences between challenges 
</p>
<p>relating to access to patented and generic drugs.  
</p>
<p>15. In response, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
</p>
<p>highest attainable standard of health observed that there were many lessons to learn from 
</p>
<p>the Ebola crisis. He called for improved response systems, mobilization of additional 
</p>
<p>resources, and improved health systems and infrastructure to prevent crises. Dr. Mirza 
</p>
<p>clarified the fact that the challenges in access to patented and generic drugs were the same, 
</p>
<p>but that the high prices of patented drugs posed an additional challenge. He suggested a 
</p>
<p>broader approach going beyond a focus on patented drugs and market failures, to also 
</p>
<p>recognize failures in public policy. Speaking on behalf of Mr. Khor, Germ&#225;n Vel&#225;squez, 
</p>
<p>Special Adviser for Health and Development at the South Centre, suggested that WHO 
</p>
<p>employ article 19 of its Constitution to make binding decisions and deliver justice in access 
</p>
<p>to medicines.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Improving health delivery systems in challenging contexts 
</b></p>
<p>16. Abdul Majeed Siddiqi, Head of Mission, HealthNet TPO, Afghanistan, discussed 
</p>
<p>mental health treatment in fragile States. In Afghanistan, the work of HealthNet TPO since 
</p>
<p>2000 had included efforts to integrate mental health services in the health systems of 
</p>
<p>15 provinces on the basis of fact-finding, education and training, and policy advocacy. 
</p>
<p>However, approximately half the Afghan population suffered from mental health problems, 
</p>
<p>compared with 20 per cent in other developing countries, and only 2 per cent sought </p>


<p>treatment. Additional challenges in Afghanistan included: stigmatization of mental health 
</p>
<p>patients; unequal integration of mental health services in primary and secondary health 
</p>
<p>care; lack of quality referral health care, funding and prioritization by the Government and 
</p>
<p>donors; staff capacity, supply of medicines in health facilities, quality of medicines and 
</p>
<p>compliance.  
</p>
<p>17. Msgr. Robert J. Vitillo, Head, Caritas Internationalis, Geneva, while acknowledging 
</p>
<p>the role of States, pointed to the complementary role in health crises of various stakeholders 
</p>
<p>including faith-based organizations. Following the Ebola outbreak, while governments and 
</p>
<p>international organizations struggled to respond, organizations like Caritas had acted 
</p>
<p>immediately at the local, national, regional and international levels. They strengthened and 
</p>
<p>maintained support provided by local Catholic health services and mobilized international 
</p>
<p>volunteers, working with local communities. Faith-based organizations were particularly 
</p>
<p>well placed to ensure that human dignity was upheld in all circumstances, and to provide 
</p>
<p>local communities with material, pastoral and spiritual support that complemented medical 
</p>
<p>support from health-service providers. 
</p>
<p>18. Mahmoud Daher, Head, WHO Gaza sub-office for the occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>territories, explained how since 1967 military occupation had impeded development in the 
</p>
<p>region, weakening all aspects of development for 4.2 million Palestinians and adversely 
</p>
<p>affecting health systems. In Gaza, multiple external and internal factors had caused chronic 
</p>
<p>shortages in essential medicines averaging 30 per cent over the past five years, and, 
</p>
<p>averaging 50 per cent in disposable medical supplies. Unreliable fuel supplies and 
</p>
<p>inadequate equipment and financial resources also posed obstacles to health services 
</p>
<p>delivery, especially in Gaza.<b> </b>He noted that the Palestinian health sector would continue to 
</p>
<p>suffer until the structural causes of those deficiencies were addressed and barriers were 
</p>
<p>removed to control over resources and planning, to economic and educational opportunities 
</p>
<p>and to self-determination.  
</p>
<p>19. During the interactive dialogue, interventions were made by representatives of the 
</p>
<p>Congo, Associazione Comunit&#224; Papa Giovanni XXIII, the China Medical Association, 
</p>
<p>Health Innovation in Practice, New Generation Ishaka, the People&#8217;s Health Movement, and 
</p>
<p>by Dr. Bermudez and Raffaela Schiavon, General Director, Ipas Mexico. Suggestions 
</p>
<p>included: (a) the international community must guarantee access to essential drugs and 
</p>
<p>protect and support health-care professionals even in challenging contexts and people in 
</p>
<p>vulnerable situations including women, must have access to medicines; (b) renew the focus 
</p>
<p>on direct actions to improve health systems, including in rural areas, and to train medical 
</p>
<p>personnel and support staff; (c) build trust between communities and health workers; (d) 
</p>
<p>effectively coordinate international responses to health challenges; (e) base long-term, 
</p>
<p>sustainable approaches to improve access to medicines, on data and not politics.  
</p>
<p>20. In his concluding remarks, Msgr. Vitillo observed that maternal health care was 
</p>
<p>often neglected in challenging contexts, for example, Ebola treatment units had no facilities 
</p>
<p>designed for childbirth. However, increased cooperation between governments, 
</p>
<p>international medical teams and non-governmental organizations working with local 
</p>
<p>communities could support better health outcomes. Mr. Daher noted that many health-care 
</p>
<p>professionals in Gaza had not received their salaries for over a year, causing serious strains 
</p>
<p>on the system. Dr. Siddiqi stated that donors adopted different approaches, but that there 
</p>
<p>had been some recent success in streamlining and improving the effectiveness of 
</p>
<p>international assistance to improve access to essential medicines in challenging contexts. 
</p>
<p>Panellists agreed on the need for pharmaceutical companies, governments and the 
</p>
<p>international community to improve responsiveness to crises and ensure the realization of 
</p>
<p>human rights.  </p>


<p><b> D. Access to medicines for women and children 
</b></p>
<p>21. Dr. Schiavon stated that ensuring access to, and consistent procurement of, 
</p>
<p>reproductive and neonatal health commodities was essential to ensuring human rights 
</p>
<p>including the rights to health and life. Although maternal mortality rates had dropped 
</p>
<p>significantly since 1990, 289,000 women had still died from causes relating to maternity in 
</p>
<p>2013, and there were significant disparities in mortality rates between regions. Worldwide 
</p>
<p>41 per cent of pregnancies were unwanted, and most of them were due to non-use or 
</p>
<p>underuse of contraceptives. Lower contraceptive use correlated with higher rates of 
</p>
<p>abortion. Reducing unintended pregnancies could avert 60 per cent of maternal deaths and 
</p>
<p>57 per cent of child deaths. Although access to contraceptives had increased, inequities 
</p>
<p>remained both within and between States. Diverse challenges and barriers prevented equal 
</p>
<p>access to potentially life-saving drugs for women, including ideological opposition to 
</p>
<p>certain medications, such as emergency contraception and misoprostol (oral oxytocic) 
</p>
<p>recommended for a variety of obstetric uses. She advocated evidence-based guidelines and 
</p>
<p>policies to promote access to medicines for sexual and reproductive health.  
</p>
<p>22. Tarek Meguid, Associate Professor, State University of Zanzibar, asserted that lack 
</p>
<p>of access to medicines constituted a grave human rights violation, particularly in maternal 
</p>
<p>and child health. Quoting Mahmoud Fathalla, he said that women were not dying from a 
</p>
<p>lack of technical capacity. They were dying because they were poor, powerless and 
</p>
<p>pregnant, and the international community had yet to make the decision that their lives were 
</p>
<p>worth saving. He described inadequate facilities which had an air of veterinary medicine 
</p>
<p>about them, and stressed that the lives and dignity of poor women and children must be 
</p>
<p>protected. Women must be given the space to empower themselves so that they can take 
</p>
<p>control of their own lives. Dr. Meguid called for the creation of physical, economic and 
</p>
<p>social spaces for women to give them agency and enable them to be the drivers of change. 
</p>
<p>That required immediate action. 
</p>
<p>23. Lingli Zhang, Professor and Director of Pharmacy, West China Second University 
</p>
<p>Hospital, Sichuan University, described efforts to improve children&#8217;s access to medicines in 
</p>
<p>the BRICS countries (Brazil, China, India, the Russian Federation and South Africa), 
</p>
<p>noting their efforts to reach reduction targets in child mortality. While many affordable and 
</p>
<p>accessible medicines had been developed, effective intervention was often inadequate 
</p>
<p>owing to the lack of paediatric formulations and other factors. Despite positive steps, only 
</p>
<p>4.1 per cent of medicines in China were reserved for children, according to a survey of 
</p>
<p>medicines used in paediatrics in 15 hospitals. Dr. Zhang suggested that an appeal be 
</p>
<p>launched to raise global awareness of the need for all States to have an essential medicine 
</p>
<p>list for children. She called for States to learn from each other&#8217;s good practices, including 
</p>
<p>advances by BRICS countries, like the essential medicine list for children in China, India 
</p>
<p>and South Africa.  
</p>
<p>24. In the ensuing discussion, the speakers were Dr. Mohamed and representatives of 
</p>
<p>OHCHR, Associazione Comunit&#224; Papa Giovanni XXIII, Autistic Minority International, 
</p>
<p>the Center for Reproductive Rights and the People&#8217;s Health Movement. They discussed 
</p>
<p>governmental duties to ensure access to information on contraceptive services on a non-
</p>
<p>discriminatory basis; access to medicines for pregnant women living with food insecurity, 
</p>
<p>and for autistic women and children; and the potential of education in reducing infant 
</p>
<p>mortality. War and migration disproportionately affected women, mothers and children. In 
</p>
<p>such cases, special health policies should be implemented and drugs made available in 
</p>
<p>durable forms that did not require refrigeration.  
</p>
<p>25. Dr. Meguid stated that poor conditions were the standard for people who lived with 
</p>
<p>inadequate medical facilities. Since they had no agency in relation to their health needs that 
</p>
<p>would enable accountability, they did not complain. Health facilities were understaffed and </p>


<p>their personnel worked in unacceptable conditions. Health workers became both victims 
</p>
<p>and perpetrators of human rights abuses. Consequently, they would continue to deliver 
</p>
<p>inferior health services until they and their patients were empowered. Dr. Schiavon 
</p>
<p>concluded that inequity in access to contraceptives and some other medicines was global, 
</p>
<p>and often an ideological issue. Dr. Zhang called for change in mindsets on access to 
</p>
<p>medicines and stressed the importance of an effective health policy.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Intellectual property rights and access to medicines 
</b></p>
<p>26. Lisa Forman, Assistant Professor, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of 
</p>
<p>Toronto, described access to medicines as one of the most explicit examples of how 
</p>
<p>economics and trade rules conflicted with human rights, including the rights to life, health 
</p>
<p>and development. She focused on how intellectual property rights had an impact on drugs, 
</p>
<p>illustrated by the increase in drug prices in Malaysia of 28 per cent per year between 1996 
</p>
<p>and 2005 following the implementation of TRIPS. Over 2 billion people still lacked access 
</p>
<p>to essential medicines, with drug pricing remaining a key obstacle to access. She called on 
</p>
<p>the United Nations to support the use of compulsory licensing as a proven means of 
</p>
<p>reducing prices and realizing State duties under the right to health. States should be held to 
</p>
<p>account in the universal periodic review process for imposing TRIPS-plus provisions in 
</p>
<p>free trade agreements as a violation of the right to health. Ms. Forman suggested that 
</p>
<p>TRIPS flexibilities were an insufficient solution to pricing concerns, referring to the Global 
</p>
<p>Commission on HIV and the Law&#8217;s recommendation that the Secretary-General create a 
</p>
<p>new body to recommend a new intellectual property rights regime for drugs. 
</p>
<p>27. Thamara Romero, Legal Officer, Intellectual Property Unit, United Nations 
</p>
<p>Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) discussed UNCTAD work on access to 
</p>
<p>medicines. The UNCTAD mandate in that area was based on the 2012 Doha Mandate  
</p>
<p>(TD/500/Add.1, para. 65 (j)), and its assurance of the supply of essential medicines. 
</p>
<p>UNCTAD had observed an increased need to diversify and expand pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>production. In the future India might no longer be considered the &#8220;pharmacy of the world&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Expanding local production could result in improved access. She referred to a high court 
</p>
<p>case in Peru in which an individual&#8217;s right to health had been upheld, regardless of whether 
</p>
<p>the Government had assigned adequate financial resources to the health sector. She called 
</p>
<p>for increased use of TRIPS flexibilities. She argued that, if properly implemented, human 
</p>
<p>rights and intellectual property were not necessarily contradictory. However, it was 
</p>
<p>necessary to create awareness among policymakers and judges on the application of TRIPs 
</p>
<p>flexibilities to enhance access to medicines.   
</p>
<p>28. Antony Taubman, Director, Intellectual Property Division, World Trade 
</p>
<p>Organization (WTO), highlighted the intersection of health, trade and intellectual property 
</p>
<p>rights. The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health was a major 
</p>
<p>milestone in understanding those intersections, recognizing the importance of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property in the development of new medicines while acknowledging possible effects on 
</p>
<p>pricing &#8212; a basis for international policy discussions seeking to implement practically an 
</p>
<p>appropriate balance between promoting access and innovation. He recommended greater 
</p>
<p>international cooperation to fulfil the right to health, required for sustainable development. 
</p>
<p>He outlined three broad areas for future work: (a) elucidation of rules, data and industry 
</p>
<p>developments; (b) coordination of operations and system-wide coherence; 
</p>
<p>(c) implementation and action. Drawing on the study by WTO, the World Intellectual 
</p>
<p>Property Organization and WHO, <i>Promoting Access to Medical Technologies and 
</i></p>
<p><i>Innovation</i>, he noted widespread recognition of the need to strengthen national health 
</p>
<p>systems and to develop innovative procurement solutions within existing legal and policy 
</p>
<p>frameworks. </p>


<p>29. During the interactive dialogue, comments were made by representatives of 
</p>
<p>Colombia, India, Mexico, the Colombian Commission of Jurists, Knowledge Ecology 
</p>
<p>International, the People&#8217;s Health Movement-Safe Observer International, Third World 
</p>
<p>Network, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines, as well as by Dr. Bermudez, Dr. 
</p>
<p>Schiavon and Regina Kamoga, Executive Director, Community Health and Information 
</p>
<p>Network, Uganda. They discussed the following: South-South cooperation; patent 
</p>
<p>monopolies; TRIPs-plus provisions in free trade agreements; the fundamental unfairness of 
</p>
<p>intellectual property regimes, particularly for middle income countries; definition of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;essential medicines&#8221;; alternatives to TRIPS; the  role of WTO; contribution of universities 
</p>
<p>to innovation and development of medicines; barriers to research and development; 
</p>
<p>antibiotic resistance and the challenge from intellectual property regimes that hampered the 
</p>
<p>supply of effective antibiotics; the positive role of TRIPs in spurring innovation; the need 
</p>
<p>for more compulsory licensing in developing countries.  
</p>
<p>30. In her closing remarks, Ms. Forman referred to the responsibilities of States in 
</p>
<p>ensuring access to all medicines, not only essential medicines, and asserted that the current 
</p>
<p>system of TRIPs exceptions and flexibilities was inequitable. The Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which had entered into force on 
</p>
<p>5 May 2013, established a legally binding petitions procedure, an important mechanism for 
</p>
<p>interpretation and enforcement of the right to health. Mr. Taubman reiterated the 
</p>
<p>importance of policy coherence across legal and policy regimes. He called for intellectual 
</p>
<p>property experts to develop a stronger understanding of public health issues, and for health 
</p>
<p>practitioners and policymakers to gain a practical understanding of TRIPS flexibilities. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Romero noted that different countries had different needs, but that analyses of national 
</p>
<p>legal strategies were helpful in implementing the TRIPS agreement and its flexibilities. 
</p>
<p>Improved local production capacity facilitated access to medicines.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Lessons learned and emerging challenges in the global response 
</b></p>
<p><b>to AIDS 
</b></p>
<p>31. Martin Choo, Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (APN+), 
</p>
<p>stressed the importance of equitable access and effective treatment. He asserted that access 
</p>
<p>to treatment was a human right, treatment made patients feel human, and effective 
</p>
<p>treatment was a public good. However, patients were being left behind, and many of those 
</p>
<p>so left behind were from vulnerable social groups including the poor, sex workers, drug 
</p>
<p>users and lesbian, gay, transgender, transsexual and intersex persons. He argued that 
</p>
<p>patients should not be mere statistics. In the Asia Pacific region, almost 40 per cent of 
</p>
<p>people infected with HIV/AIDS were not receiving treatment. Depression and mental 
</p>
<p>illness were highly prevalent amongst people with HIV but they often went untreated as 
</p>
<p>well. In national legislatures APN+ had strongly advocated that people living with HIV had 
</p>
<p>the right to have access to treatment. APN+ also worked to extend treatment and 
</p>
<p>community support to the most vulnerable. 
</p>
<p>32. Alma de Leon, Regional Director, International Treatment Preparedness Coalition, 
</p>
<p>Latin America and the Caribbean, explained that many medicines available in the 
</p>
<p>developed world were not available in Latin America. Children often had little access to 
</p>
<p>treatment, which might, however, be reduced or eliminated when they became adults for 
</p>
<p>lack of the third line of drugs, which were inaccessible in some countries because of their 
</p>
<p>high price. The new development goals must accelerate universal coverage and eliminate 
</p>
<p>gaps in access to medicines. Universal health care would only become a reality if the 
</p>
<p>people&#8217;s demands were met and if human rights prevailed over intellectual property rights. 
</p>
<p>She called on the international community to break down barriers to access and pursue 
</p>
<p>international trade and investment laws that permitted access to affordable medicines. The </p>


<p>commendable efforts of community movements in exerting pressure to reduce prices must 
</p>
<p>be redoubled to enhance progress towards access to affordable medicines for all. 
</p>
<p>33. Tenu Avafia, Policy Adviser, HIV, Health and Development Practice, Bureau for 
</p>
<p>Development Policy, United Nations Development Programme, cited the report of the 
</p>
<p>Global Commission on HIV and the Law which called for changes in legal systems. That 
</p>
<p>could prevent up to 900,000 new HIV infections by 2030. The Joint United Nations 
</p>
<p>Programme on HIV/AIDS had set several targets in that regard including: halving the 
</p>
<p>number of countries with punitive laws and practices around HIV transmission; creating an 
</p>
<p>environment which safeguarded dignity, health and justice; and developing action-oriented, 
</p>
<p>evidence-based recommendations for effective AIDS responses that promoted and 
</p>
<p>protected the human rights of people living with and most vulnerable to HIV. The report 
</p>
<p>emphasized that application of the current patent regime to medicines was a recent 
</p>
<p>development. Furthermore, States had historically had the right to license patented 
</p>
<p>inventions compulsorily when needed. The TRIPS Agreement posed a barrier to access to 
</p>
<p>medicines. It benefited patent-holders at the expense of people living with HIV. The report 
</p>
<p>recommended that the Secretary-General examine proposals for a new multilateral regime 
</p>
<p>to promote innovation and increase access, that developed countries stop pushing TRIPS-
</p>
<p>plus agreements, that developing countries use TRIPS flexibilities, and that least developed 
</p>
<p>countries be indefinitely exempted from TRIPS. 
</p>
<p>34. During the dialogue, there were interventions from representatives of the Bolivarian 
</p>
<p>Republic of Venezuela, the China Medical Association, Health Innovation in Practice and 
</p>
<p>Zomi Community USA, as well as from Amit Sengupta, Associate Coordinator, People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Health Movement, India, and Dr. Bermudez. They called for urgent action to change an 
</p>
<p>intellectual property regime that continued to be a barrier to access to medicines. The 
</p>
<p>achievements of the AIDS movement had not been adequately translated into improved 
</p>
<p>access to all medicines for all. Continued activism would support access to medicines for 
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS treatment and States must act to improve their local production of drugs, 
</p>
<p>eradicate stigmatization of persons living with HIV/AIDS and ensure that domestic laws 
</p>
<p>and policies promoted, protected and fulfilled people&#8217;s right to health.  
</p>
<p>35. In conclusion, panellists emphasized the need to eliminate stigma and discrimination 
</p>
<p>against persons living with HIV/AIDS. Mr. Choo called for increased support from 
</p>
<p>international organizations, improved mental health care and strategic, interlinked, 
</p>
<p>community-based partnerships to support and care for persons living with HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>Ms. de Leon advocated increased attention to key populations and an end to senseless 
</p>
<p>deaths caused by stigmatization of persons living with HIV/AIDS. Mr. Avafia stressed the 
</p>
<p>importance of strong legal systems in protecting patient confidentiality and reducing 
</p>
<p>stigma. He observed that current drug prices were not sustainable even in developed 
</p>
<p>countries and that they affected persons suffering from all diseases. He argued for policy 
</p>
<p>coherence to reconcile human rights obligations and international trade and investment 
</p>
<p>laws.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Patient-centred approaches to access to medicines 
</b></p>
<p>36. Ms. Kamoga  called for a people-centred approach to access to medicines that took 
</p>
<p>into account cultural and demographic differences to extend appropriate and effective 
</p>
<p>health care to rural and urban populations alike. Rural populations faced particular 
</p>
<p>difficulties in reaching medical centres and were more likely to experience lack of access to 
</p>
<p>medicines owing to shortages. She explained that Uganda had both formal and informal 
</p>
<p>medical systems. People who lacked access to formal systems must rely on private health 
</p>
<p>care and pay three to five times more for medicines than those with formal coverage. 
</p>
<p>Innovative approaches were essential to ensure access to medicines and save lives. Civil </p>


<p>society organizations had led the way by extending medical services to rural areas, 
</p>
<p>promoting community drug distribution programmes that pooled transportation costs and 
</p>
<p>providing social support and education for patients. Unfortunately, many national 
</p>
<p>governments in developing countries lacked the political will to take action to protect their 
</p>
<p>citizens. They must act immediately to ensure access to affordable, high quality and safe 
</p>
<p>medicines and promote further investment in research and development.  
</p>
<p>37. Dimitry Borisov, Executive Director, Equal Right to Life, Russian Federation, 
</p>
<p>asserted that all persons had an equal right to life. Therefore, access to medical care for all 
</p>
<p>categories of patients must be ensured. Unfortunately, in the Russian Federation, there were 
</p>
<p>plans to reduce spending on health care from 3.6 per cent to 2.8 per cent of gross domestic 
</p>
<p>product, placing a direct threat to access to medicines. Beyond resources, there were 
</p>
<p>structural barriers to access including inadequate transparency in decision-making 
</p>
<p>processes, insufficient collection of data, and a gap between legislative policies and their 
</p>
<p>financing and execution. Those problems were clearly evident in cancer treatment. The 
</p>
<p>inadequate treatment of cancer patients substantially affected mortality rates and those 
</p>
<p>problems were reflective of the health system of the Russian Federation as a whole. Equal 
</p>
<p>Right to Life promoted a patient-centred approach and advocated fulfilment of State health-
</p>
<p>care commitments and intersectoral collaboration. 
</p>
<p>38. Noel Hayman, Clinical Director, Inala Indigenous Health Service, Australia, 
</p>
<p>described his efforts to extend health care to aboriginal communities, in which life 
</p>
<p>expectancy was 17 years less than for other Australians. He emphasized the importance of 
</p>
<p>quality research and good data to ascertain the origins of health outcome disparities. 
</p>
<p>Research revealed that few indigenous peoples had access to and used primary health-care 
</p>
<p>systems. Results of a focus group demonstrated that many aboriginal Australians were not 
</p>
<p>accessing available health services because of cultural differences making them feel 
</p>
<p>unwelcome. By actions to bridge those cultural differences, including employment of 
</p>
<p>aboriginals in health systems, cultural awareness strategies and educational outreach, the 
</p>
<p>health service had greatly expanded its reach. The key was to understand and acknowledge 
</p>
<p>the culture and community. To further close the health coverage gap for indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples, the private sector, national and local governments, medical practitioners and 
</p>
<p>communities must continue to collaborate to address their specific medical needs 
</p>
<p>effectively. By so doing, the health service had improved access to affordable medicines.  
</p>
<p>39. Dr. Sengupta stated that people working together had the power to change health 
</p>
<p>systems by demanding fulfilment of their rights. In India, there was a history of common 
</p>
<p>people uniting to bring about transformative change. Access to medicines had always been 
</p>
<p>an issue for popular mobilization by the masses. Civil society organizations in India 
</p>
<p>campaigned against large pharmaceutical companies and put pressure on the Government to 
</p>
<p>introduce measures that would allow generic pharmaceutical and local production to thrive. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, drug prices in India were 10 per cent or less than global prices, and Indian 
</p>
<p>generics helped reduce the cost of antiretrovirals by more than 40 times. However, the 
</p>
<p>implementation of TRIPS in India posed a threat both for India and importing States. He 
</p>
<p>called for global solidarity and collective action to address that threat, preserve the generic 
</p>
<p>industry of India, resist pressure to adopt TRIPS-plus agreements and improve access to 
</p>
<p>medicines  for all.  
</p>
<p>40. During the interactive dialogue, there were interventions from Dr. Mohamed and 
</p>
<p>Dr.  Schiavon, representatives of Panama, the United States of America, WHO, the 
</p>
<p>International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care, Maloca Internationale, Third 
</p>
<p>World Network and the Union for International Cancer Control. Issues included the 
</p>
<p>following: access to opioids and palliative care; patenting and criminalization of traditional 
</p>
<p>medicines; cancer treatment; use and standardization of essential medicine lists; acquisition, 
</p>
<p>receipt, distribution and storage of medicines; impact of changing political regimes on </p>


<p>health systems; procurement of medicines and treatment of patients in resource-constrained 
</p>
<p>settings; balancing between ensuring drug quality and safety and preventing overregulation 
</p>
<p>and regulatory capture.  
</p>
<p>41. In his concluding remarks, Dr. Sengupta stated that, although safety was a valid and 
</p>
<p>important concern, the current debate around it had political elements that could not be 
</p>
<p>ignored. Decisions and policies affecting health care must not lose sight of the ultimate 
</p>
<p>objective of fulfilling the people&#8217;s right to health. Dr. Hayman agreed that safety, 
</p>
<p>particularly for use of opiates, was an important concern. He emphasized the 
</p>
<p>responsibilities of all governments in guaranteeing access to medicines. Mr. Borisov 
</p>
<p>described how the transition from the Soviet public health system to the current 
</p>
<p>public/private health system had had a negative impact on access to health care in the 
</p>
<p>Russian Federation. Currently, thousands lacked adequate cancer care because of coverage 
</p>
<p>gaps and insufficient financing for legislative mandates, exacerbated by lack of 
</p>
<p>transparency in decision-making. Ms. Kamoga stated that substandard drugs posed a real 
</p>
<p>challenge, particularly in Uganda which lacked appropriate regulatory and enforcement 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. She advocated a rights-based approach to access to medicines that empowered 
</p>
<p>communities and individuals and employed effective, evidence-based policies. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Breakout discussion groups and plenary discussion 
</b></p>
<p>42. All participants were invited to join one of three breakout discussion groups. Each 
</p>
<p>focused on a key issue relating to access to medicines in the context of the right to health. 
</p>
<p>Group one, facilitated by Dr. Vel&#225;squez, addressed intellectual property regimes and access 
</p>
<p>to medicines. Group two, facilitated by Nhan T. Tran, Manager, Implementation Research 
</p>
<p>Platform, Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, WHO, focused on health 
</p>
<p>systems strengthening, capacity-building, community engagement and empowerment. 
</p>
<p>Group three, facilitated by Dr. Sengupta, discussed financing access to medicines and 
</p>
<p>universal health coverage. In those groups, participants focused on identifying concrete 
</p>
<p>solutions and good practices for overcoming barriers to access to medicines.  
</p>
<p>43. During the plenary discussion which followed, the main findings of the groups were 
</p>
<p>presented by a rapporteur nominated by each group. All participants were given an 
</p>
<p>opportunity to respond and present proposals for the conclusions and recommendations of 
</p>
<p>the Social Forum. Those who took the floor were representatives of Ecuador, Panama, Ariel 
</p>
<p>Foundation International, Knowledge Ecology International, Third World Network and 
</p>
<p>Universities Allied for Essential Medicines, as well as Ms. Forman, Dr. Meguid, 
</p>
<p>Dr. Sengupta and Damiano de Felice, Strategic Adviser to the Chief Executive Officer, 
</p>
<p>Access to Medicine Foundation. A synthesis of the proposals emerging from the breakout 
</p>
<p>and plenary discussions is reflected in the conclusions and recommendations of the present 
</p>
<p>report. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Innovative approaches to promoting access to medicines 
</b></p>
<p>44. Geoff Adlide, Director of Advocacy and Public Policy at Gavi, the Vaccine 
</p>
<p>Alliance, explained the innovative efforts of Gavi to shape vaccine markets with a view to 
</p>
<p>promoting access. Gavi was a public-private partnership focused on saving children&#8217;s lives 
</p>
<p>and promoting human health through improved access to immunization in poor countries. It 
</p>
<p>sought to address inequities in access to vaccines through innovative approaches to access, 
</p>
<p>governance, monitoring and vaccine markets. It supported vaccine purchases by low-
</p>
<p>income countries through pooling domestic and regional purchasing power and donor 
</p>
<p>contributions to minimize costs. Gavi also promoted competition and sought to balance 
</p>
<p>supply and demand to ensure continuous supplies of the vaccines required. It tried to </p>


<p>improve vaccination delivery including with regard to thermostability, presentation and 
</p>
<p>packaging, combinations, safety and efficiency. Timely, transparent and accurate market 
</p>
<p>information for manufacturers and States was essential to its work to promote sustainable 
</p>
<p>access to vaccines for all.  
</p>
<p>45. Nana Boohene, Procurement and Supply Specialist, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
</p>
<p>Tuberculosis and Malaria, and Hye-Young Lim, Human Rights Adviser at the Global Fund, 
</p>
<p>presented the Fund&#8217;s work to promote access to medicines. A rapidly evolving global 
</p>
<p>health landscape required innovative approaches to increasing access to essential health 
</p>
<p>commodities. The Global Fund operated in 140 countries and adaptability was integral to 
</p>
<p>maximizing its impact. When States reached middle-income status, they lost access to 
</p>
<p>certain benefits in international assistance and delayed implementation of TRIPs which had 
</p>
<p>an impact on their ability to procure medicines. The Fund sought to improve access by 
</p>
<p>underserved populations worldwide by reducing market fragmentation to capitalize on 
</p>
<p>collective negotiating power including through the use of electronic marketplaces and 
</p>
<p>exchanges. Its strategies directly integrated human rights considerations, focused on 
</p>
<p>procurement for impact, leveraged new technologies for innovation and supply chain 
</p>
<p>management, and promoted market access and continuity of supply. The Fund sought to 
</p>
<p>increase investment in programmes that addressed human rights barriers to accessing health 
</p>
<p>services and withdraw support from programmes that infringed upon human rights. 
</p>
<p>46. Rohit Malpani, Access to Medicines Campaign Director of Policy and Analysis, 
</p>
<p>M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res<i>,</i> described the Access Campaign, which responded to doctors&#8217; 
</p>
<p>frustration regarding the availability, affordability and suitability of medicines. It sought to 
</p>
<p>address basic market failures of the patent system, under which research and development 
</p>
<p>costs were to be recouped through monopolies leading to high-priced products. There was 
</p>
<p>no incentive for research and development for the poor nor for expanding their access. The 
</p>
<p>Campaign called for delinking product prices from research and development costs. Its 3P 
</p>
<p>project, &#8220;push, pull, pool&#8221;, aimed to combine push funding, pull funding and the pooling of 
</p>
<p>intellectual property rights to promote innovative research and development for new, 
</p>
<p>effective tuberculosis drug regimens and affordable access to quality medicines for all. In 
</p>
<p>multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, the 3P project incentivized collaborative, early-stage 
</p>
<p>research through patent pooling and pull and push funding. By securing public funding for 
</p>
<p>prizes and clinical trials, ensuring an open and collaborative model, it promoted the 
</p>
<p>collaborative development of drug regimens through patent pooling. The Campaign was 
</p>
<p>seeking to promote a model of research and development that delinked its cost from the 
</p>
<p>final product price and ensured that research and development for tuberculosis was carried 
</p>
<p>out in a manner that delivered effective, short-course, affordable tuberculosis regimens 
</p>
<p>for all. 
</p>
<p>47. Lena K&#228;hler, Researcher, Human Rights and Development, Danish Institute for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, a national human rights institution mandated to promote and protect human 
</p>
<p>rights in Denmark and abroad, introduced the Institute&#8217;s efforts to develop indicators for 
</p>
<p>accessibility, availability, acceptability and quality in the context of the right to health. The 
</p>
<p>lack of consensus on the interpretation of economic, social and cultural rights constituted an 
</p>
<p>obstacle to its work. By developing a generally applicable toolbox on right to health 
</p>
<p>indicators, it hoped to promote realization of the right to health locally and globally. The 
</p>
<p>Institute had identified as core obligations the availability of essential medicines, 
</p>
<p>prevention, treatment and control of epidemic and endemic diseases, immunization against 
</p>
<p>major infectious diseases, and reproductive, maternal and child health care. 
</p>
<p>48. During the discussion, there were interventions from representatives of Brazil, Chile, 
</p>
<p>the China Medical Association, the Colombian Commission of Jurists, Third World 
</p>
<p>Network, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines, as well as from Dr. Sengupta, 
</p>
<p>Dr. Mohamed and Dr. Meguid. Some speakers described efforts to impede production of </p>


<p>low-cost generic pharmaceuticals as crimes against humanity. Others called on the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council and special procedures mandate holders to focus on access to medicines. 
</p>
<p>They supported a holistic, people-centred and community-driven approach to health. That 
</p>
<p>would include innovative efforts to address neglected diseases, like multiple drug-resistant 
</p>
<p>tuberculosis, that disproportionately impacted on the poorest and most vulnerable, and to 
</p>
<p>promote improved governance mechanisms, particularly for regulatory oversight and 
</p>
<p>accountability of multinational corporations. The question was raised as to whether or not 
</p>
<p>efforts to promote access had gone far enough to seek alternatives to market-based 
</p>
<p>approaches. 
</p>
<p>49. In their concluding remarks, the panellists supported further integration of human 
</p>
<p>rights considerations in access to medicines. Ms. Lim stressed the need to integrate human 
</p>
<p>rights principles throughout procurement processes. She noted that the concept of middle-
</p>
<p>income countries was an artificial one and that access to medicines should not be dictated 
</p>
<p>by the economic status of a country but by the needs of people, and that the Global Fund to 
</p>
<p>Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was supporting the strengthening of health systems 
</p>
<p>in a number of countries. Citing the work of the Committee on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights, Ms. K&#228;hler asserted that the right to health required access to all medicines 
</p>
<p>not only essential medicines. Mr. Adlide clarified that Gavi only supplied vaccinations 
</p>
<p>through governments; responded to requests from governments; worked to reduce prices 
</p>
<p>and emphasized transparency in its operations. Mr. Malpani decried continued mispricing 
</p>
<p>of vaccines, called for rendering access to medicines sustainable and reiterated that middle-
</p>
<p>income countries faced substantial challenges in improving access.  
</p>
<p><b> J. Good practices in promoting access to medicines (round table) 
</b></p>
<p>50. Mr. de Felice described the Access to Medicine Index, a ranking of the world&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>20 largest research-based pharmaceutical companies on the basis of what they did to 
</p>
<p>facilitate access to medicine in developing countries. He noted that there was hope, that 
</p>
<p>there were good practices, and that the Index, by drawing attention to corporate behaviour, 
</p>
<p>could influence businesses to exercise greater responsibility. The Index compared 
</p>
<p>corporations on the basis of their performance over time with regard to multiple factors, 
</p>
<p>including but not confined to governance, pricing, patents, local stakeholder engagement, 
</p>
<p>capacity-building and donations. Although progress was uneven, the Index indicated that 
</p>
<p>the pharmaceutical industry had stepped up its efforts to improve access to medicine in 
</p>
<p>developing countries. A competitive environment that not only held pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>companies accountable when required, but also recognized their efforts and 
</p>
<p>accomplishments, would help advance access to medicines. 
</p>
<p>51. Sathyanarayanan Doraiswamy, Senior Reproductive Health/HIV Coordinator, 
</p>
<p>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), described 
</p>
<p>UNHCR work to ensure access for refugees and other persons of concern. When people 
</p>
<p>were forcibly displaced across national borders, they became refugees, often with limited 
</p>
<p>access to health care in countries of asylum. UNHCR efforts to promote health care for 
</p>
<p>refugees were guided by its global strategy for public health and its guidelines on essential 
</p>
<p>medicines and medical supplies. Those addressed the needs of persons in differing phases 
</p>
<p>and contexts including acute emergencies, protracted displacement and in their pursuit for 
</p>
<p>durable solutions. The two main models for providing health care were direct integration in 
</p>
<p>national systems of host States and integration to the maximum extent possible combined 
</p>
<p>with support from UNHCR and non-governmental organizations. UNHCR pursued various 
</p>
<p>methods to promote access, including: provision of emergency health kits, collaboration 
</p>
<p>with national AIDS programmes to support antiretroviral treatment, research programmes </p>


<p>and partnerships with the private sector. While those provided short-term solutions, the 
</p>
<p>only long-term sustainable solution was total integration into national health systems.  
</p>
<p>52. Soraya Ramoul, Director, Access to Health, Novo Nordisk, described the company&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>efforts to promote access to medicines for the treatment of diabetes. Many people with 
</p>
<p>diabetes resided in low and middle-income countries. Novo Nordisk provided half of the 
</p>
<p>insulin worldwide. It employed differential pricing policies so that patients in developing 
</p>
<p>countries paid one quarter of the price paid in developed countries. However, access was 
</p>
<p>not simply a matter of affordability. It also required strong health delivery systems 
</p>
<p>including sufficient and adequately trained medical personnel. Local prices might differ 
</p>
<p>from initial purchasing prices because of supply chain problems, price mark-ups, import 
</p>
<p>duties and taxes. Further efforts were needed to ensure that prices offered to patients were 
</p>
<p>affordable and also sustainable from a business perspective. Better implementation of the 
</p>
<p>right to health in the private sector context required translation of technical human rights 
</p>
<p>language into business language.  
</p>
<p>53. James Love, Director, Knowledge Ecology International, recommended drastic 
</p>
<p>changes to existing models of research and development and intellectual property rights. 
</p>
<p>The prevailing system had failed to promote access and was fundamentally unfair. It 
</p>
<p>created patent monopolies, vesting power and profits in private hands. Corporate lobbying 
</p>
<p>to protect those interests contributed to regulatory arbitrage and perpetuation of the status 
</p>
<p>quo. That system valued profits over human well-being and failed to achieve its stated 
</p>
<p>objective of promoting innovation, particularly in research and development for treatment 
</p>
<p>of diseases that disproportionately impacted the poor and the vulnerable. He argued for 
</p>
<p>changes to the intellectual property regime, improved incentives for underfunded areas of 
</p>
<p>research and development, mobilization of innovative sources of finance, increased scrutiny 
</p>
<p>by the Human Rights Council, particularly in applying the right to development in relation 
</p>
<p>to intellectual property rights, and innovative approaches to research and development. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Love advocated deep, radical and transformative reforms that would delink research 
</p>
<p>and development costs from product prices along with the elimination of product 
</p>
<p>monopolies, in favour of other financing mechanisms, including combination of research 
</p>
<p>grants, contracts and other subsidies and delinked financial incentives, including robust 
</p>
<p>funding of large innovation inducement prizes for HIV/AIDS and cancer as well. 
</p>
<p>54. Esteban Burrone, Head of Policy, Medicines Patent Pool, described the evolution 
</p>
<p>and work of that initiative. WHO first proposed the idea of a patent pool in 2008 as part of 
</p>
<p>its global strategy on public health and innovation. After a feasibility study by the 
</p>
<p>International Drug Purchase Facility (UNITAID) (&#8220;Innovative financing to shape markets 
</p>
<p>for HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis&#8221;), which was welcomed by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council at its fifteenth session, the Medicines Patent Pool was set up to promote access to 
</p>
<p>medicines for HIV treatment through resource pooling and voluntary licensing. Since 2010, 
</p>
<p>that entity had negotiated licences for 11 antiretrovirals with five patent-holders. It worked 
</p>
<p>with 10 generic manufacturers through 53 sublicensing agreements to improve access to 
</p>
<p>antiretrovirals in low and middle-income countries where up to 94 per cent of people living 
</p>
<p>with HIV resided. Patent pool licences had been recognized for their public health 
</p>
<p>orientation, transparency and flexibility. Within four and a half years, the Pool had 
</p>
<p>contributed to opening up the market for first and second line antiretrovirals. It was 
</p>
<p>exploring expansion to cover tuberculosis and hepatitis C.  
</p>
<p>55. Smiljka de Lussigny, HIV Programme Manager, UNITAID, discussed that 
</p>
<p>initiative&#8217;s focus on innovative access to medicines. UNITAID used innovative financing, a 
</p>
<p>major portion of which came from a levy on air tickets, for greater access to treatments and 
</p>
<p>diagnostics for HIV, malaria and tuberculosis in low-income countries. It focused on 
</p>
<p>maximizing available resources for the promotion of access by mobilizing resources and 
</p>
<p>promoting their effective use. Affordability posed a substantial barrier to access, </p>


<p>particularly when States lacked appropriate national policies, access to affordable and 
</p>
<p>quality generic medicines and/or financial resources. New, effective treatment for 
</p>
<p>hepatitis C was largely inaccessible to many patients owing to prohibitive costs. UNITAID 
</p>
<p>intervened by providing funding to organizations working to demonstrate the impact, cost-
</p>
<p>effectiveness and utility of new treatment and diagnostic tools and to develop the evidence 
</p>
<p>needed to inform health policy and normative guidance. It also helped to improve the 
</p>
<p>affordability of new commodities, often by leveraging its purchasing power to negotiate 
</p>
<p>with manufacturers for the supply of quality-assured health products at lower prices or by 
</p>
<p>enabling generic, low-cost production of medicines.  
</p>
<p>56. Hans Rietveld, Director, Market Access and Capacity-Building, Malaria Initiative, 
</p>
<p>Novartis Pharma AG, introduced the Novartis Malaria Initiative. The latter had been 
</p>
<p>involved in providing low-cost, life-saving treatment for malaria patients, a disease which 
</p>
<p>had been taking the life of one child every 60 seconds for the past 15 years. It pursued 
</p>
<p>multiple strategies to combat malaria including research and development of new treatment 
</p>
<p>options, capacity-building, improving access and provision of treatment. Since 2001, the 
</p>
<p>Initiative had delivered more than 700 million treatments without profit to 65 malaria 
</p>
<p>endemic countries. It had developed paediatric tablets that were dissolvable in liquid for 
</p>
<p>babies and children and an improved formulation for adults. The Power of One campaign 
</p>
<p>treated one child for every dollar raised. Its partnership with the fund-raising organization 
</p>
<p>Malaria No More had rallied public support and funds for 3 million malaria treatments in 
</p>
<p>Zambia. The Initiative sought simple and innovative solutions to complex problems. For 
</p>
<p>example, it had utilized mobile phones to monitor drug supplies in Africa and head off 
</p>
<p>stock-outs, and published and distributed education materials on malaria prevention and 
</p>
<p>treatment. However, much remained to be done including on development of new treatment 
</p>
<p>for drug-resistant malaria and on strengthening health systems. 
</p>
<p>57. During the interactive dialogue, the following took the floor: representatives of 
</p>
<p>Brazil, Indonesia, the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care, New 
</p>
<p>Generation Ishaka, Safe Observer International, Rencontre Africaine pour la d&#233;fense des 
</p>
<p>droits de l&#8217;homme, Third World Network, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines; 
</p>
<p>Drs. Sengupta, Bermudez, Schiavon and Zhang; Ms. Forman. Many speakers called for a 
</p>
<p>rights-based health paradigm to replace market-oriented solutions, and related actions from 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council. They recommended increasing attention to the medical needs of 
</p>
<p>children, corporate responsibility, equitable access to medicines, and reduction of 
</p>
<p>regulatory barriers to access, including TRIPs and TRIPs-plus provisions, research and 
</p>
<p>development of treatments for neglected tropical diseases, access to pain medication, and 
</p>
<p>the use of tariffs to safeguard local manufacturing capacity. Several speakers called on 
</p>
<p>States to promote access without discrimination, to put people first, and to refrain from 
</p>
<p>exerting political pressure to increase patent protections at the expense of access to 
</p>
<p>medicines. They called on the Secretariat to issue strong recommendations on intellectual 
</p>
<p>property rights, regulatory measures, and equal access to health care and sexual and 
</p>
<p>reproductive health. Reiterating that access to medicines was a matter of life and death, 
</p>
<p>they demanded that States and the private sector take immediate action to remove barriers 
</p>
<p>to access to medicines. 
</p>
<p>58. In response, Mr. Rietveld clarified that he spoke for the Novartis Malaria Initiative, 
</p>
<p>and not Novartis as a whole. The Initiative worked because the non-profit business model 
</p>
<p>and the scale of the problem had allowed Novartis and partners to combine their approaches 
</p>
<p>into a sustainable effort to promote access to life-saving medicines. Ms. Ramoul urged 
</p>
<p>governments, health-care professionals, activists and industry to avoid finger-pointing and 
</p>
<p>instead collaborate to promote access to medicines. Mr. de Felice explained the 
</p>
<p>methodology of the Access to Medicine Index and suggested additional research into 
</p>
<p>neglected tropical diseases. He supported initiatives to promote sharing and enhanced 
</p>
<p>access to intellectual property like the Medicines Patent Pool. Citing positive impacts of the </p>


<p>Patent Pool, Mr. Burrone appealed for greater risk-taking and policy experimentation. He 
</p>
<p>highlighted the need to maintain drug quality while regulatory barriers were rationalized to 
</p>
<p>promote access. Mr. Love lamented a system which excluded the majority, and the lack of 
</p>
<p>access to cancer medication. He proposed fundamental changes to promote innovation in 
</p>
<p>the least harmful manner, and to delink drug prices from research and development costs. 
</p>
<p>Ms. de Lussigny referred to the obligation to promote access and use limited resources to 
</p>
<p>benefit as many people as possible. She recommended addressing the issue of regulatory 
</p>
<p>barriers to the importation of life-saving medicines and emphasized the important role of 
</p>
<p>generic competition in reducing prices. Dr. Doraiswamy supported a greater focus on 
</p>
<p>neglected populations and their rights. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>59.</b> <b>In closing the Social Forum, the Chairperson assured all the participants of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>continued commitment of Qatar to global health. He informed them of the World 
</b></p>
<p><b>Innovation Summit for Health which had held its annual session in Qatar in February 
</b></p>
<p><b>2015. The Summit had brought together health leaders from over 80 countries to 
</b></p>
<p><b>share the latest research, ideas and health innovations that had the potential to 
</b></p>
<p><b>revolutionize the future of global health care.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p><b>60.</b> <b>Several common themes emerged from the 2015 Social Forum. Not only is 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to medicines a matter of life and death; it also enhances the quality of life; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>it is key to a life with dignity. Yet, 2 billion men, women and children have no access 
</b></p>
<p><b>to essential medicines. Intellectual property laws, lack of finances, weak health 
</b></p>
<p><b>systems, poverty, inequality and discrimination, among other factors, contribute to 
</b></p>
<p><b>lack of access to medicines.  
</b></p>
<p><b>61.</b> <b>Access to medicines involves public health, social justice and international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights obligations. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cultural Rights</b> <b>requires States to take steps, to the maximum of their available 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources, to progressively realize the right to health, prohibit retrogressive measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>and requires them to immediately fulfil their minimum core obligations. It also calls 
</b></p>
<p><b>for international cooperation. Access to medicines is a core obligation. Medicines must 
</b></p>
<p><b>be affordable, acceptable, accessible, of good quality, and made available without 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination.  
</b></p>
<p><b>62. Access to medicines is a complex and multidimensional issue calling for holistic 
</b></p>
<p><b>solutions. Measures must be put in place to improve supply chains, address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>underlying social determinants of health, promote policy coherence premised on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>primacy of human rights over international trade, investment and intellectual 
</b></p>
<p><b>property regimes and to ensure that health delivery systems are appropriate to those 
</b></p>
<p><b>they serve. Inequities must be eliminated, including high costs borne by patients in 
</b></p>
<p><b>many low and middle-income countries.  
</b></p>
<p><b>63</b>. <b>People</b>&#8217;<b>s agency and empowerment should be improved to enhance access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>medicines especially for the poor. Procedural safeguards like participation and access 
</b></p>
<p><b>to information must be upheld. Evidence-based guidelines and policies to promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to appropriate health-care services for women would help realize their right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>health, and an increase in paediatric formulations would strengthen access for 
</b></p>
<p><b>children. Addressing stigma and discrimination and ensuring equitable access and 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective treatment would help realize the rights of people living with HIV.  </b></p>


<p><b>64.</b> <b>Resource constraints cannot be an excuse for failing to meet health needs. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Reasons for disparities in health outcomes across States of similar socioeconomic 
</b></p>
<p><b>status must be understood and addressed. Experience shows that publicly funded 
</b></p>
<p><b>health systems are the best way to ensure equitable access to health care. Access can 
</b></p>
<p><b>be improved through innovative financing mechanisms; enabling public policies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>more health workers; technical support; better health data, administrators, transport 
</b></p>
<p><b>and delivery; improved supply chains, local production and health education; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other means. Holistic, people-centred and community-driven policies and active local 
</b></p>
<p><b>involvement help strengthen health systems.  
</b></p>
<p><b>65.</b> <b>Access to medicines is one of the most explicit examples of how economics and 
</b></p>
<p><b>trade rules conflict with human rights, including the rights to life, health and 
</b></p>
<p><b>development. All are entitled to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and 
</b></p>
<p><b>traditional knowledge must be protected. Pharmaceutical companies must comply 
</b></p>
<p><b>with their human rights responsibilities and ethical obligations. Several initiatives and 
</b></p>
<p><b>good practices, including by those companies, point to steps in that direction. New 
</b></p>
<p><b>models of research and development must address needs, not simply manage markets 
</b></p>
<p><b>and profits.  
</b></p>
<p><b>66.</b>  <b>Effective health policies, including the development of essential medicines lists, 
</b></p>
<p><b>could improve access. States must live up to their individual and collective 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitments and adopt a human rights-based approach to access to all medicines, 
</b></p>
<p><b>not only essential medicines. International solidarity and collective action could 
</b></p>
<p><b>support access for all.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>67.</b> <b>Participants recommended urgent and immediate action, at the local, national, 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional and international levels. Health systems needed to be strengthened, universal 
</b></p>
<p><b>health coverage established and access to medicines ensured. That included building 
</b></p>
<p><b>production capacity in developing countries, allowing access to generic drugs, 
</b></p>
<p><b>enhancing research and development into treatment for neglected diseases and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementing effective procurement, distribution, price and quality control systems. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent steps to improve access to maternal and child health would help prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>maternal and infant mortality. The international community must aim for universal 
</b></p>
<p><b>access in the post-2015 development agenda, which should also include mental health.  
</b></p>
<p><b>68.</b> <b>All stakeholders should explore ways of mobilizing new and innovative means 
</b></p>
<p><b>of financing development and increasing resources available for health. Possibilities 
</b></p>
<p><b>included imposition of a financial transaction tax, debt cancellation, resource pooling 
</b></p>
<p><b>and tax reforms. International financial institutions must allow States sufficient policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>space to pursue health objectives and States should make efforts to utilize existing 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources more effectively including by leveraging their political and purchasing 
</b></p>
<p><b>power to negotiate reduced prices and voluntary licensing.  
</b></p>
<p><b>69.</b> <b>TRIPS flexibilities and compulsory licensing should be used to their fullest and 
</b></p>
<p><b>resort to political pressure to undermine those tools or impose TRIPS-plus provisions 
</b></p>
<p><b>in trade agreements must be regarded as a violation of human rights obligations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>calling for accountability in the universal periodic review. The legally binding 
</b></p>
<p><b>petitions procedure under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on Economic, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Social and Cultural Rights provided a means for interpretation and enforcement of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the right to health. 
</b></p>
<p><b>70.</b> <b>Intellectual property laws required transformative changes to ensure that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>benefits of scientific progress were enjoyed by all. Recommendations included </b></p>


<p><b>alternatives to market-based approaches and reforms to delink research and 
</b></p>
<p><b>development costs from product prices. The recommendations of the report of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Global Commission on HIV and the Law, particularly the call for the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>to establish a commission to examine and propose alternatives to TRIPS, needed 
</b></p>
<p><b>follow-up action. In the meantime, implementing TRIPS must be suspended, where it 
</b></p>
<p><b>impeded access to medicines for the poor.  
</b></p>
<p><b>71.</b> <b>Participants called for a new and legally binding treaty on research and 
</b></p>
<p><b>development of medicines that would promote innovation and equitable access. 
</b></p>
<p>University research should be perceived as public research for everyone&#8217;s <b>benefit and 
</b></p>
<p><b>not patented without proper safeguards to ensure access to resulting medicines. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights should consider adopting a 
</b></p>
<p><b>general comment on the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress.  
</b></p>
<p><b>72.</b> <b>All stakeholders should collaborate to enhance health systems. Participants 
</b></p>
<p><b>proposed a holistic approach to health systems that enhanced equitable access, 
</b></p>
<p><b>improved training of health and administrative personnel, employed culturally 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate delivery systems, involved engagement with local communities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided health and education outreach.  
</b></p>
<p><b>73.</b> <b>Participants recommended improved governance mechanisms, particularly for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the regulatory oversight and accountability of multinational corporations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Pharmaceutical companies had responsibilities as articulated in the 2008 report of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur on the right</b> <b>of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
</b></p>
<p><b>standard of health (A/63/263) containing the Human Rights Guidelines for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Pharmaceutical Companies in relation to Access to Medicines. States, pharmaceutical 
</b></p>
<p><b>companies, the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational 
</b></p>
<p><b>corporations and other business enterprises, and the Human Rights Council should 
</b></p>
<p><b>act to ensure their implementation.  
</b></p>
<p><b>74.</b> <b>The Human Rights Council and the international human rights machinery 
</b></p>
<p><b>must remain seized of the issue. Participants recommended integration of a universal 
</b></p>
<p><b>periodic review of the right to health and access to medicines that is evidence-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>and promotes transparency and accountability. They called on the Council to 
</b></p>
<p><b>commission a compilation of good practices in promoting access to medicines. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations of the Social Forum must be taken up by the Council and 
</b></p>
<p><b>acted upon.</b> </p>
