IN THE HIGH COURT OF FIJI
AT SUVA
MISCELLANEOUS JURISDICTION

MISCELLANEOUS ACTION NO: HAM0041 OF 2003S

STATE

-v-

JOSEVA BALELOA

Hearing: 2nd December 2003
Ruling: 2nd December 2003

Mr. D. Toganivalu for State
Accused  In Person

RULING

The accused makes another application for bail. Bail on the 4th of November 2003 was refused because of public interest factors. Furthermore the Accused has, according to the record been convicted for a number of offences and a custodial sentence is likely. Because he has been convicted the presumptions in favour of bail is rebutted.

In addition to this, some offences are dated to times when bail had been granted by the Suva Magistrates Court. Although the hearing of this case is delayed because the Director for Legal Aid is out of the country, I am adjourning only until 4th December and a long delay is not anticipated. Bail is refused for these reasons.
