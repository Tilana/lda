Newmont Announces Preliminary Third Quarter 
Attributable Gold and Copper Production and Sales
This release reflects Newmont’s preliminary third quarter operating results, which remain subject to 
change when the Company files its third quarter Form 10-Q on Thursday, October 31, 20131.
DENVER, October 10, 2013 – Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) (“Newmont” or the 
“Company”) today reported preliminary third quarter attributable gold and copper production of 1.283 
million ounces and 34 million pounds, respectively.  Preliminary attributable gold and copper sales were 
1.263 million ounces and 35 million pounds, respectively.  Third quarter production was positively 
impacted by increased mill throughput in Nevada and higher grades and increased mining productivity as 
a result of efficiency improvements at Tanami in Australia.
The Company continues to expect full year 2013 attributable gold production of 4.8 – 5.1 million ounces 
and has revised its attributable copper production outlook to 135 – 145 million pounds from 150 – 170 
million pounds.  Gold production is expected to benefit from increased mill throughput in Nevada and the 
commencement of commercial production from Akyem in the fourth quarter.  Attributable copper 
production for the year has been revised due to lower than expected mill throughput at Boddington and 
lower than expected ore grade processed at Batu Hijau.

reflect our expected third quarter results as of the date of this news release.  Actual reported results are subject to 
management's final review as well as audit by the Company's independent registered accounting firm and may vary 
significantly from those expectations because of a number of factors, including, without limitation, additional or revised 
information and changes in accounting standards or policies or in how those standards are applied.  For a discussion 
of factors that may adversely affect our financial results and condition, see the Company’s 2012 Annual Report on

covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws.  Such forward-looking statements 
may include, without limitation estimates of full year 2013 attributable gold and copper production and sales.  
Estimates or expectations of future events or results are based upon certain assumptions, which may prove to be

incorrect.  Such assumptions, include, but are not limited to: (i) there being no significant change to current

or implies an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith 
and believed to have a reasonable basis.  However, such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other 
factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed, projected or implied by the 
“forward-looking statements”.  Such risks include, but are not limited to, gold and other metals price volatility, currency 
fluctuations, increased production costs and variances in ore grade or recovery rates from those assumed in mining 
plans, political and operational risks, community relations, conflict resolution and outcome of oppositions and 
governmental regulation and judicial outcomes.  For a more detailed discussion of such risks and other factors, see 
the Company’s 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on February 22, 2013, with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, as well as the Company’s other SEC filings.  The Company does not undertake any obligation to 
release publicly revisions to any “forward-looking statement,” including, without limitation, outlook, to reflect events or 
circumstances after the date of this news release, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as may 
be required under applicable securities laws.  Investors should not assume that any lack of update to a previously 
issued “forward-looking statement” constitutes a reaffirmation of that statement. Continued reliance on “forward-
looking statements” is at investors' own risk.
