<p>matter of priority and necessity, complementary standards in the form of either a convention or 
</p>
<p>additional protocol(s) to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination, filling the existing gaps in the Convention and also providing new normative 
</p>
<p>standards aimed at combating all forms of contemporary racism, including incitement to racial 
</p>
<p>and religious hatred, </p>

<p>human rights system and the need to enhance the momentum of this process with a view to 
</p>
<p>ensuring the timely fulfilment of the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee,

<p><i> Recalling</i> the need to provide adequate protection for victims of racism, racial

<p> 2. <i>Requests</i> the Chairperson-Rapporteur to ensure that the outcome referred to in the 
</p>
<p>road map is circulated in a timely manner to all stakeholders, in order that complementary
