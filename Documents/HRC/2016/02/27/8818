<p><b>  Purpose and description of the mission to Colombia 
</b></p>
<p>1. During the course of my official visit to Colombia, between 1 and 12 February, I 
have had an opportunity to meet with both President &#193;lvaro Uribe V&#233;lez and numerous 
senior government officials and to consult directly with representatives and members of 
Afro-Colombian communities. My visit allowed me a unique opportunity for dialogue in 
relation to my mandate on minority issues and to promote implementation of the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious 
and Linguistic minorities. I wish to express my thanks to the Government of Colombia for 
its cooperation in the preparation and conduct of my visit.  
</p>
<p>2. The focus of my visit to Colombia has been communities who identify as Afro-
Colombian, Black, Raizal and Palenquero. In view of this I have visited numerous cities 
and regions of Colombia, including Bogot&#225;, Cartagena, San Basilio de Palenque, Turbaco 
(Bol&#237;var), Urab&#225; region (Choc&#243;/Antioquia), Apartado, Quibdo, Cali, Buenaventura (Valle 
del Cauca) and the municipality of Su&#225;rez (Cauca) and the surrounding areas where these 
communities are prominent.  
</p>
<p>3. The views expressed in this statement are of a preliminary nature and are not 
comprehensive. My findings and recommendations will be fully developed when I report 
on my visit to the United Nations Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Overview 
</b></p>
<p>4. The story of Afro-Colombians begins with slavery and the massive and gross 
violations of the rights of African descendants that terrible chapter in history entailed, not 
only in Colombia but in the entire region. In Colombia, the most prominent slave-labour 
operations were established in coastal areas.  As slaves escaped, they were forced to find 
refuge in nearly uninhabitable, geographically remote regions of the Atlantic and Pacific 
Coast. There they strived and remarkably succeeded, to build communities and livelihoods 
under conditions of extreme isolation, harsh climate, and often extreme poverty.  Except for 
nearby communities of Indigenous peoples, these settlements have been all Black for 
centuries.  Colombia has recognized the ownership rights of Afro-Colombians to these 
territories. 
</p>
<p>5. As in many other countries, the legacy of slavery endures and is manifested in 
communities that are socially and economically marginalized, facing racist attitudes and 
structural discrimination.  It must be acknowledged that the Colombian government has 
made efforts through provisions of its Constitution, legislation and policies to address 
certain aspects of the disparities faced by Afro-Colombians. Nevertheless, the legacy of 
slavery continues to have a profound impact on the lives of Afro-Colombians, Blacks, 
Raizal and Palenquero communities.   
</p>
<p>6. In addition, new and emerging challenges face Afro-Colombian communities. They 
include violence and oppression at the hands of a variety of armed actors, the ongoing 
struggle for their lands and territories, displacement, the impact of agro-business, logging 
and mining interests and &#8220;megaprojects&#8221; aimed at economic development and exploitation 
of natural resources. Some communities face a daily struggle for survival, displaced from 
their lands and forced into conditions of extreme vulnerability and insecurity, lacking basic 
needs, including adequate food, water and electricity, health care and education for their 
children. The situation of many Afro-Colombian communities in both rural regions such as 
Choc&#243;, and urban environments to which they have often been displaced in towns such as </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/23/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>Quibdo, Suarez,  Buenaventura, Cartagena and Cali, which I visited, can only be described 
as critical.  
</p>
<p>7. Afro-Colombian settlements, in rural areas and town ghettos, rival only the 
reservations for Indigenous peoples as the very poorest in Colombia, with extreme poverty 
rates of over 60 percent. In Colombia, the extreme poverty map and the map of high density 
Afro-Colombian populations coincide. Surveys suggest that 80 percent of Afro-Colombians 
do not have basic needs met. Infant mortality rates in Choc&#243; and Cauca are 54 per thousand 
of the population. Life expectancy in Afro-Colombian regions is only 55. Illiteracy rates for 
Afro-Colombians are estimated to be twice the national average. The responses of the 
national Government and regional authorities to the poverty and lack of basic needs of 
these communities have been inadequate and must be addressed as a matter of urgency.   
</p>
<p>8. Afro-Colombian communities officially make up approximately 10.62 percent 
(4.311.757) of the population according to the 2005 census. The Ombudsman&#8217;s office 
considers that the figure is close to 25 percent or 10.5 million people. Both government and 
community sources concur that the census failed to capture the full demographic and socio-
economic picture of the Afro-Colombian population. Additionally there is virtually no 
disaggregation of socio-economic data by race, so government policies are based on faulty 
data. I often heard from Afro-Colombians that they feel statistically &#8220;invisible&#8221;, and that 
consequently their issues are ignored, their lives are less valued and that government 
policies dedicated to their needs are not achieving the desired improvements to their 
situations.   
</p>
<p><b> II. The legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. Colombia has an impressive and commendable legislative framework that 
recognises many rights of Afro-Colombians, starting with the Constitution of 1991 which 
recognizes not only the right to non-discrimination but also the right to equality for all 
citizens.  It also pledges to protect the ethnic and cultural diversity of the country and it 
promotes the political participation of minorities by establishing two reserve seats in the 
House of Representatives for Afro-Colombians. 
</p>
<p>10. In the context of Afro-Colombian communities, key among Colombia&#8217;s laws is Law 
70 of 1993 which recognises the right of black Colombians to collectively own and occupy 
their ancestral lands.  Law 70 therefore legally guarantees the right of collective property 
for black communities as well as enshrining protection of their cultural practices and 
traditional uses of natural resources and guaranteeing the economic and social development 
of their communities.  Under Law 70, these lands are to be &#8220;inalienable, imprescriptible and 
non-attachable.&#8221;   Law 70 also reinforces rights to education, health and political 
participation.  
</p>
<p>11. While the constitutional and legislative measures are praiseworthy, the vast majority 
of communities and organizations that I consulted complain that implementation of 
Colombia&#8217;s legislation on Afro-Colombian communities remains woefully inadequate, 
limited and sporadic.  Most importantly, where steps have been taken, no real enforcement 
has followed.  Close to two decades after Law 70 was adopted, despite the granting of 
collective titles to some 90 percent of Afro-Colombian ancestral lands, many communities 
are displaced, dispossessed and unable to live on or work their lands. As one woman told 
me, &#8220;the laws say all the right things but still, nothing has happened.&#8221;    </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/23/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b> III. Displaced and dispossessed 
</b></p>
<p>12. Displacement from their lands was highlighted as the highest priority issue for many 
Afro-Colombians whom I met. Those lands onto which run-away slaves were forced to 
retreat, while isolated and neglected for centuries, have in recent years been identified as 
the most fertile and resource rich of Colombia&#8217;s territory.  This has placed these once 
isolated, largely self-sufficient communities directly in harm&#8217;s way. 
</p>
<p>13. Decades of armed conflict between the Government, paramilitaries and guerrilla 
forces have played out largely in the territories of Afro-Colombians. These are also some of 
the most strategically important regions for guerrillas, former paramilitaries and other 
armed groups currently involved in narcotics production and trafficking. While the 
government has adopted a political position that the armed conflict has ended and 
paramilitary groups have demobilized, in many rural black community that I visited I heard 
emotional and credible stories of murders and threats to the lives of community leaders.  
Whole communities are being forced to flee their lands and leave all of their possessions to 
seek better security in towns, where they are ill-equipped to negotiate an urban 
environment.   
</p>
<p>14. The official number of internally displaced persons stands at 3,073,010 persons or 
695,354 households as of May 2009, constituting the world&#8217;s second largest internal 
displacement situation. Civil society estimates go as high as 4 million Internally Displaced 
People and there is a common agreement that exact figures are difficult to ascertain. While 
few communities have eventually returned to their lands, those who do, find that others 
have claimed ownership or rights of usage in their absence.  
</p>
<p>15. Many of the displacements have occurred as a consequence of military 
confrontations between different armed groups.   The government reports that the violence 
has decreased considerably and communities confirm to me that massacres and large-scale 
atrocities are now uncommon.  However many described an escalation in the killing of 
selected community leaders.  The message from many in communities that I visited is that 
while the names, uniforms or tactics of the illegal armed groups may have changed, the 
violence remains in the form of selective murders, disappearances, intimidation, continuing 
displacement and confinement. The experience of many is that demobilization of 
paramilitary groups has not put an end to the violence; they have just re-grouped under new 
names like the &#8220;Black Eagles.&#8221; They remain as active as ever in intimidation of Afro-
Colombian communities. While urgently wanting protection, communities fear that army or 
police presence in their communities can lay communities open to retaliatory attacks from 
guerrilla and Illegal armed groups.  
</p>
<p>16. In many cases, it is believed that the perpetrators of crimes are identified by victims 
as persons belonging to illegal armed groups and guerrillas. However, victims and 
communities believe that there is complete impunity for all of those who commit crimes 
against them. On August 17, 2009, 117 members of an Afro-Colombian community were 
displaced due to confrontations between two illegal armed groups for the control of the 
Bajo Baudo River area.  Afro-Colombians organizations and their leaders that resist receive 
death threats and there have been numerous recent murders.  The memories of seeing 
family and friends slaughtered are vivid and are routinely recalled by credible threats from 
those persons who the communities recognize as having committed the past atrocities. 
</p>
<p>17. I was pleased to meet with the Vice Minister of Defense and representatives of the 
police and the military during my visit. I was told of important steps being taken to build 
armed services that are aware of and responsive to the rights of Afro-Colombian 
communities and to break with the pattern of past violations. These efforts are welcome and 
should be enhanced. However, it is equally clear to me that more must be done to protect 
vulnerable communities and their leaders who continue to be threatened and killed on a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/23/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>regular basis. It is the primary role of the armed services to protect all of Colombia&#8217;s 
communities to their upmost ability. There must be no compromise to this principle and no 
tolerance of those who deviate from it. Much remains to be done to regain the confidence of 
vulnerable communities. 
</p>
<p>18. I would like to commend the work of the Ombudsman&#8217;s office in establishing a 
system of early warning and risk assessment for communities and leaders under threat.  
Communities seem to trust the Community Ombudsmen and their local representatives, 
many of whom are themselves under death threats.   Regrettably much remains to be done 
to ensure that this process is effective in delivering timely and appropriate measures of 
protection.    While the Ombudsman&#8217;s office has the capacity to identify the credible threats 
on the ground, their alerts must be assessed by a committee of the security forces and civil 
institutions at the national level, which has frequently discounted the credibility of the 
alerts.  The Ombudsman does not sit on that committee but must rely on it to undertake 
protective measures. 
</p>
<p>19. While violence and threats of more violence are still the initial forces propelling 
displacements, the motivations have changed somewhat over the recent years.  Armed 
groups seek lands for the illegal coca cultivation and trafficking in these regions. New 
macro-economic development plans have targeted these regions for one-crop agri-business 
investments that include palm oil and banana cultivation; for mining concessions, ranching 
and logging operations and other economic interests.  
</p>
<p>20. Displacement has a massive impact on the lives and rights of individuals and 
communities. The phenomenon of displacement of Afro-Colombians has particularly 
affected women who have been displaced to urban areas in greater numbers than black men 
and who suffer extreme vulnerability when they are. Ancestral lands from which Afro-
Colombians are displaced are not only the source of livelihood and survival for 
communities, they are also essential for the preservation of Afro-Colombian culture, 
livelihood, language, tradition and for maintaining the social fabric of communities. 
Displacement has given many Afro-Colombians little choice but to move to urban areas 
where they frequently find inhospitable environments of poverty, discrimination and fear. 
As a result the effects of displacement require solutions for both rural and urban 
communities.  These were among the finding of a landmark decision of the Constitutional 
Court, Order 005 of 2009.    
</p>
<p>21. The Court&#8217;s conclusions that Government must act comprehensively to address the 
rights and needs of Afro-Colombians who are displaced, along with the specific measures 
ordered by the Court,  have not to date been effectively implemented on the ground.  
Departmental and Municipal authorities admit extremely poor levels of service delivery and 
support to displaced families.  
</p>
<p>22. While my meetings with officials and institutions of the State, including the 
Ministry of the Interior and Justice and Acci&#243;n Social, have revealed a plethora of Plans of 
Action, policy initiatives, and dedicated programmes in relation to displacement and in 
such fields as education, health care and housing, the reality is that implementation is hard 
to identify and resources and outputs are failing to match the expectations and needs of 
Afro-Colombians. It is evident that the financial resources allocated to projects that look 
positive on paper, are too often failing to trickle down to the communities who urgently 
need the services which have been promised.  
</p>
<p>23. I welcome the establishment of the President&#8217;s Intersectoral Commission for the 
Advancement of the Afro-Colombian Population and its recommendations.  Those 
recommendations focus primarily on the situation of Afro-Colombians in urban 
environments, where admittedly the majority now live due to displacements and the poor 
enforcement of their land rights.  It is my hope that those recommendations will quickly </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/23/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>move from the planning phase to the phase of actually impacting the lives of those who are 
currently suffering. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Afro-Colombian women and violence 
</b></p>
<p>24. Afro-Colombian women have spoken to me of their experiences, the violence 
committed against them, including sexual violence, the fear and trauma that they have 
endured on a daily basis and the challenges of their lives as women and mothers living 
under conditions of conflict, displacement and poverty. Theirs is a story that must be told 
and a situation that must be resolved. Women have told me of the multiple discrimination 
that they face as Afro-Colombians, women, displaced, and poor, a potentially fatal 
combination that leaves them in a situation of extreme vulnerability. Responses must be 
urgently put in place that recognize the extreme impact of violence and displacement on 
women and create conditions of security, dignity and justice. The rights of women to return 
to their community lands in security must be considered a priority.  
</p>
<p>25. When men have been killed, disappeared or forced to flee, women have assumed 
leadership roles in their communities and have shown remarkable resilience and resistance. 
However they do not receive the necessary recognition as community leaders and are not 
afforded the protection measures that they require. Mothers also spoke of losing children to 
forced recruitment into guerrilla and illegal armed groups and noted that extreme poverty, 
threats and intimidation, the regular presence of armed groups in their neighbourhoods and 
promises of money to help their families, create the conditions under which children are 
easy targets for recruitment into guerrilla or illegal armed groups.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Economic interests and inconvenient rights 
</b></p>
<p>26. Many Afro-Colombians have been displaced by &#8220;megaprojects&#8221;, large-scale 
economic operations, often involving national and multinational companies, promoted by 
the government as bringing development and economic gain to the whole of Colombia. The 
communities however, have grave concerns about encroachment on their land rights and 
adverse environmental impacts. But, in the face of such economic interests and 
megaprojects it appears that the rights of communities are &#8220;inconvenient rights&#8221; and that 
the laws put in place to protect them are equally inconvenient.    
</p>
<p>27. Afro-Colombian communities have the right to prior and informed consultation 
under Decree 1320 of 1998, which purports to incorporate International Labour 
Organization Convention 169 into domestic law.  It requires that &#8220;prior informed 
consultation&#8221; must take place with Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities for the 
exploitation of natural resources within their territories and that Afro-Colombians are to 
elect Community Councils to represent their interests in those consultations. Prior 
consultation is a central principle in the protection of all rights of Afro-Colombian 
communities and is particularly relevant as they seek to maintain control of their lands 
under considerable pressure from State and private actors.  
</p>
<p>28. However the law does not adequately define important features relating to how that 
consultation should take place and with whom. I was informed that projects have been 
implemented without consultation or with consultations held with people who do not 
legitimately represent communities and their interests. Consultations must be meaningful 
and effective and respect to the highest degree the rights of minorities to participate fully in 
decisions that affect them and their territories. Importantly ILO Convention 169 requires 
that the prior and informed <i>consent</i> of communities should also be achieved before projects 
are implemented on their lands.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/23/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>29. I have been informed by the government that there are cases in which ongoing 
processes are underway to resolve disputes between the companies behind proposed 
megaprojects and communities which claim collective titles to the land. In the well-
publicized case of Curvarad&#243; and Jiguamiand&#243; where agro-businesses usurped land of 
displaced communities to grow palm oil trees for bio-fuel production, the Vice Minister of 
Agriculture and the Ministry of Interior and Justice informed me that the court seized of 
that matter has confirmed the title held by the communities.  Community members, 
however, told me that in fact the unauthorized use of the land is continuing and they are 
still displaced.  According to the Attorney General&#8217;s office, their investigation of penal 
charges in that case has not yet concluded. 
</p>
<p>30. In some situations involving claims of usurped land rights, the interest of the 
government is complex.  One crop agro-business development projects, such as palm oil 
plantations, figure prominently in national development plans.  The government has a 
program of loans and financing for projects that accord with national planning goals in 
agriculture and mining, which some claim have financed projects on usurped land of Afro-
Colombians.  Local or Departmental governments in some cases, as I was informed by the 
Governor's office in Buenaventura, may have an ownership share in public-private projects 
like the expansion of the port there, as well as benefitting from increased tax revenues.  
This means that when Afro-Colombian communities seek government assistance in 
regaining their full land rights, they are unclear whether government is acting as a referee 
or as an interested party.  Actually, under the constitution and Law 70, the government role 
should be to protect fully the legal rights of communities.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Participation in decision-making 
</b></p>
<p>31. Political participation and representation is a key minority issue, enabling minorities 
to have a voice in decision making bodies and to ensure that the issues of minorities are 
adequately represented at all levels. However Afro-Colombians are extremely poorly 
represented in political structures and institutions in Colombia and consequently the voices 
and issues of Afro-Colombians are not being sufficiently heard or given the attention that 
they deserve. While it is noted that a quota of two seats in Colombia&#8217;s Congress are 
reserved for Afro-Colombians, much more must be done to ensure that they are adequately 
represented and attention must be given by all political actors, including political parties, to 
improve the representation of Afro-Colombians.  In the Executive and administrative 
branches of government there is also serious under-representation. While the national 
police told me that there are a high percentage of Afro-Colombians in their ranks, they are 
concentrated at the lowest levels.  In Department and Municipal offices in regions with 
overwhelming Afro-Colombian populations, black officials are often seen as not truly 
representing the interests of black people. 
</p>
<p>32. At the local level, the Community Councils offer essential representative structures 
and possibilities for local governance and autonomy. Community Councils must, however, 
be legitimately elected by the communities that they represent.  In general I have been 
informed of a lack of recognition and respect for Afro-Colombian leadership and decision 
making structures. Many have described to me the manipulation or co-opting of community 
leadership and Community Councils, creating divisions within Afro-Colombian 
communities with the aim of acquiring land.  
</p>
<p>33. These are my preliminary findings based on my two week visit to Colombia. I will 
be making a series of recommendations to the Government of Colombia in my full report to 
the Human Rights Council.
