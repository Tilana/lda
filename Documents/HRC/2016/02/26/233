<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, Maria Grazia Giammarinaro 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>In the present report, the Special Rapporteur outlines her vision of the mandate and 
</p>
<p>the working methods she intends to use, drawing on the work and experience of her 
</p>
<p>predecessors, in the hope of making progress in implementing the mandate entrusted to her 
</p>
<p>by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 26/8. 
</p>
<p>In section II, the Special Rapporteur provides an account of her activities since her 
</p>
<p>appointment. In section III, she briefly looks into the main trends and challenges of 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons, focusing on the link between trafficking in persons and economic 
</p>
<p>trends; trafficking and mixed migration flows; trafficking and conflicts; the protection of 
</p>
<p>children on the move; a gendered perspective of trafficking; and trafficking and social 
</p>
<p>inclusion. In section IV, she defines the legal and policy frameworks of her mandate.  
</p>
<p>In section V, the Special Rapporteur sets out the agenda of her intended action,  
</p>
<p>guided by the principles of (a) a human rights-based and victim-centred approach to 
</p>
<p>promoting and protecting the human rights of victims of trafficking, especially women and 
</p>
<p>children; (b) a gendered perspective to understand the characteristics of crimes of 
</p>
<p>trafficking and adopt targeted measures; and (c) the best interests of the child in all actions 
</p>
<p>concerning trafficked children. In particular, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s focus will be on 
</p>
<p>prevention of all forms of trafficking as a social issue, especially in relation to labour 
</p>
<p>exploitation; promotion and protection of the human rights of victims of trafficking and 
</p>
<p>exploited persons as potential victims; engaging with the private sector and social partners 
</p>
<p>with a view to complementing the criminal justice response with a meaningful social 
</p>
<p>agenda to prevent and combat trafficking in persons.  
</p>

<p>The Special Rapporteur will focus on prevention of and protection from all forms of 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons, in continuation of the broad interpretation of trafficking in persons 
</p>
<p>adopted by the mandate. This would include developing understanding of new and 
</p>
<p>emerging trends of trafficking, such as the consequences and impacts that conflicts and 
</p>
<p>humanitarian crises may have on trafficking; and the link between mixed migration flows 
</p>
<p>and trafficking, which she intends to explore further within existing human rights 
</p>
<p>frameworks. The prevention of trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation, including 
</p>
<p>of vulnerable or marginalized groups such as migrants, children, minorities, asylum seekers 
</p>
<p>and refugees, will be another aspect of the expert&#8217;s focus. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur will adopt an inclusive and holistic approach to 
</p>
<p>preventing and combating trafficking in persons which requires addressing the 
</p>
<p>systemic/underlying social factors that create the vulnerabilities of victims and potential 
</p>
<p>victims of trafficking. Building on the existing work of the mandate, in particular the basic 
</p>
<p>principles on the right to an effective remedy for victims of trafficking in persons 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/26/18 and A/69/33797), she will look into remaining gaps in the conceptualization 
</p>
<p>of that right and its operationalization at the national level. Moreover, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur intends to analyse laws, policies and practices around the world and take stock 
</p>
<p>of promising practices and lessons learned on the provision of unconditional assistance to 
</p>
<p>victims and potential victims of trafficking, including children, who are frequently left 
</p>
<p>without assistance or the necessary support to access remedies, including compensation. 
</p>
<p>She expects to provide guidance to policymakers and practitioners on better implementing 
</p>
<p>the right to assistance and support and maximizing outreach and impact, thereby 
</p>
<p>contributing to more effective prevention and prosecution.  
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur is of the view that additional guidance would be necessary 
</p>
<p>to better equip States for the actions required to comply with their obligations to exercise 
</p>
<p>the principle of due diligence, and to ensure accountability for the rights of trafficked 
</p>
<p>persons by preventing trafficking, investigating and prosecuting traffickers, assisting and 
</p>
<p>protecting victims of trafficking and providing access to remedy. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur expects to engage with all stakeholders to address 
</p>
<p>trafficking effectively by partnering and engaging with States and non-State actors. She 
</p>
<p>will also consider civil society organizations as strategic partners &#8212; not only service 
</p>
<p>providers &#8212; to be included in the process of designing and implementing targeted anti-
</p>
<p>trafficking measures. 
</p>
<p>Additionally, the Special Rapporteur will continue reaching out to the private sector, 
</p>
<p>in particular engaging with businesses and employers, as well as trade unions, to look out 
</p>
<p>for possibilities for public-private partnerships aimed at establishing effective actions to 
</p>
<p>prevent and combat trafficking. Such actions, including State action plans or other 
</p>
<p>regulations, will increase awareness of the risks that trafficking entails for businesses and 
</p>
<p>employers, and encourage them to commit themselves to take action to eradicate 
</p>
<p>trafficking, especially from their supply chains. To that end, the Special Rapporteur will 
</p>
<p>bring together businesses in selected sectors to exchange experiences and practices with 
</p>
<p>each other, review their assessment protocols through the lens of trafficking prevention, 
</p>
<p>pilot the use of benchmarks and indicators and encourage multi-stakeholder initiatives, 
</p>
<p>where they exist, to respect human rights and combat trafficking in persons, including the 
</p>
<p>establishment of complaint mechanisms enabling vulnerable workers to report exploitation. 
</p>
<p>In the final section, the Special Rapporteur sets out the methodology she intends to 
</p>
<p>adopt in carrying out her mandate, which includes the conduct of country visits and the 
</p>
<p>production of country reports, the development of thematic expertise and checklists to 
</p>
<p>shape international standards, the promotion of clarity around trafficking and fleshing out 
</p>
<p>the substantive content of key trafficking issues. In order to respond effectively to reliable 
</p>
<p>allegations of human rights violations and protect the rights of actual or potential victims of </p>


<p>trafficking, she will communicate cases to States, requesting clarification and action in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the established procedure. Finally, the Special Rapporteur will strengthen 
</p>
<p>the mandate&#8217;s engagement with other United Nations human rights mechanisms, including 
</p>
<p>relevant special procedures mandates, treaty bodies and the universal periodic review. She 
</p>
<p>also intends to fight trafficking in cooperation with regional, subregional and national 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, including national coordinating bodies, national rapporteurs or equivalent 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, and national human rights institutions.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 26/8. 
</p>
<p>It outlines the activities of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially 
</p>
<p>women and children and contains a thematic analysis of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s vision of 
</p>
<p>her mandate. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Participation in conferences and consultations 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 8 October 2014 in Vienna, the Special Rapporteur was part of a panel on the 
</p>
<p>theme of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) issue paper on the key 
</p>
<p>concept of consent, held on the margins of the seventh session of the Conference of Parties 
</p>
<p>to the United Nations Convention against International Organized Crime. 
</p>
<p>3. On 24 November 2014 in Vienna, she made a statement during the launch of the 
</p>
<p>UNODC <i>Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2014</i>. 
</p>
<p>4. On 10 and 11 December 2014 in Geneva, she took part in a panel discussion on 
</p>
<p>addressing the drivers of irregular migration through a comprehensive approach, during the 
</p>
<p>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Dialogue on 
</p>
<p>Protection Challenges: Protection at Sea. 
</p>
<p>5. On 13 March 2015 in Geneva, she addressed the twenty-eighth session of the annual 
</p>
<p>meeting of the International Coordination Committee of National Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Institutions for the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur visited Malaysia from 23 to 28 February 2015, at the 
</p>
<p>invitation of the Government. The report on the visit is contained in the addendum to the 
</p>
<p>present report. She thanks the Government for its cooperation prior to and during the visit.<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Emerging trends and challenges  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Trafficking in persons and economic trends 
</b></p>
<p>7. Trafficking in persons, especially women and children, is a gross human rights 
</p>
<p>violation. It is also a lucrative crime that generates US$150.2 billion per year in illegal 
</p>
<p>profits.1 The flow of trafficking in persons evolves with the changing socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>realities of society and traffickers adapt their modus operandi accordingly. 
</p>
<p>8. In the age of globalization, trafficking in persons cannot be examined in isolation 
</p>
<p>from the broader socioeconomic realities that drive it, nor should it be tackled only from a 
</p>
<p>criminal perspective. Factors such as poverty and inequality, lack of educational 
</p>
<p>opportunity and  access to health care, gender discrimination, including gender-based 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 International Labour Office, <i>Profits and Poverty: the Economics of Forced Labour</i> (2014), p. 13. </p>


<p>violence, racial inequality and migration are some of the underlying factors that 
</p>
<p>cause/contribute to trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p>9. No country or region is spared the crime of trafficking in persons, which can occur 
</p>
<p>everywhere &#8212; at the national, subregional, regional, transcontinental and international 
</p>
<p>levels. Recent trends reveal that victims tend to be trafficked from poor countries to more 
</p>
<p>affluent ones within a region. Similarly, there is also a correlation between the affluence of 
</p>
<p>a destination country (measured by its gross domestic product) and the share of victims 
</p>
<p>trafficked there from other regions (transregional trafficking). Richer countries attract 
</p>
<p>victims from a variety of origins and countries, whereas less affluent countries are mainly 
</p>
<p>affected by domestic or subregional trafficking flows.2 
</p>
<p>10. Moreover, trafficking in persons has been identified as a problem across a variety of 
</p>
<p>economic sectors, including those integrated into global markets. It has been reported that 
</p>
<p>the economic sectors most exposed to trafficking in persons include agriculture and 
</p>
<p>horticulture, construction, garments and textiles, hospitality and catering, mining, logging 
</p>
<p>and forestry, fishing, food processing and packaging, transportation, domestic service and 
</p>
<p>other care and cleaning work. In those cases, trafficking in persons may be carried out by 
</p>
<p>businesses and/or their business partners, including suppliers, subcontractors, labour 
</p>
<p>brokers or private recruitment agencies, often because of the motivation to derive economic 
</p>
<p>benefits from exploitable labour or services provided by trafficked persons or because of 
</p>
<p>unmonitored or unregulated supply chain practices (see A/67/261, paras. 8&#8211;12). It is worth 
</p>
<p>mentioning that in such cases trafficking in persons can and does occur without the transfer 
</p>
<p>of victims from one place to another. The focus should therefore be on the exploitation, 
</p>
<p>rather than the way the person has reached the destination country. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Trafficking and mixed migration flows 
</b></p>
<p>11. Trafficking in persons, especially women and children, is a multifaceted issue that is 
</p>
<p>often interlinked with so-called mixed migration flows, encompassing various categories of 
</p>
<p>persons on the move, including refugees, asylum seekers, economic migrants and other 
</p>
<p>migrants3 travelling, mostly in an irregular manner, along similar routes, using similar 
</p>
<p>means of travel, but for different reasons.4 Trafficking victims do not necessarily 
</p>
<p>immediately enter the mixed migration flow process as trafficked persons, but might 
</p>
<p>become trafficked during their journey or when they reach a transit or destination country. 
</p>
<p>Their migration might often have started out through smuggling, but then have turned into 
</p>
<p>trafficking at a later stage. Initial consent to a migration project, be it regular or irregular, 
</p>
<p>does not imply that a case has necessarily to be qualified as smuggling. Rather, when 
</p>
<p>migrants are placed in abusive and exploitative situations during their journey or at their 
</p>
<p>destination, and when their rights are drastically limited or completely denied, the case in 
</p>
<p>question has to be qualified as trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>12. In fact trafficked persons, like other categories of persons in a migration process, are 
</p>
<p>initially persons pushed into a search for a better life to flee a range of issues, such as  
</p>
<p>poverty, armed conflict, humanitarian crises, torture or other human rights violations, 
</p>
<p>including domestic violence and gender-related persecution. Social and economic 
</p>
<p>vulnerabilities, linguistic isolation, irregular residence status and States&#8217; persistent failure to 
</p>
<p>recognize and protect the human rights of vulnerable and/or undocumented migrants 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p>(Geneva, 2004), p. 42. 
</p>

<p>contribute to exploitative activities that occur as a result of trafficking in places of origin, 
</p>
<p>transit and destination (A/HRC/26/37/Add.2, para. 46). This is particularly prevalent in 
</p>
<p>some sectors in countries of destination that have a rapidly growing demand for low-cost, 
</p>
<p>low-skilled migrant labour, and that are thus prone to labour exploitation.  
</p>
<p>13. Moreover, increasingly restrictive and exclusionary immigration policies, including 
</p>
<p>criminalization and detention of irregular migrants, insufficient channels for regular 
</p>
<p>migration and family reunification, and lack of regular access to the labour market for 
</p>
<p>asylum seekers, refugees and migrants, while rarely achieving their purpose, further 
</p>
<p>contribute to an increase in the exploitation of migrants, including through trafficking 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/26/37/Add.2, para. 46). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Trafficking and conflicts 
</b></p>
<p>14. Violent conflicts and humanitarian crises fuel trafficking in persons. Situations such 
</p>
<p>as the persecution of minorities, arbitrary detention, torture, rape, kidnapping and enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearance, the destruction of homes, increased food prices and progressively scarce 
</p>
<p>access to water and sanitation, which increase the risk of illness and starvation, lead to 
</p>
<p>forced internal and international displacement of the population and forced migration. In 
</p>
<p>their search for a safer and better life, many fall prey to traffickers and exploiters.  
</p>
<p>15. Trafficking is a feature of armed conflict as well as of post-conflict situations5 and 
</p>
<p>usually has a strong gender dimension. For instance, men and boys are trafficked for the 
</p>
<p>purpose of supplying combatants to supplement fighting forces. Armed conflicts also 
</p>
<p>increase the risk of women and girls being sexually exploited, which includes being 
</p>
<p>abducted and forced into sexual slavery and/or forced prostitution.6 Those victims may be 
</p>
<p>transported across international borders before being sold and trafficked to other regions or 
</p>
<p>countries.7 They can also be trafficked for the purposes of forced labour for armies and 
</p>
<p>armed groups. In addition, arranged marriages or false promises of domestic work abroad 
</p>
<p>that are expected to provide children with a better life often render them vulnerable to 
</p>
<p>trafficking for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labour, including 
</p>
<p>domestic servitude. Furthermore, paramilitary groups can wreak havoc on communities 
</p>
<p>during armed conflicts, often forcing children<b> </b>to become soldiers and workers, including in 
</p>
<p>the illegal drug trade.  
</p>
<p>16. Recent trends show that people fleeing conflict and emergency situations to seek 
</p>
<p>asylum increasingly risk their lives in unsafe travel conditions at sea and on land. Those 
</p>
<p>who survive the perilous journey are at a higher risk of trafficking because of their 
</p>
<p>desperation and lack of viable options. They face continued uncertainty, physical, 
</p>
<p>emotional and psychological insecurity, financial strain and lack of legal and/or social 
</p>
<p>inclusion in their host communities. That lack of inclusion means they have little access to 
</p>
<p>education, health care and housing. It also means they face significant barriers in accessing 
</p>
<p>jobs in the formal labour market and can often only find work in the informal economy. By 
</p>
<p>its very nature, the informal sector is unregulated, making it an ideal environment for 
</p>
<p>unscrupulous employers and/or intermediaries to exploit and traffic workers. With the

</i></p>

</p>
<p> 6 See In-depth study on all forms of violence against women: report of the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>(A/61/122/Add.1), para. 143.  
</p>
<p> 7 See the report of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, 
</p>
<p>Violence against women perpetrated and/or condoned by the State during times of armed conflict

<p>considerable pressure on children to help provide financial stability to their families during 
</p>
<p>humanitarian crises, those children may not only be vulnerable to trafficking, but they will 
</p>
<p>also be more likely to work in the unregulated informal sector, as they do not receive an 
</p>
<p>education.8  
</p>
<p>17. In post-conflict situations, the association between military, peacekeeping, 
</p>
<p>humanitarian and other international personnel and private contractors, organized crime and 
</p>
<p>the growth of trafficking in women and children for sexual exploitation has raised global 
</p>
<p>concerns.9
 
It has been reported that an international presence fuels the demand for work and 
</p>
<p>services produced through trafficking and exploitation, in particular sexual services and 
</p>
<p>forced labour. Various factors, such as a vulnerable population and fragile/non-existent 
</p>
<p>institutions, including weak law enforcement, can combine to create a climate of impunity 
</p>
<p>in which international personnel involved in criminal exploitation and trafficking are not 
</p>
<p>investigated, apprehended or prosecuted.10 Moreover, unclear contractors&#8217; engagement 
</p>
<p>regulations are likely to fuel abusive practices the dynamics of which have not yet been 
</p>
<p>fully understood, such as deceptive recruitment practices in countries of origin, followed by 
</p>
<p>exploitative employment by military contractors in conflict areas.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Protecting children on the move 
</b></p>
<p>18. Trafficking of children is on the increase globally, with girls being affected the most. 
</p>
<p>The recently released <i>Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2014</i> also notes significant 
</p>
<p>regional differences concerning child trafficking, with children comprising a majority of 
</p>
<p>detected victims of trafficking in Africa and the Middle East.11  
</p>
<p>19. The mandate&#8217;s work has confirmed that girls and boys are trafficked for a variety of 
</p>
<p>reasons, including for purposes of sexual exploitation, such as in prostitution and in the 
</p>
<p>production of child pornography. Furthermore, they are trafficked for forced and 
</p>
<p>exploitative labour in farms and factories and on fishing boats, for forced criminal 
</p>
<p>activities, for forced and organized begging, and for domestic servitude in private 
</p>
<p>households. While much trafficking of children involves movement across international 
</p>
<p>borders, many countries experience the phenomenon of internal child trafficking.  
</p>
<p>20. The mandate found that in certain regions, trafficked children, like adults, are often 
</p>
<p>obliged or induced by their traffickers and exploiters to commit crimes,12 inter alia, 
</p>
<p>pickpocketing, burglary, and drug cultivation and transportation. In spite of non-
</p>
<p>punishment clauses in regional and international legal instruments,13 the children are often 
</p>
<p>then prosecuted, imprisoned and/or deported for the illegal activities they have carried out 
</p>
<p>as a direct consequence of their situation as trafficked persons, instead of being considered 
</p>
<p>as victims of trafficking.

<p>21. Child victims of trafficking need specific assistance, protection and support that 
often differ substantially from those given to adults and they require child-specific and 
</p>
<p>child-centred measures in relation to identification, protection and assistance that are based 
</p>
<p>on the principles and provisions of existing human rights law (A/HRC/26/37/Add.2, 
</p>
<p>paras. 39&#8211;42). In particular, appropriate procedures must be put in place to assess the best 
</p>
<p>interests of the child in every case, before any decision is made regarding the child 
</p>
<p>concerned, including assistance measures and eventually repatriation.  
</p>
<p><b> E. A gendered perspective to trafficking  
</b></p>
<p>22. Women are significantly involved in trafficking in persons, both as victims and 
</p>
<p>offenders. Data regarding women are among the most interesting findings in the UNODC 
</p>
<p><i>Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2014</i>, which confirms that women and girls are 
</p>
<p>disproportionately exploited not only for the purposes of sexual but also labour 
</p>
<p>exploitation. In some regions, such as in South and East Asia, in Africa and the Middle 
</p>
<p>East, women are even the majority of people exploited as forced labour.  
</p>
<p>23. Men and boys can also become victims of trafficking, particularly for forced labour 
</p>
<p>and to a lesser extent for sexual exploitation. However, lack of awareness about the 
</p>
<p>involvement of men as trafficked persons has resulted in identification failures, as well as 
</p>
<p>significant discrimination against male victims, particularly in terms of access to protection 
</p>
<p>and assistance (A/HRC/26/37/Add.2, para. 34). 
</p>
<p>24. With regard to perpetrators, while the majority of traffickers are men, women 
</p>
<p>constitute 28 per cent of convicted trafficking offenders.14 It is not uncommon for women 
</p>
<p>victims of trafficking to be convicted for offences connected with, or arising out of, their 
</p>
<p>trafficking situation, as a result of coercion by their perpetrators to undertake criminal 
</p>
<p>activities. In those situations, they often come to the attention of the authorities primarily as 
</p>
<p>offenders, whilst they should rather be identified as victims of trafficking. On the other 
</p>
<p>hand, in some cases women start out as victims of trafficking and, as a means of escaping 
</p>
<p>their own victimization, turn into perpetrators, undertaking the most visible and dangerous 
</p>
<p>criminal tasks. In that regard, the mandate has noted the involvement of women traffickers 
</p>
<p>in areas such as the recruitment and controlling of children for forced labour and domestic 
</p>
<p>servitude, and of women and girls for sexual exploitation (A/HRC/23/48/Add.2 and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/26/37/Add.4). 
</p>
<p>25. Some forms of trafficking mostly involve women and girls, who comprise the vast 
</p>
<p>majority of people trafficked for sexual purposes and for labour exploitation in domestic 
</p>
<p>servitude. Moreover, women are also trafficked for the purpose of forced and servile 
</p>
<p>marriages (A/HRC/21/41).  
</p>
<p>26. Assistance and support measures should take into account a gendered perspective, 
</p>
<p>building upon good practices in relation to the field of sexual exploitation, especially those 
</p>
<p>based on solidarity and the help that women can provide to each other, and that survivors 
</p>
<p>can provide to actual, potential and presumed victims of trafficking.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Trafficking and social inclusion 
</b></p>
<p>27. The notion of social inclusion of victims of trafficking is a well-established element 
</p>
<p>in the context of integration/reintegration of victims in the country of destination or in their 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 14 UNODC, <i>Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2014</i>, p. 10. </p>


<p>home country.15 
 
The social inclusion of victims of trafficking prevents their further 
</p>
<p>victimization and is also a preventive measure against retrafficking. 
</p>
<p>28. Social inclusion options for victims of trafficking, such as access to housing, social 
</p>
<p>protection, health care, education and employment, are vital in countries of destination, 
</p>
<p>transit and origin. In most cases, the capacity of countries to offer viable long-term social 
</p>
<p>inclusion options for victims, in particular those returning to their country of origin, is 
</p>
<p>limited owing to factors such as poverty, unemployment and weak social structures. On the 
</p>
<p>other hand, in countries of destination social inclusion is hampered by a number of factors, 
</p>
<p>including restrictive migration policies and poor labour market regulations. As a result, in 
</p>
<p>many countries trafficked persons, even after being identified as such and having 
</p>
<p>undertaken a rehabilitation and reintegration process, are not allowed to work or regularize 
</p>
<p>their residence status;  rather, they are repatriated at the end of criminal proceedings. In the 
</p>
<p>absence of viable social inclusion options for victims of trafficking, it will be difficult to 
</p>
<p>break the cycle of trafficking and retrafficking.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>29. Trafficking is a grave violation of a number of human rights, especially the right to 
</p>
<p>liberty and the right not to be held in slavery or involuntary servitude, the right to be free 
</p>
<p>from cruel and inhumane treatment, the right to be free from violence and the right to 
</p>
<p>health. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s framework for action will be guided by existing 
</p>
<p>international and regional human rights instruments and principles relating to trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons.  
</p>
<p><b> A. International human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>30. Prior to the adoption of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
</p>
<p>Persons, especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention 
</p>
<p>against Transnational Organized Crime (also referred to as the Palermo Protocol), 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons was addressed in various instruments, including the 1926 Slavery 
</p>
<p>Convention, the 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave 
</p>
<p>Trade and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery, and the 1949 Convention for the 
</p>
<p>Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others. 
</p>
<p>Other international normative documents also contain provisions against trafficking of 
</p>
<p>persons, such as the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1966 International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Discrimination against Women, the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child 
</p>
<p>and its 2000 Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
</p>
<p>pornography.  
</p>
<p>31. In December 2003, the Palermo Protocol entered into force and has since been 
</p>
<p>ratified by many States.16 The purposes of the Protocol are to prevent and combat 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons, paying particular attention to women and children; to protect and 
</p>
<p>assist the victims of trafficking, with full respect for their human rights; and to promote 
</p>
<p>cooperation among States parties in order to meet those objectives. UNODC offers practical 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 15 Basic principles on the right to an effective remedy for trafficked persons, art. 9 (A/69/33797, annex); 
</p>
<p>OHCHR, <i>Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking</i>, 
</p>
<p>guideline 6; Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, art. 15, 
</p>
<p>para. 4. 
</p>

<p>help to States in the implementation of the Protocol, giving guidance for the drafting of 
</p>
<p>laws and the creation of comprehensive national anti-trafficking strategies, and assisting 
</p>
<p>with resources to implement them. 
</p>
<p>32. In addition, several ILO instruments are also of relevance to combating trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons, including ILO Conventions No. 29 (1930) concerning Forced or Compulsory 
</p>
<p>Labour; No. 100 (1951) concerning  Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for 
</p>
<p>Work of Equal Value; No. 105 (1957) concerning the Abolition of Forced Labour; No. 111 
</p>
<p>(1958) concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation; No. 138 
</p>
<p>(1973) concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment; and No. 182 (1999) 
</p>
<p>concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of 
</p>
<p>Child Labour. Of particular importance is the Protocol to the Forced Labour Convention, 
</p>
<p>1930 which came into force in 2014, complementing ILO Convention No. 29 and re-
</p>
<p>enforcing existing international law. The Protocol creates new obligations to prevent forced 
</p>
<p>labour, to protect victims and to provide access to remedy, such as compensation for 
</p>
<p>material and physical harm. It is also supported by a recommendation that provides 
</p>
<p>technical guidance on its implementation.  
</p>
<p>33. ILO Convention No. 189 (2011) concerning decent work for domestic workers, 
</p>
<p>which entered into force in 2013, and its Recommendation No. 201 extend basic labour 
</p>
<p>rights to domestic workers, including those in private households, who are without clear 
</p>
<p>terms of employment, unregistered and excluded from the scope of labour legislation. It 
</p>
<p>stresses States&#8217; duty of diligence in effectively eliminating child labour and sets a minimum 
</p>
<p>age for domestic workers.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional human rights mechanisms  
</b></p>
<p>34. The regional specificities of trafficking in persons necessitate regional and 
</p>
<p>subregional anti-trafficking instruments and mechanisms that are at the interface of 
</p>
<p>international action and local realities. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Europe and Central Asia 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, 
</p>
<p>which entered into force in February 2008, applies to all forms of trafficking, whether 
</p>
<p>national or transnational, all victims of trafficking and all forms of exploitation. The 
</p>
<p>Convention is open to ratification by States which are not members of the Council of 
</p>
<p>Europe. The countries which have signed up to the Convention are monitored by the Group 
</p>
<p>of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. The Council of Europe also 
</p>
<p>supports governments in the implementation of the Convention and the recommendations 
</p>
<p>emerging from its monitoring process. 
</p>
<p>36. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has been 
</p>
<p>addressing trafficking in persons as a major concern since 2000, when the first Ministerial 
</p>
<p>Council decision on enhancing OSCE efforts to combat trafficking in human beings was 
</p>
<p>taken. In 2003, the OSCE Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings was 
</p>
<p>adopted and in 2006 the Special Representative and Coordinator for Combating Trafficking 
</p>
<p>in Human Beings was appointed. In 2007, a Platform for Action against Human Trafficking 
</p>
<p>was adopted, and in 2013, the Addendum to the OSCE Action Plan to Combat Trafficking 
</p>
<p>in Human Beings: One Decade Later was endorsed.  
</p>
<p>37. In Central Asia, in 2005 the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) adopted 
</p>
<p>the Agreement on the Cooperation of the CIS Member States in Combating Trafficking in 
</p>
<p>Persons, Human Organs and Tissues, followed by the adoption in 2006 of the Decision on 
</p>
<p>the Programme of Cooperation of the CIS Member States in Combating Trafficking in </p>


<p>Persons for the period 2007&#8211;2010. Finally, a CIS draft Programme of Action for 2007&#8211;
</p>
<p>2010 was adopted, to support the implementation of the 2005 Agreement and facilitate 
</p>
<p>efficient cooperation at the regional level for the prevention and suppression of trafficking 
</p>
<p>in persons and the rehabilitation of victims.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Middle East and North Africa 
</b></p>
<p>38. Within the framework of the League of Arab States, the Arab Initiative to Build 
</p>
<p>National Capacities to Combat Human Trafficking in the Arab Countries was launched in 
</p>
<p>March 2010 by the Council of Arab Ministers of Justice. The Initiative is aimed at 
</p>
<p>combating trafficking in persons through developing the criminal justice system in Arab 
</p>
<p>States, for example by the capacity-building of law-enforcement bodies, prosecutors, 
</p>
<p>members of the judiciary and the media. 
</p>
<p>39. Other regional instruments for addressing trafficking in persons are the Arab 
</p>
<p>Framework Act on Combating Trafficking in Persons (2008), which serves as a platform 
</p>
<p>from which to spearhead action against trafficking in persons, and the Arab Charter of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights (2008), which, inter alia, prohibits trafficking in human organs; and slavery 
</p>
<p>and servitude, forced labour and trafficking in persons for the purposes of prostitution or 
</p>
<p>sexual exploitation or the exploitation of the prostitution of others or any other form of 
</p>
<p>exploitation or the exploitation of children in armed conflict; and has extensive provisions 
</p>
<p>on the right to decent work freely chosen and on the right to development. 
</p>
<p>40. The Gulf Cooperation Council has also taken initiatives to curb trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons in the subregion, including through capacity-building workshops and the 
</p>
<p>development of guiding principles to combat trafficking in persons in the region. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Latin America and the Caribbean 
</b></p>
<p>41. In this region, the 1994 Inter-American Convention on International Traffic in 
</p>
<p>Minors and the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication 
</p>
<p>of Violence against Women (Convention of Bel&#233;m do Par&#225;)17 contributed to the anti-
</p>
<p>trafficking legal framework. Other instruments, such as the 2005 Montevideo Declaration 
</p>
<p>against Trafficking in Persons in MERCOSUR (Common Market of the South) and 
</p>
<p>Associated States, the 2008 Recommendations of the First International Congress of 
</p>
<p>MERCOSUR and Associated States on Trafficking in Persons and Child Pornography, the 
</p>
<p>Work Plan against Trafficking in Persons in the Western Hemisphere (2010&#8211;2012, later 
</p>
<p>extended for two years, and 2015&#8211;2018), the Inter-American Declaration against 
</p>
<p>Trafficking in Persons (&#8220;Declaration of Brasilia&#8221;, 2014) and the Brazil Declaration on a 
</p>
<p>Framework for Cooperation and Regional Solidarity to Strengthen the International 
</p>
<p>Protection of Refugees, Displaced and Stateless Persons in Latin America and the 
</p>
<p>Caribbean (Cartagena+30, 2014), further consolidated regional efforts to eradicate human 
</p>
<p>trafficking.  
</p>
<p>42. The commitment to promote effective measures to combat trafficking in persons was 
</p>
<p>reaffirmed by the member States of a number of regional and subregional organizations, in 
</p>
<p>particular MERCOSUR, the Andean Community, the Union of South American Nations, 
</p>
<p>the Central American Integration System  and the Organization of American States (OAS). 
</p>
<p>OAS is strongly engaged in combating trafficking in persons on the American continent. At 
</p>
<p>the political level, the OAS General Assembly has adopted resolutions that express the 
</p>
<p>commitment of member States in that regard. At the level of the secretariat, the OAS Anti-
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 17 Article 2 of the Convention defines violence and article 2 (b) lists trafficking in persons as a form of 
</p>
<p>violence against women.  </p>


<p>Trafficking in Persons Unit provides specialized training and assistance to member 
</p>
<p>countries to implement the Palermo Protocol and the recommendations stemming from the 
</p>
<p>OAS meetings of national authorities on trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Asia-Pacific region 
</b></p>
<p>43. A number of initiatives have been launched to combat trafficking in persons in the 
</p>
<p>Asia-Pacific region, including the Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in 
</p>
<p>Women and Children for Prostitution, adopted by the States members of the South Asian 
</p>
<p>Association for Regional Cooperation in 2002. In addition, the Association of Southeast 
</p>
<p>Asian Nations (ASEAN) launched its first programme, the Asia Regional Cooperation to 
</p>
<p>Prevent People Trafficking Project (2003&#8211;2006), which was implemented by the 
</p>
<p>Government of Australia. The Project focused on criminal justice responses to trafficking in 
</p>
<p>partner countries. Following its success, the Project was extended in 2011 as the Asia 
</p>
<p>Regional Trafficking in Persons Project. ASEAN also adopted the ASEAN Declaration 
</p>
<p>Against Trafficking in Persons Particularly Women and Children (2004), followed by the 
</p>
<p>adoption of a work plan to implement the Declaration. An ASEAN convention on 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons  and a regional plan of action are expected to be finalized and adopted 
</p>
<p>in 2015. 
</p>
<p>44. In the Greater Mekong subregion, the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative 
</p>
<p>against Human Trafficking, comprising six States (Cambodia, China, the Lao People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam), has been addressing trafficking 
</p>
<p>issues since 2004 through subregional plans of action, task forces at various levels and 
</p>
<p>other mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>45. The Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related 
</p>
<p>Transnational Crime, a consultative mechanism launched in 2002 by ministers of over 50 
</p>
<p>countries in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond, also works on practical anti-trafficking and 
</p>
<p>anti-smuggling measures in the region.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Africa 
</b></p>
<p>46. The African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights,18 the African Charter on the 
</p>
<p>Rights and Welfare of the Child,19 and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and 
</p>
<p>Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa20 provide the legal framework for 
</p>
<p>combating trafficking in persons. Additionally, the Migration Policy Framework for Africa 
</p>
<p>(2006) provides the overarching policy of the African Union on migration issues, including 
</p>
<p>human trafficking. The Ouagadougou Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings, 
</p>
<p>Especially Women and Children (2006) provides specific recommendations to be 
</p>
<p>implemented by regional economic communities and member States on prevention of 
</p>
<p>trafficking, protection of victims of trafficking and prosecution of those involved in the 
</p>
<p>crime of trafficking. Furthermore, the African Union Horn of Africa Initiative on Human 
</p>
<p>Trafficking and Smuggling (Khartoum Declaration, 2014) focuses on, inter alia, areas such 
</p>
<p>as addressing the social, economic, environmental, cultural, security and political factors 
</p>
<p>that make people vulnerable to human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>47. Subregional initiatives include the Economic Community of West African States 
</p>
<p>(ECOWAS) Declaration on the Fight against Trafficking in Persons (2001) and the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 18 Arts. 2, 5, 15, 18, paras. 3, 60 and 61. 
</p>
<p> 19 Art. 29 in particular. 
</p>
<p> 20 Article 4 (2) (g) prohibits trafficking in children and women and requires States to prosecute the 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of such trafficking and protect those at risk. Other relevant articles are articles 2, 3, 11, 
</p>

<p>ECOWAS Initial Plan of Action against Trafficking in Persons (2002&#8211;2003). Subsequent 
</p>
<p>plans of action against trafficking in persons have also been adopted. Moreover, the 
</p>
<p>ECOWAS and Economic Community of Central African States biregional Plan of Action 
</p>
<p>to Combat Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children (2006&#8211;2009), the related 
</p>
<p>resolution and a multilateral cooperation agreement have further strengthened subregional 
</p>
<p>initiatives to curb trafficking. The biregional Plan of Action reaffirmed the ECOWAS 
</p>
<p>Initial Plan of Action and extended efforts to combat trafficking into the Central African 
</p>
<p>region. In addition, the Southern African Development Community Plan of Action to 
</p>
<p>combat trafficking in persons, the revised African Union Plan of Action on Drug Control 
</p>
<p>and Crime Prevention (2007&#8211;2012 and 2013&#8211;2017) can be cited as examples of subregional 
</p>
<p>initiatives. Joint cooperation between intergovernmental organizations, such as between the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and the African Union, in the Asian-African Legal Consultative 
</p>
<p>Organization  or within the Commonwealth can be cited as joint actions to address human 
</p>
<p>trafficking.21  
</p>
<p><b> V. Agenda-setting 
</b></p>
<p>48. Building upon the work of her predecessors, and in accordance with Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 26/8, the Special Rapporteur aims to (a) promote the prevention of 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons in all its forms and the adoption of effective measures to uphold and 
</p>
<p>protect the human rights of victims of trafficking in persons; (b) promote the effective 
</p>
<p>application of relevant international norms and standards and contribute to their further 
</p>
<p>improvement; (c) identify, share and promote good practices in order to uphold and protect 
</p>
<p>the human rights of victims of trafficking in persons and to identify protection gaps, 
</p>
<p>including with regard to the identification of victims of trafficking in persons; and (d) 
</p>
<p>examine the impact of national, regional and international anti-trafficking measures on the 
</p>
<p>human rights of victims of trafficking in persons with a view to proposing adequate 
</p>
<p>responses to challenges. 
</p>
<p>49. To that end, the Special Rapporteur will advocate a human rights-based and victim-
</p>
<p>centred approach to promote and protect the human rights of victims of trafficking, 
</p>
<p>especially women and children, guided by international human rights law and standards, 
</p>
<p>including the OHCHR Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>Human Trafficking<i>. 
</i></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur will adopt a gendered perspective on trafficking which 
</p>
<p>acknowledges that both women and men can be involved in trafficking and provides a 
</p>
<p>better understanding of how to address the similarities and differences in the trafficking 
</p>
<p>experience of women and men. In her work, she plans to pay particular attention to 
</p>
<p>understanding the characteristics of trafficking crimes from a gender perspective to ensure 
</p>
<p>the adoption of targeted measures. A gender perspective is necessary to understand why 
</p>
<p>women constitute the majority of victims of trafficking in certain sectors, and why men are 
</p>
<p>less likely to be identified as victims of trafficking and less likely to be reached by existing 
</p>
<p>support measures for trafficked persons. In addition, the compounded effects of various 
</p>
<p>types of exploitation which affect women disproportionately should be examined. For 
</p>
<p>instance, in the agriculture sector, women trafficked for labour exploitation who work in the 
</p>
<p>fields during the day are often sexually exploited at night by fellow workers and/or brokers 
</p>
<p>and intermediaries.  
</p>
<p>51. Finally, the Special Rapporteur will be guided by the best interests of the child in all 
</p>
<p>actions concerning trafficked girls and boys, whether undertaken by public or private 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies. She expects to 
</p>
<p>look into existing identification, protection and assistance gaps in relation to children who 
</p>
<p>have been trafficked for various purposes, with the aim of providing insights on issues such 
</p>
<p>as the procedures for determining the  best interests of the children, access to justice, 
</p>
<p>provision of unconditional assistance and effective remedies including compensation for 
</p>
<p>such children. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Focus on prevention of all forms of trafficking in persons  
</b></p>
<p>52. In continuation of the broad interpretation of trafficking in persons adopted by the 
</p>
<p>mandate, the Special Rapporteur will embrace and further develop a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>understanding of trafficking for any illicit purpose. This includes &#8212; but is not limited to &#8212; 
</p>
<p>trafficking in adults and children for sexual purposes, for labour exploitation, for 
</p>
<p>exploitative adoption and for participation in armed conflicts; trafficking in women, men 
</p>
<p>and children for forced labour and other forms of exploitation, such as exploitation in 
</p>
<p>criminal or illicit activities, or forced and organized begging; trafficking in women and girls 
</p>
<p>for forced and servile marriages, sexual exploitation and forced labour, including domestic 
</p>
<p>servitude; and trafficking in persons for the removal of organs (A/HRC/26/37, para. 36).  
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur wishes to underline that trafficking should be seen and 
</p>
<p>tackled not only as a crime, but as an economic and social phenomenon, linked with global 
</p>
<p>economic trends. She believes that an inclusive and holistic approach to the prevention of 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons requires addressing the systemic/underlying social factors that create 
</p>
<p>vulnerabilities in victims and potential victims of trafficking.  
</p>
<p>54. With a view to preventing all forms of trafficking, the Special Rapporteur also 
</p>
<p>intends to develop, through research, thematic studies and other means, an understanding of 
</p>
<p>new and emerging trends in trafficking, such as the consequences and impacts that conflicts 
</p>
<p>and humanitarian crises may have on trafficking, on which there is a dearth of information.  
</p>
<p>55. In addition, she wishes to explore further the link between mixed migration flows 
</p>
<p>and trafficking, in order to recommend effective measures, aimed at preventing exploitation 
</p>
<p>or further exploitation of socially vulnerable people fleeing death, torture or other forms of 
</p>
<p>violence such as domestic violence, or unemployment, destitution and extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>That includes exploring ways to increase<b> </b> opportunities for regular migration and family 
</p>
<p>reunification, and for non-exploitative employment, with the aim of preventing trafficking 
</p>
<p>by ensuring full respect of migrants&#8217; rights, in line with the International Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.22<b> </b></p>
<p>56. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur expects to focus on the prevention of labour 
</p>
<p>exploitation, including of vulnerable or marginalized groups such as migrants, children, 
</p>
<p>national, ethnic or racial minorities, asylum seekers and refugees, by engaging with 
</p>
<p>businesses, trade unions and other relevant parties, and by further exploring ways to better 
</p>
<p>regulate and monitor the activities of recruitment and employment agencies, with a view to 
</p>
<p>preventing abusive practices leading to debt bondage, trafficking and exploitation. 
</p>
<p>57. While the Special Rapporteur intends to accord priority to those thematic areas, she 
</p>
<p>will also continue to follow up on thematic concerns addressed by her predecessors, such as 
</p>
<p>the issue of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation, including of children, 
</p>
<p>especially as a consequence of conflicts, and in connection with labour exploitation, 
</p>
<p>including domestic servitude. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><b> B. Focus on promotion and protection of the human rights of victims 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur believes that the human rights of victims of trafficking 
</p>
<p>should be placed at the centre of protection measures taken to address trafficking. That 
</p>
<p>includes the protection of<b> </b>victims from further exploitation and harm, and their access to 
</p>
<p>adequate assistance, support and remedies.  
</p>
<p>59. Comprehensive assistance and support to victims and potential victims of trafficking 
</p>
<p>are crucial for an effective fight against trafficking in persons on the one hand, and are 
</p>
<p>instrumental to accessing justice and effective remedies on the other hand. Not all 
</p>
<p>trafficked and exploited persons will be able or willing to report their exploiters or 
</p>
<p>participate in legal proceedings against them. All victims should, however, be enabled to do 
</p>
<p>so if they wish.  
</p>
<p>60. Currently, assistance and support to exploited and trafficked persons are most 
</p>
<p>commonly dependent on three main factors: a person&#8217;s immigration/residence status; the 
</p>
<p>initiation of criminal proceedings for the crime of trafficking; and cooperation with 
</p>
<p>criminal justice actors. As a result, assistance, support and ultimately access to remedies 
</p>
<p>remain out of reach for a large number of trafficked and exploited persons who are afraid of 
</p>
<p>being deported or detained, and/or  who distrust the authorities and are afraid of losing the 
</p>
<p>possibility of pursuing their migration project. In addition, there are indications and 
</p>
<p>concerns that the current set-up of most assistance and support mechanisms might result in 
</p>
<p>discrimination against victims who are not willing or able to cooperate with law 
</p>
<p>enforcement. Assistance and support to child victims of trafficking and other exploited and 
</p>
<p>vulnerable children also require that they be provided with appropriate assistance and 
</p>
<p>protection, taking full account of their human rights and special needs.  
</p>
<p>61. In particular, protection and assistance should not be made conditional upon the 
</p>
<p>capacity or willingness of victims to cooperate with law enforcement agencies, regardless 
</p>
<p>of whether legal proceedings are initiated or charges pressed against their traffickers and 
</p>
<p>exploiters, or whether the crime has been legally qualified as trafficking or as another or 
</p>
<p>less serious crime. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur expects to further explore the need 
</p>
<p>for unconditional access to a range of support services for victims of trafficking, including 
</p>
<p>children, who are frequently left without assistance or the necessary support to access 
</p>
<p>remedies, including compensation &#8212; a situation that exacerbates the risk of further human 
</p>
<p>rights violations.  
</p>
<p>62. Building on the existing work of the mandate,23 in particular the basic principles on 
</p>
<p>the right to an effective remedy for trafficked persons (A/HRC/26/18, annex) and A/69/33797), 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur intends to analyse laws, policies and practices around the world and 
</p>
<p>take stock of promising practices and lessons learned on the provision of unconditional 
</p>
<p>assistance to victims and potential victims of trafficking. She expects to provide guidance 
</p>
<p>to policy makers and practitioners on better implementing the right to assistance and 
</p>
<p>support, and maximize outreach and impact, thereby contributing to more effective 
</p>
<p>prevention and prosecution.  
</p>
<p>63. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur envisages building upon the work of the 
</p>
<p>mandate in the area of protection of the rights of victims of trafficking and access to justice. 
</p>
<p>In that regard, she intends to further follow up on the basic principles on the right to an 
</p>
<p>effective remedy for trafficked persons, which provide for remedies for victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking, including restitution, rehabilitation, compensation, satisfaction and guarantees 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 23 See A/64/290, paras. 91&#8211;95, and A/64/290, paras. 80&#8211;81. See also UNHCR, Guidelines on 
</p>
<p>International Protection No. 7. </p>


<p>of non-repetition, and call on States to ensure that access to those measures shall not 
</p>
<p>depend on the victim&#8217;s capacity or willingness to cooperate in legal proceedings. When 
</p>
<p>looking into remaining gaps in the conceptualization of the right to an effective remedy and 
</p>
<p>the operationalization of the basic principles at the national level, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>expects to further delve into issues such as the possible types of trafficking exploitation 
</p>
<p>covered by the principles, what the barriers to access to remedy are, whether the nature of 
</p>
<p>the State responsibility affects the content of the reparation, the available forms of 
</p>
<p>reparation, the accessibility of compensation funds to victims and the conditions for the 
</p>
<p>protection of victims&#8217; rights in out of court settlements . 
</p>
<p>64. Moreover, international law mandates States to exercise due diligence to prevent 
</p>
<p>trafficking, to investigate and prosecute traffickers, to assist and protect victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking and to provide access to remedy. As trafficking in persons is most often 
</p>
<p>perpetrated by non-State actors, compliance with the due diligence principle is critical to 
</p>
<p>ensure State accountability for the protection of the rights of victims and potential victims. 
</p>
<p>However, the standard of due diligence as it relates to trafficking in persons has not been 
</p>
<p>comprehensively articulated, either by the mandate of the Special Rapporteur or elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that additional guidance would be 
</p>
<p>necessary to better equip States for the actions required to comply with their due diligence 
</p>
<p>obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Engaging with States, the private sector and social actors 
</b></p>
<p>65. Trafficking in persons requires a concerted effort by all stakeholders if it is to be 
</p>
<p>effectively addressed. In view of this, the Special Rapporteur will endeavour to continue 
</p>
<p>partnering and cooperating with States, both those that are parties to the Palermo Protocol 
</p>
<p>and those that are yet to ratify it. She is also committed to continue engaging with non-State 
</p>
<p>actors on the role they can or should play in preventing and responding to trafficking. In 
</p>
<p>particular, she will consider civil society organizations as strategic partners &#8212; not only 
</p>
<p>service providers &#8212; to be included in the process of designing and implementing targeted 
</p>
<p>anti-trafficking measures. 
</p>
<p>66. Trafficking feeds into a global market that seeks out cheap, unregulated and 
</p>
<p>exploitable labour and the goods and services that such labour can produce. With regard to 
</p>
<p>the private<b> </b>sector, the key role that business actors can play in removing trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons from the supply chains is widely acknowledged.  
</p>
<p>67. The mandate has devoted attention to the extent to which trafficking in persons has 
</p>
<p>emerged as a key challenge and risk in a wide range of industries and sectors integrated into 
</p>
<p>global markets, despite corporate social responsibility programmes. This includes a 
</p>
<p>thematic report to the General Assembly (A/67/261) on the issue of trafficking in global 
</p>
<p>supply chains which examined the different ways human trafficking manifests itself in the 
</p>
<p>global economy, the response of global businesses, existing and emerging strategies to 
</p>
<p>combat abuse, and the immediate and long-term steps necessary for business leaders to take 
</p>
<p>effective and sustainable action. That work was followed in 2012 by an expert meeting with 
</p>
<p>representatives of business enterprises, trade unions, non-governmental organizations, 
</p>
<p>academia and international organizations that focused on understanding the relationship 
</p>
<p>between human trafficking and global supply chains, and the risks run by workers and 
</p>
<p>business.24 In addition a panel on preventing trafficking in global supply chains was 
</p>
<p>convened by the previous mandate holder on the fringe of the annual Forum on Business 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>and Human Rights in 2013.25 The mandate has also developed a draft checklist of indicators 
</p>
<p>and benchmarks that enterprises could use to assess the risks of human trafficking and 
</p>
<p>forced labour in their supply chains. They are intended to build on and complement the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as well as existing important initiatives 
</p>
<p>developed by enterprises themselves and civil society organizations (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/23/48/Add.4). 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur will continue to build on the work of the mandate in that 
</p>
<p>field and capitalize on the momentum created by new legislation and initiatives from 
</p>
<p>businesses and civil society to free the supply chains from trafficking, forced labour and 
</p>
<p>slavery. On the basis of her global mandate, international standing and expertise on issues 
</p>
<p>relating to trafficking in persons, the Special Rapporteur intends to continue engaging with 
</p>
<p>businesses in order to encourage the establishment and effective implementation of self-
</p>
<p>regulatory action (codes of conduct and other similar mechanisms) by the private sector, 
</p>
<p>with the aim of increasing awareness of the risks that trafficking entails, and encouraging 
</p>
<p>them to take action to eradicate trafficking from their supply chains. That would entail the 
</p>
<p>mandate holder bringing together businesses in a number of selected sectors to exchange 
</p>
<p>experiences and practices among themselves, review their assessment protocols through the 
</p>
<p>lens of trafficking prevention, pilot the use of the benchmarks and indicators and encourage 
</p>
<p>multi-stakeholder initiatives, where they exist, to operationalize the responsibility of 
</p>
<p>businesses to respect human rights.26  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Method of work 
</b></p>
<p>69. In undertaking her activities, the Special Rapporteur will endeavour to adopt a 
</p>
<p>participatory approach, in the form of consultations and constructive dialogue with all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including victims of trafficking, civil society and the private sector.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Country visits  
</b></p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur will continue to undertake country visits to help ground the 
</p>
<p>mandate&#8217;s understanding of the problem of trafficking in national realities and to forge 
</p>
<p>relationships with those on the front line, while also providing States and their partners with 
</p>
<p>an opportunity to access information, expertise and insight. The factors to be taken into 
</p>
<p>account in selecting country visits are varied and in doing so the Special Rapporteur will 
</p>
<p>follow the usual criteria of special procedures mechanisms.27  
</p>
<p>71. During those visits, she will focus on the nature of the trafficking problem, the key 
</p>
<p>human rights issues and the effectiveness of institutional, legal, judicial, administrative and 
</p>
<p>other mechanisms to protect those rights. She will ensure that her country visits are widely 
</p>
<p>consultative, involving government officials; victim support agencies and, where 
</p>
<p>appropriate, victims; members of the judiciary and parliamentarians; members of United 
</p>
<p>Nations country offices; and international and non-governmental organizations in the 
</p>
<p>country concerned.  
</p>
<p>72. In the ensuing reports on her visits, she will highlight the major issues of concern to 
</p>
<p>the mandate; forms and manifestations of trafficking; the legislative and institutional 
</p>

</p>

<p>framework; identification of trafficked persons; protection of trafficked persons; 
</p>
<p>prosecution of perpetrators; cooperation with civil society; and international and regional 
</p>
<p>cooperation. She will also provide concrete recommendations to governments and relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders on how to tackle the issue of trafficking. As part of her commitment to 
</p>
<p>continuing the work of her predecessors, the Special Rapporteur will also try to follow up 
</p>
<p>on recommendations made in previous reports on countries visited.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Thematic studies and checklists 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur will endeavour to develop thematic expertise through 
</p>
<p>studies, reports and other tools, in order to make substantial contributions to poorly 
</p>
<p>understood or new areas of concern. The thematic areas will be carefully chosen on the 
</p>
<p>basis of their relative importance and urgency, as well as the capacity of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur to make a contribution to shaping international standards and promoting 
</p>
<p>awareness in the chosen area. In this regard, some of the themes the Special Rapporteur has 
</p>
<p>already identified as priorities are to be found in section III of the present report.  
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur will actively seek to promote normative clarity around 
</p>
<p>trafficking and to help flesh out the substantive content of key rules and obligations where 
</p>
<p>that is required. That work is expected to result in clear anti-trafficking tools and 
</p>
<p>recommendations, checklists, indicators and benchmarks that are based on existing 
</p>
<p>international standards as recognized in the major human rights treaties as well as the 
</p>
<p>specialist trafficking instruments. To that end, the Special Rapporteur intends to convene 
</p>
<p>consultations and expert group meetings and regular exchanges with a variety of 
</p>
<p>stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Consultation and cooperation  
</b></p>
<p>75. Trafficking in persons is a critical issue for every country, affecting many different 
</p>
<p>groups and cutting across multiple sectors. The range of current and potential stakeholders 
</p>
<p>is accordingly very wide. The Special Rapporteur believes that trafficking will be fought 
</p>
<p>successfully if all stakeholders work in partnership, across borders and across all parts of 
</p>
<p>society. In that regard, she will work together with governments, national rapporteurs and 
</p>
<p>equivalent mechanisms dealing with trafficking in persons, national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions, intergovernmental organizations and specialized agencies, to promote 
</p>
<p>cooperation and concerted action at the international, regional and national levels. She will 
</p>
<p>also enhance cooperation with existing regional, subregional and national anti-trafficking 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, including national coordinating bodies, national rapporteurs or equivalent 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and national human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p>76. In carrying out her mandate, the Special Rapporteur will consult civil society and 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations working to combat trafficking, as well as persons and 
</p>
<p>institutions with particular expertise (such as academia and certain professional categories). 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur will continue to consult and partner with a wide range of national 
</p>
<p>and local organizations, especially during her country visits.  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur will also reach out to the private sector, engaging with 
</p>
<p>businesses and employers in particular, to look out for possibilities for public-private 
</p>
<p>partnerships that will address the demand for cheap labour in the private sector, unethical 
</p>
<p>recruitment practices and other practices relating to the elimination of trafficking in supply 
</p>
<p>chains.  </p>


<p><b> D. Communication with victims 
</b></p>
<p>78. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur  focuses on the rights and needs of victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking and the Special Rapporteur will continue to consult victims and involve them in 
</p>
<p>the work of the mandate. The Special Rapporteur is convinced that the involvement of 
</p>
<p>victims is critical to ensuring that the measures taken to address trafficking benefit those in 
</p>
<p>need; that unintended harmful consequences are anticipated and avoided; and that 
</p>
<p>opportunities for change and improvement are identified in a timely way. 
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur is explicitly mandated to respond effectively to reliable 
</p>
<p>allegations of human rights violations with a view to protecting the rights of actual or 
</p>
<p>potential victims of trafficking. In accordance with established procedure, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur will communicate cases to States, requesting clarification and action.28  
</p>
<p><b> E. Cooperation with United Nations human rights mechanisms and 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations  
</b></p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur intends to work in collaboration with other special 
</p>
<p>procedures mechanisms which examine issues relating to trafficking, including but not 
</p>
<p>limited to: the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants; the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences; the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography; and the 
</p>
<p>Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other 
</p>
<p>business enterprises. The Special Rapporteur will continue to strengthen the work of the 
</p>
<p>trafficking mandate while delineating its intersections with related mandates. In this regard, 
</p>
<p>she will try to identify possible joint initiatives that can complement each other&#8217;s work, 
</p>
<p>such as joint communications on allegations of human rights violations and the issuance of 
</p>
<p>joint press statements. 
</p>
<p>81. In the course of her work the Special Rapporteur intends to strengthen the mandate&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>engagement with relevant treaty bodies29 in order to create synergy to ensure States&#8217; 
</p>
<p>accountability with regard to the issue of trafficking in persons. She will benefit from their 
</p>
<p>expertise and their concluding observations, general comments/recommendations and case 
</p>
<p>law on issues relating to trafficking, to which she also expects to contribute when relevant. 
</p>
<p>She also believes that the universal periodic review contributes to strengthening efforts 
</p>
<p>aimed at combating trafficking in persons as part of a holistic review of a country&#8217;s human 
</p>
<p>rights situation.  
</p>
<p>82. The mandate holder also values cooperation with United Nations agencies, 
</p>
<p>international organizations and existing coordination mechanisms around the world and 
</p>
<p>intends to build on those partnerships to consolidate a collaborative approach to the fight 
</p>
<p>against trafficking.

<p><b> VII. Conclusion  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur looks forward to fulfilling the requirements of her 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandate, as outlined in Human Rights Council resolution 26/8, and to constructive 
</b></p>
<p><b>and fruitful cooperation with diverse stakeholders in all regions of the world. She
