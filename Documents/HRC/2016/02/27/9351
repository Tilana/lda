<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur undertook a visit to Sri Lanka from 1 to 8 October 2007. 
He expresses appreciation to the Government for the full cooperation extended to him. In 
addition to visiting detention facilities in Colombo and the south-west of the country, including 
in Galle, he also visited police stations and prison facilities between Trincomalee and Kandy, in 
the eastern and central parts of the country, respectively. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur has full appreciation for the challenges the Government faces from 
the violent and long-lasting conflict with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). 
Notwithstanding the difficult security situation with which the Government is faced, Sri Lanka in 
principle is still able to uphold its democratic values, to ensure activities of civil society 
organizations and the media, and to maintain an independent judiciary. 
 The Government of Sri Lanka has taken a number of important legal steps in order to 
prevent and combat torture as well as to hold perpetrators accountable. Most notably, the 
enactment of the Torture Act No. 22 of 1994 and the Corporal Punishment Act No. 23 of 2005 
as well as legal safeguards in the Code of Criminal Procedure constitute positive legal measures 
in the fight against torture. The Special Rapporteur is further encouraged by the fact that capital 
punishment has not been carried out in Sri Lanka for more than three decades. The fact that a 
system of Judicial Medical Officers (JMO) is in place in the country is also a positive sign. 
However, the system set up by these measures cannot be regarded as fully effective. 
</p>
<p> The high number of successful fundamental rights cases decided by the Supreme Court of 
Sri Lanka, as well as the even higher number of complaints that the National Human Rights 
Commission (NHRC) continues to receive on an almost daily basis indicates that torture is still 
widely practised in Sri Lanka. Obstacles for victims of torture in accessing Judicial Medical 
Officers result in the loss of important medical evidence, which in turn impedes criminal 
proceedings against perpetrators. The absence of an ex officio obligation on law enforcement 
officials or judges to investigate cases of torture further aggravates the situation for victims. 
In general, the lack of effective witness and victim protection prevents the effective application 
of the laws in place. 
</p>
<p> Over the course of his visits to police stations and prisons, the Special Rapporteur 
received numerous consistent and credible allegations from detainees who reported that they 
were ill-treated by the police during inquiries in order to extract confessions, or to obtain 
information in relation to other criminal offences. Similar allegations were received with respect 
to the army, particularly by suspected LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) members. The 
Special Rapporteur was shocked at the brutality of some of the torture measures applied to 
persons suspected of being LTTE members, such as burnings with soldering irons and 
suspension by the thumbs. With regard to the situation in prisons, the Special Rapporteur, while 
appreciating the recent legal prohibition of corporal punishment in Sri Lanka, is concerned about 
the high number of complaints of corporal punishment, corroborated by medical evidence in 
some prisons. 
</p>
<p> In many of Sri Lanka&#8217;s prisons the combination of severe overcrowding with antiquated 
infrastructure of certain facilities places unbearable strains on services and resources for 
detainees. In particular, the lack of space amounts to degrading treatment in some prisons. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p>With regard to conditions of detention in police stations, the Special Rapporteur observed that 
detainees are locked up in basic cells, often without natural light and sufficient ventilation, and 
sleep on concrete floors. While he is not concerned about such conditions for criminal suspects 
held in police custody for up to 24 hours, these conditions become inhuman for suspects held in 
these cells under the Emergency Regulations for periods of several months up to one year. 
</p>
<p> Under the Emergency Regulations, most of the safeguards against torture either do not 
apply or are simply disregarded, which leads to a situation in which torture becomes a routine 
practice in the context of counter-terrorism operations. The non-applicability of important legal 
safeguards in the context of counter-terrorism measures, as well as excessively prolonged police 
detention, opens up the doors for abuse. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the reported links between the Government and 
the Tamileela Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP)-Karuna group, which were confirmed by the 
representative the Special Rapporteur met in Trincomalee. The TMVP-Karuna group has been 
accused of particularly brutal human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p> Accordingly, on the basis of his findings the Special Rapporteur recommended to the 
Government a number of measures to prevent and combat torture and ill-treatment. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur was invited by the Government of Sri Lanka to undertake a visit to 
the country from 1 to 8 October 2007. 
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the mission was to assess the situation of torture and ill-treatment in the 
country, and to strengthen a process of sustained cooperation with the Government to assist it in 
its efforts to improve the administration of justice. The Special Rapporteur expresses his 
appreciation to the Government for the full cooperation it extended to him. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with government officials, including the Secretary 
of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights, the Minister of 
Justice, the Chief Justice, the Attorney General, the Inspector General of Police, the 
Commissioner General of Prisons, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), the army&#8217;s 
legal adviser on human rights, and the Secretary-General for the Secretariat for Coordinating the 
Peace Process. 
</p>
<p>4. A primary focus of the visit was the inspection of detention facilities in the country, and in 
this regard, the Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation to the Government for the respect 
of the terms of reference for the visit. In particular, he wishes to thank the Inspector General of 
Police and the Commissioner General of Prisons for opening up the prisons and police detention 
facilities without restrictions, including the carrying out of unannounced visits, and enabling him 
to conduct private interviews with detainees. In Colombo and vicinity, the Special Rapporteur 
visited Welikada Prison, Colombo Remand Prison, the New Magazine Prison (Female Ward), 
the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), the Terrorist Investigation Department (TID), 
Mount Lavinia Police Station, Ratmalana Police Post, Panadura South Police Station, and 
Payagala North Police Station. In Galle, he visited the TID detention facility at Boosa. In 
Trincomalee and vicinity, he visited Trincomalee Prison, Trincomalee Police Headquarters 
(including CID), China Bay Police Station, Kantale Police Station, Polonnaruwa Police Station, 
and Polonnaruwa Prison. In and around Kandy, the Special Rapporteur visited Bogambara 
Prison, Katugastota Police Station, and Wattegama Police Station. In Trincomalee, the Special 
Rapporteur also visited a representative of the Tamileela Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP), the 
group which broke away from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2004 under the 
leadership of Vinayagamoorthi Muralitharan, also known as Colonel Karuna Amman. 
</p>
<p>5. During the mission the Special Rapporteur met with a broad range of civil society 
organizations, lawyers, medical professionals, and representatives of international organizations 
(e.g. the United Nations country team, including the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund, the United Nations Population Fund, the World Health Organization), the Sri Lankan 
Monitoring Mission (SLMM), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the 
diplomatic corps. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur shared his preliminary findings with the Government at the close 
of his mission, to which the Government responded with constructive comments. He is pleased 
to report that the Government at that time already indicated that it will appoint a high-level task 
force to study his recommendations, consisting of public sector stakeholders and members 
representing judicial and civil society sectors. On 16 January 2008, a preliminary version of this 
report was sent to the Government. On 20 February, the Government provided comments. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur wishes to acknowledge with appreciation the excellent support 
provided by the United Nations Resident Coordinator, Neil Buhne, and his staff in the 
United Nations country team; the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR); Dr. Derrick Pounder, University of Dundee, United Kingdom; and Julia Kozma and 
Isabelle Tschan of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Particular circumstances of fact-finding in Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p>8. It was the intention of the Special Rapporteur to assess the situation of torture and 
ill-treatment in the entire territory of the country, and to examine not only torture and 
ill-treatment allegedly committed by the police and other security forces of the Government of 
Sri Lanka, but also those allegedly committed by or on behalf of other parties to the present 
conflict, including the LTTE. Indeed the most serious allegations of human rights violations that 
come to light, including those related to torture and ill-treatment, are in relation to the conflict 
and are alleged to be committed by both government and non-State forces, including the LTTE 
and the TMVP-Karuna group. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur established contact with the LTTE in preparation of the 
mission and was in fact provided with an invitation to all areas under LTTE control. From the 
very start of preparations, the Government was supportive of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s objective 
to probe allegations of torture and ill-treatment attributed to the LTTE. However, prior to the 
commencement of the visit, the Government denied him permission to travel to LTTE-controlled 
areas on the basis that the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit there would be used by the LTTE for 
purposes of propaganda. Thus, the Special Rapporteur was not able to speak to detainees under 
the direct control of the LTTE and can therefore not draw any conclusions of the situation 
regarding torture and ill-treatment in these areas. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur also requested the Government to provide him with a letter of 
authorization for detention facilities of the Ministry of Defense. The Government, however, 
maintained the position before and throughout the mission that the Sri Lankan armed forces no 
longer had the authority to detain persons but were obliged to immediately hand over any 
arrested person to the police. As a consequence, the Special Rapporteur was not provided with a 
letter of authorization to visit any facilities of the armed forces. The primary focus of the 
findings of the Special Rapporteur therefore relate to torture, ill-treatment and conditions of 
detention in the ordinary context of the criminal justice system as well as to the treatment of 
suspected members of the LTTE held by the Sri Lankan civilian authorities (police and prison 
administration), including persons held under the Emergency Regulations. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>11. The conditions for independent fact-finding were further impeded by certain instances, 
where detainees were hidden or brought away shortly before the Special Rapporteur arrived.<b>1</b> For 
example, 59 persons out of 110 had been transferred from the Boosa detention facilities on order 
of the director of the Terrorist Investigation Department in the days leading up to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. The situation was aggravated by the fact that the Special Rapporteur received 
the information from the remaining detainees that the transferred persons were those who had 
been most seriously tortured before and still bore marks of the ill-treatment. After the Special 
Rapporteur protested against such obvious attempts to prevent him from talking to persons 
previously detained in Boosa, he was provided with a list of the detainees concerned with 
details of their whereabouts and, in fact, could trace many of these detainees later at TID 
headquarters and the Colombo Remand Prison. At the first visit in TID, the Special Rapporteur 
was informed by detainees that one male detainee had been brought away in order to hide him. 
At his second visit, the Special Rapporteur could meet this detainee, who told him that he was 
forced to lie under a bench in an office until the Special Rapporteur had left the facility.
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  By letter dated 20 February 2008, the Government stated: [T]he allegations made are of a 
</p>
<p>potentially serious nature and confirmation of the facts on which the allegations are based are yet 
to be conclusively clarified. The [Special Rapporteur] states that some detainees were &#8220;hidden&#8221; 
or &#8220;brought away&#8221; from Boosa detention facility to presumably avoid exposure to him and then, 
in the same paragraph, states that he &#8220;in fact, could trace many of these detainees later at TID 
headquarters and the Colombo Remand Prison&#8221;. The fact that the [Special Rapporteur] could 
trace the whereabouts of these detainees (albeit at a later time - see paragraph 72) is sufficiently 
indicative that they were being processed by the criminal justice system and were not being 
deliberately prevented from meeting the [Special Rapporteur]. The [Special Rapporteur] goes on 
to cite only one case at the Terrorist Investigation Division where a detainee was supposedly 
concealed during an initial visit and, on the second visit of the [Special Rapporteur], met the 
[Special Rapporteur] and said that he was instructed to hide &#8220;under a bench&#8221; until the [Special 
Rapporteur]&#8217;s initial visit was concluded. Even this detainee therefore was not permanently 
&#8220;hidden&#8221; from the [Special Rapporteur]. The other comments of the [Special Rapporteur] 
relating to detainees in Mount Lavinia being kept in a bus until his visit was over is questionable, 
since the police officers of individual police stations were unaware of the [Special Rapporteur]&#8217;s 
movements and would be unable to predict with certainty when (or if) the [Special Rapporteur] 
would visit their stations. A comment is made to the effect that the detainees in question were 
taken to an &#8220;unknown place believed to be Ratmalana Police Post shortly upon arrival of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8221; and returned to the place of detention after the [Special Rapporteur]&#8217;s visit. 
No interview with these four detainees at any time is indicated and no source for the information 
is identified. No assertion is made as to these detainees showing any signs of ill-treatment or 
complaining of such treatment. The reported incidents at Bogambara Prison have resulted in a 
preliminary disciplinary inquiry being conducted against the officer concerned and formal 
charges are to be proffered against that officer by the Prisons Department. Further clarification is 
being sought from TID as to the reasons for the movement of detainees during the period of the 
[Special Rapporteur]&#8217;s visit. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>Other detainees told him that they were kept in a bus outside the facilities during the first visit. 
Also, in Mount Lavinia Police Station four detainees were brought away on the morning of the 
visit of the Special Rapporteur and were later brought back when he had left. In Bogambara 
prison, detainees reported that two prisoners with serious injuries resulting from corporal 
punishment they had been subjected to had been transferred to other prisons. The Special 
Rapporteur was able to find one of these prisoners later in Welikada prison and could satisfy 
himself of the accuracy of the allegations. 
</p>
<p>12. After having received many allegations of serious human rights violations, among them 
torture and ill-treatment, by the TMVP-Karuna group, in particular in the East of the country, the 
Special Rapporteur visited an office of the TMVP in Trincomalee. There, a representative told 
him that until six months ago the group had indeed taken persons into custody for questioning 
for approximately two days. At the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur the representative 
assured that the TMVP was only conducting political activities and did not detain persons 
anymore. The representative showed the Special Rapporteur an identity card issued by the 
TMVP, which was officially recognized by the police and armed forces. He explained that, in the 
case of any problem arising between the authorities and a member of the TMVP, the member 
concerned only had to show this identity card to solve the problem.<b>2</b> In particular, according to 
the representative, TMVP personnel were immune from arrest and searches.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>B. Context and challenges in the promotion and protection of 
human rights: the conflict 
</b></p>
<p>13. At the outset, the Special Rapporteur states that he has full appreciation for the challenges 
that the Government faces from the violent and long-lasting conflict with the LTTE. 
Notwithstanding the difficult security situation the Government is faced with, Sri Lanka in 
principle is still able to uphold its democratic values, ensure activities of civil society 
organizations and media, and maintain an independent judiciary. At the same time, it remains 
true that humanitarian and human rights law absolutely prohibit the use of torture or other forms 
of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>14. The LTTE began fighting the Government of Sri Lanka with the aim of establishing an 
independent State of Tamil Eelam in the north and east of the country in the late 1970s. 
From 1983 on, an intense armed conflict between the separatist group and governmental forces 
has taken place. In February 2002, under Norwegian mediation, the Government entered into
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  The Government reported that, in relation to the TMVP representative&#8217;s alleged statements, 
</p>
<p>the Government reiterates that it is not responsible for exaggerated claims by members of 
political groups relating to their supposed or assumed status and emphasizes that no persons 
carrying arms are accorded special privileges nor granted any special facilities by lawfully 
constituted authorities. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>a ceasefire agreement (CFA) with the LTTE. Despite the CFA, fighting carried on, and after 
resuming control over the Jaffna Peninsula, government forces in 2007 also regained control 
over the eastern provinces, which had been under LTTE control. The Vanni area in the north of 
the country is, however, still under the overall control of the LTTE. 
</p>
<p>15. On 2 November 2007, S.P. Thamilselvan, the head of the LTTE&#8217;s political wing and 
representative in negotiations for the LTTE, was killed in an air raid. A few weeks later, a bomb 
attack in Colombo attributed to the LTTE cost the lives of 21 civilians. In the aftermath of 
this attack, government forces arrested more than 2,200 Tamils, of which 2,000 were released in 
the following days. Another blast carried out in Colombo killed four members of the Sri Lankan 
army. 
</p>
<p>16. It is widely reported that, during the battles over control of the east, government forces 
made tactical use of the TMVP-Karuna group. Consisting of approximately one quarter of the 
former LTTE cadres, the Karuna group has conducted many ambushes and killings of LTTE 
cadres, political representatives and supporters. It is also considered responsible for abductions, 
torture and killings of civilians and has established a reign of terror over a large part of the 
civilian population living in the eastern provinces. Reliable sources told the Special Rapporteur 
that no police action was taken against members of the TMVP-Karuna group, which was later 
confirmed by a TMVP representative. Meanwhile, Colonel Karuna was arrested in London and 
sentenced on 25 January 2008 to nine months&#8217; imprisonment for possession of a false passport. 
There are calls for his prosecution under universal jurisdiction for war crimes, including 
recruitment of child soldiers, summary executions, and torture.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>17. In January 2008, the Government formally withdrew from the CFA following a number of 
recent bomb attacks, part of a series of incidents causing numerous civilian and military 
casualties attributed to the LTTE. Even before this withdrawal, with the CFA still in force, the 
monitoring mechanism established under it, SLMM, reported numerous violations of the 
agreement on both sides.<b>4</b> The SLMM subsequently terminated its monitoring operations 
on 16 January 2008. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  The Government invited the Special Rapporteur to direct his attention to the conditions of 
</p>
<p>detention in the British maximum-security facility in which Colonel Karuna is currently 
detained. It reported that the presence of several LTTE suspects in close proximity to this 
individual have, according to news reports, given rise to allegations of mistreatment and torture 
there. The Government invited the Special Rapporteur to consider inquiring into the 
circumstances of his detention in such a hazardous environment. 
<b>4
</b>  The Government reported that the SLMM (during its mandated term of office) reported a 
</p>
<p>number of violations of the CFA by members of the LTTE which was several times the number 
of violations said to have been committed by the Government or its armed services. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK  
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International level  
</b></p>
<p>18. Sri Lanka is party to the major United Nations human rights treaties prohibiting torture and 
ill-treatment: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and Punishment (CAT); 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women <b>(</b>CEDAW); 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD); 
and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). 
</p>
<p>19. Sri Lanka has acceded to the first Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights<b>5</b> and it ratified the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in 
armed conflict. However, Sri Lanka has not signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture, nor has it recognized the competence of the Committee against Torture to 
receive communications from other States parties as well as from or on behalf of individuals 
under the respective articles 21 and 22 of the Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>20. Sri Lanka is a party to the Geneva Conventions of 1949. It has, however, not ratified the 
Additional Protocols to the Conventions, nor has it signed the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>21. Sri Lanka was the subject of a confidential inquiry by the Committee against Torture under 
article 20 of the Convention against Torture from April 1999 to May 2002. The Committee 
concluded on the basis of a visit of two Committee members to Sri Lanka in August 2000 that, 
although torture is frequently resorted to by the police, the army and paramilitaries, the practice 
of torture in Sri Lanka was not of a systematic nature<i>.</i> Following the recommendations, the 
Government of Sri Lanka appointed a permanent Inter-Ministerial Standing Committee and 
Inter-Ministerial Working Group on Human Rights Issues mandated to monitor action taken by 
government agencies relating to incidents/allegations of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  National level 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Constitutional protection of human rights, including 
the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p>22. Chapter III of the Constitution contains a set of fundamental rights and freedoms such as 
freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention, 
punishment, freedom of speech, assembly, association, movement as well as the right to equality. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  However, in its judgement in <i>Nallaratnam Singarasa v. Attorney General</i> (SC (Spl) L.A. 
</p>
<p>No. 182/99) of 15 September 2006, the Supreme Court ruled that accession to the ICCPR 
Optional Protocol was unconstitutional. This seems to have posed direct obstacles to the 
campaign for the ratification of OPCAT. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p>23. The prohibition of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is provided in 
article 11: &#8220;No person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; Article 15 prohibits any limitation of this right in times of public emergency. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Provisions in legislation criminalizing torture 
</b></p>
<p>24. Sri Lanka applies a dualist legal system and has implemented the criminal law provisions 
of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment by Act No. 22 of 1994. Torture is defined under its article 12 as: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;any act which causes severe pain, whether physical or mental, to any other person, being 
an act, which is 
</p>
<p> (a) Done for any of the following purposes that is to say 
</p>
<p>(i) Obtaining from such other person or a third person, any information or 
confession; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Punishing such other person for any act which he or a third person has 
committed, or is suspected of having committed; or 
</p>
<p>(iii) Intimidating or coercing such other person or a third person; 
</p>
<p>or done for any reason based on discrimination, 
</p>
<p>and being in every case, an act which is done by, or at the instigation of, or with the 
consent or acquiescence of, a public officer or other person acting in an official capacity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur notes that the definition in article 12 is in conformity with 
definition of article 1 of CAT; however, it does not expressly include &#8220;suffering&#8221;. Acts of 
torture, as well as participation, complicity, aid and abetment, incitement and the attempt 
to torture are punishable under the Anti-Torture Act.<b>6</b> Penalties range from mandatory 7 
to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 to 50,000 rupees (US$ 100-500).<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>26. Article 2, paragraph 5, states that any offence under the Act shall be a &#8220;cognizable and 
non-bailable offence&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>27. Article 3 of the Act specifically denies the defence of exceptional circumstances such as 
the state or threat of war, internal political instability, public emergency as well as the order of a 
superior officer or a public authority against charges of torture.  
</p>
<p>28. Articles 7 to 10 of the Act contain provisions regarding universal jurisdiction in conformity 
with the Convention against Torture. 
</p>

</b>  Article 2 (4) of Act No. 22. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.6

</p>
<p>29. In addition, the Sri Lankan Penal Code, in articles 321 and 322, criminalizes acts which 
may fall within the scope of the Convention against Torture, such as intentionally causing harm 
or grievous harm with the aim to extort confessions or information leading to the detection of an 
offence or misconduct or to compel restoration of the property. These offences are punishable 
with a maximum of 10 years&#8217; imprisonment and a fine. Explanatory so-called &#8220;illustrations&#8221; to 
article 321 describe torture cases. For example: &#8220;(a) A, a police officer, tortures Z in order to 
induce Z to confess that he committed a crime. A is guilty of an offence under this 
section. (b) A, a police officer, tortures B to induce him to point out where certain stolen 
property is deposited. A is guilty of an offence under this section&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>30. Further, article 364 (2) of the Penal Code outlaws rape of a woman in custody (including in 
a remand home and a women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s institution) and foresees punishment of 
10 to 20 years&#8217; imprisonment and a fine. In addition, the perpetrator shall be ordered to pay 
compensation to the victim for injuries caused. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Safeguards against torture and ill-treatment during arrest and detention 
</b></p>
<p>31. Article 13 of the Constitution foresees a number of fundamental safeguards, such as 
freedom from arbitrary arrest (art. 13 (1)) and the right to be informed of the reasons for arrest. 
Article 13 (2) stipulates that &#8220;every person held in custody, detained or otherwise deprived of 
personal liberty shall be brought before the judge of the nearest competent court according to the 
procedure established by law, and shall not be further held in custody, detained or deprived of 
personal liberty except upon and in terms of the order of such judge made in accordance with the 
procedure established by law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>32. Article 15 of the Constitution provides for the possibility of restriction of the safeguards 
and rights granted by the above-mentioned provisions in the interest of national security, public 
order and the protection of public health or morality. 
</p>
<p>33. There are a number of provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP) which 
potentially safeguard the integrity of a person arrested or detained: the legal time limit of police 
custody of 24 hours, excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the 
Magistrate (article 37 of CCP and article 65 of the Police Ordinance); the requirement to 
maintain an &#8220;Information Book&#8221;, including the file, by the Criminal Investigation Department 
and any bureau of investigation for the purpose of recording statements; the obligation of the 
officer in charge of the police station who is responsible for the Information Book to furnish 
three certified copies of all notes resulting from the investigation and of all statements recorded 
in the course of the investigation to the Magistrate (art. 147, CCP). 
</p>
<p>34. Other potential safeguards are: the notification of the Magistrate&#8217;s Court of arrests of 
persons without warrant by any police officer (including information whether persons have been 
admitted bail or otherwise, art. 38, CCP); informing the arrested persons of the reason for arrest 
(with a right for the arrested person to see the arrest warrant if so requested, art. 53, CCP). 
</p>
<p>35. Where an officer in charge of a police station &#8220;considers that the examination of any 
person by a medical practitioner is necessary for the conduct of an investigation&#8221;, he can order 
such examination by a governmental medical officer (art. 122 (1), CCP). </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p>36. However, the Code lacks fundamental safeguards<b>8</b> such as the right to inform a family 
member of the arrest or the access to a lawyer and/or a doctor of his or her choice for a person 
arrested and held in custody. The code does not specify the interrogation conditions and is silent 
about the possibility of the presence of a lawyer and an interpreter during the interrogation. 
</p>
<p>37. With respect to arrest and detention by the armed forces, the Special Rapporteur notes the 
six-clause Presidential Directive of 7 July 2006, on Protecting Fundamental Rights of Persons 
Arrested and/or Detained, which was re-circulated by the Secretary of Defence on 12 April 2007 
to the commanders of the army, navy and air force as well as the Inspector General of Police. 
Among the provisions included are: no person shall be arrested or detained under any 
Emergency Regulation or the Prevention of Terrorism Act No. 48 of 1979, except in accordance 
with the law and proper procedure and by a person who is authorized by law to make such an 
arrest or order such detention; the person making the arrest or detention should identify himself 
by name and rank, to the person or relative or friend of the person to be arrested; the person to be 
arrested should be informed of the reason for the arrest; all details of the arrest should be 
documented in the manner specified by the Ministry of Defence; the person being arrested 
should be allowed to make contact with family or friends to inform them of his whereabouts; 
when a child under 18 years or a woman is being arrested or detained, a person of their choice 
should be allowed to accompany them to the place of questioning; as far as possible, any such 
child or woman arrested or detained should be placed in the custody of a Women&#8217;s Unit of the 
Armed Forces or Police or in the custody of another woman military or police officer; the person 
arrested or detained should be allowed to make a statement in the language of his choice and 
then asked to sign the statement; if he wishes to make a statement in his own handwriting it 
should be permitted; members of the NHRC or anyone authorized by it must be given access to 
the arrested or detained person and should be permitted to enter at any time, any place of 
detention, police station or any other place in which such a person is confined; and the NHRC 
must be informed within 48 hours of any arrest or detention and the place the person is being 
detained. 
</p>
<p><b>Forensic examination 
</b></p>
<p>38. The CCP provides for the possibility for a Magistrate or an investigator empowered by 
the Minister to order a post-mortem examination (also in the case the body is already buried, 
art. 373, CCP). Further, a person in police detention can complain to the Magistrate and ask for a 
medical examination by a Judicial Medical Officer (JMO), a specially trained medical doctor of 
the Department of Forensic Medicine. The Magistrate may subsequently order the police to take 
the victim to the JMO. However, the Special Rapporteur found a serious shortcoming in this 
procedure: since in most cases the victim is accompanied to the JMO by exactly the same police 
officer who is responsible for the alleged crime of torture or ill-treatment, the independence of
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  For a comprehensive outline of such safeguards against torture see the general 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on torture, E/CN.4/2003/68, para. 26. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>the examination is jeopardized.<b>9</b> Also, the access to a JMO is not guaranteed and in many 
instances the alleged victim is brought before an ordinary medical doctor not trained in forensic 
medicine. 
</p>
<p>39. The medical personnel in various prisons acknowledged that they received on a regular 
basis allegations of torture and other forms of ill-treatment by persons who are transferred from 
police stations to the prisons. In many cases, these complaints are corroborated by physical 
evidence, such as scars and haematomas. However, the medical personnel only feels responsible 
for treating obvious wounds and does not take any further action, like reporting the alleged abuse 
to the authorities or sending the victim to a JMO. The Special Rapporteur notes that the 
Government will take steps to initiate a process through the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice 
to inform medical officers to report to the special unit of police and the NHRC instances where 
probable cases of torture are discovered. 
</p>
<p><b>Confessions 
</b></p>
<p>40. Articles 24 to 27 of the Evidence Ordinance (EO) do not allow confessions in court that 
were extracted through torture. In addition, ordinary law provides that a confession made to a 
police officer or to another person while in police custody is inadmissible before the courts. 
This rule, however, is not applicable to persons detained under Emergency Regulations. 
</p>
<p><b>Emergency Regulations 
</b></p>
<p>41. Article 155 of the Constitution and the Public Security Ordinance (PSO No. 25 of 1947) 
allow the President to declare a state of emergency. 
</p>
<p>42. For three decades, emergency rule has continued between intervals in Sri Lanka. The 
Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) of 1979 was suspended in 2002 after the CFA was agreed 
upon. However, the law is still in force and its section 9 (1), allowing to detain a person under 
detention order (DO) for a period of  &#8220;three months in the first instance, in such place and subject 
to such conditions as may be determined by the Minister&#8221;, renewable to a maximum 
of 18 months, still applies. Although the CFA provided for the temporary suspension of the PTA, 
throughout this time many provisions of the PTA were reintroduced under the Emergency 
Regulations and now that the CFA has been abrogated, the temporary suspension of the PTA has 
been repealed. 
</p>
<p>43. New Emergency Regulations (ER, or Emergency Miscellaneous Provisions and Powers 
Regulations, EMPPR) were imposed on 14 August 2005 by then President Kumaratunga after 
the assassination of Foreign Minister Kardirgamar.<b>10</b> They are drawn from the PTA and allow 
detention without charge for 90 days. This term is renewable for up to one year. Suspects can

</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  The Government reported that it is generally the practice of JMOs to request that 
</p>
<p>accompanying police officers remain outside the examination area/room. 
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  The ER must be approved by the parliament within 14 days and extension requires 
parliamentary clearance every month. </p>

 page 15 
 
</p>
<p>also be held by security forces for up to a year under &#8220;preventive detention&#8221; orders issued by the 
defence secretary (section 17). A suspect detained under the ER must not be produced before a 
magistrate for up to 30 days. Not only police officers and soldiers, but also so-called &#8220;public 
officers&#8221; and those specifically authorized by the President may make arrests under the ER. In 
addition, the ER allow joint operations of arrest between the army and the police without 
clarifying the respective responsibilities of these two forces (sect. 19). 
</p>
<p>44. Under the Regulations, the authorities may dispose of bodies without public notification 
(sect. 56). The deputy inspector-general of the police has the authority to cremate bodies and 
thereby destroy potential evidence of torture or CIDT. 
</p>
<p>45. Contrary to sections 24 to 26 of the Evidence Ordinance, under the ER, confessions to 
senior police officers may also be used as evidence in court.  
</p>
<p>46. On 6 December 2006, President Rajapaksa promulgated an additional set of ER,<b>11</b> 
reinstating certain provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which had been suspended as 
part of the 2002 ceasefire accord. Regulation 19 contains an immunity clause for any 
government official<b>12</b> for any action under the regulations, provided that such a person has acted 
in good faith and in the discharge of his official duties.  
</p>
<p><b>Safeguards under the Emergency Regulations 
</b></p>
<p>47. Persons arrested by the army must be turned over to the police within 24 hours (sect. 19) 
and their family must be provided with an arrest notification acknowledging custody. The NHRC 
must be informed of all detentions under the ER within 48 hours and has legal authority to visit 
detainees wherever they are held. This rule was confirmed by the Presidential Directives on 
Protecting Fundamental Rights of Persons Arrested and/or Detained, issued in July 2006 and 
recirculated in April 2007, providing for access to the NHRC to arrested and detained persons 
and therefore to any place of detention (see also safeguards, paragraph 37 above). 
</p>
<p>48. During his mission the Special Rapporteur was informed that the NHRC is keeping a 
confidential database registering the arrests under the Emergency Regulations. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Complaints and investigations of acts of torture 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Complaints 
</b>49. There are several avenues to seek justice for victims of torture and ill-treatment. 
50. Jurisdiction for offences under the Anti-Torture Act No. 22 lies with the High Court. 
In this regard complaints have to be addressed to the Attorney General&#8217;s (AG) Department. 
Upon instruction of the AG the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) under the supervision of the 
Inspector General of the Police (IGP) conducts the investigations. The Prosecution of Torture

</p>
<p>Perpetrators Unit (PTP), established pursuant to the recommendations of the United Nations 
Committee against Torture, monitors the work of the SIU and the Criminal Investigation 
Department (CID), and is also in charge of investigation of torture cases. The Attorney General&#8217;s 
Department decides on the indictment of alleged offenders on the basis of files submitted by the 
SIU and PTP. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the significant number of indictments, 34, made 
by the Attorney General. While appreciating that the conviction of offenders is entirely a matter 
for the courts, before which evidence must be led and prosecutions carried out according to law, 
he regrets that the indictments by the Attorney General have lead so far only to three convictions. 
He notes that eight cases were concluded with acquittals. Further, the Special Rapporteur is 
concerned about the long duration of investigation with regard to these cases of often more than 
two years and allegations of threats against complainants and torture victims. 
</p>
<p>52. The Attorney General&#8217;s powers have so far not been used to prosecute any officer for 
torture above the rank of inspector of police and no indictment was filed on the basis of 
command responsibility.<b>13</b>  
</p>
<p>53. Victims of torture or ill-treatment may also file a criminal action before a Magistrate&#8217;s 
Court against an alleged torturer for &#8220;voluntarily causing hurt&#8221; under article 136 (1) (a) of CCP, 
provided that the police have not filed an action under articles 122 (1), (2), 124, and 137 CCP. 
</p>
<p>54. Torture victims may also submit a complaint to the Supreme Court for a violation of 
article 11 of the Constitution within 30 days of the infringement in order to be awarded 
compensation. 
</p>
<p>55. In general, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern the absence of an effective ex officio 
investigation mechanism in accordance with article 12 of the Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p><b>National Police Commission 
</b></p>
<p>56. The National Police Commission, created by the 17th amendment of the Constitution 
under article 155 (a) in 2001, then appointed in 2002, is in charge of disciplinary control over all 
officers except the Inspector General (art. 155, G (1) (a)) and has also the duty to establish a 
public complaints procedure (art. 155, G (2)<b>14</b>). However, this procedure has been established 
only in January 2007 and therefore no conclusions can be drawn yet with regard to its 
implementation in practice.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>13
</b>  The Government reported that Sri Lanka&#8217;s case law clearly indicates that, for criminal 
</p>
<p>liability to attach to someone, there must be criminal intent (<i>mens rea</i>) and a clear nexus with the 
criminal act. 
<b>14
</b></p>
<p>  It &#8220;shall establish procedures to entertain and investigate public complaints and complaints 
from any aggrieved person made against a police officer or the police service&#8221;. 
<b>15
</b></p>
<p>  Before this date, the NPC, in practice, delegated the investigations leading to possible 
disciplinary action against any offending officer to the police. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur notes that the legitimacy and credibility of the NPC has been 
questioned because of the 2006 presidential appointments of the Commissioners, in a manner 
similar to the appointments to the NCHR (see below). 
</p>
<p>58. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) was given the mandate by the Inspector 
General of the Police (IGP) to handle all criminal investigations into complaints of alleged 
torture, other than complaints relating to allegations against CID officers. However, complaints 
of torture recorded at police stations are first referred to the Assistant Superintendent of Police 
(ASP) or the Superintendent of Police (SP) of the relevant area. The legal division of the police 
refers them to the IGP who refers them to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), under his 
command. The SIU is also handling allegations of torture referred to the Government by the 
NHRC, NGOs and the Special Rapporteur on Torture in his communications and regularly 
provides the Special Rapporteur with clarifications and updates. Apart from the SIU, senior 
police officers with regional command responsibilities also conduct inquiries into torture 
allegations. 
</p>
<p><b>National Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>59. The NHRC, created in 1997, is empowered to conduct investigations into complaints of 
violation of fundamental rights, such as violations of article 11 of the Constitution prohibiting 
torture (art. 14 of Establishment Act No. 21). Subsequently, the NHRC can refer the matter for 
reconciliation or mediation. In case this procedure fails, the NHRC may recommend initiating a 
prosecution of the perpetrator. However, lacking the capacity to conduct detailed criminal 
investigations into complaints of torture, the NHRC can only make recommendations and is not 
empowered to approach courts directly. 
</p>
<p>60. According to representatives of the NHRC, the Commission received a total 
of 405 complaints of torture in the first nine months of 2007. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur notes a regrettable development related to independent 
human rights monitoring in Sri Lanka with the downgrading in October 2007 of the NHRC by 
the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights (ICC). In its report,<b>16</b> the ICC&#8217;s Sub-Committee on 
Accreditation expressed concern about the independence of the Commissioners, in view of 
the 2006 presidential appointments, which were done without the recommendation of the 
Constitutional Council, as prescribed in Sri Lanka law. It further questioned whether the actual 
practice of the Commission remained balanced, objective and non-political, particularly with 
regard to the discontinuation of follow-up to 2,000 cases of disappearances in July 2006. The 
Sub-Committee noted that the NHRC did not take measures to ensure its independent character 
and political objectivity, and it failed to issue annual reports on human rights, as required by the 
Paris Principles. The Sub-Committee, also noting the importance for national human rights

</p>
<p>institutions to maintain consistent relationships with civil society, stated that the appointment 
process caused civil society in Sri Lanka to question the constitutionality of the NHRC, thereby 
affecting its credibility. 
</p>
<p>62. The Government reported that the direct appointment by the President of the 
Commissioners was compelled by circumstances in which the Constitutional Council was not 
validly constituted and thus could not make any valid recommendations. The President also 
holds the residual power of appointment in the event of any such consultative forum not being in 
existence. The non-establishment of the Constitutional Council was not due to any fault on the 
part of the President or the Government but, rather, to a weakness in the legal provisions. The 
issue is now being addressed, reports the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Compensation 
</b></p>
<p>63. Article 17 of the Constitution entitles every person to a remedy for the infringement of 
fundamental rights by State action. Furthermore, article 126 (2) states that &#8220;any person [who] 
alleges that any such fundamental right &#8230; has been infringed &#8230; may &#8230; apply to the 
Supreme Court &#8230; praying for relief or redress in respect of such infringement&#8221;. In granting 
relief, the Supreme Court has construed the relevant constitutional provisions as containing a 
right to compensation.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>64. The Supreme Court has in its jurisprudence interpreted torture as &#8220;any act by which severe 
pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person by a public 
official acting in the discharge of his executive or administrative duties or under colour of office 
for such purposes as obtaining from the victim or a third person a confession or information, 
imposing a penalty on the victim &#8230; or coercing the victim or third person to do or refrain doing 
something&#8221;. <b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>65. The Government reported that Sri Lankan jurisprudence provides that a torture victim may 
not only claim for the harm suffered but also, according to the Supreme Court, claim for future 
medical expenses. These expenditures may be charged to the State. In recent years, the

</b>  <i>Saman v. Leeladasa and Another</i>, S.C. Application No. 4/88, 6 and 7 October 1988:

<p>Per Fernando, J.: &#8220;An impairment of personality - the violation of those interests which 
every man has, as a matter of natural right, in the possession of an unimpaired person, dignity 
and reputation, and whether it be a public or private right - committed with wrongful intent 
established liability in the <i>actio injuriarum</i>; patrimonial loss, as well as damages for mental pain, 
suffering and distress can be recovered. When the Constitution recognized the right set out in 
article 11, even if it was a totally new right, these principles of the common law applied, and the 
wrongdoer who violated that right became liable, and his master too, if the wrong was committed 
in the course of employment. It was not necessary for a new delict to be created by statute or 
judicial decision.&#8221; Per Amerasinghe, J.: &#8220;Our Court has preferred to treat a violation of a 
Fundamental Right as something <i>sui generis </i>created by the Constitution and not as a delict.&#8221;

</p>
<p>Supreme Court has held that both the State and individual perpetrators may be liable to pay 
compensation to the victim. In awarding and calculating compensation, the Supreme Court has 
taken into consideration the gravity of the injuries, the methods of torture employed and the 
harm caused. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the far-reaching jurisprudence of the 
Supreme Court with regard to violations of article 11 of the Constitution. Given the high 
standards of proof applied by the Supreme Court in these torture-related cases it is highly 
regrettable that the facts established do not trigger more convictions by criminal courts.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>66. In Sri Lanka, compensation cannot be claimed as part of criminal proceedings. However, 
in cases related to article 321, PC (&#8220;intentionally causing harm&#8221;), Magistrate Courts may award 
compensation to be paid by the offender when the Court refrains from imposing a prison 
sentence or from a proceeding to conviction (art. 17 (4), CCP). 
</p>
<p>67. A rape victim may obtain compensation from the offender according to the provisions 
stipulated in the Penal Code Amendment Act No. 22 of 1995. 
</p>
<p>68. Under Civil Law (Civil Procedure Code) torture victims or relatives of torture victims can 
also bring a damages claim before the District Court for pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses 
incurred as a result of torture against an individual. 
</p>
<p>69. The NHRC may recommend a compensation for a victim of torture or, in case of death, his 
or her relative to be paid by the police or army officer (art. 15 (3) (c) of the Establishment Act). 
</p>
<p><b>II.  THE SITUATION OF TORTURE AND ILL-TREATMENT 
</b></p>
<p>70. In the opinion of the Special Rapporteur, the high number of indictments for torture filed 
by the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, the number of successful fundamental rights cases decided by 
the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, as well as the high number of complaints that the NHRC 
continues to receive on an almost daily basis are a clear indication that torture is widely 
practised in Sri Lanka.<b>20</b> During his visits to places of detention in various parts of the country,
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>19
</b>  The Government reported that there are two principal standards of proof that are operational 
</p>
<p>in Sri Lanka: proof as to the balance/preponderance of probabilities (civil standard); and proof 
beyond a reasonable doubt (criminal standard). According to the Government, in the so-called 
&#8220;Fundamental Rights&#8221; cases, the Supreme Court decides on the basis of documentary evidence 
and oral pleadings and applies the civil standard. However, for a criminal conviction to be 
upheld, the court must be satisfied that the offence (including torture) is proved beyond a 
reasonable doubt - a much higher standard of proof. In fundamental rights cases the liability is 
primarily on the State whereas in criminal cases penal sanctions are imposed against the 
individual (most often involving deprivation of liberty). 
<b>20
</b></p>
<p>  The Government notes the clarification made by the Special Rapporteur during the debriefing 
session with the Government on 8 October 2007, wherein he stated that what he meant by the 
term &#8220;widely practised&#8221; was that he encountered instances of probable torture in several diverse 
locations and not as a systematic practice. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.6

</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur received only a comparatively low number of allegations of torture from 
detainees suspected of ordinary crimes. But, in the context of detention orders under the 
Emergency Regulations and in particular with respect to LTTE suspects, the clear majority of all 
detainees interviewed by the Special Rapporteur complained about a broad variety of  methods 
of torture, some extremely brutal. In many cases, these allegations were corroborated by forensic 
evidence. The considerable number of clearly established cases of torture by TID and other 
security forces, together with various efforts by TID to hide evidence and to obstruct the 
investigations of the Special Rapporteur, leads him to the conclusion that torture has become a 
routine practice in the context of counter-terrorism operations, both by the police and the armed 
forces. 
</p>
<p>71. Methods of torture reported included beating with various weapons, beating on the soles of 
the feet (<i>falaqa</i>), blows to the ears (<i>telephono</i>), positional abuse when handcuffed or bound, 
suspension in various positions, including <i>strappado</i>, &#8220;butchery&#8221;, &#8220;reversed butchery&#8221; and 
&#8220;parrot&#8217;s perch&#8221; (or <i>dharma chakara</i>), burning with metal objects and cigarettes, asphyxiation 
with plastic bags with chilli pepper or gasoline, and various forms of genital torture.<b>21</b> This array 
of torture finds its fullest manifestation at the TID detention facility in Boosa. The Special 
Rapporteur is also shocked by the brutality of some of the torture measures applied to persons 
suspected of being LTTE members, such as burnings with soldering irons and suspension by the 
thumbs. The latter method was allegedly applied by the army. 
</p>
<p>72. As reported above, the Special Rapporteur found out that more than half of the detainees of 
the Boosa detention facility had been either liberated or brought to other places of detention, 
such as TID in Colombo and the Colombo Remand Prison, in the days preceding his visit. In 
interviews with the remaining detainees, the Special Rapporteur learned that the transferred 
detainees were those who had been most seriously tortured previously and still bore marks of the 
ill-treatment. In an effort to trace the persons concerned, the Special Rapporteur received a list 
from the Director of TID in Colombo, indicating where the transferred detainees could be 
found. The Special Rapporteur later visited Colombo Remand Prison and TID in Colombo a 
second time and spoke with a number of the detainees concerned (see appendix). 
</p>
<p>73. Intimidation of victims by police officers to cause them to refrain from making complaints 
was commonly reported, as were allegations of threats of further violence, or threatening to 
fabricate criminal cases of possession of narcotics or dangerous weapons. Detainees regularly 
reported that habeas corpus hearings before a magistrate either involved no real opportunity to 
complain about police torture given that they were often escorted to courts by the very same 
perpetrators, or that the magistrate did not inquire into whether the suspect was mistreated in 
custody. Medical examinations were frequently alleged to take place in the presence of the 
perpetrators, or directed to junior doctors with little experience in the documentation of injuries. 
</p>

<p> A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p><b>Accountability and prevention 
</b></p>
<p>74. In general, the Special Rapporteur notes that Sri Lanka already has many of the elements in 
place necessary both to prevent torture and combat impunity, such as fundamental rights 
complaints before the Supreme Court in relation to article 11 of the Constitution, indictments and 
prosecutions based on the 1994 Convention against Torture Act, bringing suspects before 
magistrates within the statutory 24-hour period, formal legal medical examinations by trained 
forensic experts (Judicial Medical Officers), and investigations and visits by the NHRC. 
</p>
<p>75. The commitment of the Government to fight torture is also demonstrated by the 
establishment of mechanisms by the Inspector General of Police and the Attorney General&#8217;s 
Office specifically to investigate allegations of torture (e.g. the Special Investigations Unit and 
the Prosecution of Torture Perpetrators Unit). Moreover, with respect to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
mandate, the Government regularly continues to provide clarifications and updates with regard to 
communications related to such violations. 
</p>
<p>76. However, a number of shortcomings remain and, most significantly, the absence of an 
independent and effective preventive mechanism mandated to make regular and unannounced 
visits to all places of detention throughout the country at any time, to conduct private interviews 
with detainees, and to subject them to thorough independent medical examinations. It is the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s conviction that this is the most effective way of preventing torture. In the 
case of Sri Lanka, he is not satisfied that visits undertaken by existing mechanisms, such as the 
NHRC, are presently fulfilling this role, or carrying out this level of scrutiny. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur welcomes information from the Government that it intends to establish an 
inter-agency body to study possible modalities and mechanisms to undertake visits to places of 
detention and also to strengthen the capacities and efficacy of the NHRC in this connection. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur appreciates that, by enacting the 1994 Torture Act, the 
Government has implemented its obligation to criminalize torture and bring perpetrators to 
justice. He is also encouraged by the significant number of indictments, 34, filed by the 
Attorney General under this Act. However, he regrets that these indictments have led so far only 
to three convictions. One of the factors influencing this outcome is reportedly because of the 
Torture Act&#8217;s high mandatory minimum sentence of seven years; it is effectively a disincentive 
to apply against perpetrators. Other factors are the absence of effective ex officio investigation 
mechanisms in accordance with article 12 of the Convention against Torture, as well as various 
obstacles detainees face in filing complaints and gaining access to independent medical 
examinations while still detained. 
</p>
<p>78. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur notes with great concern that many of the legal 
safeguards contained in the CCP do not apply in cases of detention under the Emergency 
Regulations. The absence of such safeguards is a logical explanation for the considerably higher 
risk for suspected LTTE members to become victims of torture. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>79. Although many victims of torture in Sri Lanka are provided with compensation in 
article 11 cases by the Supreme Court, these cases are not taken up for criminal procedure. 
According to the Attorney General, the reason for this discrepancy lies in the diversity of 
standards of proof before the Supreme Court and the criminal courts. However, the Special 
Rapporteur has found that the Supreme Court applies high standards of proof and he is 
convinced that many of the cases would have succeeded also in criminal procedures. 
</p>
<p><b>Corporal punishment in prisons 
</b></p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the recent abolition of corporal punishment in 
Sri Lanka under the Corporal Punishment Act No. 23 of 2 August 2005. However, in the course 
of his visit, he received disturbing complaints of cases of corporal punishment corroborated by 
medical evidence. In particular, in Bogambara prison the Special Rapporteur heard of a number 
of instances of corporal punishment and was informed of the names of prison guards who 
regularly beat prisoners. In the office indicated by the informants, the Special Rapporteur found 
instruments that could have no other use than for beatings, such as plastic tubes bound together 
in a bundle. 
</p>
<p>81. Again, prisoners reported that two detainees recently punished in this manner had been 
transferred shortly before the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur 
was able to speak to one of the detainees concerned later in Welikada Prison, Colombo. 
The detainee confirmed that he had been corporally punished by one of the guards at 
Bogambara Prison. He bore visible marks on his back of recent abuse which medically 
corroborated his allegations (see appendix, paragraph 92). 
</p>
<p>82. In the debriefing of the assistant superintendent of police at Bogambara Prison, the chief 
jailer admitted the use of corporal punishment in cases of detainees who &#8220;do something wrong&#8221;. 
He also confirmed that they had received many complaints of ill-treatment against the guards 
mentioned by the Special Rapporteur. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to report that the 
Government has initiated an inquiry to look into this matter. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONDITIONS OF DETENTION 
</b></p>
<p>83. As far as conditions of detention are concerned, the Government provided the Special 
Rapporteur with statistics indicating severe overcrowding of prisons. While the total capacity of 
all prisons amounts to 8,200, the actual prison population has reached 28,000. Poor conditions of 
detention can amount to inhuman and degrading treatment, which is well established in the 
jurisprudence of several international and regional human rights mechanisms. In Sri Lanka, the 
combination of severe overcrowding with the antiquated infrastructure of certain prison facilities 
places unbearable strains on services and resources, which for detainees in certain prisons, such 
as the Colombo Remand Prison, where the lack of space was most obvious, amounts to 
degrading treatment. The lack of adequate facilities also leads to a situation where convicted 
prisoners are held together with pretrial detainees in violation of Sri Lanka&#8217;s obligation under 
article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Although the conditions 
are definitely better in prisons with more modern facilities, such as Polonnaruwa and the Female 
Ward of the New Magazine Prison, the prison system as a whole is in need of structural reform. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
 page 23 
 
</p>
<p>84. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to various police stations, he observed that detainees 
are locked up in basic cells, sleep on the concrete floor and are often without natural light and 
sufficient ventilation. While he is not concerned about such conditions for criminal suspects held 
in police custody for up to 24 hours, these conditions become inhuman for suspects held in these 
cells under detention orders pursuant to the Emergency Regulations for periods of several 
months up to one year. This applies both for smaller police stations, such as at Mount Lavinia, 
and especially for the headquarters of CID and TID in Colombo, where detainees are kept in 
rooms used as offices during the daytime, and forced to sleep on desks in some cases. 
</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur welcomes recent information from the Government that TID has 
secured a new detention facility, which it will occupy in the second quarter of 2008, and has 
canvassed the assistance of the ICRC with regard to specifying minimum standards relating to 
space, ventilation and light for detainees in the new facility. 
</p>
<p><b>Women in detention 
</b></p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur found the detention facilities in the Female Ward of the 
New Magazine Prison in general to be more adequate than the male detention facilities in 
Colombo. However, the female detainees are also living in overcrowded conditions and some of 
the women reported fights between the prisoners without proper intervention by the prison 
guards. The Special Rapporteur is pleased that the strict division of male and female detainees in 
prisons is in general observed and that female prisoners are guarded by female prison personnel.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Children in detention 
</b></p>
<p>87. In the TID facilities in Colombo the Special Rapporteur met eight children (four girls and 
four boys) who were being held on account of being child soldiers for the LTTE. He strongly 
condemns the recruitment of children in the conflict, be it for fighting or other forms of 
servicing the armed groups. On the other hand, he also deems prolonged detention of minors in 
counter-terrorism detention facilities deeply worrying. 
</p>
<p><b>The death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>88. The death penalty is foreseen by article 52 of the Penal Code. Murder is punishable by 
death (art. 296). No death sentence has been carried out in Sri Lanka since 1977. However, the 
High Court has, for example, sentenced five police officers guilty of raping and murdering a 
Tamil schoolgirl, to death sentences in 1998. 
</p>
<p>89. While the Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the policy of Sri Lanka not to carry out 
death sentences over the last 30 years, he observes that courts continue to sentence persons to 
death. This leads to a considerable number of condemned prisoners living for many years under 
the strict conditions of death row. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur concludes that the Government of Sri Lanka has set a number of 
important legal steps in order to prevent and combat torture as well as to hold perpetrators 
accountable. Most notably, the enactment of the Torture Act No. 22 of 1994 and the Corporal 
Punishment Act No. 23 of 2005 as well as legal safeguards in the Code of Criminal Procedure 
constitute positive legal measures in the fight against torture. The Special Rapporteur is further 
encouraged by the fact that capital punishment has not been executed in Sri Lanka for more than 
three decades. The fact that a system of JMOs is in place in the country is also a positive sign. 
</p>
<p>91. However, the system set up by these positive measures cannot be regarded as fully 
effective. The high number of successful fundamental rights cases decided by the Supreme Court 
of Sri Lanka, as well as the even higher number of complaints that the NHRC continues to 
receive on an almost daily basis indicates that torture is still widely practised in Sri Lanka. 
Obstacles for victims of torture to access the JMOs result in loss of important medical evidence 
which in turn impedes criminal proceedings against perpetrators. The absence of an obligation 
on law enforcement officials or judges to investigate cases of torture ex officio further 
aggravates the situation for victims. In general, the lack of effective witness and victim 
protection prevents the effective application of the laws in place. 
</p>
<p>92. Under the Emergency Regulations, most of the safeguards against torture mentioned above 
either do not apply or are simply disregarded, which leads to a situation in which torture 
becomes a routine practice in the context of counter-terrorism operations. The non-applicability 
of important legal safeguards in the context of counter-terrorism measures, as well as excessively 
prolonged police detention, opens the door for abuse. The Special Rapporteur is also shocked by 
the brutality of some of the torture measures applied to persons suspected of being LTTE 
members, such as burnings with soldering irons and suspension by the thumbs. 
</p>
<p>93. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the reported links between the 
Government and the TMVP-Karuna group, which were confirmed by the representative the 
Special Rapporteur met in Trincomalee. The TMVP-Karuna group has been accused of 
particularly brutal human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) End impunity for members of the TMVP-Karuna group; 
 (b) Ensure that detainees are given access to legal counsel within 24 hours of arrest, 
including persons arrested under the Emergency Regulations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) All detainees should be granted the ability to challenge the lawfulness of the 
detention before an independent court, e.g. through habeas corpus proceedings; </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
 page 25 
 
</p>
<p><b> (d) Ensure that magistrates routinely ask persons brought from police custody how 
they have been treated and, even in the absence of a formal complaint from the defendant, 
order an independent medical examination in accordance with the Istanbul Protocol; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Ensure that all allegations of torture and ill-treatment are promptly and 
thoroughly investigated by an independent authority with no connection to the authority 
investigating or prosecuting the case against the alleged victim; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Ensure all public officials, in particular prison doctors, prison officials and 
magistrates who have reasons to suspect an act of torture or ill-treatment, to report 
ex officio to the relevant authorities for proper investigation in accordance with article 12 
of the Convention against Torture; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Ensure that confessions made by persons in custody without the presence of a 
lawyer and that are not confirmed before a judge should not be admissible as evidence 
against the persons who made the confession; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) The burden of proof should shift to the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable 
doubt that the confession was not obtained under any kind of duress; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Expedite criminal procedures relating to torture cases by, e.g., establishing 
special courts dealing with torture and ill-treatment by public officials; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Allow judges to be able to exercise more discretion in sentencing perpetrators of 
torture under the 1994 Torture Act; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) Drastically reduce the period of police custody under the Emergency 
Regulations and repeal other restrictions of human rights under them; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) Develop proper mechanisms for the protection of torture victims and witnesses; 
 (m) Ensure that the constitution and activities of the NHRC comply with the 
Paris Principles, including with respect to annual reporting on the human rights situation 
and follow-up on past cases of violations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (n) Establish appropriate detention facilities for persons kept in prolonged custody 
under the Emergency Regulations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (o) Establish an effective and independent complaints system in prisons for torture 
and abuse leading to criminal investigations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (p) Investigate corporal punishment cases at Bogambara Prison as well as torture 
allegations against TID, mainly in Boosa, aimed at bringing the perpetrators and their 
commanders to justice;

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The following accounts are based on allegations by detainees while being interviewed by 
the Special Rapporteur. Detainees who requested anonymity are indicated below as <b>Detainee 
(in bold)</b>. Many detainees requested absolute confidentiality due to fears of reprisals and their 
allegations are not contained in the present appendix (names known to the Special Rapporteur). 
The Special Rapporteur conducted visits to detention facilities unannounced and was able to hold 
private interviews with detainees, in general. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  TERRORIST INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT (TID), COLOMBO 
(Visited on 2 and 7 October 2007) 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Terrorist Investigation Department (TID) is located in the High Security Zone in 
Colombo, and is one of the two facilities in the capital (the other being the Criminal 
Investigation Department) where alleged terrorist suspects are transferred to for questioning 
following arrest. On the day of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s first visit, there were 57 male detainees 
and 9 females. The detention facilities are comprised of two wings, one for male detainees, and 
one for females and children. The male wing holds a cell block with eight tiled cells each 
approximately 1.5 x 2.5 metres. During the day, the detainees can leave their cells to stand or 
walk in the narrow corridor. During night time, they are locked in the cells, with up to 
four persons per cell. Some sleep in the corridor. The entire facility lacks natural light and 
ventilation is very poor; made worse in hot weather. Two washing facilities serve the 57 male 
detainees. The female wing is comprised of two small cells and a short corridor. The ICRC 
comes every month. On Saturdays, the detainees can receive short family visits. The Special 
Rapporteur was received by the Director of TID, Senior Superintendent of Police, 
Nandana Munasinghe. 
</p>
<p>3. Most of the detainees who alleged torture requested absolute confidentiality and their 
testimonies are not included in this report. Detainees were afraid of both the officers and alleged 
spies among the detainees. Those who had been talking to the Special Rapporteur during his first 
visit were taken out of their cells and subjected to reprisals, including threats and ill-treatment by 
Inspector of Police Saman and Police Constable Perera shortly after the delegation departed. 
The Special Rapporteur was also informed about several attempts by TID officers to obstruct his 
investigations during his first visit. Detainees, including children, had been taken out of their 
cells for the purpose of hiding them from the Special Rapporteur. A group of 12 detainees was 
held for a prolonged period of time in a bus outside TID during the Special Rapporteur&#180;s visit. 
</p>
<p>4. <b>K.J.</b>, aged 16. Four months ago, he was arrested by the police in Batticaloa 
(Kalawanchidud), and brought to TID. He was a member of the Karuna group and sought to 
leave it by shooting himself in the foot. He reported that he has no problems with the TID 
officers. His parents cannot afford to come and visit him. 
</p>
<p>5. <b>Detainee</b>. He was never tortured but knows of others who were beaten and suspended. 
In recent days, just prior to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, a relatively high number of detainees, 
around 17 or 18, had been either released from TID or remanded into custody in other facilities. 
On the morning of the visit, TID tried to hide eight children (four boys and four girls aged 
around 15 years from Batticaloa) by moving them to the first floor. The TID officers regularly </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
 page 29 
 
</p>
<p>torture persons on the first floor in the branch offices. In addition, the detainees are often insulted 
by the officers, who ask them, for example, &#8220;How many fathers do you have?&#8221; He was brought 
before a judge once, but could not speak to him. 
6. <b>Detainee</b>. For the first four days after he had been brought to TID, he was severely 
ill-treated by three officers named Abdeen, Suber and Kankha. After he was forced to 
completely undress, two of the officers placed a stick under his knees and handcuffed him in 
front of his shackled legs (&#8220;parrot&#8217;s perch&#8221; or &#8220;dharma chakara&#8221;). In this position, he was hung 
upside-down between two tables in the office of Branch No. 3 on the first floor of the TID 
premises. For 10 minutes, the officers beat him with an iron bar on the soles of his feet and on 
his back. They also kicked him in the face. This treatment continued for four days in which the 
officers tried without success to get him to confess his involvement with the LTTE. About 
one month ago, the same officers tortured him again by the same method. It was common that 
detainees were held overnight in the interrogation rooms on the first floor. After the ill-treatment 
his feet were swollen and numb, as was one of his fingers to which he received a blow. He 
reported that another detainee named Stephen had been taken out of the cells and brought to an 
unknown location earlier the same day. Stephen had been massively tortured, including beatings 
on his testicles. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur made a return visit to TID on 7 October 2007. 
</p>
<p>8. <b>Supaiya Jayasangar</b>, aged 30. Three months ago he was arrested by the police and taken 
to  Murunkan (Mannar) Police Station. At the police station he was beaten with a wooden stick 
on his legs. After one day, he was transferred to TID. 
</p>
<p>9. <b>Four boys between 14 and 15 years of age</b>. On 8 August 2007, the LTTE camp 
Kanchikudiaru (near Ampara) was attacked by the Special Task Force (STF), and upon surrender 
the boys were arrested as suspected LTTE members. They reported that they had joined the 
LTTE in May 2007 motivated by the physical training, food, as well as the money they would 
receive. Upon arrest, the boys were taken to Thandirady STF camp where they were held for 
one day. On 9 August, they were brought to a police station in Colombo and then transferred to 
TID. They made no allegations regarding ill-treatment but complained about the restricted 
movement in their small and crowded cell, and the lack of natural light and fresh air. Their 
families were informed about their detention. 
</p>
<p>10. <b>Nicholas Stephen</b>, aged 27. On 4 July 2007, he was travelling on a bus to Mannar and was 
arrested at a checkpoint in Colombo by army personnel. He was immediately blindfolded and 
brought to a location which he believed to be CID. Somebody told him, &#8220;This is the fourth floor 
and you will never return alive.&#8221; He was put alone in a small room without furniture. His 
blindfold was never removed and he was occasionally brought to the toilet by an officer. He was 
handcuffed most of the time. Only when he was eating were the handcuffs removed. One time he 
tried to remove the blindfold but was immediately beaten on the back of his head. Over a three-
day period he was repeatedly tortured. Completely naked, a chain was put under his knees to 
which his wrists were bound, and he was lifted above the ground. A bag with petrol was put 
over his head. He was beaten on his abdomen and his arms with a plastic pipe, and on his feet 
and legs with a metal pipe. He was cut on the inner side of his left knee with a blade. A hard 
object, such as a stone, was put under his testicles, which were then beaten with a metal pipe that 
was brandished to him. He was also suspended by his feet and handcuffed behind his back. </p>

</p>
<p>In this position he was raised and lowered so that his head hit the floor several times. From the 
ill-treatment his testicles were swollen to the size of a grapefruit and he had to walk with his 
legs apart. On the first day after the beating, they were bright red and on the second day they 
turned to a blackish red. The swelling lasted for one and a half months and for 25 days he had 
blood in his urine. He still feels a burning sensation when he tries to urinate. On the top of his 
head the hair did not grow back after the ill-treatment and he showed a bald patch of about 
four centimetres in diameter. When he was tortured he heard that somebody raised the volume 
on a TV in order to drown out his screaming. He also heard cell doors opening and closing. 
The officer who was with him in the room spoke Tamil. After three days he was brought to 
Grand Pass Police Station and his blindfold was removed. After two days there he was 
transferred to TID. When the TID officers took down his details they asked him whether 
he had been beaten. He answered, &#8220;Yes&#8221;, and they said, &#8220;We will also beat you.&#8221; From 15 to 
22 September, he had to stay in an office on the first floor. He was beaten on his feet with a 
plastic pipe filled with sand while an officer grabbed him by the throat, pulled him back and 
lifted him. He reported that on the day of the first visit of the Special Rapporteur, he was brought 
up to the office of Branch No. 1 because the officers wanted to prevent him speaking out. He had 
to lie under a bench. When he heard the Special Rapporteur speaking he wanted to shout but an 
officer kept his mouth shut with his hand. Examination by a forensic doctor disclosed no specific 
injuries to corroborate the account but this was not unexpected given the nature of the injuries 
alleged and the time interval since infliction. However, the account of the physical effects of the 
ill-treatment was so precise and detailed as to be compelling from a medical perspective. 
</p>
<p>11. <b>Detainee, female</b>. She reported that her husband was tortured before her eyes. 
</p>
<p>12. <b>Detainees, children</b>. They reported that they were not beaten but that the officers often 
used foul language to insult them. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur recommends that prompt and independent investigations of all 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment be carried out in order to bring those responsible to justice 
(i.e. the alleged perpetrators, Inspector of Police Saman, Police Constable Perera, and the 
management of TID, including the Director of TID, Senior Superintendent of Police, 
Nandana Munasinghe, as well as the CID officers allegedly responsible for the ill-treatment of 
Nicholas Stephen).

<p><b>II.  MOUNT LAVINIA POLICE STATION, COLOMBO 
</b></p>
<p><b>(Visited on 3 October 2007) 
</b>14. Mount Lavinia Police Station is a two-storey building, staffed by about 326 officers. 
The cell block contains three cells, each approximately about 3 by 2 metres and a corridor. 
According to the detainees, the inner cell doors are always open and prisoners can move about 
freely inside. Detainees have to sleep on the floor in the cells and inner corridor. Detained 
women stay in one of the offices and sit on a bench or sleep on the floor. Visitors can come to 
the police station and bring food and water. At the time of the visit, 19 men were detained. 
According to the information from the prisoners, four detainees were taken out of the cell and 
hidden in an unknown place believed to be Ratmalana Police Post shortly upon arrival of the 
Special Rapporteur. No entry in the custody registers indicated prisoner transfers. The Special 
Rapporteur was later informed that two hours after his departure from the station, the four hidden </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
 page 31 
 
</p>
<p>detainees were brought back to the cell. The Special Rapporteur was received by the Officer 
in Charge, Inspector of Police, K.A.P. Indnegalle, and Acting Headquarter Inspector 
Manjulo Fernando. The detainees were afraid of reprisals and requested the Special Rapporteur 
either to keep the information confidential or to keep the identity anonymous. 
</p>
<p>15. <b>Detainee</b>. He was arrested in a police raid on weapons offences, and brought to 
Mount Lavinia Police Station&#8217;s Crime Branch, where two officers and eight constables 
questioned him for three hours. The constables threatened to arrest his family if he was lying. 
Since his arrest he has not been able to go outside and there is no possibility for exercise. The 
ICRC visited the station the day before. Before their visit there were 42 prisoners, but shortly 
before their arrival about 15-16 prisoners were taken away, most of whom were LTTE 
suspects. On these occasions, prisoners are believed to be taken to Ratmanala Police Post. 
About five persons sleep in his 3 by 2 metres cell. He reported that there are generally no 
problems among the prisoners. Some prisoners receive food from their families. They receive 
books and playing cards from the Red Cross. He complains that the toilet facility is filthy. 
</p>
<p>16. <b>Detainee</b>. He was brought in on suspicion of a theft of a mobile phone. For the first 
few days he was kept handcuffed crosswise behind his back and beaten with cricket stumps on 
his toes, particularly on his toe nails, and the top of his feet. An IP, sergeant and a constable 
participated in the beatings. 
</p>
<p>17. <b>Detainee</b>. He was arrested in connection with a search for a weapons cache. 
He complained that the group of arrested persons did not receive any food for three days. 
When they were taken to the magistrate the police officers remained in the same room 
and they did not give them a chance to speak to him. He reported that many of the detainees had 
been tortured until they could not walk anymore. Many were too scared to speak about the 
ill-treatment out of fear of reprisals. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur recommends that allegations of torture be thoroughly investigated 
and the perpetrators be brought to justice.

<p><b>(Visited on 3 October 2007) 
</b>21. Payagala North Police Station has one small cell where at the time of the visit six male 
detainees were held. One female detainee sat on a bench in front of the cell. All had been 
arrested the day before and interrogated. Three persons had been held for over 24 hours. 
The Special Rapporteur was received by the Officer in Charge, Inspector of Police, 
Mr. C. Ayjitukumara. 
22. <b>G.S.</b>, age 15. On 2 October 2007 at 12 a.m., he was arrested on suspicion of having stolen 
cattle and was brought to the police station. He reported that he was taken by three police 
officers behind the station and was beaten by one police officer (Sunit Saand) with a wooden 
stick on his back in order to extort a confession. 
</p>
<p>23. <b>Detainee, child</b>. His hands were bound with a rope in front. He reported the officers used 
foul language. When he was brought to the police station, a constable questioned him about a 
theft. During the hour long interrogation, he was struck twice on his buttocks with a wooden 
stick, and slapped in the face. However, he did not confess. When sitting, he reported that he still 
feels pain in his back side. His family had been informed of his arrest and had contacted a 
lawyer. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  TID DETENTION FACILITY AT BOOSA 
</b></p>
<p><b>(Visited on 3 October 2007) 
</b>24. Located in the vicinity of Galle in the south of the country, the TID Detention Facility at 
Boosa primarily holds prisoners suspected of involvement with the LTTE. At the time of the 
visit, 54 male detainees were held, all LTTE suspects. Most of them have been detained there for 
more than three months, and 22 of whom had been produced before a court. The detainees were 
held in three different wings: 19 persons in the first wing, 14 persons in the second wing and 
21 persons in the third wing. The detainees in the first wing sleep on the floor in several small 
cells, whereas in the second and third wings the detainees are held in large halls. The wings were 
fairly clean and were not crowded, though the detainees complained of rats. They were allowed 
to be outside the cell during day time. No women were detained at the time of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. The Special Rapporteur was received by OIC H.G. Srisena. He reported that 
Boosa was solely a detention facility and that no interrogations took place there. 
</p>
<p>25. The detainees who were interviewed reported that some detainees were recently 
transferred out before the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit and were the ones that were most 
heavily subjected to torture and ill-treatment, and would still have visible injuries. 
Upon enquiry, the OIC confirmed to the Special Rapporteur that in the last few days (beginning 
on 28 September 2007) 59 detainees were transferred to TID, Colombo, on instructions of TID 
Director Nandana Munasinghe. They were reportedly transferred for court appearances.</p>

<p> A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
 page 33 
 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur spoke on the phone to the TID Director, requested and later received a 
full list of all 59 detainees, some of whom were released and some of whom were brought to 
Colombo Remand Prison. Some of these detainees he could speak to during his second visit to 
the TID Headquarters, the Colombo Remand Prison and the New Magazine Prison (Female 
Ward) in Colombo. 
</p>
<p><b>First wing 
</b></p>
<p>26. According to the information from the 19 detainees in the first wing, several of them 
reported having been subject to torture and ill-treatment by various methods at Boosa Camp 
or at an earlier stage in police custody or army camps. Eleven detainees reported that a plastic 
bag filled with petrol was pulled over their head; eight were reportedly beaten with sticks; 
six detainees say that they were handcuffed and then suspended and five were suspended in the 
&#8220;parrot&#8217;s perch&#8221; position (also known as dharama chakara) - the detainee is handcuffed in front 
of his knees, his legs are shackled, a stick is passed through his arms and behind his knees, and 
the person is suspended upside-down. Several detainees were subjected to ill-treatment on their 
private parts; three detainees reported that petrol was poured over their penis; and five explained 
that a rope or string was tied around their penis and then pulled. 
</p>
<p>27. The detainees alleged that the toilets were freshly painted the day before the visit of the 
Special Rapporteur, and the TV was installed on the morning of the visit. 
</p>
<p><b>Third wing 
</b></p>
<p>28. <b>Detainee</b>. He was arrested on suspicion of membership in the LTTE. He was initially 
brought to the TID premises in Colombo, and taken to the first floor where three or four different 
units had their offices. There he was handcuffed to a table in a large office, to which a smaller 
office was attached. He was tortured for three days in order to obtain a confession and 
information on his friend, who was also suspected to be a member of the LTTE. During this 
time, he was beaten by three officers, one of them named Kankha. The officers used two wooden 
sticks to beat him on the back, buttocks and legs. He was handcuffed crosswise behind his back 
and beaten. The beatings usually lasted for one hour before he was handcuffed to the table again 
and given a rest. For about one week after the ill-treatment he had problems sitting and walking. 
After about one month, he was produced before a medical officer who gave him a medical 
certificate. He complained about the torture before court but nothing happened. He stayed at TID 
for about two months. During the first 15 days, his family was not informed of his arrest. 
The ICRC came to see the detainees. Later, he was transferred to Boosa. 
</p>
<p>29. <b>Detainee</b>. He was arrested on suspicion of providing support to the LTTE. He was brought 
to Boosa, where four officers beat him in an office used for interrogations. One of them used a 
plastic pipe of four centimetres in diameter, which was filled with sand. The others beat and 
kicked him with their hands and feet. He was mainly beaten on his legs and on the soles of his 
feet but also kicked on the right lower part of his abdomen. During the beatings he was always</p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p>completely naked and he was handcuffed crosswise behind his back. After the beatings in the 
office he was brought back to the cell for a while but was threatened that he should not tell 
anybody of the torture. After the ill-treatment he had blood in his urine for one week and he lost 
some feeling in his feet. One of the officers who tortured him was called Nishantha, and he and 
the other officers involved were still working at TID in Boosa. He reported that he is too afraid 
of reprisals to file an official complaint. 
</p>
<p>30. <b>Detainee</b>. He was arrested in Colombo on suspicion of membership in the LTTE. 
Four men in civilian clothes dragged him into a white van and did not tell him who they were. 
During the arrest he was beaten by them. Three of the men held him while the fourth one 
punched him in the face and on his chest and kicked him against his knees. He was brought to 
TID where he was interrogated but not beaten. During his second interrogation the next day, the 
officer in charge made him kneel down and beat him twice with his flat hand and his fist on his 
cheeks. His family was informed the day after his arrest. The TID officers wanted him to confess 
to membership of the LTTE. Eventually, he signed a statement in Sinhalese which he could not 
understand. He saw a magistrate but did not speak to him. He reported that he was previously 
arrested in 2001, and on that occasion, during interrogation, a plastic bag filled with petrol was 
put over his head for three minutes. 
</p>
<p>31. <b>Detainee</b>. He was arrested by the police on suspicion of being a member of the LTTE. He 
was brought to Seruwalla Police Station where he was neither interrogated nor abused. After one 
day, he was transferred to Kantale Police Station where he stayed for one and a half months. For 
the first three days, he was interrogated by two police officers. He was brought out of the police 
station and forced to stand under a tree for two hours while he was questioned. The investigating 
officer wanted to know where he had hidden weapons and when he did not say anything, the 
officer became angry and took him to another building where he began to beat him. Another 
officer, who served as a Tamil interpreter, did not take part in the beatings. He was handcuffed 
and had to sit on the floor while the officer beat him with a squared wooden stick on the soles of 
his feet and with a smaller stick on his head. He was also beaten on his abdomen. This treatment 
continued in sessions over a period of three days, and he was returned to his cell in between 
sessions. In June, he was transferred to Boosa, whereupon his arrival fresh interrogations into his 
suspected hiding of weapons began. After he was taken to a medical officer who certified he was 
in good health, TID officers began to interrogate and torture him on a regular basis. For two to 
three times per week he was interrogated by two officers until September 2007. His hands were 
handcuffed behind his back crosswise, he was punched in his abdomen, and his nipples were 
squeezed. One of the officers stepped with his shoes on his feet, his hair was pulled and he was 
slapped in the face. He was also forced to sit cross-legged while one officer stepped on his knees 
and forced them to the ground. During this ordeal he was always naked. He recalls that one of 
the TID officers was called Sumith. He was last abused at the end of August. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur recommends that prompt and independent investigations of all 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment be carried out in order to bring those responsible to justice 
(including the management of the institution). </p>

<p><b>VII.  TRINCOMALEE PRISON, TRINCOMALEE 
</b></p>
<p><b>(Visited on 4 October 2007) 
</b>33. The detention facilities of Trincomalee Prison are comprised of an old wing, where 
six cells each hold five detainees, and a more modern wing with three buildings. Generally, the 
remand prisoners are held on the first floor and the convicted prisoners on the ground floor. 
However, due to place constraints, remand detainees are also held on the ground floor. 
Women are separated from men. The prison does not have a punishment cell but prisoners are 
reportedly sent to another prison for punishment. Some of the convicted prisoners are working 
in Trincomalee and Jaffna harbour, loading cargo onto the ships. The cell doors are open from 
6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and the detainees can move about freely within their wings. On the day of the 
Special Rapporteur&#180;s visit a total of 251 prisoners were detained in the prison, which has an 
official capacity of 200. Fifty-one were reported to be held there temporarily. There were 
130 men in pretrial detention, 117 convicted men and 4 convicted women. No minors were 
detained. No one was detained under detention orders. Anuradhapura Prison, according to the 
Chief Jailer, Gamini Silva, is the facility which can accommodate &#8220;high security&#8221; prisoners. 
No firearms are stored at Trincomalee Prison and security is provided by the Harbour Police. 
The prison staff comprises 40 persons, including 5 women. According to the Chief Jailer, there is 
neither a doctor nor a nurse resident at the premises and they do not have a dispensary. However, 
once a week on Thursdays at 2 p.m. a doctor visits the prison. The prisoners spend most of the 
day outside their cells. There is no sports field, however they are allowed to play carambole or 
chess and practise yoga. Three times a week there is the possibility to take Tamil, Sinhalese or 
English language classes. All Muslim detainees are held in the same cell during Ramadan and 
are allowed to observe their religious practices. The detainees reported to the Special Rapporteur 
that the treatment in the prison is generally friendly. As a form of disciplinary punishment, the 
detainees reported that they are ordered to do knee bends for five minutes, and in some cases 
they are beaten with a rubber stick. A number of Tamil detainees complain of harassment by 
Sinhalese detainees. 
</p>
<p>34. <b>S.T. Nejam</b>, aged 23, a member of the Home Guard, Mutur. On 27 October 2006, he was 
arrested on suspicion of selling official weapons and taken to Mutur Police Station. He was taken 
to the OIC&#8217;s office, where he was handcuffed and ordered to sit on a chair. Ten persons were 
present in the office: two superintendents, a sergeant, an IP and six police constables. He was 
asked by the OIC to bend his upper body and then was kicked in the teeth by the OIC. He was 
beaten with a chair in his face for 10 minutes resulting in bleeding. When he was brought back to 
his cell, he was verbally threatened that he should tell the truth. After two days&#8217; detention at the 
police station he was produced before a magistrate and then transferred to the prison. He 
reported the ill-treatment to the magistrate, who did not listen to him and did not react to his 
allegations. 
</p>
<p>35. <b>K.M. Jahankeer</b>, 26, a member of the Home Guard, Mutur. On 8 May 2007, he was 
arrested on suspicion of illegal possession of a weapon. At Mutur Police Station he was brought 
to a room on the first floor for interrogation. Standing naked, his thumbs as well as his feet were 
tied with rope. He was ordered to stand on a chair and was then suspended by his thumbs and 
feet from an iron bar fixed across the room. Four persons - the OIC (an inspector of police), a 
superintendent, a sergeant and a constable - were present in the room. He was punched in his 
face by the OIC and then beaten on the soles of his feet with a cricket stump. Further, the officers </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
page 36 
 
</p>
<p>drove three nails into each of the soles of his feet. As a consequence of this ill-treatment he was 
screaming and was bleeding from his feet and mouth. He was subjected to similar ill-treatment 
on the second and third day of his arrest. He was held for three days in the police cell without 
receiving any food. On the third day he was forced to touch the weapon he was suspected of 
possessing illegally and to sign a statement. Upon his request, he was taken in a police jeep to 
Mutur Hospital, where he received some basic treatment but was not allowed to speak to the 
doctor in private. In addition, the OIC told the doctor not to report the detainee&#8217;s injuries. He was 
taken to a magistrate&#8217;s house on the Sunday, but did not have a chance to see him personally 
(i.e. he remained in the vehicle). His parents came to visit him at the police station, but they were 
only allowed to see him from a certain distance and were not allowed to give him food. In any 
case, he was not able to speak to them because of his injuries and consequently his parents did 
not report the ill-treatment. He was transferred to the prison soon after.

boots on his back by police officers. Later he was remanded in custody. On 13 May 2005, he was 
released on bail, but did not show up before court, and consequently, the police issued a warrant 
for his arrest. He was rearrested some days later and taken to Vavunyia Police Station. From 
there he was transferred to Anuradhapura Police Station where he was kept in custody for 
four days and then taken to Trincomalee Prison. He made no allegations of ill-treatment in

twice in the face by a police officer. He was then brought to Ulpotha Police Post, where he was 
kept overnight and was neither interrogated nor ill-treated. He has been to court and was 
sentenced to imprisonment. He reported that within the prison no torture takes place but guards 
sometimes slap detainees. On the occasion of his first arrest 10 months previously, he was beaten 
severely by the police and had to be hospitalized for two days. 
</p>
<p>38. <b>Detainee</b>. He surrendered to an army post after having been abducted by the LTTE and

thrown to the floor where he was beaten for about one hour. Four other persons were arrested 
together with him but he does not know if these persons were also beaten. He was later brought 
to a police station where the soldiers claimed that they had captured him though he had 
surrendered voluntarily. He was kept for three months at the police station and brought to the 
court every fortnight. Since March, he has been detained in Trincomalee Prison. He reported no 
allegations of ill-treatment in the police station, nor in the prison. 
</p>
<p>39. <b>Detainee</b>. Following an explosion, he was pulled out of his shop by members of the navy 
and dragged to the spot where the blast had taken place. He was severely beaten and kicked by 
around 30 to 40 persons, both civilians and members of the navy. He was later brought to the 
police headquarters in Trincomalee and then to the prison but was not beaten again. </p>

</p>
<p>40. <b>Detainee</b>. In November 2006, he was arrested at home by Trincomalee CID officers. 
He was beaten by the officers in front of his mother and his uncle. Then the officers took him to 
another house and asked him whether he knew the person living there. He was later brought to 
the police headquarters in Trincomalee, where he was beaten again. As a suspected member of 
the LTTE, he stayed in the police station for three months. For 17 days, he was repeatedly 
interrogated and on four or five occasions he was beaten for about one hour. The beatings took 
place in the inquiry/crimes branch office amidst police officers who were going about their 
paper work. His hands were tied with his own shirt and he was pushed under a table, where he 
was beaten and kicked all over his body. He was asked for information on another person who 
had been shot. The police brought him to his community where he was forced to identify LTTE 
members. Initially, he had a bag over his head with holes for his eyes, but when he did not point 
out anybody the police removed the bag and branded him as a traitor in front of his home 
community. In February 2007, he was brought to court and then to the prison. He reported that 
he is afraid of the Sinhalese prison guards.

<p>48. <b>Yogaswaran Lakmanan</b>, aged 27 years, Trincomalee. On 3 October 2007, he was 
arrested on suspicion of LTTE membership (which often occurs when identity cannot be readily 
established) on the Kantale Road. It is his first arrest, and he made no allegations of ill-treatment 
or any kind of pressure. He reported that his father was aware that he has been arrested. 
</p>
<p>49. <b>Mohamed Palel Riyal</b>, aged 22. On 4 October 2007, he was arrested by the police on 
suspicion of supporting the LTTE. He reported that he was involved in a fight and sustained 
injuries, and was later arrested as he was seeking treatment at the hospital. He reported that he 
was questioned by the arresting officer, and made no allegations of ill-treatment. His parents 
have visited him, and he was provided food, water, and access to a toilet. 
</p>
<p>50. <b>Detainee</b>. In September 2007, he was arrested by the army at his home on suspicion of 
membership in the LTTE. He was brought to the police headquarters, sent home the same day, 
and told not to tell anybody that he had been arrested by the army. He was ordered to report to 
the police station the next morning, and he has been detained there since. He was not given any 
reasons for his arrest but thought that it was suspected that he had rejoined the LTTE. He is 
questioned periodically by CID officers whether he had weapons or if he knew of anybody else 
who had weapons. The police have threatened him that he would &#8220;not get out alive&#8221; if he did not 
answer their questions, but he did not tell them anything. Sometimes, officers came to his cell at 
night to question him through the bars. He reported that he is afraid to be killed by the army or 
the police after being released. The army had killed twelve people in the course of one year and 
had alleged that members of the Karuna group were the culprits. The ICRC has visited him but 
not the NHRC. He reported that in general, Tamil detainees were not treated well. In 2002, he 
was abducted by the LTTE and was forced to stay with them for 10 days. When he managed to 
escape he reported the incident to the police, who ordered him to report to the police station 
every week until the end of 2003.

being used for weapons storage), and at the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur, there 
were no detainees. The Special Rapporteur is informed that 14 detainees had been brought to 
Court the same morning. Generally, it was reported, no one is detained under the Emergency 
Rules at this police station. Police Constable R.M.K. Rasnayake, reported that the toilets in</p>

</p>
<p>the cells have been blocked for at least as long as he has been serving at this station, which is 
eight years. He further reported that in the cells used for detainees, an average of 6 persons are 
held, 10 being the maximum. Chief Inspector H.M. Herath denied this, informing the Special 
Rapporteur that PC Rasnayake is unreliable due to a head injury he had suffered. The three cells 
have been used for storage only for a few months, problems with the toilets have persisted only 
for 1.5 months, and only five detainees at most are held per cell, according to the chief inspector. 
The Special Rapporteur noted an abandoned female child around 5 or 6 years old from Batticaloa 
in the police station, for whom social services were called to collect her.

of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. Of 249 male detainees, 109 were convicted, 124 were on 
remand, 15 on appeal, and one was in the hospital. Of the female detainees, one was 
convicted and three were on remand. One child was also detained. Fifty-six staff are employed 
at the prison. The Special Rapporteur was received by Assistant Superintendant of Prisons 
Lal A. Wickramsinghe, who has been at the prison since August 2007. The ASP reported that 
punishment of detainees, such as cancellation of visits for one week, is implemented in 
accordance with the prison ordinance. There are no punishment cells in the prison and 
problematic detainees have to be sent to the punishment cells of Ratnapura Prison. Members of 
rival groups, former police officers or escapees are held separately from the other detainees. He 
pointed out that one mentally ill boy, detained in a separate cell, would be brought to the hospital 
the next day. The former head of the prison was known for beating detainees, and was subject to 
a magisterial inquiry and was subsequently transferred to another post. The ASP reported that he 
has not received any complaints of ill-treatment by prison guards. When questioned about a 
number of allegations of ill-treatment received relating to one of his staff named Indika, the ASP 
described him as a well-meaning eager new recruit, but would nevertheless look into the 
allegations.

vulgar language but who did not use any force apart from grabbing his shirt. On 25 September, 
he was produced before a magistrate and later transferred to the prison. There was no medical 
examination upon arrival at the prison. The detainee&#8217;s family was informed of his detention only 
after his transfer to the prison. He reported regular visits by his parents, and he is represented 
by a lawyer. He made no allegation of ill-treatment in prison. He is expected to appear in court 
on 9 October. He can play sports. He reported that it is generally fine in the boys&#8217; cell

<p>55. <b>M.G.C.B.</b>, aged 15, Onagama, Polonnaruwa. On 3 October 2007, he was arrested at home, 
accused of having stolen three bicycles. He alleges that one constable slapped his face and 
threatened him with a knife during the arrest. He was taken to Kaduruvala Police Station, where 
he was kept in custody for 24 hours. The following day, he was produced before a magistrate and 
subsequently transferred to the prison on 4 October where he spent his first night in the female 
wing. He made no allegations of ill-treatment in prison. At the time of the visit, he was detained 
alone, away from the other prisoners, in a cell on the second floor, above the ASP&#8217;s office, which 
also contained empty offices. Shortly after the interview, officers informed the Special 
Rapporteur that the boy would be transferred to a children&#8217;s house for under-16s later that day. 
</p>
<p>56. <b>Detainee</b>. Upon arrest he was beaten by the officers all over his body with wooden batons. 
Other people on the street witnessed the beating. He was brought to Polonnaruwa Police Station 
where he was detained for three days. At night he was taken out of his cell, brought to the 
interrogation room and beaten and kicked. He was not handcuffed and was clothed. He was 
beaten continuously for 10 minutes while standing. Sometimes he fell down and then the officers 
started kicking him on the ground. He was beaten all over his body with a large heavy plastic 
pipe of seven centimetres in diameter filled with dirt with which he was struck mainly on the 
back and arms. He reported that his arms and thighs were swollen after the beatings. He did not 
launch an official complaint, nor tell the magistrate of the ill-treatment. After one month in the 
remand prison he was brought to a doctor but he did not tell him of the beatings. He complained 
of the quality of the food in the prison and reported that the guards regularly beat the inmates in 
front of other detainees with belts and sticks for punishment. On the day of the visit, he reported 
that a mentally ill boy was being beaten by the guards because he had attacked another detainee 
with a razor blade. 
</p>
<p>57. <b>Hitihamique Muthubanda</b>, aged 52. He reported that after he had a quarrel with other 
detainees one and a half months ago, the Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) ordered a 
guard to beat him in front of the others. The guard bent him over and beat him on the back with a 
broom stick. When he tried to get up he was beaten on his buttocks and finally all over his body 
apart from the head. He reached back to protect his buttocks and was struck on the hands. 
He showed dark bruises under the nails of his left index and middle fingers. The beating lasted 
for about five to six minutes. The guard&#8217;s name is Indika and he is still on duty in the prison. 
He reported that the mentally ill boy was beaten in the morning by several guards and was 
locked in the punishment cell where persons are sometimes detained for up to one month. </p>

<p><b>(Visited on 6 October 2007) 
</b>65. Built in 1876, Bogambara Prison has an official capacity of 800 inmates. On the day of 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the total population was 1,998 inmates, including 53 prisoners 
on death row, 1,408 convicted prisoners, 358 on remand, and 178 prisoners sentenced to 
death or life imprisonment and awaiting appeal. The Special Rapporteur was received by 
Superintendant of Prisons Nelson Abeydheera, ASP of Prison C.M.N. Chandrasekera, and 
Chief Jailer T.I. Uduwara. 
</p>
<p>66. On the day of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit the high-security wing was temporarily 
occupied by 83 Muslim detainees in order to allow them to observe Ramadan. According to the 
prisoners they are fully allowed to practise their religious beliefs, participate in sports activities 
which take place on Sundays for two to three hours, and receive visitors once a month. Twice a 
week there is the possibility to take English, Singhalese and Tamil language lessons. Many 
detainees described that they were generally well-treated within the prison and reserved their 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment to circumstances surrounding their arrest and interrogation 
by the police. Methods of torture described by the detainees included: plastic bags placed over 
their heads containing chilli powder or petrol; being suspended from bound hands; subjected to 
the &#8220;parrot&#8217;s perch&#8221;; struck with a baton against a book placed on the head; and being exposed to 
electric shock. Many other detainees reported about routine corporal punishment in the prison, 
usually at the Location Branch. The officers accused of beating detainees were Mr. Rohetha, 
Nihal, Palita, Mutubanda and Kalugampitiya. Mr. Nihal was reported to be the most brutal one. 
During an inspection of the Location Branch, the Special Rapporteur found most of the tools 
allegedly used for corporal punishment; a plastic pipe; wooden sticks and cricket bats. When the 
latter confronted the Chief Jailer and the ASP with these serious allegations, both admitted that 
corporal punishment takes place. Two of the most severely punished prisoners, Mr. Vanni and 
Pradeep Nishanta, had recently been transferred to Welikada and Mahara Prison, respectively. 
The Special Rapporteur later visited Mr. Jayantha Kulasinghe (also known as Vanni Sutha) at 
Welikada Prison in Colombo and could corroborate the allegations with medical evidence. He 
was informed by the Government that use of corporal punishment at Bogambara Prison will be 
subjected to a special investigation.  
67. <b>M.M. Pashme</b>, aged 22, Jaella, Colombo area. On 6 March 2005, around 5 p.m., he was 
arrested on suspicion of possession of heroin. He was forced into a police jeep, kicked in the 
chest by a constable, and driven to Kandana Police Station. Around 8.30 p.m., during 
interrogation by the OIC (Inspector of Police) and two constables in the Crime Branch Office, he 
was handcuffed and ordered to stand against a wall. He was questioned about the heroin with 
vulgar language, threatened that he should tell the truth, beaten all over his body with a T-56 rifle 
and a wooden baton, and slapped by the OIC over the course of two hours. He was struck with a 
baton at his knee, and later had difficulty walking as a result. He was forced to lie face down on 
a bench and two wooden batons were pressed behind his knees and on his neck. He was then 
brought back to his cell for a short while, but taken out again after midnight to the interrogation 
room where he was forced by three constables to sign a typewritten statement with his 
fingerprints. The following day he was produced before a magistrate, but could not report the 
ill-treatment as he was escorted by the police. He was subsequently transferred to Bogambara 
Prison where he stayed for 28 days. After that he spent 30 months in Welikada Prison in </p>

<p>Colombo and following a dispute with a prison guard he was transferred back to Bogambara 
Prison on 14 September 2007. He alleges that Mr. Bandara, a prison guard in Bogambara Prison, 
slaps and sometimes beats prisoners with a stick. He himself was beaten by him because he was 
wearing a Muslim cap. He expressed his wish to go back to Welikada Prison in order to be able 
to see his family more often, since they cannot afford the travel expenses to come to see him in 
Kandy. 
</p>
<p>68. <b>S. Laffer</b>, aged 21, Kinniya, Trincomalee. On 26 April 2007, he was arrested in 
Trincomalee on suspicion of theft of a gold chain and taken to China Bay Police Station, where 
he was interrogated by an inspector of police, a superintendant and a constable in the Crime 
Branch Office. Stripped to his underwear, he was forced to lie face down on the floor, and was 
handcuffed with his arms behind his back. He was beaten with a rubber stick of 50 cm in length 
on his head and on the soles of his feet in order to extract a confession. He was questioned where 
he obtained the chain, and threatened that he should tell the truth. Sitting on the floor and 
handcuffed under his knees, he was beaten on his back as well as kicked in the legs. The beatings 
continued for over a period of two hours. The following day, he was produced before a 
magistrate who upon seeing his injuries and being told of the treatment by the detainee, told the 
police to bring him to a hospital. At the hospital the detainee, who was handcuffed throughout 
the examination, received medical treatment in the presence of the police officer. The police kept 
the medical report. After the examination the detainee was brought to Trincomalee Prison where 
he stayed for one month. No allegation was made regarding ill-treatment in the prison. He later 
spent two weeks in Anuradhapura Prison before he was transferred to Bogambara Prison at the 
beginning of August 2007. He reported that in Bogambara Prison, the prison guard Mr. Rohetha 
(B-wing) is known for beating Tamil and Muslim prisoners with an iron bar. He himself was 
beaten by the officer on 5 August 2007. The beatings by Mr. Rohetha take place in the open 
space close to the laundry, behind the showers. Mr. Rohetha tells the prisoner to kneel down with 
his hands behind his back and then beats them. He has not reported the ill-treatment to the 
Chief Jailer because he is afraid of reprisals. 
</p>
<p>69. <b>Mohammed Nisar</b>, aged 26, Trincomalee. On 3 August 2007, he was arrested on 
Jawalay Road on suspicion of heroin possession. He was taken to Trincomalee Police Station 
and interrogated in the Crime Branch Office by four constables and one sergeant around 5 p.m. 
He was threatened that he should tell the truth about the heroin. During the questioning he struck 
a constable, and the police beat him. He reported that they forced him to sit with his legs 
outstretched on the floor, one constable held his arms, while another used a razor to cut him on 
his left arm and chest. He was later handcuffed behind his back and his head was forced under a 
table and he was beaten for 30 minutes until he fell unconscious. The next morning he was 
woken and forced to sign a prepared statement, and taken to the hospital for treatment. The 
police kept the medical report. On 7 August, he was taken to a magistrate and not given a chance 
to speak except to plead guilty or not guilty. The judge saw his injuries but did not say anything. 
Initially taken to Trincomalee Prison, where he stayed for 20 days, he was then transferred to 
Anuradhapura Prison, where he remained for 10 days, and then came to Bogambara Prison. 
He reported that he has been well-treated in the prison. On examination by the accompanying 
forensic doctor multiple thin linear scars, both old and healing, were present over the left arm 
and chest most prominently to the anterior aspect of the left forearm. The scars were mostly 
parallel and of generally uniform width suggesting that they had been inflicted by repeatedly 
running a sharp edge over the skin surface to produce shallow cut wounds. The overall pattern of 
injuries was strongly suggestive of self-infliction and on direct questioning the detainee stated </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
page 44 
 
</p>
<p>that he was right handed. When asked to reconstruct the position in which he claimed to be at the 
time the injuries were inflicted by a police officer standing in front of him with himself seated on 
the ground it was apparent that the backs but not the fronts of the forearms would have been 
exposed to any potential assault. For these reasons it was concluded that the injuries were self 
inflicted and that this allegation was false. 
</p>
<p>70. <b>Detainee</b>. Recently, he had to spend three days in the punishment cell. Before he was 
brought to the cell he was beaten with knotted electric cables by two prison guards. He received 
six strokes on his back by one of the guards in the prison kitchen and five strokes by the other 
guard in the office. The beatings were witnessed by other detainees. Afterwards he could not sit 
down or go to the toilet because of the pain. He reported that corporal punishment happened on a 
regular basis. One detainee named Vanni Sutha had recently been beaten severely and the marks 
on his back would still be clearly visible. He reported that sometimes the guards punish detainees 
for no reason and sometimes people get locked into the punishment cells for weeks. All 
detainees have to work in the mornings and evenings, regardless of whether they are physically 
fit. Inter-prisoner violence was common but the guards never intervened. 
</p>
<p>71. <b>Detainee</b>. During his time in the punishment cell he was only given mouldy smelling rice 
and vegetables. About three months ago, he was beaten by two guards in the office where a sign 
says &#8220;Location Branch&#8221;. The officers beat him with a cricket bat and a fan-belt on the soles of 
his feet, his calves and on his head. They wanted him to tell them that another officer smuggled 
tobacco into the prison but he did not say anything. He was beaten for approximately 20 minutes. 
Later he was locked into the &#8220;measurement&#8221; cell, where normally Muslim detainees conduct 
their fasting. After one month in the measurement cell he was released and after an inquiry, he 
was sent to the punishment cell. He reported that sometimes detainees get beaten heavily and are 
severely injured. They are either released or sent to another prison. Five days ago, a detainee 
named Vanni Sutha had been beaten heavily with a fan belt.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Detainee</b>. Across the right and left upper back, right flank and back of the right shoulder 
were multiple linear hyper-pigmented scars each 10 cm or more long and with occasional scars 
showing a &#8220;rail track&#8221; appearance indicative of a blow from a linear object with a circular cross 
sectional shape such as a stick or cabling. The appearance of the injuries was consistent with 
alleged beating or beatings some months or more previously. He reported that another detainee 
had been badly beaten recently and was sent to the hospital. One detainee had been beaten for 
one hour and his leg was severely injured. He had been transferred to Mahara Prison. Another 
detainee named Jayantha Kulasinghe (Vanni Sutha) had been beaten on 28 or 29 September 
because he had called the prison guard &#8220;Sir&#8221; in addition to his rank (detainees are not allowed to 
call guards by their ranks). Vanni Sutha was transferred to Welikada Prison. The names of the 
guards who were punishing detainees were Nimal, Palitha, Mutubanda and Kalugamitiya. He 
reported that these officers were specifically brought to the prison in order to beat detainees.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Detainee</b>. He was beaten in December 2006, and on this occasion, while other prisoners 
were holding him down a guard beat him with a black wire of a thickness of one&#8217;s thumb. 
Another guard beat him with a baton and when he raised his handcuffed arms in order to protect 
himself the guard broke his arm with the baton.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>74. On the day of the visit, one mentally ill man was held in a cell without any natural or 
artificial light. He has been on death row for 11 years.<b> </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
 page 45 
 
</p>
<p>75. Of the full complement of seven prison doctors, two, who had worked at the prison for 
three and four years respectively, were available for interview. Both doctors reported that they 
were required to ask all new detainee arrivals whether they had been assaulted by the police and 
they complied with this instruction. The detainees were able to reply freely and if there was an 
allegation then they were examined and injuries were documented. The majority of allegations 
were of beatings with batons and cables, suspension from the ceiling sometimes with suspension 
upside down (reverse butchery) and beatings to the soles of the feet (<i>falaqa</i>), and crushing of the 
fingers with blows. There were on average about 20 detainee admissions per day and it was their 
impression that a detainee with visible injuries was seen every two to three days. There had been 
no noticeable change in the number or pattern of injuries seen over the past three to four years. 
The problem appeared to be a general one with the police and there were no specific geographic 
areas or sections of the police force responsible. Neither did the physical abuse appear to be 
related to specific crimes except that persons accused of rape were invariably assaulted by the 
police. Review of prisoner admission forms between 12 August 2007 and 19 September 2007 
identified six cases of new detainees with injuries attributable to assaults with three of the cases 
specifically alleging assault by the police. For example, File No. 1264/07 recorded an assault by 
Kandy police on the night of 1 September 2007, using a cane pole and there was physical 
evidence of bruising over the left shoulder. File No. 1244/07 recorded an assault by the police 
three days previously with evidence of bruises over the back, the right leg, the right heel and the 
sole of the right foot. File No. 1145/07 recorded an assault by police at Wattegama Police Station 
on 10 August 2007 at 10 a.m. using a pole to beat the head. On examination there were abrasions 
to the left side of the face, swelling of the left cheek and a small laceration. 
</p>
<p>76. At the debriefing prison officials indicated that no complaints of ill-treatment were 
received from courts, or human rights organizations, or the Red Cross. However, it was pointed 
out by the Special Rapporteur that a high number of different prisoners indicated with consistent 
accounts identities of perpetrators, locations, and how and with what instruments the beatings 
were carried out. There was much evidence provided which could not be merely dismissed with 
denials. Chief Jailer T.I. Uduwara told the Special Rapporteur that sometimes the guards beat 
detainees if they have done something wrong. He admitted that he had received many complaints 
against the guards mentioned by the Special Rapporteur. However, he insisted that there was a 
likelihood that &#8220;the prisoners have done something wrong if we beat them&#8221;. ASP Chandrasekera 
confirmed the statements of the Chief Jailer. The ASP undertook to take appropriate action.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur recommends that prompt and independent investigations of all 
allegations of the beatings and other ill-treatment be carried out. Those responsible including the 
named alleged perpetrators Mr. Rohetha, Nihal, Palita, Mutubanda and Kalugampitiya as well as 
the Chief Jailer and the Prison Management should be suspended and brought to justice. <b>

<p>78.  The Special Rapporteur was received by the CID Director, Senior Superintendent of 
Police, Nimal Kulatunga, Inspector Senartne, and Sub-Inspector Jayawardene. He and his 
delegation had to wait for almost an hour to get access to the fourth and sixth floors. During this</p>

<p>A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
page 46 
 
</p>
<p>period, much activity was going on but the Special Rapporteur has no evidence that detainees 
were being hidden from him. In any case, it was obvious that the detainees were being informed 
about the visit and possibly received instructions about how to behave.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>79.  The day of the visit, there were a total of 21 detainees; 11 persons were detained on the 
fourth floor and there were 10 detainees on the sixth floor. The conditions of detention were 
appalling. On the fourth floor, some prisoners were detained in cells and others were, due to the 
lack of sufficient space, kept in normal offices where they had to sleep on desks. During the day 
these detainees had to sit in a waiting room under the surveillance of an officer. The detention 
area on the sixth floor consists of one large room with several small cage-like cells lining the 
wall. The 10 detainees are able to remain outside the cells. Washing facilities are accessible from 
the room. There is no natural light or fresh air in the room.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>80. Many of the detainees did not wish to speak to the Special Rapporteur out of fear of 
possible reprisals. Some other detainees requested absolute confidentiality. In general, the 
Special Rapporteur received many allegations of torture and ill-treatment of detainees by CID 
officers before and during his visit, primarily of persons suspected of terrorist activities (e.g. the 
case of Nicholas Stephen at the TID, whose torture at the CID was corroborated by medical 
evidence; see paragraph 10 above).<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Fourth floor 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>E.S. Dharmappriya</b>, a soldier. On 2 June 2007, he was arrested and held under a detention 
order for suspected kidnappings of wealthy individuals. He spent one and a half months on the 
sixth floor of CID. Then he was brought to the fourth floor. During the daytime when the office 
where he sleeps is used by CID officials, he remains in a rest room. At night he is brought to the 
office and has to sleep on the desk. He is questioned at least twice a week and sometimes every 
day. He reported that he had not been beaten or threatened. Families of detainees can visit every 
Thursday and Saturday.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Nishantha Gajanapake</b>, aged 40. On 20 June 2007, he was called on his mobile and 
summoned to come to a bus stop in Gampa where CID officers picked him up and brought him 
directly to CID in Colombo. He was suspected of being responsible for a number of abductions. 
He had served in the Sri Lankan Air Force and was later suspected to be a member of the Karuna 
group. One of his comrades is now a State witness against him. He is held on a three-month 
detention order. After he was brought to Colombo he was questioned almost every day for one 
month but now the inquiries appear to be over. The interrogations were conducted in a friendly 
manner. He complained that the food the detainees received was of poor quality. He is afraid of 
getting out of detention because he feels he is a target for different groups. He reported that CID 
agents expected the visit of the Special Rapporteur. They had even painted the walls for the visit.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Chammeera Daladawatta</b>, aged 35. On 26 June 2007, he was arrested. Previously, he was 
working as personal security officer of TID and was ordered by his superiors to collaborate with 
the Karuna group in 2005 and 2006. He reported that this is now being held against him. At the 
beginning of his detention, he was questioned every third day but he did not confess to anything.</p>

</p>
<p>For one and a half months he has not been questioned further. He felt that because he was a 
police officer he was treated well by the CID officers. In general, he thought that people were 
treated better in CID than in other places, such as TID or police stations. He is afraid of getting 
out of detention because he feels he is a target for different groups.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>H.M. Anura Bandarai</b>, aged 35, a lorry driver, Colombo. On 12 May 2007, he was 
stopped in Vavuniya and found to be transporting TV sets in which the LTTE had hidden 
explosives. He was arrested and taken to the police station where he spent two days before he 
was brought to CID. He does not have complaints against the officers.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Wijewickrama Manamperige Sampath Prethi Viraj</b>, aged 30. He is a soldier of the 
Sri Lankan Army. On 2 July 2007 he was summoned to CID where he was arrested. First, he was 
detained on the sixth floor, where he was bitten by a rat. He was also slapped in the face by a 
police officer on the sixth floor. The CID officers told him that he was going to be detained for 
one year. On 8 August, he was moved to the fourth floor. He is not allowed to leave his cell 
and can only talk to the detainee next to him. He wept often as he was distressed and wanted to 
get out.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Rasaiya Devarasa</b>, aged 33. He has been detained in CID since 1 June 2007. He comes 
from the Vanni area and his family visited him three times so far. In June, he was beaten with a 
wooden baton on his soles as well as on his stomach, and was handcuffed in a very 
uncomfortable position. This ill-treatment went on three times per day for 15 to 20 minutes.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>Nimantha Anura Bandara Ekanayake</b>, aged 26. He was arrested in the north of the 
country on 12 May 2007 and had to stay in the police station until 14 May 2007, before he was

<p><b>Sixth floor 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Jayasuriga</b>, aged 36. On 11 November 2006, he was arrested in Badulla because he had 
rented out his house to a Tamil who had apparently used his motor bike for the assassination of a 
minister. He was brought from his house directly to CID, where he was interrogated before being 
put in a cell. He is under a detention order and has spent almost one year in CID. He initially 
stayed on the fourth floor and then was moved to the sixth floor. He has not been interrogated for

<p>91. The Special Rapporteur recommends that allegations of torture at CID be thoroughly 
investigated and that detainees of CID be relocated to proper detention facilities.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>XVII.  WELIKADA PRISON, COLOMBO 
</b></p>
<p><b>(Visited on 2 and 7 October 2007) 
</b>92. The Welikada Prison, although the biggest prison in Sri Lanka, is in principle well kept. 
In 2006, the institution counted a total of 16,487 prisoners out of which 3,600 were in pretrial 
detention and 12,887 were convicted. In the wing where persons condemned to death are 
detained the Special Rapporteur found poor hygienic conditions and rat infestation. The Prison 
Director showed a very cooperative attitude to the Special Rapporteur.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>93. During his first visit, the Special Rapporteur spoke to a few persons who were on death 
row. The prisoners made no allegation of ill-treatment. On 7 October 2007, the Special 
Rapporteur interviewed only one person. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>R.K.G. Jayantha Kulasinghe</b> (also known as Vanni Sutha), aged 45. On 27 September 2007, 
he was asking officer Nimal in Bogambara Prison for soap. Because he had called him &#8220;Sir, 
officer&#8221;, Nimal took him to the &#8220;location&#8221; branch and beat him. Detainees are expected to 
address the guards as, among other things, &#8220;reverend priest&#8221;. He reported that the family of the 
person he had killed in Kandy a number of years ago bribed Nimal to beat him every now and 
then for no reason. First, Nimal slapped him on the right ear with his flat hand so that his hearing 
is still impaired. He did not bleed from the ear but felt dizzy. Then he was brought to the corner 
of the office which is called &#8220;location&#8221;. Nimal has his desk there. It was 11 a.m. and many 
officers were sitting and working in the office, among them also senior officers. Nimal said, 
&#8220;You must learn how to speak to officers. We are the bosses and we can do what we want.&#8221; 
Other detainees were ordered to hold him down while Nimal was beating him on the knees with 
a baton. He then had to stand spread-eagled against the wall while Nimal was beating him with a 
thumb-thick knotted electric cable on his back. After each blow Nimal straightened the cable 
again. After 10 blows he could not stand the pain anymore and sat down. He begged Nimal not 
to beat him anymore but he continued. In order to protect his face he raised his arms. More than 
100 detainees were watching the scene through the office window. Nimal shouted dirty words 
about his mother at him, ordered him to kneel, apologize to the officers, and demanded that he 
worship him. When he did as he was ordered Nimal stopped the beating. He told him to go to 
the prison doctor. His shirt was soaked with blood and torn from the ill-treatment. Already 
on 30 August he had been ill-treated by the same guard. Normally he is detained in Colombo but 
because he has also a case in Kandy he was brought to Bogambara Prison for 14 days. After he 
had complained of the beatings he was transferred back to Colombo. He had shown the marks of 
the beatings to a judge who had told him to complain to Bogambara&#8217;s Chief Jailer. He 
complained four times but nothing happened. The Chief Jailer told him that he had nothing to do 
with this. He was not brought to the doctor, and treated the wounds by himself with tea.</p>

<p> A/HRC/7/3/Add.6 
 page 49 
 
</p>
<p>In Colombo he had not shown the torture marks to anyone because he was afraid of being 
brought back to Bogambara. He has to present himself to the court in Kandy on 5 February 2008 
and is frightened of being detained in Bogambara Prison again. He made no complaints 
regarding his treatment in Welikada Prison. On examination by the forensic doctor there were 
five fresh linear healing injuries to the back all aligned horizontally.The largest lesion was 
a 30 by 1 cm &#8220;rail track&#8221; lesion. Below this was a 10 by 0.5 cm linear area of freshly developing 
scarring with puckering of the margins. Over the lumbar area of the lower back were 
three horizontal parallel broader areas of scabbing and developing scarring two of which were 
15 by 1.5 cm and one of which was 8 by 2 cm. There were corresponding freshly repaired tears 
approximately 3 and 8 cm in length to the shirt. Over the back of the right forearm just below the 
elbow was a horizontal linear healing lightly scabbed injury. The pattern of injuries was 
indicative of a beating to the back using a linear object with a circular cross sectional shape 
while the victim was relatively immobile but at one point sustaining a defensive type injury 
when raising the right arm for protection. The age of the injuries as assessed from the degree of 
healing was consistent with the time frame alleged and the pattern of injuries was very strongly 
corroborative of the circumstances of infliction alleged.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>95. The Prison Director promised that Mr. R.K.G. Jayantha Kulasinghe would get medical 
treatment and not be transferred back to Bogambara Prison. In addition, he explained that he will 
initiate an investigation regarding the case. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>XVIII.  NEW MAGAZINE PRISON (FEMALE WARD), COLOMBO 
(Visited on 7 October 2007) 
</b></p>
<p>96. On the day of the visit, the New Magazine Prison had an inmate population 
of 626 prisoners, of which 189 were convicted prisoners, 408 were on remand, 25 were 
on appeal for life and death sentences, and four were being held as LTTE suspects. 
Thirty-three children were also held together with their mothers in the prison, including 17 boys 
and 16 girls. The female ward is very well kept and clean. There is a very well equipped 
&#8220;day care&#8221; for the children of the prisoners. However, the pretrial detention wing is heavily 
overcrowded. The Special Rapporteur&#180;s delegation was received by Chief Jailer 
Kumari Rathnaweera.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Detainees, female</b>. In May 2007, the two sisters were arrested on suspicion of membership 
in the LTTE. Both women were questioned in a police station by male officers and asked to sign 
a statement in Sinhalese. Though no violence was used they were subjected to vulgar language. 
They were transferred to Boosa the next day where they remained for four months. At Boosa, 
they were again interrogated. They signed statements out of fear without knowing what they 
were signing because it was in Sinhalese. They were later transferred with all the women to 
TID in Colombo, where they stayed for two days, and then to Magazine Prison in Colombo 
on 1 October 2007. Neither woman made allegations regarding ill-treatment in detention.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>M.W.R</b>., aged 20. She was transferred from Boosa TID Detention Centre together with the 
sisters, above. She was arrested (together with her mother) at her house near Batticoloa and taken 
to Kalmunai Police Station on 9 September 2007. While her mother was released she was kept in 
custody at the police station until 19 September 2007 and then transferred to Boosa TID 
Detention Centre. She made no allegations, but was very scared.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>XIX.  COLOMBO REMAND PRISON 
</b></p>
<p><b>(Visited on 7 October 2007) 
</b>99. The Colombo Remand Prison is a very old institution and the conditions of detention are 
appalling: the institution is extremely overcrowded and prisoners are detained in poor hygienic 
conditions. On the day of the visit there were a total of 1,552 detainees. Ninety persons were 
convicted, 1,332 persons were in pretrial detention and 130 persons were detained under the 
Emergency Regulations. Eighty-five of them were detained in the G Ward, which is a special 
ward for LTTE suspects. Due to a lack of space 45 other suspects were detained in the I Ward.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>100. The Special Rapporteur interviewed detainees that were transferred from Boosa Camp 
shortly before his visit. Most of them requested their names not to be cited in the report.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>101. Twenty-one detainees (17 Tamils and 4 Sinhalese) were questioned on what forms of 
torture and ill-treatment they had to endure. Seventeen were beaten with batons or sticks; 
13 were handcuffed in an uncomfortable position; 10 were subjected to the &#8220;parrot&#8217;s perch&#8221; and 
were lifted in this position; 2 were suspended by their thumbs for 15 and 30 minutes respectively 
(in Trincomalee and Jaffna army camps); 6 were hung upside-down with their legs bound 
together; 10 had a plastic bag with petrol put over their head; 3 had a stick inserted into their 
penis; 3 had gasoline poured over their penis; 1 had his penis tied and pulled; 4 were held in a 
&#8220;strappado&#8221; position on the ground; 11 were subjected to &#8220;<i>falaqa</i>&#8221;; 4 had their penis squeezed in 
a drawer; 10 were beaten on their joints (knees, elbows and shoulders); 1 was burned with a 
soldering iron; 12 were beaten on their ears, of which 8 still had problems hearing; 7 were beaten 
on the top of their heads; 1 was beaten with a gun on his stomach; 8 were threatened with a gun; 
1 was fired at with a gun; 2 had blood in their urine; and 13 were kneed in their sides (kidneys). <b> 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Thavaraja Kokilakrihnan</b>. On 30 March 2007, he was summoned to Therekovil Police 
Station and arrested. He was held there for three days. The first day, he was taken into a small 
room and beaten by eight police officers with cricket stumps and cricket batons. Then he was 
handcuffed behind his back and his feet were tied together. A bag filled with petrol was pulled 
over his head for about six minutes and he was beaten on his ears. Later he was suspended 
naked with a nylon rope around the handcuffs and hands to a fan on the ceiling and beaten for 
20 minutes. During this time, he was raised and lowered to the ceiling several times. The second 
day he was beaten. On the third day, he was ordered by a policeman to run away and told that he 
would be shot in the back as he ran away. The detainee was forced to sign a statement in 
Sinhalese which he did not understand. Superintendant Karunathilake and Sergeant Peremunage 
were involved in the torture and ill-treatment. After three days he was transferred to Ampara 
Police Station/Crime Branch were he stayed for one month. Three constables from the Crime 
Branch used to get drunk during the night-time, and regularly took him out of his cell and beat 
him with a police baton and cricket stumps on his back. He was usually handcuffed during the 
beatings. On 1 May 2007, he was transferred to Boosa TID Detention Centre where he stayed 
until early October before being transferred to Colombo Remand Prison, shortly before the 
Special Rapporteur&#180;s visit. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/3/Add.6

</p>
<p>103. <b>Kendemarakilega Anura Silva</b>, aged 23. He was arrested by the police on 28 March 2007 
at 4 p.m. in Ampara and was brought to Ampara Police Station where he was detained for one 
month and five days. Then he was transferred to Thirukovil Police Station. The police officers 
brought him to the kitchen in order to hide him from his relatives. He was blindfolded, 
handcuffed behind his back and shackled. A rope was bound around his body on which he was 
suspended. He was beaten with cricket batons all over his body. After the beatings he was seated 
and tied to the window. Two police officers, SI Karunatileka and Kaluarachchi, said that they 
were going to prove that he was a member of the LTTE. They heated a flat metal bar, which was 
approximately as long as an arm and thick as a finger, with which he was burned on his legs. 
His wife later informed the ICRC. A representative came five days later and spoke to him in 
private. He told her of the torture and she promised to come back after three days. In the 
meantime, officer Karunatileka threatened him not to complain to her again. In May he was 
brought to Boosa. Officer Nishanta at Boosa claimed that the burning marks were in fact bullet 
wounds and accused him of being a member of the LTTE. In the following three months he was 
tortured and beaten in regular intervals. One night in July, three drunken policemen tortured him 
with a soldering iron. He still has two dozen burning marks on his chest. One of the policemen 
was Nishanta, the others were called Nanyakkara and Silva. Forensic evidence corroborated his 
allegations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>104. The Special Rapporteur recommends that Mr. Kendemarakilega Anura Silva, who was 
extremely depressive and suicidal during the interview, receive proper medical and psychiatric 
rehabilitation and be released.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Detainees, male</b>. The two detainees reported to the Special Rapporteur that they were 
suspended by their thumbs in the respective army camps where they were held. After their 
description of the ill-treatment, the forensic doctor examined their thumbs, which in one case 
showed thin linear scarring consistent with suspension by wire as alleged. Both described very 
severe pain on suspension and loss of consciousness from pain, with apparent dislocation of the 
thumb joints. Both gave similar accounts of the physical effects of the alleged ill-treatment on 
their ability to use their thumbs for such day-to-day activities as eating and holding drink 
containers. On examination six and three months, respectively, after the events, both displayed 
weakness of the thumbs in pinching and gripping movements but no weakness of the other 
digits, and both complained of the continuing practical effects of this on day-to-day life.
