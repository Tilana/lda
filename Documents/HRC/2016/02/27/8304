Republic&#8221;.  In paragraph 18 of the resolution, the Human Rights Council requests the High

its nineteenth session. The present report is submitted pursuant to this request.  It contains 
information on the status of implementation of resolution S-17/1 as of 5 December 2011.

<p><b> II. Implementation of Human Rights Council resolution S-17/1 
</b></p>
<p>2. In paragraph 13 of resolution S-17/1, the Council decides to dispatch urgently an 
independent international commission of inquiry, to be appointed by the President of the 
Human Rights Council, to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights 
law since March 2011 in the Syrian Arab Republic, to establish the facts and circumstances 
that may amount to such violations and of the crimes perpetrated and, where possible, to 
identify those responsible with a view to ensuring that perpetrators of violations, including 
those that may constitute crimes against humanity, are held accountable. 
</p>
<p>3. In response to paragraph 13, on 12 September 2011 the President of the Human 
Rights Council appointed three high-level experts as members of the commission of 
inquiry: Paulo Pinheiro (Chairperson), Yakin Ert&#252;rk and Karen Koning AbuZayd. The 
commission of inquiry started its work on 26 September 2011.  
</p>
<p>4. In paragraph 14 of resolution S-17/1, the Council requests that the report of the 
commission of inquiry be made public as soon as possible and, in any case, before the end 
of November 2011, and also requests it to present a written update to the report on the 
situation in the Syrian Arab Republic at the nineteenth session of the Human Rights 
Council, in an interactive dialogue with the participation of the High Commissioner. 
</p>
<p>5. The report of the independent international commission of inquiry on the Syrian 
Arab Republic was presented to the President of the Human Rights Council on 28 
November 2011. The commission of inquiry will submit a written update on the human 
rights situation in Syria to the nineteenth session of the Council, under agenda item 4. 
</p>
<p>6. In paragraph 15 of resolution S-17/1, the Human Rights Council decides to transmit 
the report of the commission of inquiry and the update thereto to the General Assembly, 
and recommends that the Assembly transmit the reports to all relevant bodies of the United 
Nations. 
</p>
<p>7. The President of the Human Rights Council transmitted the report of the 
commission of inquiry on 28 November 2011 to the President of the General Assembly.

the High Commissioner to provide the full administrative, technical and logistical support 
needed to enable the commission of inquiry to carry out its mandate. 
</p>
