no past, current or anticipated prohibited direct or indirect contacts or

subsidiaries of other U.S.
companies, have engaged in contacts and transactions with the Listed Countries 
in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Prior sales to the Listed
Countries are for oil field service equipment (primarily wellhead and flow 
metering
equipment) and associated services related to the installation of that 
equipment. Contacts with the governments or government-controlled entities of 
the Listed Countries occurred primarily through local sales representatives of 
the non-U.S.
subsidiary, but in no case did such contacts involve approval or facilitation by
U.S. persons or prohibited U.S. content. Under the agreements with these sales 
representatives, the sales representatives are required to comply with 
applicable laws
and regulations, including any U.S. laws and regulations that might impose 
restrictions on sales to the Listed Countries. </P>

December&nbsp;31, 2012, in 2009, like many
other companies, the Company adopted a policy directing the Company&#146;s non-
U.S. subsidiaries to effectuate an orderly withdrawal from doing business with 
the Listed Countries. This policy prohibited entering into new commitments 
involving the
Listed Countries, but did not require the non-U.S. subsidiaries to cease 
performance of existing commitments, provided such commitments could be 
performed in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and such 
commitments could not be
extended or expanded. Furthermore, following the issuance of the June&nbsp;3, 
2013 Executive Order 13645 (effective July&nbsp;1, 2013) (the &#147;Executive 
Order&#148;) imposing additional sanctions on Iran, the Company issued a further

its non-U.S. subsidiaries making them aware of the Executive Order and requiring

referred to above. These obligations consist of performance of delivery, 
maintenance and support obligations associated with contracts executed prior to 
the adoption of
the Company&#146;s policy in 2009. The Company has neither entered into any new 
agreements, arrangements or other contacts with the governments of the Listed

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times

U.S. subsidiary sales to the Listed Countries accounted for ***, *** and less 
than *** of
the Company&#146;s consolidated revenue in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. 
The Company had no sales to the Listed Countries during the first quarter and 
second quarter of 2013. While some residual service-related activities by non-
U.S.
subsidiaries may occur, the Company expects these to be insignificant since all 
remaining outstanding commitments have been substantially completed. Pursuant to
the Company&#146;s 2009 policy and adherence to the Executive Order, the Company
will
not recognize any additional revenue from the Listed Countries. Furthermore, 
neither the Company nor its non-U.S. subsidiaries have investments or capital 
assets in any of the Listed Countries. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times

with the Listed Countries to be quantitatively material relative to the overall 
business of
the Company. Furthermore, the Company does not believe that its non-U.S. 
subsidiaries&#146; de minimis level of sales into the Listed Countries, coupled 
with its policy decision to effectuate an orderly withdrawal from transactions 
with the Listed
Countries, should be quantitatively or qualitatively material to a reasonable 
investor in making an investment decision. The Company is aware that states such
as Iowa and Minnesota have adopted legislation requiring shareholder engagement 
with, and
targeted divestment from, companies operating in Sudan. Other than letters from 
representatives of public pension funds in Iowa and Minnesota, who we believe do
not hold a significant amount of Company stock, the Company has received no 
similar

potential investors. </P>
