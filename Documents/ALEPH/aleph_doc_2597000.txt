5 Business Review and Prospects and Management’s Discussion and Analysis
5.1
Business Review
The first half of 2016 saw weak global economic recovery. China’s GDP grew by 6.7% year on year. The oil products
pricing mechanism was further improved with the price floor put into place. Domestic consumption of oil products was
up by 4.4%, driven by gasoline and kerosene consumption growth and partly offset by continuing decline in diesel
consumption, showing continuous divergence in the consumption mix of oil products. Domestic consumption of major
chemicals  continued  to  grow.  Ethylene  equivalent  consumption  increased  by  1.7%  compared  with  the  first  half  of
2015. Chemical prices were lower following decline in feedstock prices, but chemical products margin remains at
high levels.
In the first half of 2016, international crude prices recorded a sharp decline from prices in the first half of 2015, and
bottomed out during the period, with the average spot price of Platts Brent at USD 39.81 per barrel, 31.2% below the
level in the same period last year.

Movement of International Crude Oil Prices
Operation Review
Exploration and production
To address the challenge of low oil prices, we effectively optimised exploration and development activities in the first
half  of  this  year.  Our  continuing  efforts  in  exploration  paid  off  with  new  oil  discoveries  in  the  Tahe  of  Xingjiang
Autonomous Region, the Beibu Gulf off-shore in Guangxi and the Yin-E Basin in the Nei Mongol Autonomous Region
and new natural gas findings in west Sichuan and the Erdos Basin. A strong focus was placed on the development of
natural gas. Phase Two shale gas development project in Fuling Shale Gas field further facilitated our shale gas
development. Production in the first half of 2016 was 218.99 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which domestic crude
production was 128.38 million barrels, overseas crude production was 25.79 million barrels, and total gas production
was 388.69 billion cubic feet. In production, we strengthened cost discipline, reduced high-cost oil production, and
increased natural gas production.

In the first half of this year, we adjusted our product mix in response to sharp increase of throughput from independent
refineries  and  ample  market  supply.  We  further  optimised  our  oil  product  slate  by  increasing  the  production  of
gasoline, kerosene and light chemical feedstock and decreasing diesel-to-gasoline ratio to 1.17, reduced our crude
purchasing costs, moderately increased refined oil products export and pressed ahead with oil products standards
upgrading. Centralised marketing of the lubricant, LPG and asphalt businesses helped enhance the profitability of
those products. In the first half of 2016, we processed 116 million tonnes of crude oil and produced 73.26 million
tonnes of refined oil products, with production of gasoline and kerosene up by 3.74% and 3.36%, respectively, from
levels in the first half of 2015.

Marketing and distribution
In the first half of 2016, we coordinated and optimised resources and took full advantage of the synergy between our
fuel and non-fuel businesses, achieving growth in both total business volume and retail sales despite ample domestic
fuel supply and strong competition in the market. In addition, we adjusted marketing efforts by increasing the retailing
of premium products with high octane number. We further improved our product pipeline network, accelerated the
building of service stations and optimised marketing network. The total sales volume of refined oil products in the first
half of 2016 was up by 4.5% from the corresponding period last year to 97.17 million tonnes, of which domestic sales
accounted for 86.51 million tonnes, up by 3.1%. Non-fuel business transaction was up by 43% from the first half of
2015 to RMB 18.5 billion owing to Internet+ marketing promotions and other measures

Chemicals
In the first half of this year, we continued to adjust the structure of our feedstock, products and facilities to address
market changes and maximise profit. We further lowered the feedstock cost for ethylene, strengthened the integration
among  production,  sales,  product  R&D  and  customer  needs,  and  continuously  optimised  operations  of  our
manufacturing facilities, which has achieved great results. Ethylene production for the first half of 2016 was 5.478
million  tonnes,  up  by  0.38%  from  the  corresponding  period  last  year.  We  strengthened  the  R&D,  production  and
marketing capabilities of new high value-added products, with the ratio of performance polymer reaching 58% and the
differential ratio of synthetic fiber reaching 83.2%. We also focused on bettering customer services and enhancing
customer loyalty. At the same time, we held firm to our strategies of low inventories and differentiated marketing. In the
first half of 2016, total chemicals sales volume increased by 8.3% from the corresponding period last year to 32.82
million tonnes.

Safety Management and Environmental Protection
Work safety has always been at the core of our operations and we continued to strengthen our safety management in
the first half of 2016. We conducted special work to reduce safety risks in our oil and gas pipelines and tank farms, put
protective measures in place to cope with strong rainfall and bad weather, spared no efforts to implement prevention &
control measures, and realised safe production in general.
We  strengthened  our  green  and  low-carbon  strategy  by  intensifying  our  work  in  environmental  protection,  energy
conservation and emissions control. We continued to advance our energy performance contract model and energy
management system, defined the projects of our Energy Efficiency Doubling initiative, and completed our Clear Water,
Blue  Sky  program.  In  the  first  half  of  2016,  energy  intensity  was  down  by  0.69%,  chemical  oxygen  demand  in
discharged  waste  water  was  down  by  7.88%,  ammoniac  nitrogen  emissions  were  down  by  3.96%,  sulfur  dioxide
emissions were down by 6.88%, and NOx emissions were down by 3.02% from levels in the corresponding period last
year, and all hazardous chemicals, discharged water, gas, and solid waste were properly treated.

5.1.3
Capital Expenditures
To address the changing business environment, we improved the decision-making mechanism for investments and
focused  on  managing  investment  return  and  increasing  growth  quality  and  efficiency.  In  the  first  half  of  2016  total
capital  expenditure  was  RMB  13.474  billion.  Capital  expenditure  for  the  exploration  and  production  segment  was
RMB 5.168 billion, mainly for Phase Two of shale gas development in Fuling, the LNG terminals in Guangxi and

5.2
Business Prospects
China’s economic growth is expected to be steady in the second half of 2016, which will drive the growth of domestic
demand for refined oil products and petrochemical products. The consumption mix of oil products shall continue to
change, and demand for chemical products shall be gradually going for more high-end products. Yet over-supply in
the international oil market is likely to persist, and international oil prices will stay at a low level. The competitiveness
of naphtha based chemicals will remain strong.
Against this background, we will spare no effort to expand our markets, optimise our operations, control costs, adjust
asset structure and manage risks with the following focuses in each business segment:
We will maintain the level of input intensity in exploration and optimise planning of our exploration program to achieve
high efficiency. For oil, we will strengthen progressive exploration and reservoir evaluation for oil projects to increase
the quality of new projects and apply refined management over existing projects. For natural gas, we will speed up
key capacity building projects, optimise production and sales, intensify reservoir assessment in west Sichuan and
Northeast China, and press ahead with development of Fuling Shale Gas field. In the second half of 2016, we plan to
produce  147  million  barrels  of  crude  oil,  of  which  domestic  production  will  account  for  125  million  barrels  and
overseas production will account for 22 million barrels. We plan to produce 421.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas
during the period.
11
We  will  base  our  refining  facility  utilisation  rates  on  market  conditions,  allocate  crude  resources  and  refining
throughput  according  to  profit  margins  and  regional  conditions,  optimise  our  product  slate  to  increase  high  value-
added products, and emphasise technology R&D. We will continue to lower the diesel-to-gasoline ratio, upgrade the
refined  oil  products’  quality,  increase  clean  fuel  production  and  expand  the  sales  volume  of  lubricants,  LPG  and
asphalt. We plan to process 120 million tonnes of crude in the second half of this year.
We will focus on both sales volume and profits in marketing and distribution business, with profits as priority goals of
operation. We will redouble efforts to expand our markets, increase our retail volume, optimise our sales structure,

In the first half of 2016, the Company’s turnover was RMB 856.8 billion, representing a decrease of 16.2% year on
year. The change was mainly attributable to the decline of international crude oil price and petrochemical product
prices as compared with the same period of last year.

Most of the crude oil and a small portion of natural gas produced by the Company were internally used for refining and
chemical production with the remaining sold to other customers. In the first half of 2016, the turnover from crude oil,
natural gas and other upstream products sold externally amounted to RMB 23.0 billion, decreased by 20.9% year on
year,  accounting  for  2.6%  of  the  Company’s  turnover  and  other  operating  revenues.  The  change  was  mainly
attributable to lower prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as declined external sales volume of crude oil under
the Company’s profit-oriented production plan with a focus on optimisation of crude oil production.
Petroleum  products  (mainly  consisting  of  oil  products  and  other  refined  petroleum  products)  sold  by  the  Refining
Segment  and  the  Marketing  and  Distribution  Segment  achieved  external  sales  revenues  of  RMB  538.6  billion,
representing  a  decrease  of  13.0%  year  on  year  and  accounting  for  61.3%  of  the  Company’s  turnover  and  other
operating revenues. Those changes were mainly due to the decline of downstream product prices driven by sharp
drop of crude oil prices. The sales revenue of gasoline, diesel and kerosene was RMB 467.2 billion, representing a
decrease of 10.0% year on year, accounting for 86.7% of the sales revenue of petroleum products. Sales revenue of
other refined petroleum products was RMB 71.5 billion, representing a decline of 28.5% year on year, accounting for
13.3% of the sales revenue of petroleum products.
The  Company’s  external  sales  revenue  of  chemical  products  was  RMB  126.3  billion,  representing  a  decrease  of
10.8% year on year, accounting for 14.4% of its turnover and other operating revenues. The decreased sales revenue
as a result of lower chemical product price was partly offset by the company’s marketing effort in expanding market.

(2)
Operating expenses
In the first half of 2016, the Company’s operating expenses were RMB 844.1 billion, representing a decrease of 15.6%
year on year. The operating expenses mainly consisted of the following:
Purchased  Crude  oil,  products  and  operating  supplies  and  expenses  were  RMB  615.4  billion,  representing  a
decrease of 20.2% year on year, accounting for 72.9% of total operating expenses, of which:
‧Crude oil purchasing expenses were RMB 163.1 billion, representing a decrease of 35.2% year on year. Throughput
of crude oil purchased externally in the first half of 2016 was 85.88 million tonnes (excluding the volume processed
for third parties), decreased by 4.4% year on year. The average cost of crude oil purchased externally was RMB
1,900 per tonne, decreased by 32.2% year on year.
‧Other purchasing expenses were RMB 452.3 billion, decreased by 12.8% year on year. The change was mainly due
to the decline of crude oil prices, which resulted in lower purchase prices of crude oil related petrochemical products.
Selling, general and administrative expenses of the Company totaled RMB 33.1 billion, representing an increase of
2.5%  year  on  year.  The  change  was  mainly  due  to  increased  investment  in  R&D  and  intensified  conversions  of
research  outcomes  into  productivity.  The  R&D  expense  was  up  by  RMB  1.2  billion  year  on  year.  Under  the
Company’s cost-saving efforts, other expenses decreased as compared with the corresponding period of 2015.
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation expenses of the Company were RMB 49.1 billion, representing an increase
of 6.1% year on year. This was mainly due to the continued investments in fixed assets.
Exploration expenses in the first half of 2016 were RMB 4.7 billion, representing a decrease of 21.6% year on year.
This was mainly due to higher successful exploration rate and optimised deployment.
Personnel expenses were RMB 29.1 billion, representing an increase of 8.8 % year on year. The change was mainly
attributable to the improvement of our recruitment system, resulting in transfer of part of remuneration related expense
from selling, general and administrative expenses into personnel expenses.
Taxes other than income tax were RMB 112.8 billion, representing a decrease of 5.9% year on year. This was mainly
due to declined domestic consumption of diesel, resulting in a decrease of sales volume of diesel from refineries as
compared with the corresponding period of 2015, which cause a decrease of RMB 5.6 billion in consumption tax. The
special oil income levy decreased by RMB 0.8 billion as a result of decreased prices of crude oil and natural gas.

RMB  depreciation,  compared  with  a  net  gain  of  RMB  0.16  billion  in  the  corresponding  period  of  2015.  After  the
implementation  of  exchange  rate  reform  by  People’s  Bank  of  China  in  2015,  the  Company  has  adjusted  its  debt
structure in time by gradually deleveraging its debt in foreign currencies. As of the end of this period, the Company
had almost eliminated its foreign exchange rate risk exposure of debt in foreign currencies. Meanwhile, the Company
took measures to hedge exchange risk of accounts payable with financial derivatives while relevant earnings were
added into investment incomes, offsetting effects of currency fluctuations on the Company’s performance.

representing an increase of 15.8% year on year, This was mainly due to higher profitability of the Company’s non-
controlling subsidiaries in refining and chemicals segments.
(8)
Profit attributable to Owners of the Company
In the first half of 2016, profit attributable to owners of the Company was RMB 19.9 billion, representing a decrease of

crude  oil  and  natural  gas,  however,  profits  from  refining  and  marketing  segments  increased  while  performance  of
chemicals segment remained stable, demonstrating advantages of the Company’s integrated business model.

Changes in accounting polices
√ Applicable □ Not applicable
On 26 August 2016, the 8th meeting of the sixth session of the Board was convened, during which the “Proposal on
Changes in Accounting Policy of Sinopec Corp.” (the “Changes in Accounting Policy”) was considered and approved
unanimously by the Board.
In 2014, the International Accounting Standards Board published Amendments to International Accounting Standard
27 (IAS 27) — Separate Financial Statements. These amendments allowed entities to use equity method to account
for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their separate financial statements. Entities wishing to
change to the equity method must do so retrospectively. The amendment is effective from 1 January 2016.
In  order  to  eliminate  the  difference  regarding  subsequent  measurements  on  investments  in  joint  ventures  and
associates  between  separate  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  ASBE  and  IFRS,  Sinopec  Corp.
changed its subsequent measurements on investments in associates and joint ventures from cost method to equity
method in its separate financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS from 1 January 2016.
By adopting the amendments to IAS 27 — Separate Financial Statements, the balance of investments in associates,
investments in joint ventures, retained earnings and other reserves as at 31 December 2015 would be increased by
RMB 8,056 million, RMB 644 million, RMB 8,672 million and RMB 28 million in the separated financial statements
prepared in accordance with IFRS due to the retrospective adjustment.
36
The  Changes  in  Accounting  Policy  has  no  impact  on  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  ASBE  or
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
7.4 The Group has no material accounting errors during the reporting period.
7.5 Changes in the scope of consolidation as compared with those for last annual report
√ Applicable □ Not applicable
Sinopec Corp. and Sinopec Assets Management Corporation (“SAMC”) jointly set up Gaoqiao Petrochemical Co. Ltd.
for RMB 100 million in cash in 2016. Subsequently, Sinopec Corp. subscribed capital contribution with the net assets
of Gaoqiao Branch of the Company and SAMC subscribed capital contribution with the net assets of Gaoqiao Branch
of SAMC. The capital contribution was completed on 1 June 2016, after which Sinopec Corp. held 55% of Gaoqiao
Petrochemical Co. Ltd.’s voting rights and become the parent company of Gaoqiao Petrochemical Co. Ltd.
As  China  Petrochemical  Corporation  controls  both  the  Company  and  SAMC,  the  transaction  described  above
between  Sinopec  Corp.  and  SAMC  has  been  accounted  as  business  combination  under  common  control.
Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of Gaoqiao Branch of SAMC have been accounted for at historical cost, and the
consolidated financial statements of the Company prior to these acquisitions have been restated to include the results
of operation and the assets and liabilities of Gaoqiao Branch of SAMC on a combined basis.

changed its subsequent measurements on investments in associates and joint ventures from cost method to equity
