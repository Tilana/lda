<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar 
was established pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1992/58, and was 
recently extended by Human Rights Council resolution 19/21. The present report is 
submitted pursuant to Council resolution 19/21 and General Assembly resolution 67/233, 
and covers human rights developments in Myanmar since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report 
</p>
<p>to the Council (A/HRC/19/67) in March 2012 and to the Assembly (A/67/383) in October 
</p><p>2012. 
</p>
<p>2. From 11 to 16 February 2013, the Special Rapporteur conducted his seventh mission 
to Myanmar and met, in Nay Pyi Taw, the Minister for Home Affairs, the Minister for 
Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, the Attorney General, the Deputy Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, the Deputy Minister for Border Affairs, the Deputy Chief Justice and other 
justices of the Supreme Court, as well as several Members of Parliament and parliamentary 
committees. In Yangon, he met Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, members of the Myanmar 
National Human Rights Commission, civil society, prisoners of conscience held in Insein 
Prison, former detainees from Buthidaung Prison, the United Nations country team and the 
diplomatic community. He also visited Yangon University and met with the Dean and 
students, and visited the offices of the Myanmar Times.  
</p>
<p>3. He visited Rakhine State, where he met State authorities and community leaders. He 
visited camps for displaced persons for both Buddhist and Muslim communities in Sittwe, 
Myebon and Pauk Taw and visited Sittwe Prison. He also visited Kachin State, where he 
met State authorities and civil society, visited camps for displaced persons in Myitkyina 
and Waingmaw and visited Myitkyina Prison. He expresses thanks to the Government of 
Myanmar for its cooperation during the visit.  
</p>
<p>4. He visited Japan from 7 to 10 February and met with representatives of the Japan 
International Cooperation Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of 
Economy, Trade and Industry, the Parliamentary Senior Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, 
and civil society organizations. He also visited Thailand from 17 to 18 February and met 
with representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, civil society, United Nations 
regional and national offices and the diplomatic community. He is grateful to the 
Governments of Japan and Thailand for their cooperation. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur expresses thanks to the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Geneva, Bangkok and New York, for 
assisting him in discharging his mandate. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Prisoners of conscience 
</b></p>
<p>6. Since the formation of the new Government, eight amnesties have been granted and 
800 prisoners of conscience released. The most recent amnesty, announced by the President 
on 16 November 2012, resulted in the release of more than 50 prisoners of conscience and 
was granted in accordance with article 204 (a) of the Constitution and article 401 (1) of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur publicly welcomed the releases, while noting that article 
401 (1), (3), (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure enables the attachment of conditions, 
such as the imposition of the remaining sentence if a condition on which the sentence was </p>


<p>suspended or remitted is judged by the President not to have been fulfilled. He reiterates 
that the release of prisoners of conscience must be without any conditions. Credible sources 
indicate that over 250 prisoners of conscience remain behind bars. In this regard, he 
welcomes the announcement on 6 February of the formation of a committee to identify the 
remaining prisoners of conscience to be released, which follows the Government&#8217;s earlier 
</p>
<p>commitment made on 18 November 2012 to set up such a mechanism. According to the 
President&#8217;s Office, the Committee is to be chaired by Union Minister in the President&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Office, Soe Thane, and made up of representatives from Government ministries, civil 
society organizations and some political parties. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur hopes that this will lead to the speedy release of all 
remaining prisoners of conscience. Those who have already been identified should be 
released without delay. Furthermore, in view of allegations that persons continue to be 
arrested for political reasons, he recommends that the Committee is established as a 
permanent body. 
</p>
<p>9. During his latest visit, the Special Rapporteur visited Insein Prison and met with five 
prisoners of conscience: Aung Naing, Saw Francis, Tun Oo, Win Myint and Zaw Moe. He 
also visited Sittwe Prison, where he met with Tun Aung. The Special Rapporteur discussed 
these cases, along with the four international non-governmental organization (INGO) 
workers who remain in Buthidaung Prison, with the Home Affairs Minister in Nay Pyi 
Taw. The Minister acknowledged the importance of this issue and requested that the 
Special Rapporteur send him the list of persons mentioned during the discussion. 
</p>
<p>10. In Yangon, the Special Rapporteur met with recently released prisoners of 
conscience, including Gambira and Khaymar Sara, whom he had previously visited in 
Insein Prison. While overjoyed to be speaking to them in freedom, he was concerned to 
hear of the difficulties they faced in rebuilding their lives and that some had faced repeated 
detention since their initial release. He reiterates that it is the duty of the State to provide 
adequate medical and psychosocial services to those released; in particular, those who 
suffered ill treatment or prolonged periods of solitary confinement. Rehabilitation support 
should also be provided, given that many former prisoners face difficulties in finding 
employment or continuing their education. Furthermore, many former prisoners continue to 
be denied passports and cannot travel abroad, while some who are medical and legal 
professionals have had their licences revoked. The rights and freedoms of those released 
must be respected and any restrictions or conditions removed, and ways to provide just 
compensation need to be considered. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Committee to identify prisoners of conscience be given a broad terms of reference, so that it 
can look into these issues and propose necessary legislative reforms.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Conditions of detention and treatment of prisoners 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the ongoing practice of torture in places 
of detention in Myanmar. During his interviews with displaced persons in camps in 
Myitkyina and Waingmaw and prisoners in Myitkyina prison, he received allegations of 
arbitrary arrest and torture during interrogation by the military of Kachin men accused of 
belonging to the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). In Rakhine State, he received 
allegations that Muslim prisoners detained in Buthidaung Prison after last June and 
October&#8217;s violence have been tortured and beaten to death.  
</p>
<p>12. While in Yangon, the Special Rapporteur met with the sister of Myo Myint Swe, 
who died following torture during interrogation while in police custody. His case is 
consistent with other information the Special Rapporteur has continued to receive on 
professionalized torture techniques being used by police officers on suspects of violent 
crime with the aim of extracting confessions. He highlights that addressing human rights </p>


<p>violations through the criminal justice system is necessary to combat the culture of 
impunity that exists for acts of torture in police stations, prisons and in other places of 
detention, particularly during the interrogation of suspects. In addition, he encourages the 
Government to initiate human rights training programmes for police officers and prison 
officials, and to develop the capacity of other relevant public officials, including judges and 
doctors, who can intervene on suspected cases of torture.  
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the steps being taken by the Government to 
address the ongoing practice of torture in Myanmar. He commends the Government on its 
commitment last November to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) 
to resume prison visits in order to assess conditions and facilitate access to healthcare, and 
notes the subsequent successful completion of the first pilot prison visit in January. He 
encourages the Government to continue this good cooperation with the ICRC and reiterates 
his recommendation that national and other international monitoring groups be provided 
with access to prisons. To help systematize the process of prison visits to prevent torture, he 
recommends that Myanmar prioritize the ratification of the Convention against Torture and 
other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its Optional Protocol. 
Furthermore, he encourages the Government to invite the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment to conduct a country visit.  
</p>
<p>14. In Yangon, the Special Rapporteur also met with the wife of Phyo Wai Aung. He 
was deeply saddened to learn of the passing away of the former prisoner of conscience on 4 
January 2012, only five months after his release from Insein Prison. Phyo Wai Aung had 
previously informed the Special Rapporteur that his confession had been extracted as a 
result of torture. His death has also highlighted the inadequate health care that prisoners are 
provided with in Myanmar&#8217;s prisons. The Special Rapporteur recommends that urgent 
measures be taken to address this, including through the passing and implementation of a 
new Prisons Law, which he understands from the Home Affairs Minister will be considered 
by Parliament soon. He hopes the new law will comply with international standards, 
including the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, and 
also address concerns over the use of solitary confinement, transfers to remote prisons and 
non-judicial punishment. In this regard, he encourages the authorities to take into account 
the comments provided on the initial draft by the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime (UNODC) and OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges important progress that has been made in 
developing a more open environment for people to express themselves, including a freer 
media environment. In 2012, no journalists were jailed in Myanmar and the country rose 18 
places to 151 out of 179 States in the 2013 World Press Freedom Index.  
</p>
<p>16. In August 2012, in a significant step forward, pre-publication screening and 
censorship by the Press Scrutiny and Registration Division (PSRD) was brought to an end, 
and in January 2013 the PSRD was replaced with the Copyright and Registration Division 
(CRD). However, members of the press are still required to send printed copies of their 
publications to the CRD after publication, and the CRD can summon journalists to its 
headquarters and threaten newspapers with suspension. The Special Rapporteur also has 
concerns over the current registration process for print publications, where the threat of the 
revocation of licences could be used by State authorities as a tool for censorship, as well as 
concerns over the misuse of defamation laws to secure censorship. 
</p>
<p>17. In September, the Government established a 28-member Interim Press Council, 
which subsequently created four working committees to perform the tasks of resolving 
disputes and complaints, drafting the code of ethics and the new media law, finance and </p>


<p>management, and information and public relations. The Chair of the Council is retired 
Supreme Court Judge Khin Maung Aye and the Deputy Chair is journalist and writer 
Maung Wuntha. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged to see that membership is largely 
made up of independent journalists, some of whom he met in Yangon during his latest visit. 
The Council has been proactive in carrying out its tasks, such as engaging in mediation 
between the Government and two journals, <i>The Voice</i> and <i>Snapshot Journal</i>, for the 
withdrawal of Government lawsuits against the publications.  
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government&#8217;s decision to pass the 
responsibility of drafting a new media law to the Interim Press Council, which will help to 
ensure meaningful consultation with relevant stakeholders and a law that meets 
international standards. The law, which he hopes will be passed by the end of the year, will 
establish a permanent Press Council and new publishing guidelines, and should help to 
protect the freedom of expression of reporters and editors. However, he is alarmed about a 
proposed Printing and Publishing Enterprise Law, which came to his attention just prior to 
the finalization of this report, and calls for its urgent review by the Interim Press Council to 
help ensure it meets international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>19. In conjunction with the passing of a new media law, reforms to existing legislation 
also need to take place (see Recommendations).   
</p>
<p>20. During his meeting with journalists in Yangon, concerns were expressed over 
difficulties in accessing information from local and central Government officials. The 
Special Rapporteur recommends the passing of a right to information act to address these 
concerns.   
</p>
<p>21. He welcomes measures that have been taken to develop media plurality, which will 
enable people to receive a wide range of information and ideas. Around 350 journals and 
newspapers now exist in Myanmar, and from April 2013 private newspapers will be able to 
publish daily editions. He emphasizes that the criteria for granting such licences should be 
reasonable and objective, clear, transparent and non-discriminatory.  
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that reform of the broadcast media is lagging, 
and that the same commendable bottom-up approach that the Government is taking to 
reform the print media is not being applied to broadcast journalism. For instance, there are 
currently no measures in place to ensure plurality of broadcast media, such as community 
radio. Licensing regimes for broadcast media need to provide for an equitable allocation of 
frequencies between public, commercial and community broadcasters. He therefore 
recommends the establishment of an independent and public broadcasting licensing 
authority with the power to examine broadcasting applications and to grant licenses. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that public broadcast news remains heavily 
censored. He encourages the Government to take steps to ensure that public service 
broadcasting operates in an independent manner with editorial freedom, including 
providing funding in a manner that does not undermine its independence. The Government 
should also prevent undue media dominance by privately-controlled media groups that may 
be harmful to a diversity of sources and views. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the increased freedom for Internet users, with 
Internet caf&#233; owners no longer receiving police visits and no longer required to keep logs of 
the computers used by customers. However, he is concerned about the decision of 
Parliament on 17 January to investigate the online activities of a blogger who had criticized 
MPs&#8217; amendments to the Constitutional Tribunal Law. He highlights that uninhibited 
expression is particularly important in a democratic society for the purposes of public 
debate on State institutions and figures in the public and political domain.  </p>


<p><b> D. Freedom of assembly and association 
</b></p>
<p>25. While welcoming the more open environment that people in Myanmar now enjoy to 
assemble and demonstrate, the Special Rapporteur has concerns over the extent to which 
this right is being respected. This is partly because of shortfalls in the 2011 Peaceful 
Assembly and Peaceful Procession Act and its associated by-law, as well as the problematic 
implementation and enforcement of this legislation by State officials and police officers on 
the ground.  
</p>
<p>26. The ongoing arrest and detention of people involved in peaceful protests reflects 
shortcomings in the Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession Act. If a peaceful 
assembly or procession takes place without a permit from the authorities, article 18 of the 
Act provides for a punishment of up to one year imprisonment and a fine of 30,000 kyat. 
Furthermore, the Act is being used in conjunction with other laws, of which the Special 
Rapporteur recommends the concurrent amendment. Failure to gain permission to hold an 
assembly can result in two years imprisonment under articles 141-3, 145, 151 and 505(b) of 
the Criminal Code. The 1988 Law Relating to the Formation of Organizations provides 
sentences of up to five years for people who participate in groups that, in broad and vague 
terms, &#8220;attempt, instigate, incite, abet or commit acts that may in any way disrupt law and 
order, peace and tranquillity, or safe and secure communications; [or] affect or disrupt the 
regularity of state machinery&#8221;. Furthermore, the 1908 Unlawful Associations Act 
authorizes the President to declare, at his discretion, any organization to be unlawful. 
Subsequently, anyone who is a member of an association declared to be unlawful or who 
assists the operations of any such association can be imprisoned for between two and three 
years.  
</p>
<p>27. On 21 September 2012, 13 activists were arrested under the Act for leading a march 
in Yangon on International Peace Day to voice their opposition over the ongoing war in 
Kachin State, and in October, 10 activists from Mandalay and Bago were charged under the 
Act for participating in peaceful protests against electricity shortages in May. On 23 
November 2012, four gold mine workers, Ye Yint Htun, Naing Win, Nay Aung Htet and 
Saw Naung, were arrested for leading a march to Nay Pyi Taw against the Government&#8217;s 
decision to close the Moehti Moemi gold mine in central Myanmar. They were 
subsequently sentenced to six months imprisonment by Pegu court on 3 January 2013 for 
protesting without permission under article 18 of the Law, and article 505(b) of the 
Criminal Code. On 26 November, eight activists, including former prisoner of conscience 
Naw Ohn Hla, were arrested for protesting in Yangon against the expansion of the Monywa 
copper mine in the Letpadaung mountain range in Sagaing region. They were charged 
under the Act for protesting without a permit, and article 505 (b) of the Criminal Code. The 
eight were subsequently released on bail on 11 December. On 13 December, four activists 
in Mandalay and four activists in Monywa were arrested under article 18 of the Act in 
connection with protests organized on 12 December to demand a halt to the project. On 18 
January, the four activists in Mandalay were sentenced to one month in prison, but were 
released as they had already spent over 33 days in prison after their arrest. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that imprisonment for participating in a peaceful 
assembly, procession or march is not an appropriate punishment and urges the amendment 
of these laws accordingly. 
</p>
<p>29. The Act states that people should apply for permission to exercise their right to 
peaceful assembly five days in advance. This provision is currently being used by State 
officials to place unnecessary and disproportionate restrictions on freedom of assembly, 
with permits for assemblies being granted and denied arbitrarily and on political grounds. 
The Special Rapporteur therefore recommends that the Act be amended to bring it into line 
with international standards. Rather than a requirement to gain <i>permission</i> for an assembly, </p>


<p>organizers should instead be required only to <i>notify</i> authorities of plans to organize an 
assembly so that the State is able to facilitate the exercise of the right to freedom of 
peaceful assembly, and ensure the protection of participants, public order, public safety and 
the rights and freedoms of others.   
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur also has concerns over the police handling of protests. On 
29 November, police attempted to clear the main protest site near the Monywa (Letpadaung 
Taung) copper mine, resulting in 73 people, including 67 monks, being injured, with around 
30 persons suffering burn injuries. During his latest visit, the Special Rapporteur met with 
participants in the protests, who described how incendiary devices had been used to 
disperse crowds, resulting in serious injuries. In his meeting with the Home Affairs 
Minister, the Minister denied that any incendiary devices had been used. The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes the establishment by the Government on 1 December 2012 of a 
commission chaired by Aung San Suu Kyi to look into the Monywa copper mine protests, 
and hopes that the report will help to clarify whether excessive force was used and will 
recommend measures to bring any perpetrators to justice.   
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur also received reports that, on 23 November 2012, the four 
miners from Moehti Moemi gold mine in Yemathin township (referred to above) were 
assaulted and arrested by security forces while peacefully marching together with around 
70 fellow protestors to Nay Pyi Taw to protest the closure of their mine. Allegedly, around 
100 police officers armed with sticks charged the group and beat the peaceful 
demonstrators before arresting the four miners. 
</p>
<p>32. To help address this issue, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Peaceful 
Assembly and Peaceful Procession Act, its associated by-law, and police regulations, be 
amended to include provisions on the necessary and proportionate use of force in 
controlling public assemblies, as laid out by the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use 
of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. Law enforcement officials should be 
held liable by an independent and democratic oversight body, and by a court of law, for the 
unjustified or disproportionate use of force or for failing to intervene when necessary to 
prevent a violation of a person&#8217;s rights. Furthermore, he recommends more guidance and 
capacity development for law enforcement officials in dealing with crowd control in 
accordance with international standards. In this regard, he welcomes the openness shown 
by the Home Affairs Minister during their meeting to engage with the international 
community in ensuring that law enforcement personnel are abiding by international 
standards.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur notes progress in the Government&#8217;s efforts to promote 
socio-economic development and economic growth. The National Economic and Social 
Advisory Council, established in June 2012, has drafted a framework for further socio-
economic reforms, which is to be approved by the national planning commission shortly. 
President Thein Sein has publicly committed to halve the rate of poverty and hunger by 
2015 and to use the more than $6 billion in debt relief recently granted to Myanmar for 
poverty alleviation, and the construction of schools, hospitals and power generation. The 
Special Rapporteur highlights the importance of focussing on the right to education in the 
country&#8217;s democratic transition, and refers to his previous analysis and recommendations 
</p>
<p>on this right (A/HRC/16/59). 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur highlights that now is the time to put in place a human 
rights based approach to development to ensure that the flow of investment and opening of 
businesses is directed towards ensuring the realization of the human rights of the people of 
Myanmar. In addition to ensuring the effective implementation of core international human </p>


<p>rights and labour standards, the Special Rapporteur also urges the Government to 
implement the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and use the Principles for 
Responsible Contracts in the development and negotiation of investment contracts with the 
private sector.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about increasing reports and allegations of 
violations of land and housing rights across the country. While there are no clear data, land 
confiscations reportedly increased in 2012, particularly to clear areas for infrastructure 
projects and natural resource exploitation. He also notes allegations of the involvement or 
collusion of security forces, the police, local Government officials and private businesses. 
Notably, the majority of complaints received by the Myanmar National Human Rights 
Commission (MNHRC) and the Parliamentary Rule of Law Committee headed by Aung 
San Suu Kyi are related to land disputes and land confiscations. Farmers and civil society 
activists across the country have been protesting against land confiscations, including the 
continued demonstrations against the Letpadaung copper mine mentioned above. Farmers, 
often with no documentation to prove land ownership, face harassment or are arrested if 
they resist eviction (see A/67/383 for further analysis and recommendations). Parliament 
has established a commission to deal with land confiscations, and he encourages it to make 
public the results of its work.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Conflict and the situation of ethnic minorities 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur has previously highlighted concerns regarding the ongoing 
conflict and tensions in ethnic border areas, including the increased troop presence in 
various States, which have engendered human rights violations such as forced labour, 
portering and sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur has followed closely developments in Kachin and Northern 
Shan States and is concerned by the allegations he continues to receive of attacks against 
civilian populations, extrajudicial killings, sexual and gender-based violence, arbitrary 
arrest and detention, as well as torture. He has also received allegations of the use of 
landmines, the recruitment of child soldiers, as well as forced labour and portering 
committed by all parties to the conflict. He notes continuing reports of arrests of ethnic 
Kachin men suspected to have links with the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) or 
the KIA (mostly made under the Unlawful Associations Act, the Explosive Substance Act 
and the Emergency Provisions Act) and the torture of suspects to extract confessions. In 
February, the Special Rapporteur received similar allegations when he visited camps for 
internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Myitkyina (the two Jan Mai Kaung camps) and 
Waingmaw (the Thargaya and Lavoa camps). In Myitkyina Prison he met with Brang 
Shawng and Manam Tu, both ethnic Kachin men arrested in Kachin IDP camps and 
detained and charged on suspicion of belonging to the KIA. He has serious concerns that 
both were tortured by the military during interrogation to extract false confessions.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur is concerned by reports that a number of civilians were 
killed (26 between September 2012 and February 2013) and that an estimated 2,000 
persons were newly displaced (since November 2012) as a result of the recent escalation of 
the conflict, with the military reportedly using air power and heavy artillery to attack targets 
in and around Laiza.  
</p>
<p>39. Following talks in China, the Government and the KIO issued a Joint Statement on 6 
February and agreed to work on an overall framework for the de-escalation of the conflict 
and to establish a monitoring mechanism in this respect. The Special Rapporteur joins the 
Secretary-General in welcoming this development and urges all parties to continue dialogue 
towards genuine and sustainable peace in Kachin State. He also renews his call on the </p>


<p>Government and all armed groups to ensure the protection of civilians during armed 
conflict and to respect international human rights and humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>40. An estimated 75,000 people remain displaced to date and approximately 40,000 
among them are displaced in KIA/KIO-controlled areas, which United Nations convoys 
have not been able to access since July 2012. While community-based and faith-based 
organizations continue to provide humanitarian assistance in non-Government controlled 
areas, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the humanitarian needs in these camps are 
significant and that local organizations are facing shortages in supplies. He urges the 
Government to ensure quick implementation of its recent commitment to allow the United 
Nations and international organizations access to provide humanitarian assistance to all 
conflict-affected areas in Kachin State.  
</p>
<p>41. The Government has continued its dialogue with other armed groups on the basis of 
President Thein Sein&#8217;s road map to achieving peace. A Union Peacemaking Central 
Committee was established in May 2012 as well as a Myanmar Peace Centre in June to 
streamline negotiations, address post-ceasefire needs and consolidate peacebuilding 
activities. Continuing dialogue since preliminary ceasefire agreements were concluded with 
ten ethnic armed groups last year have resulted, for example, in the opening of liaison 
offices in a number of ethnic border States, and the signing of a 27-point agreement with 
the Chin National Front (CNF) in December which, <i>inter alia</i>, provides for the introduction 
of the Chin language in primary schools, the granting of licenses for newspapers and media 
publications in the Chin language, the provision of basic services in Chin State and the 
establishment of a Chin human rights committee to report on human rights violations to the 
CNF, the MNHRC and the State Government.   
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that any durable political solution must address the 
root causes of the conflict and should address the particular concerns of ethnic minority 
groups. He will closely monitor developments in ongoing political negotiations, in 
particular (a) how they address issues such as the disarmament, rehabilitation and 
reintegration of former combatants; (b) the verification and release of children recruited 
into armed groups; (c) assistance and support to those affected by the conflict, including 
landmine victims; (d) demining; (e) poverty alleviation and socio-economic development in 
ethnic minority areas; (f) natural resource management, revenue-sharing and self-
governance, including through a possible review of the Constitution; (g) the voluntary, safe 
and dignified return and resettlement of refugees and internally displaced persons (see 
A/67/383); (h) the promotion of the rights of ethnic minorities; and (i) a means of 
addressing continuing allegations of human rights violations. As political negotiations 
move forward, he hopes that civil society and affected communities, including women, will 
be fully consulted and involved in peacemaking and peacebuilding processes. In all these 
areas, the Government should continue to seek international assistance, including from 
OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by reports that no new landmines were laid in 
2012, that agreements have been signed with international non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) for demining programmes, and that the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and 
Resettlement has established a mine risk education programme. He remains concerned, 
however, that injuries and casualties caused by landmines continue to be reported and have 
apparently even increased, and that an estimated 5.2 million people live in areas 
contaminated by landmines in Myanmar, which also causes severe psychological trauma. 
Additionally, he continues to receive allegations of civilians being used as minesweepers by 
the military and non-State armed groups. He welcomes steps taken by the Government to 
become party to the Mine Ban Treaty and hopes for enhanced cooperation with 
international organizations to develop a comprehensive plan to end the use of landmines, 
establish accurate data on their location and use, ensure their systematic removal, and </p>


<p>rehabilitate victims. In Kachin State, where armed conflict continues, he urges authorities to 
begin the process of demining in the areas where the conflict has ceased.   
</p>
<p>44. Following the signing of the Joint Action Plan in June 2012 to end the recruitment 
and use of child soldiers, the Government released 42 underage recruits and monitoring by 
the United Nations Task Force commenced. Additionally, ethnic armed groups, including 
the Karenni National Progressive Party and the New Mon State Party signed agreements in 
November with an international NGO to eliminate the use of child soldiers and to institute 
measures to protect children caught in conflict-affected areas. Given that underage 
recruitment has reportedly not ceased and continues to be practised by the military and a 
number of armed groups, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that the United Nations and 
other independent actors must be provided with access to recruitment centres and conflict 
areas to monitor implementation of the Joint Action Plan.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur has also previously highlighted systematic and endemic 
discrimination faced by ethnic minority groups, including policies preventing the teaching 
of minority languages in schools, restrictions on the freedom of religion or belief and 
economic deprivation. For example, he continues to receive allegations of discriminatory 
regulations and restrictions on the construction and renovation of Christian places of 
worship in Chin State, the destruction of Christian crosses and the construction of Buddhist 
places of worship using forced labour from Chin Christians. He also continues to receive 
allegations of coerced conversions to Buddhism at the Government&#8217;s Border Areas 
National Races Youth Development Training (Na Ta La) Schools across the country. He 
renews his call for ethnic minorities to be granted fundamental rights, as enshrined in the 
Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious or 
Linguistic Minorities. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Situation in Rakhine State 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur believes that Rakhine State is going through a profound 
crisis that threatens to spread to other parts of the country and has the potential to 
undermine the entire reform process in Myanmar. Both Muslim and Buddhist Rakhine 
communities continue to suffer the consequences of violence that the Government has 
finally been able to control, though question marks remain over the extent to which 
excessive force has been used.  
</p>
<p>47. Since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report to the General Assembly last year, a new wave 
of violence in October saw a further 37,000 displaced, the vast majority of whom were 
Rohingya but with Kaman Muslims also targeted. The current number of internally 
displaced persons in Rakhine State now stands at approximately 120,000.  
</p>
<p>48. The Presidential Announcement 2/2012 of 31 October 2012 stated that from 21 to 
30 October 2012, 89 people were killed (bringing the total to nearly 200 deaths), 136 
wounded and 5,351 houses burnt down. There have also been ongoing allegations of 
harassment, arbitrary arrests, arbitrary restriction of movement, destruction of places of 
worship and restrictions on religious worship. The 27-member Investigation Commission 
set up by the President on 17 August 2012 to investigate the violence was originally due to 
present its report on 16 November 2012, but is now scheduled to present its report on 31 
March 2013. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur continues to receive widely divergent information on the 
scale of human rights violations in Rakhine State, particularly with regard to the number of 
deaths, injuries and victims of sexual assault committed during the violence. He reiterates 
the importance of the Investigation Commission&#8217;s report addressing the issue of human 
rights violations in Rakhine State. If, following the publication of this report, allegations of </p>


<p>human rights violations are not properly addressed, the Special Rapporteur offers his 
support to the Government to pursue further investigations and recommends that the 
Government consider asking OHCHR to support fact finding and monitoring in Rakhine 
State, in addition to supporting ongoing humanitarian efforts. He emphasizes that 
establishing the truth of what has happened and holding those responsible to account will 
be integral to reconciliation and re-establishing trustful and harmonious relations between 
communities.  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur visited IDP camps in Sittwe (Min Gan and Thet Kal Pyin 
camps), Pauk Taw (Kyine Ni Pyin camp) and Myebon (Taung Paw camp). He 
acknowledges the Government&#8217;s efforts and collaboration with the United Nations and 
</p>
<p>humanitarian organizations to improve the conditions in these camps since his visit last 
August, including the provision of food, shelter and access to water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p>51. He is concerned, however, about the lack of adequate health care in the larger 
Muslim camps, which he saw in Taung Paw camp, and urges the central and State 
authorities to ensure that adequate medical care is provided to all IDP camps. He notes that 
this is not just a matter of lack of resources, but requires the safe passage of humanitarian 
assistance to these camps. He learnt during his recent visit that local and international 
medical staff are unable to provide medical care to some of the Muslim camps due to the 
threats and harassment they face from local Rakhine Buddhist communities. The Special 
Rapporteur urges the local authorities to send a clear message through their networks that 
the harassment of staff is not acceptable. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, with the rainy season approaching in May 
and question marks over the maintenance of donor support, concerns over food and water 
may again resurface. He therefore urges the Government to ease restrictions on freedom of 
movement of persons inside the Rohingya IDP camps in order to ease dependency on aid 
by enabling people to fish, tend their land, and engage in trade and financial transactions. 
Easing restrictions on freedom of movement is also important for the mental health and 
human dignity of the people in these camps. This was highlighted to the Special Rapporteur 
during his visit to Taung Paw camp, which he described as feeling more like a prison than 
an IDP camp. In addition to easing restrictions on freedom of movement, the Government 
needs to take steps to reassure the people that it is not intending to make these camps 
permanent segregated settlements by consulting with them on plans for their voluntary 
return to their villages or relocation in Rakhine State. The coming rainy season in May, 
which will flood many of these camps, further increases the urgency of relocation in order 
to avoid a humanitarian disaster. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur has received reports that Muslim villagers, particularly in 
northern Rakhine State, have had their freedom of movement restricted by security forces, 
including Nasaka, to the point where they cannot access food or their livelihoods. He urges 
the Government to take immediate steps to ease these restrictions.  
</p>
<p>54. Throughout his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has received a large number of 
allegations of human rights violations committed by Nasaka. In view of the ongoing 
seriousness of these allegations, particularly against the Muslim community during the 
recent violence, he urges the Government to fundamentally reform this border security 
force and, in the meantime, suspend all of Nasaka&#8217;s operations in Rakhine State.        
</p>
<p>55. Speaking to IDPs, community leaders and local officials during his latest visit, the 
Special Rapporteur is aware that feelings of fear, distrust, hatred and anger remain high 
between communities. To address this requires leadership from the Government to end the 
stigmatization of the stateless population in Rakhine State. It also requires education, 
responsible local journalism, and mutually respectful dialogue between community leaders 
in which both sides are willing to make compromises to find solutions. During his visit to </p>


<p>Sittwe, the local authorities organized a discussion between Muslim and Buddhist 
community leaders. He urges local authorities to do more to promote such dialogue. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur highlights that mutually respectful dialogue cannot occur 
while discrimination based on grounds of ethnicity and religion remains unaddressed. As 
stated in previous reports, there exists in Rakhine State endemic discrimination against the 
estimated 800,000 members of the Rohingya Muslim community. The lack of a legal status 
of the Rohingya effectively gives State sanction to this discrimination, denying them access 
to many of their basic human rights. He reiterates his recommendation to Parliament that 
the 1982 Citizenship Act be amended to ensure that all persons in Myanmar have equal 
access to citizenship and are not discriminated against on grounds of ethnicity or religion. 
In the meantime, the current Act should be applied in a non-discriminatory manner to 
enable those with a just claim to citizenship to claim it on an equal basis with others. 
Immediate measures should be taken to remove other discriminatory regulations applied to 
Rohingyas, including with regard to marriage, freedom of movement, registration of new 
born children, and access to education and employment.  
</p>
<p>57. During his latest mission, the Special Rapporteur visited Sittwe Prison and met with 
Tun Aung as well as other Muslim and Buddhist prisoners. He believes that Tun Aung is a 
prisoner of conscience who must be released immediately (see annex), and that such a 
move is important to demonstrate that Myanmar has made a break from the past and no 
longer imprisons people for political reasons.  
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur notes reports that more than 1,100 persons have been 
detained in relation to the violence in June and October, the vast majority of whom he 
understands are Rohingya men and boys. He remains concerned about their possible 
arbitrary arrest and their conditions of detention and treatment, particularly those from the 
Rohingya community in Buthidaung Prison, who he believes are especially vulnerable to 
human rights violations. He is concerned over the possible torture and ill treatment of 
detainees, as well as the violation of due process rights, including access to legal counsel, 
judicial control over arrest, guarantees of <i>habeas corpus</i>, pre-trial detention as the 
exception rather than the norm, and the right to be tried without undue delay. In this 
context, he recommends that independent monitoring groups, both local and international, 
be provided with access to places of detention throughout Rakhine State, but in particular 
Buthidaung Prison, to verify the conditions and treatment of persons detained, as well as to 
courts for trial monitoring. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur notes that, since his previous report, all United Nations staff 
detained in relation to the violence in Rakhine State have been released. However, he 
remains concerned that the four INGO workers referred to in this same report remain in 
detention in Buthidaung Prison, and reiterates that the charges against them are unfounded 
and that their due process rights have been denied and calls for their immediate and 
unconditional release.  
</p>
<p>60. While acknowledging the efforts made by neighbouring countries to assist the 
Rohingya community, the Special Rapporteur reiterates the responsibility of States to 
respect and protect the human rights of all people within their borders, regardless of 
whether they are recognized as citizens. The responsibility of neighbouring States has again 
been highlighted with the taking to the sea by thousands of Rohingyas, expected to number 
20,000 between October 2012 and April 2013. He has received reports of the subsequent 
deaths of hundreds of people through drowning, including on 4 December 2012 when a 
boat carrying 200 Rohingyas sunk in the Bay of Bengal, resulting in a reported 160 deaths. 
He has received reports of the involvement of security officials in both Myanmar and 
receiving countries at every stage of the journey. The fact that Rohingyas put their lives at 
risk to take to the seas in unseaworthy boats itself indicates the extent of their suffering in 
Myanmar. In this context, he draws attention to the &#8220;non-refoulement&#8221; principle under </p>


<p>international law, which requires States not to return anyone to a place where their life or 
freedom would be at risk. Furthermore, Governments should ensure that the rights of 
Rohingyas, including access to health care, are respected and that the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is provided with unhindered access to determine 
whether they are seeking asylum and whether they qualify for refugee status. States should 
not push Rohingyas back out to sea or across land borders or arrest them. Immediate steps 
should also be taken by States to address allegations of trafficking and corruption. He 
reiterates that, in view of the regional dimensions, the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations should play a more proactive role in helping to identify solutions. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Democratic transition and establishing the rule of law 
</b></p>
<p>61. Parliament opened its sixth regular session on 9 January 2013, and was scheduled to 
approve the budget for the 2013&#8211;2014 fiscal year. The fifth regular session of the 
Parliament was held from 18 October to 22 November 2012, during which a new foreign 
investment law was adopted. Parliamentary debates took place, <i>inter alia</i>, on the 
Government&#8217;s response to the renewed violence in Rakhine State and the provision of 
</p>
<p>humanitarian assistance to IDPs in Kachin State. On 7 November, Speaker of the Upper 
House, Khin Aung Myint, announced that Parliament would not consider a proposal to 
amend the 1982 Citizenship Law as several MPs had objected. Parliament set up 
independent commissions to look into the social and environmental impact of the Monywa 
copper mine in Sagaing Division, and to investigate land confiscations. On 15 November, 
the Auditor General presented his report to Parliament, which contained findings 
concerning the misuse of funds (including, in some instances, embezzlement) by 15 
Government ministries during the 2011/2012 fiscal year. Parliament began drafting an 
Anti-Corruption Law, with support from UNODC and the United Nations Development 
Programme, and on 20 December 2012 ratified the United Nations Convention against 
Corruption, which entered into force on 19 January 2013. 
</p>
<p>62. On 26 December 2012, the President announced the third step of the country&#8217;s 
reform process since March 2011: administrative reform, focussing on transparency, 
efficiency, good governance and tackling corruption. This follows what the Government 
has described as the first step (political reform and national reconciliation) and the second 
step (economic reform) of the reform process. On 22 January, the President signed into law 
the Constitutional Tribunal Amendment Bill, which allows Parliament to challenge the 
Tribunal&#8217;s decisions and requires the President to consult with the two Speakers of 
</p>
<p>Parliament before appointing the Tribunal&#8217;s Chair.  
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur sees no evidence that the judiciary is developing any 
independence from the executive branch of Government. While acknowledging that this 
will take time, he reiterates that an independent judiciary lies at the very heart of a system 
of government that respects the rule of law. He urges the Government to pay more attention 
to this aspect in Myanmar&#8217;s reform process, on which he has made previous 
recommendations (see A/66/365, A/67/383, A/HRC/19/67).  
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the importance of the Government taking 
measures to improve the capacity of judges, including with regard to the incorporation of 
international human rights standards into judgements. He notes that courses are currently 
being run for the country&#8217;s more than 1,000 judges by the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and 
the Supreme Court, and recommends that modules on human rights and the United Nation&#8217;s 
Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary be fully incorporated into these 
trainings.  </p>


<p>65. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Supreme Court to utilize its constitutional 
powers to help infuse a culture of respect for human rights within the courts system and 
State institutions in general. One such means is through the greater utilization of the 
constitutionally granted powers to issue writs of <i>habeas corpus</i>.  
</p>
<p>66. In terms of improving people&#8217;s access to justice, the Special Rapporteur notes 
Myanmar&#8217;s constitutional provisions which guarantee the right of every citizen to equality, 
</p>
<p>liberty and justice (article 21 (a)). However, he is still aware that the courts are not an 
accessible or viable means for people to seek justice. He therefore recommends more 
proactive measures to improve people&#8217;s understanding of their legal rights and improve 
</p>
<p>access to the courts and other relevant institutions as a means of redress, including through 
the setting up of a system of legal aid and the establishment of citizens&#8217; advice offices. 
Furthermore, staff support to these offices can be supplemented through schemes which 
enable university students to train as advisers to gain credits toward their degree.    
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged by Supreme Court decisions in 2012 which 
reinstated 11 of the 32 lawyers he had cited in his previous report as being disbarred for 
political reasons, and continues to follow progress on the remaining cases. However, he 
remains concerned about information he has received of the ongoing intimidation of 
lawyers by State officials, including lawyers in Rakhine State seeking to provide legal 
counsel to Muslim defendants, as well as the arbitrary revocation of licenses (with some 
sources stating that 200 lawyers remain disbarred for political reasons). He reiterates his 
recommendation regarding the establishment of a strong and independent bar council, 
which will help to increase the protection of lawyers and improve the training and 
education of lawyers in the application of international human rights law at the domestic 
level. He will follow with interest progress in amending the Bar Council Act and Legal 
Practitioners Act.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur urges the Attorney General's Office to ensure that State 
prosecutors play a role in protecting the rights of suspects by acting as a check on the 
practices of the police in their interrogation of suspects and collection of evidence.  
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur notes the important and evolving role of Myanmar&#8217;s 
Parliamentary Committees. The Bills Committees of the Upper and Lower Houses are 
constitutionally mandated to vet draft legislation and report their findings to the joint 
session of Parliament. Both Houses also have committees that deal with the fundamental 
rights outlined in chapter VIII of the Constitution. He encourages one of these committees 
to establish itself as the focal committee for ensuring that all new legislation is vetted to 
ensure it is line with Myanmar&#8217;s international human rights obligations.     
</p>
<p>70. Following his meeting with the Attorney General, the Special Rapporteur was 
encouraged to learn that relevant Ministries, the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and Parliament 
</p>
<p>were considering reforms to a number of laws he had previously highlighted as not being in 
line with international human rights standards (see A/67/383). He reiterates his 
recommendation that target dates be set for the conclusion of the review, and urges proper 
attention to ensuring the amendments successfully bring the laws into line with 
international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>71. Regarding legislative reform in general, the Special Rapporteur reiterates the 
importance of a structured and coordinated process, in which new legislation is made public 
and widely disseminated to allow for meaningful consultation with relevant stakeholders, 
including civil society. Furthermore, sufficient time should be given to Parliament to 
properly consider the draft legislation.   
</p>
<p>72. During his meeting with the members of the MNHRC on 13 February 2013, the 
Special Rapporteur heard about the seven field investigatory trips undertaken by the 
Commission and the 2,868 complaints it had received over the past year. The Commission </p>


<p>had subsequently followed up on 830 complaints with the relevant Government Ministries 
and had received 51 responses (action was taken by the Ministries concerned on 33 cases). 
The Chair acknowledged that this response rate was not satisfactory and that the Ministries 
needed to be educated on the complaints mechanism and their obligations in terms of 
response. The Special Rapporteur encourages the MNHRC to make this information public 
in its Annual Report, particularly with regard to the recommendations that have been made 
on individual cases and the follow up that has occurred from the Government. He also 
encourages the Government to promptly act on complaints brought to its attention.    
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur notes that the enabling law of the MNHRC has not yet been 
passed, which he hopes will happen soon to bring the MNHRC into line with the Paris 
Principles, including with regard to the independence of commissioners, adequate and 
independent resources and the provision of a full mandate to promote and protect human 
rights.   
</p>
<p>74. Regarding the implementation of many of these recommendations, the Government 
would benefit from further extending engagement with relevant United Nations agencies, 
particularly OHCHR. The Special Rapporteur therefore welcomes the Government&#8217;s 
invitation on 18 November 2012 to OHCHR to establish an Office in Myanmar. He notes 
that consultations on the host country agreement have begun, and encourages the 
Government to expedite the process of ensuring the establishment of an OHCHR Country 
Office with a full mandate. 
</p>
<p>75. During his latest visit, the Special Rapporteur discussed the need for constitutional 
reform with a range of stakeholders. He highlights that the current Constitution contains a 
number of provisions that could undermine the rule of law and fundamental human rights, 
which have been outlined in previous reports (see HRC/13/48, A/13/48, A/66/365). He was 
encouraged that there was open discussion about the importance of the Constitution 
reflecting the needs and aspirations of the people of Myanmar, and that it could be changed 
if the people desired it. Ethnic minority groups have also stressed to the Special Rapporteur 
the need for constitutional reform to reflect their desire for more control over their own 
affairs, and that this will be crucial for the consolidation of ceasefire and political 
agreements.  
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that, in order for the rule of law to exist, the 
laws of the land should be in line with international human rights standards, and these laws 
should be applied equally to all persons, institutions and entities, including the military. 
Subsequently, he reiterates the need for civilian control of the military as fundamental to 
any democracy that upholds the rule of law. He recommends the amendment of 
constitutional provisions which, <i>inter alia</i>, provide for the establishment of permanent 
military tribunals (article 293 (b)), separate from oversight of the civilian justice 
mechanisms, for which the Commander-in-Chief exercises appellate power (article 343 
(b)); stipulate that no proceeding shall be brought against any member of the Government 
in respect of any act done in the execution of their duties (article 445), effectively providing 
the military with immunity for human rights violations that may have been committed; and 
allow for military appointees to occupy 25 per cent of seats in Parliament (articles 74, 109 
(b), 141 (b)), which also effectively provides the military with a veto on Constitutional 
amendments.  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur highlights the important role that the Constitutional Tribunal 
can play in bringing the Constitution into line with international human rights standards, 
through its mandate to interpret the provisions of the Constitution.  </p>


<p><b> VI. Truth, justice and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur continues to highlight that addressing grievances from 
decades of human rights violations and acknowledging victims&#8217; suffering will prevent 
</p>
<p>future violations and will further democratic transition and national reconciliation. 
Measures to ensure justice and accountability, and access to truth, must therefore remain 
part of Myanmar&#8217;s reform agenda. While there are many ways to ensure that justice is 
dispensed, accountability established and impunity averted, the primary responsibility rests 
with the Government of Myanmar.  
</p>
<p>79. During his latest visit, the Special Rapporteur continued to discuss with different 
stakeholders, including members of Parliament, the idea of addressing truth, justice and 
accountability through the creation of a truth commission at the parliamentary level.  
</p>
<p>80. There are no defined models and every truth commission is unique, responding to 
national needs and set in the cultural context. Truth commissions are not substitutes for 
more formal judicial accountability for the most serious violations and should not be 
afforded powers of amnesty incompatible with international law. 
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that this idea will take time to take hold and 
will be up to the people of Myanmar to develop. As a first step, there should be broad 
consultation with all relevant stakeholders in Myanmar, including victims of violations, in 
order to get their advice and views on the feasibility and desirability of a truth commission, 
and subsequently on how it could be shaped. Parliament, as the only multi-party and multi-
ethnic public institution, can be an appropriate body to engage on this difficult but 
necessary task. The MNHRC should also assume a role in taking this proposal forward.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Continuing reforms in Myanmar are resulting in ongoing improvements to the 
human rights situation. Important changes have taken place, such as legislative 
</b></p>
<p><b>reform, but sometimes not to the point where international human rights standards 
</b></p>
<p><b>are met.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>There remains a large gap between reform at the top and implementation on 
the ground. While acknowledging that it will take time to close this gap, this should 
</b></p>
<p><b>not be used as an excuse to avoid taking necessary steps, such as the capacity 
</b></p>
<p><b>development of police, army, judges and lawyers.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>While the process of reform is continuing in the right direction, there are 
significant human rights shortcomings that remain unaddressed, such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination against the Rohingya in Rakhine State and the ongoing human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations in relation to the conflict in Kachin State. The Special Rapporteur believes 
</b></p>
<p><b>that now is the time to address these shortcomings before they become further 
</b></p>
<p><b>entrenched and destabilize the reform process. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur believes the continuing existence of his mandate is vital 
to highlight these concerns and support the Government in addressing them. It helps 
</b></p>
<p><b>to remind the international community of the importance of prioritizing human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>in its bilateral relations with Myanmar. And ultimately, it provides a positive 
</b></p>
<p><b>contribution to improving the situation of human rights for the people in Myanmar.  </b></p>


<p><b> VIII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> All prisoners of conscience should be released immediately and unconditionally. 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> The Commission to grant liberty to remaining prisoners of conscience should 
include all relevant stakeholders, including civil society and former prisoners of 
</b></p>
<p><b>conscience, and should be established as a permanent body to review future detentions 
</b></p>
<p><b>and be given a broad terms of reference to help ensure the rights of released prisoners 
</b></p>
<p><b>of conscience are respected. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> To address the ongoing practice of torture in places of detention, the 
Government should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Prosecute allegations of torture by police and army personnel through 
</b></p>
<p><b>the criminal justice system; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure human rights training programmes for police officers and prison 
</b></p>
<p><b>officials, and develop the capacity of other relevant public officials, including judges 
</b></p>
<p><b>and doctors, who can intervene on suspected cases of torture; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Continue the good cooperation with the ICRC; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Provide national and other international monitoring groups with access 
</b></p>
<p><b>to places of detention;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Prioritize the ratification of the Convention against Torture and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment of Punishment, and its Optional Protocol; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Invite the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
</b></p>
<p><b>degrading treatment or punishment to conduct a country visit; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Improve health care in prisons; 
</b></p>
