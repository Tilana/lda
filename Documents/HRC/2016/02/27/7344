Addendum to the Report of the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers on her official visit to 
Portugal (27 January </b>&#8211;<b> 3 February 2015)  
</b></p>
<p><b>  The Portuguese Governm</b>ent&#8217;s reaction to the Report of the Special 
<b>Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers on her official 
</b></p>
<p><b>visit to Portugal (27 January </b>&#8211;<b> 3 February 2015)  
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with Portugal&#8217;s standing invitation to all the Special Procedures of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
</p>
<p>judges and lawyers, Gabriela Knaul, conducted a working visit to Portugal from 27
th
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>January to 3
rd
</p>
<p> February 2015, at the Portuguese Government&#8217;s invitation. 
</p>
<p>2. The defence of the independence of the judiciary as a structuring value pertaining to 
</p>
<p>the Rule of Law and to Democracy is a fundamental principle to which Portugal is deeply 
</p>
<p>committed. Portugal is determined to promote this value in the United Nations framework, 
</p>
<p>in particular in the United Nations Human Rights Council, a body to which Portugal was 
</p>
<p>elected for the 2015-2017 term. 
</p>
<p>3. Before, during and after the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the Portuguese Government 
</p>
<p>responded to all requests in a spirit of constructive cooperation and dialogue, whilst fully 
</p>
<p>respecting the independence of Ms. Knaul&#8217;s mandate. This was acknowledged in the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s Report 
</p>
<p>4. Portugal is fully committed to respecting the independence of the judges, as it has 
</p>
<p>been done so far. In light of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report, Portugal should like to recall 
</p>
<p>that it is undergoing a period of severe budgetary constraints which make the management 
</p>
<p>of the judicial system more difficult, as indeed happens with all the remaining areas. 
</p>
<p>5. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with members of the Portuguese 
</p>
<p>Government, members of Parliament and representatives of several stakeholders of the 
</p>
<p>judicial system. In the overall report on the visit and in the press release, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur expressed some concerns that, in her view, may jeopardize the effectiveness of 
</p>
<p>the principle on the independence of the judiciary. These concerns are also reflected in the 
</p>
<p>draft Report to be submitted to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>6. Hence, and briefly, the concerns of the Special Rapporteur focused on the following:  
</p>
<p> i) the unexpected consequences of the implementation of the reforms, in 
</p>
<p>particular, the legal instability, the security of the electronic system, in particular the 
</p>
<p>processing of cases;  
</p>
<p> ii) the courts&#8217; and judges&#8217; lack of autonomy, especially as concerns the need to 
</p>
<p>improve training for judges and prosecutors,  
</p>
<p> iii) citizens&#8217; access to justice; 
</p>
<p> iv) assistance provided to victims of domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>7. Regarding the implementation of reforms to the justice system, it should be 
</p>
<p>mentioned that restructuring the fundamental components of the judicial system, such as the 
</p>
<p>judicial map always imply, due to its dimension and scope, difficulties in implementation. 
</p>
<p>8. The reforms that have been implemented in the last years do not focus on partial 
</p>
<p>aspects of the justice system. The reforms have restructured the whole system in order to 
</p>
<p>make it more efficient, rational and closer to the citizens. Thus, while recognizing problems 
</p>
<p>inherent to the implementation of reforms, in particular of the new judicial map and the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>physical and computer infrastructures, the Government has speared no efforts in order to 
</p>
<p>achieve the progressive normalization of the situation, which has occurred. 
</p>
<p>9. The computer program CITIUS related to case processing is already in full operation 
</p>
<p>since the end of 2014 and improvements of infrastructures affected by the restructuring 
</p>
<p>process are ongoing. Thus, the normal operation of the judicial system has been restored. 
</p>
<p>10. The debate on the reform of the judicial map lasted several years and was widely 
</p>
<p>participated. During the entire process several entities were heard and their opinions taken 
</p>
<p>into account, such as the High Council for the Judicature, the High Council of the Public 
</p>
<p>Prosecution, the Bar Delegations, the Chamber of Solicitors, the Judges&#8217; and the 
</p>
<p>Prosecutors&#8217; Unions, the Court Officials&#8217; Union and Local Governments as well as the 
</p>
<p>National Association of Municipalities. 
</p>
<p>11. The reform is based on the extension of the territorial basis of courts, thereby 
</p>
<p>enhancing their specialization through a new management model., The current organization 
</p>
<p>deepens and extends to the entire country specialized courts, thereby streamlining the 
</p>
<p>distribution and case processing, facilitating the allocation and mobility of human resources 
</p>
<p>and the autonomy of the courts&#8217; structures. 
</p>
<p>12. Regarding training of judges and prosecutors, a considerable effort has been made in 
</p>
<p>order to ensure the specialization of these professionals thereby enabling the 
</p>
<p>implementation of a key aspect of the judicial organization reform: an increase of the 
</p>
<p>degree of specialization of several courts. 
</p>
<p>13. The Centre for Judicial Studies has paid special attention to human rights training, 
</p>
<p>through the traditional training methods and through publications, in particular electronic 
</p>
<p>publications. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s Report raises some concerns on the mechanisms of 
</p>
<p>accessing to justice. This mechanism is crucial to guarantee, to the public in general, the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of the universal right of access to justice and to courts.  
</p>
<p>15. The Portuguese Government is aware that this mechanism can be improved. Hence, 
</p>
<p>a study designed to identify the main aspects of the system that can be improved is 
</p>
<p>currently ongoing. The objective is, to guarantee that all persons needing legal protection to 
</p>
<p>have access to justice and to courts are better protected. When the outcome of the 
</p>
<p>assessment study is finalized, the Portuguese Government will take the necessary measures 
</p>
<p>so that the problems detected can be definitely corrected and, thereby, improve citizens&#8217; 
</p>
<p>rights and access to justice. 
</p>
<p>16. Regarding the concerns expressed on the courts&#8217; lack managerial autonomy , the 
</p>
<p>Portuguese Government has deepened, through the judicial organization reform, the courts&#8217; 
</p>
<p>managerial autonomy. In order to increase the efficiency of the county courts, objectives 
</p>
<p>are now set for a three-year period which is established by the county court, the High 
</p>
<p>Council of Judicature and the General Prosecution Office together with the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Justice. This autonomy aims to introduce the concept of management by objectives. The 
</p>
<p>purpose is that the court&#8217;s managerial autonomy may constitute an incentive to improve the 
</p>
<p>application of justice and its efficiency.  
</p>
<p>17. Assistance to victims of violence, even though not specifically connected with the 
</p>
<p>independence of the courts, is a main priority of the Portuguese Government. In this 
</p>
<p>context, it is necessary to distinguish two aspects: the persons detained in prisons/the 
</p>
<p>victims of violence, in particular domestic violence, and the means for the prevention of 
</p>
<p>recidivism. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>18. As to the former, the concerns focused on the duration of pre-trial detention, on ill 
</p>
<p>treatment, on the overcrowding in prisons and on the access to a lawyer. In this regard, the 
</p>
<p>authorities have been developing measures to tackle these problems. 
</p>
<p>19. As to the duration of pre-trial detention, strict deadlines were established for this 
</p>
<p>preventive measure that may only be extended in exceptional circumstances, duly justified 
</p>
<p>and confirmed. These deadlines cannot be surpassed and if there is not a charge/conviction 
</p>
<p>(according to the procedural phase) the defendant/ accused person has to be released. 
</p>
<p>20. As concerns violence against detained persons, there are internal mechanisms (Audit 
</p>
<p>and Inspection Service of the Directorate General for Rehabilitation and Prison Services) 
</p>
<p>and external ones (General Inspectorate of the Justice Services) that inquire into any 
</p>
<p>allegations of violation, draw legal consequences and improve proceedings as regards the 
</p>
<p>use of proportional force in a prison context. 
</p>
<p>21. There are several entities (Ombudsman &#8211; including in its capacity as National 
</p>
<p>Preventive Mechanism under OP-CAT) members of Parliament, the Bar and representatives 
</p>
<p>of international bodies) that may visit the prisons and detention centres without 
</p>
<p>authorization from the competent authorities. This shows that Portugal is ruled by the 
</p>
<p>principle of transparency and of collaboration with national and international entities in 
</p>
<p>charge of the defence and promotion of the fundamental rights. 
</p>
<p>22. On the guarantees provided to detained persons, it should be mentioned that 
</p>
<p>legislation, which is scrupulously complied with by the competent authorities, requires that 
</p>
<p>in no circumstances can the detainee be deprived of his right to contact with his lawyer, not 
</p>
<p>even when he is confined to a cell or to a disciplinary cell. 
</p>
<p>23. Regarding overcrowding in prisons, the Portuguese Government has been 
</p>
<p>developing a broad range of measures designed to tackle this problem. These include the 
</p>
<p>adoption of alternative measures to imprisonment that aim, first of all, to combat the 
</p>
<p>excessive number of pre-trial detainees, enabling this pre-trial detention to be served in 
</p>
<p>other ways than the prison establishment. These alternative measures (such as the electronic 
</p>
<p>bracelet) are also used in the context of programmes designed to prevent recidivism of 
</p>
<p>offenders in specific cases, such as domestic violence. 
</p>
<p><b>  To conclude, 
</b></p>
<p>24. Portugal values, guarantees and praises the independence of the judiciary. Wherever 
</p>
<p>deficiencies are identified, they will be suppressed. This independence requires a judicial 
</p>
<p>managerial system that privileges the efficiency, the autonomy, the quality and the 
</p>
<p>management by objectives.
