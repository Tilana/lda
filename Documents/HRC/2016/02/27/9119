<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Annual meetings of special rapporteurs/representatives, experts and chairpersons of 
working groups of the special procedures of the Commission on Human Rights and the Human 
Rights Council have been organized since 1994. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
Action, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993, underlined the 
importance of preserving and strengthening the system of special procedures and specified that 
the procedures and mechanisms should be enabled to harmonize and rationalize their work 
through periodic meetings (A/CONF.157/24 (part II), para. 95). 
</p>
<p>2. The fifteenth annual meeting of special procedures was held in Geneva from 23 
to 27 June 2008. Participants had before them a provisional annotated agenda and a series 
of documents prepared by mandate-holders, the Secretariat and other sources. 
</p>
<p>3. During the meeting, mandate-holders held exchanges of views with the Deputy 
High Commissioner, the former President of the Council, the current President and members 
of the Council Bureau. Participants also met with representatives of non-governmental 
organizations and national human rights institutions, and held a joint meeting with participants 
of the twentieth meeting of persons chairing the human rights treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ORGANIZATION OF WORK 
</b></p>
<p>4. The meeting was opened by the Chairperson of the fourteenth annual meeting and 
Chairperson of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures, Gay McDougall. The 
outgoing Chairperson of the Committee gave an explanation of the process of nominations to the 
Committee that was undertaken by e-mail in advance of the meeting. 
</p>
<p>5. Participants elected Asma Jahangir Chairperson of the fifteenth annual meeting and of the 
Committee, and Olivier de Schutter Rapporteur of the meeting and member of the Committee. 
The three remaining members elected by consensus on 26 June were Cephas Lumina, 
Maria Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda and Gulnara Shahinian. The former Chairperson will be an 
ex-officio member of the Committee. 
</p>
<p>6. Meeting participants expressed deep appreciation for the work carried out throughout the 
year by the outgoing Chairperson and the other members of the Committee, in particular in 
connection with the process of review of mandates conducted by the Council and the selection of 
new mandate-holders. The outgoing Chairperson also thanked the Special Procedures Division 
for its support for the Committee and for keeping mandate-holders informed about Council 
developments throughout the year. Mandate-holders approved the agenda as revised. 
</p>
<p>7. A number of parallel events were organized outside the formal agenda of the meeting, and 
were attended by several mandate-holders.<b> </b>They included discussions on child rights 
perspectives and working with the media. Mandate-holders held individual meetings with the 
Chief of the Travel Unit of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  ACTIVITIES OF THE COORDINATION COMMITTEE 
</b></p>
<p>8. The outgoing Chairperson briefed participants on the activities of the Committee under her 
chairpersonship. She outlined a number of challenges that the new Committee had addressed 
since the previous annual meeting and that the special procedures were facing. These included 
the institution-building process under Council resolution 5/1, the implementation of the code of 
conduct adopted by the Council in its resolution 5/2, the revision of the manual of special 
procedures, the development by the Committee of an internal advisory procedure and the 
facilitation of an increasing number of joint activities. 
</p><p>9. The first thread of activities of the Committee related to interaction with the Council and 
other stakeholders with regard to the review of special procedures mandates by the Council. The 
aim was to ensure that the review of mandates would result in a more effective and strengthened 
system of special procedures. The second thread of activities related to the selection and 
appointment procedures mandate-holders; the Committee had submitted a letter to the President 
of the Council reflecting its views regarding the technical requirements for eligible candidates 
for mandate-holders. In that regard, at the sixth and seventh sessions of the Council, the 
Chairperson of the Committee held meetings with the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
the President of the Council, members of the consultative group, the coordinators of regional 
groups and representatives of non-governmental organizations. Through these meetings, the 
Committee had focused on the independence of the special procedures while articulating its 
views and trying to help develop confidence in the system of special procedures as a whole. 
</p>
<p>10. It was noted that the President&#8217;s statement adopted by the Council on 18 June 2008 on the 
terms of office of mandate-holders referred to compliance of mandate-holders with the code of 
conduct. It also acknowledged the Committee as a body representing the special procedures. 
Participants stressed that the new procedure would need to be applied transparently, fairly and 
non-selectively, consistent with the independence and the integrity of the special procedures as a 
whole, and that these same purposes were served by the internal advisory procedure set up under 
the auspices of the Committee. 
</p>
<p>11. The third thread of activities concerned the finalization of the special procedures manual. 
A draft was prepared by a task force and the Committee taking into account the comments 
submitted by stakeholders as well as the code of conduct adopted by the Council. It was sent to 
all mandate-holders for their comments. A final draft was prepared incorporating all comments 
received for discussion at the fifteenth annual meeting with a view to its adoption by all 
mandate-holders. 
</p>
<p>12. The Committee held some meetings in Geneva and telephone conferences about every six 
weeks. Mandate-holders had been consulted by e-mail, telephone and other means on various 
occasions, with a view to facilitating cooperation and a common response to issues that arose 
during the year. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL AND SPECIAL PROCEDURES SYSTEM 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Update on recent developments: review of mandates, universal  
periodic review mechanism, selection of mandate-holders 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Secretary of the Council briefed participants on recent developments, including the 
first two sessions of the universal periodic review, interactive dialogues, the complaint 
procedure, thematic panels, special sessions and the Advisory Committee. He recalled the 
contribution of the special procedures to universal periodic review reports, panels and special 
sessions. 
</p>
<p>14. Expanding on the universal periodic review process, he stated that it had brought positive 
changes to the human rights machinery by making the consideration of country situations by the 
Council a regular and universal feature, avoiding the risks of selectivity among States. A total of 
192 States would have to interact with the Council in the next four years. Conclusions and 
recommendations of special procedures had been taken up in many review deliberations. Some 
States under review had welcomed the work of the special procedures and committed to invite 
them, with a few pledging to issue a standing invitation. A positive development for the special 
procedures was that their recommendations constituted half of the review reports, thereby 
complementing the concluding observations and views of the treaty bodies. The methodology 
developed by OHCHR to assess each country also drew upon existing regional mechanisms, 
such as the African Peer Review Mechanism. 
</p>
<p>15. Participants discussed the question of time allocated to their interactive dialogue at Council 
and special sessions on thematic issues, including on the negative impact on the realization of the 
right to food, at the initiative of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, as well as panels, 
including on maternal mortality at the initiative of the Special Rapporteur on the right to health. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Exchange of views with the former Council President 
</b></p>
<p>16. The former Council President and Permanent Representative of Romania, Ambassador 
Romulu Costea, focused his address on recent developments at the Council that had an impact on 
the special procedures system and on its relationship with the universal periodic review. He 
noted that the special procedures system was the backbone of the human rights machinery and 
underlined the need to preserve the independence and autonomy of mandate-holders in the 
fulfilment of their mandates. He referred to the President&#8217;s statement adopted by the Council at 
its eighth session regarding the terms of mandate-holders. He stated that, while the statement 
aimed to settle an issue raised by some Member States, it was also intended to preserve the 
independence of mandate-holders as a condition of the credibility of special procedures, and 
indeed, of the Council itself. In relation to the selection procedure, he referred to the substantial 
work undertaken by the Consultative Group and the Secretariat. He stated that one of the 
challenges for the special procedures remained the implementation of Council resolution 5/2 on 
the code of conduct and the role of mandate-holders and the Committee in that regard. 
</p>
<p>17. He stated that the universal periodic review covered various human rights mechanisms, 
including special procedures, and complemented them. The review and how special procedures 
could better contribute to it required further discussion. As to the review, rationalization and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>improvement of mandates, different views had been expressed by Member States on the way the 
review of mandates should be conducted and a rolling checklist had been issued as a guidance 
note. 
</p>
<p>18. The former President noted that, together, the full cooperation from States and the 
compliance of mandate-holders with the code of conduct would help to protect the system and 
advance the implementation of human rights. He also noted that sufficient time needed to be 
granted to mandate-holders to have a real dialogue with the Council. Referring to availability as 
one of the criteria for the selection of mandate-holders, he advised mandate-holders to be present 
at Council sessions whenever their presence was required and to the fullest extent possible, but 
acknowledged that cases of force majeure could prevent this and noted that the programme of 
work of the Council should in future be more predictable. 
</p>
<p>19. In the ensuing discussion, participants raised issues on lessons learned from special 
sessions, the contribution of special procedures to the universal periodic review process, the 
predictability of reporting by special procedures, the holding of interactive dialogues with the 
Council, the implementation of the code of conduct, the translation of reports and the need to 
further strengthen the work of mandate-holders. The former Chairperson of the Committee took 
the opportunity to thank the former President of the Council for his work and his openness to 
several issues raised by the Committee with regard to special procedures. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Exchange of views with the Council President and members of the Bureau 
</b></p>
<p>20. Participants had an exchange with the President of the Council, Ambassador Martin 
Ihoeghian Uhomoibhi, and with members of the Council Bureau, representatives of Canada 
(Ambassador Terry Cormier), the Philippines (Ambassador Erlinda Basilio), Argentina 
(Minister Raul Palaez), and Azerbaijan (Second Secretary Mammad Talibov). 
</p><p>21. Referring to an earlier discussion with the current and former Chairpersons of the 
Coordination Committee, the President welcomed the possibility of meeting all mandate-holders 
during their annual meeting. Assuring the special procedures of his continuous support and 
engagement, the President hoped for close cooperation with mandate-holders in the year to 
come. He warmly thanked the Committee for its input to the institution-building process, which 
had been extremely valuable, to shape a strengthened system of protection and promotion of 
human rights. He encouraged the special procedures to remain engaged in related discussions 
and to have an open discussion on future cooperation. 
</p>
<p>22. Participants welcomed the possibility of meeting with the current President of the Council 
and the members of its Bureau, which would strengthen the relationship between the Council and 
its special procedures for the benefit of human rights promotion and protection. Participants 
suggested giving more space to thematic reports during mandate-holders&#8217; interactive dialogues. 
The Council should pay greater attention to special procedures reports, in particular to 
recommendations that set human rights standards or that provide for concrete operational 
measures. Some participants expressed satisfaction at the fact that the universal periodic review 
gave due consideration to special procedures&#8217; recommendations. It was felt that the review was a 
landmark achievement which would allow the Council to move towards the implementation 
phase. It was noted that the Council considered the code of conduct a tool to help the special </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>procedures maintain the highest standards of independence and integrity. It was felt that 
reinforced cooperation had materialized with the outcome of the first thematic special session on 
the global food crisis. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Universal periodic review mechanism and special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Secretariat briefed participants on the universal periodic review and its relevance to 
the special procedures. It was recalled that the final outcome of the review comprised the 
Working Group report, the State response to the recommendations in the report and a technical 
decision adopted by the Council. 
</p>
<p>24. The contribution of special procedures had proved to be a major part of United Nations 
compilation reports prepared by OHCHR for consideration by the Council in the universal 
periodic review process. Overall, the findings and recommendations of special procedures had 
been referred to frequently during the review. On many occasions, States accepted or supported 
recommendations relating to issues raised by special procedures. In those cases, the State under 
review frequently invoked the existing national framework. In a few circumstances, States 
explicitly rejected recommendations relating to issues raised by special procedures, particularly 
where specific recommendations were made to amend or repeal legislation or to establish 
institutions. 
</p>
<p>25. With regard to recommendations that invitations he extended to special procedures, some 
countries indicated that they would consider such requests favourably. Some States took the 
opportunity offered by the universal periodic review to announce their willingness to invite 
special procedures mandate-holders to visit. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms while countering terrorism, Martin Scheinin, shared with participants his observations 
on the universal periodic review and its relevance to his mandate. The question of follow-up to 
review recommendations by the special procedures was raised. It was noted that, just as the 
universal periodic review could contribute to the effectiveness of special procedures by 
encouraging States to cooperate and by referring to recommendations made by the special 
procedures, the special procedures usefully refer to certain pledges and commitments made by 
the States in the review process: thus, although the two mechanisms were independent from one 
another, they could to a certain extent strengthen each other. 
</p>
<p>27. Participants also suggested that more information should be shared regarding the different 
purposes served by special procedures and the universal periodic review. It was suggested that 
the inclusion of special procedures recommendations be monitored in the final review reports. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  WORKING METHODS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Draft revised manual of special procedures mandate-holders 
</b></p>
<p>28. Participants discussed the draft revised manual of special procedures mandate-holders. The 
manual is a mechanism developed in 1999 at the initiative of mandate-holders, a living document 
that is subject to regular revision. In 2006, a draft revised version was circulated for comment 
from Governments, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders. In 2007, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>mandate-holders set up a Committee task force in charge of revising the manual further in order 
to reflect the changes in working methods brought about by the code of conduct and other new 
developments in the Council. 
</p>
<p>29. The revised manual presented by the task force integrated comments received on the draft 
from Governments and civil society organizations. Substantive changes related to the 
appointment of mandate-holders, as laid out in Council resolution 5/1; the criteria for taking 
action on communications and the transmission of urgent appeals to concerned Governments 
through diplomatic channels, unless agreed otherwise, as provided for by the code of conduct; 
Government responses to be appended to mission reports; and the sharing of public statements 
with concerned Governments sufficiently in advance of their release. 
</p>
<p>30. In the discussion that followed, several additions to the manual were proposed by 
participants, who suggested that the manual should clearly mention that conclusions and 
recommendations were addressed to Governments as well as to international organizations, civil 
society and other stakeholders. It was felt that the manual should refer to public statements 
instead of just press statements, so as to use a terminology consistent with that of the code of 
conduct. The meeting agreed that the Manual was an operational and living document and that it 
would be updated whenever necessary. Participants acknowledged the value of the manual in 
providing guidance to mandate-holders in the course of their work, so as to assist them in 
fulfilling their mandate in compliance with the code of conduct. It was proposed that the manual 
include a reference to types of communications other than letters of allegation or urgent appeals, 
such as letters relating to draft legislation or ongoing international negotiations, in order to 
reflect the full range of working methods. 
</p>
<p>31. Participants conveyed their appreciation to the task force for its work and adopted the 
draft revised manual ad referendum by consensus. An editorial team composed of 
five mandate-holders would finalize the manual for publication within six weeks of the closing 
of the annual meeting<b>. 
</b></p>
<p><b>B. Code of conduct and internal advisory procedure 
to review practices and working methods 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Chairperson introduced the interim internal advisory procedure for consideration and 
adoption by the fifteenth annual meeting. She reminded the mandate-holders that the aim of the 
procedure was to facilitate the implementation of the code of conduct and the manual of the 
human rights special procedures, with a view to enhancing the effectiveness and independence of 
the special procedures system as a whole and of its individual mandate-holders, as well as to 
providing assistance to all stakeholders where questions relating to the implementation of the 
code of conduct or to the manual were raised. 
</p>
<p>33. At the fourteenth annual meeting, the Committee was authorized to give appropriate 
consideration to any matter concerning the working methods of mandate-holders that might be 
brought to its attention. In the discussion concerning the role of the Committee under the internal 
advisory procedure, it was stressed that the procedure could contribute to enhance the core 
principle of independence of mandate-holders, and should ensure that any failure by </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>mandate-holders to act in conformity with the code of conduct or the recommendations of the 
manual were addressed at the earliest stage possible. The meeting decided to adopt the internal 
advisory procedure by consensus. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Strengthening the effectiveness of special procedures: 
communications and follow-up 
</b></p>
<p>34. The outgoing Chairperson introduced a paper on communications prepared by the 
Secretariat, noting that communications constituted a fundamental part of the regular dialogue of 
special procedures with Governments. Most mandate-holders respond to human rights violations 
by either sending urgent appeals or letters of allegations to Governments, depending on the 
degree of urgency of the case brought to their attention. Depending on the characteristics of their 
mandate, some experts address more general concerns, whether on structural or legislative 
issues. The outgoing Chairperson pointed out that, even though the system of communications 
had greatly evolved over the years with a higher percentage of joint communications along with 
streamlined working procedures within the Secretariat, some issues deserved further reflection. 
They included the relatively low rate of responses from Governments, the protection of 
witnesses, feedback to sources and the issuance of a periodic common report on 
communications. 
</p>
<p>35. The proposal that a common report on communications collated on a country-by-country 
basis be issued was supported, as it would prevent inconsistencies between mandate-holders 
reporting on the same communications to the Council; avoid unnecessary duplication of work 
and reduce mandate-holders&#8217; workload and rationalize their documents; allow the examination of 
cross-cutting human rights issues; and ensure that the content of communications and any 
follow-up given to them would feed into the universal periodic review process more effectively. 
</p>
<p>36. Participants also discussed the impact of special procedures communications. It was noted 
that Government responses to communications were not the only indicator for assessing the 
effectiveness of the work of special procedures. The desirability of further reflecting on criteria 
to assess the impact of the work of special procedures and on improving the cooperation of 
States in the communications procedures was flagged. The question of joint communications 
between country and thematic rapporteurs was also discussed. While the usefulness of 
comparing approaches and developing common strategies was noted, it was stressed that any 
decision to take action on a case or situation remained at the discretion of the mandate-holder in 
the light of his or her mandate and of the criteria laid out in the code of conduct. 
</p>
<p>37. The Secretariat briefed participants on follow-up practices that had been developed and 
streamlined over the years by many mandate-holders. They encompassed the variety of measures 
taken to encourage, facilitate and monitor the implementation of recommendations by any of the 
special procedures. The different procedures involved diverse methods of work; appropriate 
methods of follow-up varied according to factors such as whether the mandate was thematic or 
geographic; the potential contribution of technical cooperation to addressing the issue raised by 
the communication; and the cooperation and goodwill of the Government(s) concerned. As 
follow-up activities are essential to assess the effectiveness of special procedures, it was 
recommended that mandate-holders should continue enlarging their range to techniques to ensure 
adequate follow-up and share their experiences with other mandate-holders. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Cooperation with regional human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Leandro Despouy, and 
the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, Manfred Nowak, presented the activities undertaken over the past year in relation to 
cooperation with regional mechanisms. The former mentioned his participation in an OHCHR 
mission to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. He regarded such encounters as 
beneficial, as they provided a better mutual understanding of each organization&#8217;s structures, 
objectives and activities. It also gave him and OHCHR the opportunity to brief key staff 
members of the Commission on the special procedures. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers suggested that 
exchange of information on communications and country visits be strengthened between the 
special procedures and the &#8220;rapporteurships&#8221; of the Inter-American Commission on Human 
Rights specialized in the following thematic areas: freedom of expression; women&#8217;s rights; 
migrant workers and members of their families; human rights defenders; human rights of 
indigenous people; and human rights of persons deprived of liberty. A positive development was 
the establishment of focal points. With regard to country visits, the Commission and the special 
procedures were encouraged to use and compile each other&#8217;s information relating to individual 
cases, reports and recommendations. The Special Rapporteur suggested that identification and 
choice of mandate-holders&#8217; visits be coordinated in advance with the Commission. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur on torture referred to his regular exchanges with the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the Council of Europe, the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Organization of American States (OAS). 
He was regularly invited to attend sessions of these regional bodies, which were an opportunity 
to coordinate current activities. They also gave the opportunity to each player to harmonize 
points of view and opinions so as to mutually strengthen each mechanism. Of particular 
importance was the careful planning of country visits between regional human rights 
mechanisms to avoid duplication or to mutually reinforce their impact by ensuring follow-up 
visits. The Special Rapporteur regretted that a joint mission to Togo with the Special Rapporteur 
on prisons and conditions of detention of the African Union could not take place owing to lack of 
funding. 
</p>
<p>41. The Secretariat of OHCHR updated participants on three missions carried out by staff 
members of the Special Procedures Division at the end of 2007 to meet with representatives of 
regional human rights organizations. In October 2007, an inter-branch OHCHR mission travelled 
to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to identify ways to improve coordination 
between the inter-American human rights system and United Nations human rights mechanisms. 
Division staff members participated in the forty-second ordinary session of the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, held from 15 to 28 November 2007 in Brazzaville. 
The main objective of their participation in that session was to identify concrete areas for 
effective cooperation between OHCHR, the Commission Secretariat and with non-governmental 
organizations. In November 2007, a group of OHCHR representatives from all branches, 
including the Special Procedures Division, undertook a mission to the Council of Europe in 
Strasbourg, France, to examine possible ways of increasing cooperation and making use of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>synergies in the work of the respective organizations. Participants, in particular new 
mandate-holders, were encouraged to strategize their interaction in this field. Participants asked 
for continued Secretariat support to develop and facilitate cooperation. 
</p>
<p>42. Participants shared their experiences, including an expert meeting organized at OAS 
headquarters, to work on a draft inter-American convention against racism and all forms of 
discrimination and intolerance. They also discussed developments in the Asia-Pacific region, 
and it was suggested that cooperation with political and economic regional organizations and 
United Nations offices be fostered in the absence of a full-fledged Asian human rights 
mechanism. It was suggested their cooperation with regional organizations should be 
strengthened to follow-up on reports and findings of special procedures mandate-holders. 
</p>
<p>43. A representative of the Council of Europe reiterated the Council&#8217;s satisfaction at the 
ongoing cooperation with the United Nations on human rights, particularly regarding gender 
equality, the fight against racism and xenophobia, minority rights and torture. She stated that the 
Council planned to publish a yearbook on human rights with summaries of conclusions and 
recommendations of European monitoring bodies. The document would provide information on 
the situation of all 47 States members of the Council of Europe and would be a useful tool for 
special procedures, also in the context of the universal periodic review. She noted that issues of 
migration were of concern to the Council, which was considering the preparation of a new 
convention on naturalization, particularly with a view to facilitating the naturalization of migrant 
children. 
</p>
<p><b>E. Cooperation with the United Nations system: engagement  
with United Nations country teams and United Nations  
agencies, programmes and funds 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Vernor Mu&#241;oz Villalobos, introduced the 
discussion on cooperation with the United Nations system, including United Nations country 
teams, United Nations agencies, funds and programmes. He emphasized the importance of 
country teams for special procedures&#8217; country missions and the implementation of 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>45. In the ensuing discussion, participants shared their insights on good practices, how to 
improve cooperation, and challenges during country missions. Participants made some 
concrete proposals in order to enhance and capitalize on this cooperation. The Secretariat also 
informed participants on the discussion held by the Policy Committee of the Secretary-General 
on 20 May 2008, which reaffirmed the centrality of human rights in the development work of the 
United Nations. The Policy Committee stressed the universality of human rights and the 
important role of senior officials, including Resident Coordinators, in mainstreaming human 
rights at the country level. 
</p>
<p>46. A representative of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) described his positive experience with special procedures, particularly in relation to 
the right to education, the fight against racism, minority rights, poverty reduction strategies and 
migrant workers&#8217; rights. He also reaffirmed the willingness of UNESCO to assist and cooperate 
with special procedures. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Developing a common approach to special crisis situations 
</b></p>
<p>47. Participants started a discussion on the development of a common approach to serious 
crisis situations. The former Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing as a component 
of the right to an adequate standard of living, Miloon Kothari, introduced a background paper on 
this issue. 
</p>
<p>48. As the previous five years had seen an increase in joint activities by mandate-holders in the 
form of joint communications, joint missions and joint statements, the former Special Rapporteur 
suggested that collective responses by mandate-holders should be systematized, distinguishing 
between preventative work by mandate-holders in cases where certain situations could spiral into 
grave human rights violations, and collective work in cases of emergency situations. A number 
of joint initiatives that the special procedures could take were identified, including the 
formulation of recommendations to relevant neighbouring countries, the international 
community or United Nations agencies to assist the country concerned. Requesting the 
Human Rights Council to hold a special session on a crisis situation and playing, wherever 
possible, a mediatory role in ensuring that dialogue took place among actors responsible for the 
crisis were also mentioned as potentially valuable tools. 
</p>
<p>49. Thanking the former Special Rapporteur for his contribution, the Chairperson of the annual 
meeting added that collective action by the special procedures should take place under 
well-defined circumstances, such as the existence of an emergency; a threat to peace and 
security; the imminent or pending character of a humanitarian crisis; the threat of a genocide, 
war crimes or crimes against humanity; or the existence of a risk of widespread or systematic 
human rights violations (see paragraph 54 below). 
</p>
<p>50. A participant stressed that disaster and post-disaster situations should be of particular 
concern to the special procedures as it was important to determine appropriate human rights 
frameworks timely and to remind Governments of their international obligations relating to their 
responsibility to protect populations in situations of humanitarian crisis. Mandate-holders should 
also play a role in advocating for human rights protection with United Nations or aid agencies 
while distributing humanitarian aid. Participants stressed that the special procedures were 
uniquely placed to act as an early warning system in relation to situations involving serious 
human rights violations thanks to their ability to monitor the situation in any country of the 
world in the context of their specific mandates. It was also mentioned that the elaboration of 
general comments or guidelines by several mandate-holders on the requirements of human rights 
in the context of reactions to humanitarian crises could be developed. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Legal issues:  amicus curiae briefs and other 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Assistant Secretary-General for Legal Affairs, Larry D. Johnson, briefed 
mandate-holders on the issue of submitting amicus briefs before courts or participating in 
judicial proceedings in another capacity, particularly in relation to the scope of their 
immunities and privileges. 
</p>
<p>52. The Assistant Secretary-General reminded mandate-holders that, while the submission of 
briefs in legal procedures before national courts was a useful and important tool, they needed to 
be carefully considered to advance the law incrementally. Without prejudice to the independence </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of the special procedures system, the Assistant Secretary-General and the OHCHR Legal 
Adviser, Mona Rishmawi, reminded participants that amicus briefs should be carefully worded 
and that a disclaimer should be issued explaining that mandate-holders were expressing their 
own views, which did not necessarily reflect those of the United Nations or those of the 
Secretary-General. The latter, through the Office of Legal Affairs, should also be informed about 
any briefs submitted. The Assistant Secretary-General noted that, when submitting amicus curiae 
briefs, special procedures were considered &#8220;experts on mission&#8221;. They are accorded immunity 
from personal arrest and detention; they are also granted immunity in respect of words spoken or 
written and acts by them in the course of the performance of their mission; and immunity from 
legal process of every kind. However, they should be careful not to be drawn into situations 
where their participation in certain legal procedures could be interpreted as a waiver of those 
privileges and immunities. Should a question arise as to their privileges and immunities, 
mandate-holders were encouraged to always seek the advice of the Office of Legal Affairs. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Procedures for unusual but vital reporting 
</b></p>
<p>53. Mandate-holders discussed a number of situations for which follow-up through reporting 
or public statements by special procedures acting collectively was considered important, 
including secret places of detention, the situation of migrants and serious human rights violations 
in countries for which no geographic mandate had been established. The Chairperson proposed 
that, in the light of past practice, an agenda item should be added to the forthcoming meetings of 
special procedures in order to discuss similar topics. 
</p>
<p>54. Participants discussed the procedure to bring special situations to the attention of the 
annual meeting. They agreed that any situation of concern should be first brought to the attention 
of the Committee, which would decide on further action in the light of the guidelines agreed on 
at the fifteenth annual meeting. The Committee would examine the case and put the matter on 
the agenda of the annual meeting when the criteria for common action (see paragraph 49 above) 
are met. 
</p>
<p><b>VI. EXCHANGE OF VIEWS WITH THE  
DEPUTY HIGH COMMISSIONER 
</b></p>
<p>55. Addressing the annual meeting of the special procedures mandate-holders on behalf of the 
High Commissioner, the Deputy High Commissioner underlined their crucial role in the 
universal human rights protection system. She noted that special procedures had been faced over 
recent years with a number of challenges that had triggered a collective, fruitful reflection on 
enhancing their effectiveness. She stressed the impact of the establishment of a committee on the 
increased effectiveness and coordination of the special procedures. 
</p>
<p>56. The Deputy High Commissioner welcomed the appointment of mandate-holders under 
the new selection procedure. She thanked the Committee and OHCHR staff members supporting 
it for their engagement. Noting the termination of three country mandates, the Deputy 
High Commissioner mentioned the creation of two new thematic mandates - contemporary forms 
of slavery, including its causes and consequences, and the right to access to safe drinking water 
and sanitation - which would undoubtedly help to fill existing protection gaps. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>57. In relation to the institution-building process and the changes in working methods that it 
had incurred, the Deputy High Commissioner was of the view that the code of conduct, if 
universally, fairly and not selectively applied, was a tool for building greater trust with 
stakeholders and strengthening the system. Referring to the President&#8217;s statement on the terms of 
office of mandate-holders, which provides for an avenue through which cases of alleged 
persistent non-compliance could be examined, the Deputy High Commissioner advised 
mandate-holders to make themselves available, through the Committee, for the implementation 
of that new procedure. 
</p>
<p>58. The Deputy High Commissioner stated that another priority for the special procedures was 
their cooperation with the universal periodic review, as it offered a unique political forum to 
follow up their work. Special procedures could make strategic use of its outcomes. She stated 
that the special procedures could rest assured of the support and engagement of OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b>VII. INTEGRATING HUMAN RIGHTS APPROACHES 
AND MECHANISMS INTO THE WORK OF THE 
SPECIAL PROCEDURES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Enhancing the integration of a gender perspective 
</b></p>
<p>59. Regarding the integration of a gender perspective in the work of special procedures, the 
Chairperson shared her experience and outlined the need to consider particular violations against 
women or specific contributions of women to the promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>60. The Coordinator of the OHCHR Women&#8217;s Rights and Gender Unit updated 
mandate-holders on efforts made in this area, particularly the jurisprudential analysis for 
improving States&#8217; way to approach women&#8217;s rights. Major areas of concern included laws 
discriminating against women, sexual violence and socio-economic rights. Special procedures 
could take advantage of the international normative framework, including Security Council 
resolutions, to advocate for women&#8217;s rights. There were positive experiences in integrating 
gender issues in the work of the Special Rapporteur on torture and the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing. For example, the Special Rapporteur on torture devoted a thematic report to 
and organized a seminar on gender issues and torture. He was also preparing a joint visit with the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women. Participants agreed that a holistic approach was 
needed while considering gender issues. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and  
the Optional Protocol thereto 
</b></p>
<p>61. Under this agenda item, participants were briefed by the Secretariat on the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto that were adopted 
on 13 December 2006 and entered into force on 3 May 2008. The Conference of States Parties 
will be convened by the end of 2008, at which States parties will elect the members of the new 
treaty body established under the Convention. OHCHR will serve as the Secretariat of the future 
committee. 
</p>
<p>62. Examples of cooperation between the Secretariat and the special procedures to mainstream 
the rights of persons with disabilities into mandate-holders&#8217; activities were shared. For example, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on education actively participated in the 2006 OHCHR expert seminars 
on the right to education of persons with disabilities; in 2007, the Special Rapporteur on torture 
took part in the expert seminar on freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading 
treatment and punishment and persons with disabilities. Subsequently, both Special Rapporteurs 
had devoted special attention to the rights of persons with disabilities within their mandates, 
including in the drafting of thematic reports and in their fact-finding missions. Mandate-holders 
welcomed the briefing by the Secretariat and underlined the need for close cooperation and 
coordination. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Follow-up to the study on violence against children 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Secretariat briefed participants on the follow-up to the study on violence against 
children. General Assembly resolution 62/141, in which the Assembly established the mandate 
of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on violence against children, specifically 
provides that United Nations mechanisms should cooperate with the Special Representative and 
provide information, where appropriate, on the measures adopted to ensure and respect the rights 
of children to be protected from violence. The Assembly also requested human rights 
mechanisms to consider how to use their respective mandates most effectively to contribute to 
the elimination of violence against children. It was stressed that, while violence against children 
was an obvious subject of concern for some thematic mandates, such as the Special Rapporteur 
on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, all mandate-holders had a role to play in 
addressing its different manifestations, causes and consequences. 
</p>
<p>64. The Secretariat presented a number of concrete suggestions to help strengthen special 
procedures&#8217; work in this area, including devoting thematic reports to specific manifestations of 
violence against children or to violence in specific contexts/circumstances or against specific 
groups and drafting specific recommendations in the reports concerning children. It was also 
suggested that meetings be scheduled with children rights non-governmental organizations 
during mandate-holder missions and consultations organized with children and young people 
during them. More regular exchanges and interaction with the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child could also be facilitated as an important means to promote greater attention to children&#8217;s 
rights and violence against children under specific mandates. 
</p>
<p>65. Mandate-holders shared their experience with regard to their work on violence against 
children. Areas of concern included social exploitation against children, child violence and 
national criminal system, places where children are deprived of liberty, violence against children 
in connection to arbitrary detention, education and adoption. Mandate-holders supported the 
need to strengthen their engagement and contribution to address violence against children. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Secretariat briefed participants on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 61/295 on 
13 September 2007. The Declaration constitutes a landmark for indigenous people. The 
Declaration affirms the basic rights of indigenous peoples in a number of areas of special 
concern for these peoples, whose right to self-determination it recognizes. The Declaration 
includes references to the right to equality and non-discrimination; the right to cultural integrity; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the rights over lands, territories and natural resources; the right to self-government and 
autonomy; the right to free, prior and informed consent; and others. The Declaration specifically 
provides that States shall promote respect for and full application of the provisions of the 
Declaration and follow up its effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>67. There was agreement that the rights of indigenous peoples are a cross-cutting issue that 
concerns all thematic and geographic mandates and that the work of all special procedures 
mandates-holders is important for the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous 
peoples. It was underlined that a number of recommendations of special procedures 
mandate-holders addressed the concerns of indigenous peoples, although there was a need to 
strengthen follow-up in the implementation of those recommendations. Participants shared their 
experiences and good practices in this regard. Mandate-holders agreed that the effective 
implementation of the Declaration constituted a major challenge ahead, and decided to 
strengthen their efforts in that regard. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  COOPERATION WITH HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY BODIES 
</b></p>
<p>68. Participants had an opportunity to meet with the chairpersons of treaty bodies and to 
exchange views on questions relating to the follow-up to special procedures and treaty bodies 
recommendations, including in the context of the universal periodic review. The meeting was 
co-chaired with the Chairperson of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, 
Fatimata-Binta Victoire Dah. 
</p>
<p>69. Participants concurred that the universal periodic review complemented the work of the 
treaty bodies and the special procedures. The chairpersons of the treaty bodies noted that they 
would consider including universal periodic review recommendations in their country 
examinations, including the pledges made by States during the review process, although that 
would only constitute one of the sources for the identification of issues arising in the 
examination of countries. 
</p>
<p>70. Representatives of both special procedures and treaty bodies agreed to raise the existing 
level of mutual cooperation and coordination. The need to ensure greater interaction was 
stressed, including through relevant mandate-holders addressing the treaty bodies directly on the 
occasion of the review of reports of States. This was considered crucial, especially in cases 
where there were no State reports. Ensuring exchange of information between treaty bodies and 
special procedures was highlighted. In preparing general comments on the interpretation of 
treaties which they monitor, human rights treaty bodies consult with the relevant special 
procedures. It was decided that this practice should be continued. 
</p>
<p>71. The importance of building on each other&#8217;s recommendations was stressed by many 
participants. One mandate-holder explained that he was able to engage in serious dialogues with 
Governments by basing his country recommendations on treaty body observations and 
recommendations. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights 
while countering terrorism, Martin Scheinin, suggested that the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights could consider preparing a general comment on the impact of 
counter-terrorism measures on economic, social and cultural rights, and that, similarly, the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women could also consider special general comments on the impact of counter-terrorism </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>measures on the rights of women and children. The possibility for special procedures 
mandate-holders to schedule their visit to a country prior to the consideration of that country by a 
treaty body monitoring issues falling under their mandate was flagged by one mandate-holder. 
</p>
<p>72. It was recommended that consultations should be held in advance on common procedural 
and thematic issues to be discussed by the joint meeting of treaty bodies and special procedures 
the following year.  
</p>
<p><b>IX. CONSULTATIONS WITH NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS 
AND NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS  
</b></p>
<p>73. Participants had an open discussion with representatives of non-governmental 
organizations and national human rights organizations, who were invited to discuss increased 
interaction to strengthen follow-up to the work of the special procedures. 
</p>
<p>74. Appreciation was expressed by civil society organizations for the professionalism and 
effectiveness with which the Committee and other mandate-holders had participated in the 
institution-building process. The non-governmental organization representatives expressed the 
hope that the Committee would work closely with the President in the following year. Several 
civil society representatives welcomed the adoption of the internal advisory procedure to review 
practices and working methods and the manual of the United Nations human rights special 
procedures, as they constituted sound guidelines that would help mandate-holders to uphold the 
highest standards of effectiveness and integrity. 
</p>
<p>75. All non-governmental organizations expressed their strong support for the special 
procedures system. They agreed that the cooperation of non-governmental organizations was of 
paramount importance in ensuring follow-up and implementation of mandate-holders&#8217; 
recommendations. Some civil society organizations shared good practices in following up on 
mandate-holders&#8217; recommendations. The organization of follow-up seminars relating to country 
recommendations or guidelines further to the thematic reports of special rapporteurs was 
mentioned. Several non-governmental organizations supported the idea of a joint 
communications report to the Council. 
</p>
<p>76. Non-governmental organizations indicated how the work of special procedures is used to 
further advocacy, promoting greater respect for human rights, especially at the national level. 
They made suggestions about how the work of special procedures could be followed up. In that 
regard, they particularly referred to the universal periodic review as an important entry point for 
building on the recommendations of special procedures. Communications by special procedures 
were highlighted as an important tool, and recommendations were made to further improve it. 
Joint activities by special procedures, including country visits and follow-up reports, were 
mentioned as positive developments. The organizations also noted the important role played in 
monitoring implementation of special procedures&#8217; recommendations at the country level. 
Thematic issues that cross different mandates, including children&#8217;s rights, gender, sexual 
orientation and drug abuse, were also raised. The need to identify and fill protection gaps was 
noted. While neither the Committee nor the special procedures as a whole saw their role as being 
to review protection gaps, particularly in order to identify the need to establish new special 
procedures, individual mandate-holders were free to make observations in that regard in the 
fulfilment of their respective mandates. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>77. A representative of the International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights 
Institutions emphasized the importance of mandate-holders organizing meetings with national 
human rights institutions in the context of their country visits and work with them to follow-up 
on recommendations made during a country visit. An example was provided concerning the 
Ugandan National Human Rights Commission and the role it played during the mission of the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to health to the country, and in following up on his 
recommendations. This was seen as a good practice. In order to obtain or renew their 
accreditation in accordance with the Paris Principles, national human rights institutions now have 
to show the steps that they have taken to cooperate with international human rights mechanisms, 
including implementation of recommendations of special procedures. This was a new and 
welcome development. 
</p>
<p>78. Mandate-holders expressed deep appreciation for the work of non-governmental 
organizations and recognized that they played an important role in supporting the special 
procedures system, citing several examples of where that relationship had been particularly 
successful. They highlighted that their discussions held during the week had included 
consideration of how to improve their impact through communications and their other activities. 
With regard to the universal periodic review, they noted the need to track progress in 
implementation during the years between reviews. The role of the Committee was also 
reaffirmed, with a commitment to continue working with the President of the Council and with 
the Council itself to address issues of concern to the special procedures system. Several of the 
new mandate-holders took the opportunity to introduce themselves to the non-governmental 
organizations. </p>

<p><b>DECISION TAKEN AT THE FIFTEENTH ANNUAL MEETING  
OF SPECIAL PROCEDURES

<p><b>Procedure to bring special situations to the attention of the annual meeting 
</b></p>
<p> The meeting agreed that any situation of concern should be first brought to the attention of 
the Coordination Committee that will decide upon further action in light of the guidelines agreed 
upon by the fifteenth annual meeting. The Committee will examine the case and will put the 
matter on the agenda of the annual meeting when the criteria for common action* are met.

<p><b>Annex III 
</b></p>
<p><b>INTERNAL ADVISORY PROCEDURE TO REVIEW  
PRACTICES AND WORKING METHODS 
</b></p>
<p> The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action underlined the importance of preserving 
and strengthening the system of special procedures<b> </b>and specified that the procedures and 
mechanisms should be enabled to harmonize and rationalize their work (part II, para. 95). The 
independence of special procedures mandate-holders is the cornerstone of their integrity and 
nothing should be allowed to undermine that independence. At the same time, however, 
mandate-holders agree to discharge their functions and regulate their conduct in a manner totally 
in keeping with the objective of promoting and protecting human rights. 
 In the case of the special procedures, the assumption of self-regulation is both appropriate 
and essential as long as it does not prejudice the observations and the neutrality of the 
mandate-holders. The principle of self-regulation is crucial to the coherence and viability of a 
system premised upon independence. 
</p>
<p> Mandate-holders should draw upon standards set out in the manual of special procedures 
on human rights, as updated to be in consonance with the code of conduct, as guidance in 
aligning their individual practices, conduct and methods of work with their ultimate 
responsibilities to safeguard the potential victims of human rights violations. This is the 
professional responsibility of each mandate-holder. 
</p>
<p> To facilitate this process, to enhance the effectiveness and preserve the integrity of the 
system of special procedures, an internal advisory procedure has been established to provide a 
standing mechanism for continuous consideration of the practices and working methods of the 
special procedures. This procedure seeks to seize the earliest opportunity to take action when 
issues are raised regarding how mandate-holders have met agreed upon standards in the 
performance of their duties. The emphasis of the process is on issuing guidance notes on the 
appropriate interpretation of the manual to reflect an evaluation of actual practices and conduct. 
The procedure will also serve to record innovative methods and document best practices. 
</p>
<p> The internal advisory procedure does not apply to the substantive assessments made by 
mandate-holders with regard to country situations or thematic issues. Matters of substance are 
within the sole purview of each mandate-holder, in accordance with their mandate, impartiality 
and the highest degree of integrity. 
</p>
<p> <b>When and what:</b> When a matter is brought to the attention of the Coordination Committee 
that either (a) calls for an examination of the effectiveness or appropriateness of the methods of 
work as detailed in the manual; (b) calls for a consideration of whether specific acts or practices 
align with best practices as presented in the manual; or (c) could be considered a practice 
prejudicial to the integrity, independence, and impartiality of the system of special procedures or 
to the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p> <b>Who:</b> States Members of the United Nations, OHCHR, other mandate-holders and other 
relevant stakeholders. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> <b>How:</b> By written communication directly to the Chairperson of the Special Procedures 
Coordination Committee. The communication must be signed, dated and contain the information 
necessary to contact the author of the communication. If the subject of the communication relates 
to a specific event or activity, the communication must be timely. Substantial delay may make 
fair consideration of the matter impossible or moot. 
</p>
<p> <b>Review procedure:</b> When a communication is received, the Chairperson will first review 
it for the purpose of determining whether (a) appropriate corrective action has been or can be 
taken without the necessity for a broader inquiry; (b) intervening events have made action on the 
communication unnecessary; (c) the basis of the communication is directly related to substantive 
determinations made by a mandate-holder within the scope of their mandate; (d) the situation 
described in the communication is on its face either clearly irreproachable or plainly without 
veracity and/or any other reason that review of the matter should be deemed inappropriate 
a priori. If any of these apply, then the Chairperson will communicate the same to the author of 
the communication orally or in writing. 
</p>
<p> If none of the above descriptions apply, and if the communication relates to the conduct of 
an individual mandate-holder, the Chairperson will forward the communication to the 
mandate-holder and request a response. That response and the original communication will then 
be distributed to the entire Coordination Committee. If the communication is of a more general 
nature, it will be immediately distributed to the other members of the Coordination Committee 
for their consideration and comment. 
</p>
<p> When the matter under consideration is the conduct of an individual mandate-holder, the 
communication and the subsequent procedure must be treated as a matter of utmost 
confidentiality. However, the Chairperson may communicate orally or in writing with the author 
of the communication, the subject mandate-holder and other stakeholders who may have 
knowledge of the matter, and may review any relevant documents. Neither the Chairperson nor 
the Committee will undertake to make findings of fact about any matter that is reasonably in 
dispute. 
</p>
<p> <b>Outcomes:</b> In addressing matters brought before it as communications, the Committee will 
be guided solely by its interest in preserving and strengthening the system of special procedures 
based on integrity, independence and impartiality. The powers of the Committee are limited by 
its mandate to enhance and facilitate the work of mandate-holders. 
</p>
<p> In addressing communications, then, the Committee may undertake one or more of the 
following actions: prepare a guidance note that will be distributed to all mandate-holders and the 
author of the communication, which sets forth the relevant issues and facts, an explanation of the 
thinking of the Committee on the matter and, where necessary, a recommendation that the 
manual be amended to give guidance to all mandate-holders on how such situations might best 
be handled in the future. The guidance note will not include the name of the author of the 
communication or of the subject mandate-holder, if individual conduct is in question. 
Recommended changes to the manual will be vetted by the entire body of special procedures. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> In an egregious case, where the Committee finds that the conduct of the subject 
mandate-holder threatens the integrity of the system of special procedures as a whole, the 
Committee will inform and provide additional guidance to the subject mandate-holder by private 
communication in case she or he wishes to take appropriate action. The Committee will also 
submit its findings to the President of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p> The Chairperson of the Committee will report to the President of the Council on actions 
taken under this procedure. The OHCHR Secretariat will give the customary support to the 
Committee in exercising their functions under this procedure.
