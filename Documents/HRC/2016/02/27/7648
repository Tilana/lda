<p>During the 18th Session of Cambodia&#8217;s UPR, Cambodia has received 205 
recommendations from 76 delegations. Since a number of recommendations are repetitive, 
the Human Rights Committee of Cambodia has decided as follows: 
</p>
<p><b>Accepted Recommendations: 163</b> (Recommendations No. 118.1&#8211;171 except 
118.1&#8211;5, 118.22, 118.57 and 118.161). 
</p>
<p><b>Noted Recommendations: 38</b> (Recommendations No. 118.1&#8211;4 and 119.1&#8211;34). 
These recommendations are noted and are under consideration among the inter-
</p>
<p>ministerial in order to make sure they reflect the situation on the ground and in line with 
national, regional situation. 
</p>
<p><b>Rejected Recommendations: 4</b> (Recommendations No. 118.5, 118.22, 118.57 and 
118.161). 
 These recommendations are contrary to the Constitution and laws of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia.
