<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions documents the main activities undertaken between April 2008 and March 2009 to 
address the grave problem of extrajudicial executions around the world.<b>1</b> He focuses on four 
issues: (a) responding to reprisals against individuals assisting the Special Rapporteur in his 
work; (b) upholding the prohibition against the execution of juvenile offenders; (c) the killing of 
witches; and (d) the use of lethal force in the process of policing public assemblies. 
</p>
<p>2. The report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 8/3, and takes 
account of information received and communications sent between 1 April 2008 
and 15 March 2009. 
</p>
<p>3. An overview of the mandate, a list of the specific types of violations of the right to life 
upon which action is taken, and a description of the legal framework and methods of work used 
in implementing this mandate can be found in the first report of the current mandate holder 
(E/CN.4/2005/7, paras. 5-12). 
</p>
<p>4. I am grateful to the staff of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) for their assistance in relation to the mandate, as well as to 
Sarah Knuckey, William Abresch, Hina Shamsi and Madeleine Sinclair of the Project on 
Extrajudicial Executions at New York University School of Law, who provided invaluable 
expert assistance and advice. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ACTIVITIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communications 
</b></p>
<p>5. The present report covers communications sent from 16 March 2008 to 15 March 2009 and 
replies received from 1 May 2008 to 30 April 2009. The details of my concerns and the 
information provided in response by Governments are reflected in considerable detail in an 
addendum to the report (A/HRC/11/2/Add.1), which is of crucial importance. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  In the report, the term &#8220;extrajudicial executions&#8221; is used to refer to executions other than those 
</p>
<p>carried out by the State in conformity with the law. As explained in my previous reports &#8220;[t]he 
terms of reference of this mandate are not best understood through efforts to define individually 
the terms &#8216;extrajudicial&#8217;, &#8216;summary&#8217; or &#8216;arbitrary&#8217;, or to seek to categorize any given incident 
accordingly&#8221;. Rather, &#8220;the most productive focus is on the mandate itself, as it has evolved over 
the years through the various resolutions of the General Assembly&#8221;, the Commission on Human 
Rights and the Human Rights Council (E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 6; A/HRC/4/20, para. 1, fn. 1). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>6. A brief statistical profile of the communications sent during the period under review shows 
that 130 communications were sent to 42 countries,<b>2</b> including 64 urgent appeals and 
66 allegation letters. The main issues covered in the communications were the death penalty 
(54); deaths in custody (21); the death penalty for minors (20); excessive use of force (18); 
impunity (11); attacks or killings (23); armed conflict (3); and death threats (7). 
</p>
<p>7. As in previous years, the proportion of Government replies received to communications 
sent during the period under review is problematically low. The exact percentage figures in this 
regard are provided in an addendum dedicated to communications (A/HRC/11/2/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Visits 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Visits undertaken from April 2008 to March 2009 
</b></p>
<p>8. Since I last reported to the Council I have undertaken visits to Afghanistan, the 
United States of America and Kenya. Reports on those visits are before the Council, as are the 
final reports on my visits to Brazil and the Central African Republic, on which I had reported to 
the Council in 2008. In addition, follow-up reports on my previous missions to Guatemala and 
the Philippines have been submitted (A/HRC/11/2/Add.7 and Add.8). 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Mission requests outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>9. As at March 2009, I had made requests to 47 countries that I wished to visit, as well as to 
the Palestinian Authority. A visit to Colombia is scheduled for June 2009, and plans for visits to 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to Albania are being discussed. While the Palestinian 
Authority issued an invitation long ago, Israel has yet to respond. 
</p>
<p>10. The responses of 34 countries have ranged from complete silence, through formal 
acknowledgement, to acceptance in principle but without meaningful follow-up. In some cases, 
the relevant requests were first made over eight years ago. 
</p>
<p>11. States that have not responded affirmatively to requests for a visit are Algeria, Bangladesh, 
Chad, China, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guinea, India, Indonesia, 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, the Laos People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, 
Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, 
South Africa, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkmenistan, Uganda, the 
United Republic of Tanzania, Uzbekistan, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam and 
Yemen. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  The States are Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Cameroon, Chad, China, Colombia, the

<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, 
Equatorial Guinea, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Madagascar, Mexico, Mongolia, Mozambique, the 
Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, 
Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sri Lanka, the Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, the United States of 
America, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam, Yemen and Zimbabwe. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  ISSUES OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Responding to reprisals against individuals assisting  
the Special Rapporteur in his work 
</b></p>
<p>12. In March 2009, a journalist questioned the spokesperson of the Secretary-General about 
the protection available to individuals who had provided information to me on one of my 
missions. 
</p>
<p>13. The official transcript records the following exchange: 
</p>
<p><i>Question</i>: [T]here are these reports following up on Philip Alston&#8217;s report about police 
killings in Kenya that some 30 human rights activists and lawyers have gone into hiding 
because they think they&#8217;re going to be killed because they cooperated with the UN on the 
report. Is the UN aware of it, and what&#8217;s the UN going to do for people who actually 
worked with the UN on this report? 
</p>
<p><i>Spokesperson</i>: This report was made to the Human Rights Council and it is a matter for the 
Human Rights Council to take decisions on. 
</p>
<p><i>Question</i>: But if it&#8217;s true what these people say that they&#8217;re in fear of their life because they 
cooperate with the UN, does the Human Rights Council have any safety or security 
service? What&#8217;s the procedure? 
</p>
<p><i>Spokesperson</i>: The Human Rights Council does not have its own security services, if that&#8217;s 
what you&#8217;re asking.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>14. The above exchange highlights a significant challenge facing the Council in relation to the 
country missions undertaken on its behalf by special procedures mandate holders. At one level, it 
goes without saying that the Council cannot provide security services, nor can it be responsible 
for actions taken by Governments which are acting, or failing to act, in accordance with the 
generally accepted rules governing this type of human rights fact-finding. At another level, 
however, the question serves to expose a major gap in the arrangements that the Council has put 
in place. It has established a system that depends heavily on the good faith cooperation of civil 
society and private actors in providing information, but then stands back and fails to act when 
those same individuals are victimized by Government agents precisely as a result of their 
cooperation. The irony is that although the Council, and the Commission that preceded it have 
regularly acknowledged the unacceptable nature of such reprisals, it almost never takes any 
action in response to such cases. The Council should move to remedy this gap in its procedures. 
</p>
<p>15. One of the fundamental assumptions upon which country visits by special procedures are 
undertaken is the principle that &#8220;[c]omplainants, witnesses, those conducting the investigation 
and their families shall be protected from violence, threats of violence or any other form of 
intimidation&#8221;. While this formulation is taken from principle 15 of the principles on the effective 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  Daily press briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General, 
</p>
<p>30 March 2009, available at www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2009/db090330.doc.htm. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>prevention and investigation of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions (Economic and 
Social Council resolution 1989/65, annex), the same approach was repeatedly endorsed by the 
Commission on Human Rights. In its resolution 2005/9, the Commission urged Governments to 
refrain from all acts of intimidation or reprisal against those who availed or had availed 
themselves of procedures established under United Nations auspices for the protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms, or who had provided testimony or information to them. The 
principle is also reflected in the terms of reference for fact-finding missions by special 
rapporteurs/representatives of the Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/1998/45, appendix V), 
which provide that &#8220;no persons, official or private individuals who have been in contact with the 
special rapporteur/representative in relation to the mandate will for this reason suffer threats, 
harassment or punishment or be subjected to judicial proceedings&#8221;. 
16. In spite of these principles, intimidation of witnesses remains one of the most effective 
ways for perpetrators of extrajudicial executions and those who tolerate such practices to avoid 
being held accountable. If witnesses can be easily intimidated, if they and their families remain 
vulnerable, or if they sense that the protections offered to them cannot be relied upon, they are 
unlikely to testify. In reporting to the General Assembly (A/63/313, para. 12), I noted that &#8220;[t]he 
successful prosecution of those responsible for extrajudicial executions is difficult, if not 
impossible, in the absence of effective witness-protection programmes. [&#8230;] Ending impunity for 
killings thus requires institutionalizing measures to reduce the risks faced by witnesses who 
testify.&#8221; I drew attention to examples of global best practice and identified some of the key issues 
that needed to be addressed in the design of effective witness-protection programmes. In 
response, the Assembly urged States to intensify efforts to establish and implement such 
programmes and encouraged OHCHR to develop practical tools designed to encourage and 
facilitate greater attention to the protection of witnesses.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>17. Just as successful prosecution of organized crime and serious offences committed by 
organs of State or armed groups at the national level is difficult or impossible in the absence of 
effective witness-protection programmes, effective fact-finding and reporting on extrajudicial 
executions by my mandate is difficult, if not impossible, if persons cooperating with the mandate 
can be effectively intimidated by those interested in preventing them from doing so. 
</p>
<p>18. In the domestic context, the first and most important step for investigators is to take 
measures to avoid placing witnesses at risk. The same applies to witnesses<b>5</b> assisting country 
missions by special procedures. In preparing country visits, a considerable effort is made to 
assess the potential threat to possible witnesses. This involves the Special Rapporteur, OHCHR 
officials and other staff assisting my mandate, in consultation with the OHCHR Field Security 
Unit, the United Nations presence in the country, any relevant national human rights institution, 
and civil society organizations who are in contact with potential witnesses. Depending on the 
level of threat, precautionary measures regarding the locations and circumstances in which I 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  General Assembly resolution 63/182, para. 10. 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  In this context, the term &#8220;witness&#8221; is used to cover all those who provide information to the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur, whether they be victims, eyewitnesses, victims&#8217; family members, officials of 
human rights organizations or other. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>meet witnesses are decided. The actual implementation of such measures (for example, selection 
of meeting locations or travel arrangements for witnesses) is essentially the responsibility of the 
United Nations field presence, national human rights institution and civil society organizations, 
and of the witnesses themselves. The Special Rapporteur, however, retains moral responsibility 
for not subjecting witnesses to unjustified risks. Occasions have arisen when I have decided not 
to meet a potentially very valuable witness because I could not justify the risk involved for the 
witness. 
</p>
<p>19. Three factors complicate the choice, adoption and implementation of precautions designed 
to protect witnesses. First, the financial and logistical means available to a special rapporteur for 
such purposes are minimal, even with the support provided by the United Nations field presence, 
non-governmental organizations and civil society. Special rapporteurs have no resources to set 
up their own witness-protection programmes, unlike States and even the ad hoc international 
criminal tribunals and the International Criminal Court. Second, most witnesses are likely to 
overestimate the ability of a special rapporteur to protect them, and might as a consequence be 
less cautious than they would be in cooperating with a domestic investigator. Third, as the 
Government of the country concerned is the host and is responsible for the security of the special 
rapporteur, the basic details of my travel plans within the country must be shared with the 
Government. This in turn implies a serious limitation on the confidentiality of any arrangements 
that can be made to protect the identity of witnesses becoming known. 
</p>
<p>20. I inform witnesses who might be at risk that I have no concrete means at my disposal to 
assist them against retaliatory measures by the authorities once I leave the country. In some 
cases, it will be possible for a special procedures mandate holder to ask the Government 
concerned to include persons at risk in the domestic witness-protection programme. During a 
visit in 2003 to Brazil by my predecessor, a witness who had testified to her on police death 
squads was killed by unknown perpetrators (having already survived one attempt on his life by a 
police officer).<b>6</b> The Government reacted immediately and offered to include all witnesses who 
spoke to the special rapporteur - and who agreed - to be included in a witness-protection 
programme.<b>7</b> The Special Rapporteur subsequently submitted a list of witnesses to the Federal 
Government. 
</p>
<p>21. The possibility of entrusting witnesses at risk to the domestic witness-protection 
programme is, however, an exception. Generally, there is no witness-protection programme that 
would be effective under the circumstances. Where such programmes do exist, they are usually 
run by the same authorities responsible for taking or threatening the reprisals in the first place. 
</p>
<p>22. In the absence of an effective programme, my only option is to seek clarification and 
assurances from the Government concerned. For example, after my mission to Kenya, I sent 
an urgent appeal and issued public statements in response to continuing reprisals.<b>8</b> Other

</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  Documented in my public statement issued at the conclusion of the visit (&#8220;Independent expert 
</p>
<p>on extrajudicial executions says police killings in Kenya are systematic, widespread and 
 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>mandates have similarly sought explanations and assurances from Governments - whether orally, 
in letters, or through their reports - upon receiving credible allegations of such reprisals.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>23. At the end of the day, however, there will be situations in which Governments fail to 
respond meaningfully and the reprisals continue. In those situations, it is essential that the 
Council itself have a mechanism for seeking explanations from the Governments concerned and, 
where appropriate, expressing public concern when a Government&#8217;s response is inadequate. 
While the Secretary-General and other actors have an important role to play in this regard, it is 
ultimately the responsibility of the Council, whose &#8220;eyes and ears&#8221; the special procedures are 
often said to be. 
</p>
<p>24. Under current arrangements, the Council receives once a year a report addressing acts of 
intimidation or reprisal against four categories of individuals: those cooperating with 
representatives of United Nations human rights bodies; those who have cooperated with 
United Nations human rights procedures; those who have submitted communications under 
established procedures; and the relatives of human rights victims. The net thus appears to be cast 
broadly. In his report for 2009 (A/HRC/10/36), the Secretary-General provides details of, 
inter alia, the killing of the spouse of a witness who testified under the universal periodic review 
process (para. 8), the incarceration of a human rights defender who had written to the 
United Nations (paras. 9 and 10), and soldiers threatening the staff of a non-governmental 
organization (paras. 11 and 12).  
</p>
<p>25. The above-mentioned report is far from comprehensive, indeed it presents only an 
extremely limited picture of the real situation. First, it relies almost entirely on cases publicized 
by mandate holders in their reports, and especially on those mentioned by the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders. Second, cases are not reported if there are &#8220;security 
concerns&#8221; or the individuals concerned have opted not to have their cases made public. In 
instances involving threats of serious reprisals, this will often be the case. Third, reprisals against 
individuals for cooperating with other United Nations bodies, such as OHCHR field presences 
and peacekeeping operations, are not covered by the report. And finally, in the report itself, the 
Secretary-General acknowledges that reprisals against individuals cooperating with 
United Nations human rights bodies are often unreported owing to a lack of access to appropriate 
means of communication or fear of further reprisals (para. 7). The coverage of the report is thus 
very limited and its reporting seems perfunctory. 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>well planned&#8221;, press release, 25 February 2009) an urgent appeal I sent jointly with three other 
special procedures mandate holders on 13 March 2009 (which regrettably remained without a 
response from the Government as of one month later; see A/HRC/11/2/Add.1) and in two press 
releases (&#8220;UN expert on extrajudicial executions calls upon Kenyan Government to establish an 
independent investigation into the assassination of two prominent Kenyan human rights 
defenders&#8221; and &#8220;UN expert on extrajudicial executions calls on Kenya to stop the systematic 
intimidation of human rights defenders&#8221;). 
<b>9
</b>  See A/HRC/7/28/Add.2, paras. 72-74. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>26. Perhaps unsurprisingly, none of the three reports submitted by the Secretary-General to the 
Council at its fourth, seventh and tenth sessions has generated any debate among Member States. 
While a few Governments have made statements in relation to specific incidents, the reporting 
process has not served the original purpose of bringing greater attention to the relevant problems 
and providing an occasion for the Council to take action. It is therefore essential that the Council 
and other stakeholders address this issue with urgency. Recommendations to this effect are 
proposed at the end of the present report. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Upholding the prohibition against the execution of juvenile offenders 
</b>27. The prohibition against executing juvenile offenders (those who were under the age of 18 
at the time of committing the relevant crime) is one of the clearest and most important of 
international human rights standards. It is unequivocal and admits of no exception. There is not a 
single Member State of the United Nations that is not a party to one of the two international 
treaties enshrining this norm: the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Yet juvenile offenders continue to be sentenced to death, 
as evidenced by many such reports I have brought to the attention of the Governments concerned 
in recent years. 
</p>
<p>28. In its resolution 10/2, the Council urged States to ensure that capital punishment is not 
imposed for offences committed by persons under 18 years of age, and called on relevant special 
procedures of the Council to give special attention to such questions and to provide, wherever 
appropriate, specific recommendations in that regard. 
</p>
<p>29. I therefore wish to draw the Council&#8217;s attention to the situation in relation to the juvenile 
death penalty, especially as reflected in the communications sent to Governments in the last two 
years.<b>10</b> During that period, I have addressed 33 communications to five Governments<b>11</b> 
regarding allegations that the death penalty has been imposed for a crime committed by a minor, 
or that the execution of a juvenile offender was imminent or had been carried out. The 
communications concerned 46 juvenile offenders, four of them female, the remainder male.<b>12</b> 
In six cases, it was alleged that the juvenile offender had been executed.<b>13</b> In the remaining cases, 
urgent appeals were sent in situations where reports indicated the risk of the execution of a 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  See A/HRC/8/3/Add.1 and A/HRC/11/2/Add.1. 
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  Those of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia and the 
</p>
<p>Sudan. A recent Human Rights Watch report on the theme &#8220;The last holdouts: ending the 
juvenile death penalty in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Pakistan and Yemen&#8221; 
(http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2008/09/10/last-holdouts) includes Yemen but not 
Papua New Guinea. 
<b>12
</b></p>
<p>  The breakdown by country is Iran (Islamic Republic of): 24 communications concerning 
30 juvenile offenders; the Sudan: 4 communications concerning 10 offenders; Saudi Arabia: 
3 communications concerning 4 offenders; Papua New Guinea and Pakistan: each one 
communication concerning one offender. 
<b>13
</b></p>
<p>  See in A/HRC/11/2/Add.1. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>juvenile offender taking place. In two cases, I was subsequently informed by the Government 
that the death penalty had been quashed on appeal (A/HRC/8/3/Add.1); in another case, I was 
subsequently informed by a source that the juvenile offender had been released (the Government 
did not respond to my urgent appeals in these cases). Finally, in two cases, I called the 
Government&#8217;s attention to reports that such executions had already taken place. In neither of 
those cases did the Government confirm or deny the reports. 
</p>
<p>30. Unfortunately, the level of government responses to communications is particularly low in 
cases concerning the imposition of the death penalty against juvenile offenders. Thus, 
33 communications over a two-year period have drawn only four responses, amounting to a 
response rate of about 12 per cent. Moreover, since February 2008, no responses to 
communications regarding the use of the death penalty against juvenile offenders have been 
received. 
</p>
<p>31. It might be asked why the Council should be especially concerned with this particular 
issue, when a relatively small number of juveniles have actually been executed. The answer is 
threefold. First, matters concerning the right to life are of fundamental importance, a fact which 
has consistently been recognized by the Council and its predecessor. Second, the juvenile death 
penalty is a negation of the essential principles of juvenile justice endorsed by a wide range of 
United Nations bodies and accepted by all States. Third, the credibility of the Council is called 
into question if it fails to respond in any way to a situation involving repeated violations of an 
international standard that is entirely unambiguous and universally proclaimed. 
</p>
<p>32. Based on the correspondence that I have engaged in with Governments and on the replies 
received, there would appear to be four possible obstacles in the way of eliminating the juvenile 
death penalty, not just on paper, but in practice. 
33. The first obstacle seems to be a misunderstanding of the precise age at which an individual 
ceases to be a juvenile. Thus, for example, the Government of Saudi Arabia reported that it 
applies &#8220;regulations ... stipulat[ing] that a person can be held criminally responsible for acts that 
he commits after reaching the age of majority, which differs from one individual to another&#8221; 
(A/HRC/8/3/Add.1, p. 343). Similarly, article 7 (1) of the Arab Charter on Human Rights, which 
entered into force on 15 March 2008, provides that &#8220;Sentences of death shall not be imposed on 
persons under 18 years of age, unless otherwise stipulated in the laws in force at the time of the 
commission of the crime.&#8221; While the Convention on the Rights of the Child leaves room in 
article 1 for the setting of an age below 18 years for specific purposes, this is not in fact the case 
in relation to the death penalty. To the contrary, the Convention is absolutely clear in 
article 37 (a) in establishing 18 years as the minimum age attained at the time of the relevant 
crime in order for an individual to be potentially subject to the death penalty in those 
jurisdictions that have retained it. Unlike other provisions of the Convention, this prohibition is 
not flexible when account is taken of the individual development and maturity of the offender. 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has emphasized these points in relation to 
Saudi Arabia.<b>14</b> The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights similarly admits no 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>14
</b>  CRC/C/SAU/CO/2, para. 32. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>flexibility in terms of the minimum age. Thus, for States that are parties to the Arab Charter and 
to either or both of the other two international human rights treaties, the higher standard must 
prevail. In practice, this applies to all relevant States. 
</p>
<p>34. A second obstacle concerns disputes over the age of the individual. Contrary to previous 
reporting periods (for example, see A/HRC/4/20/Add.1, p. 154), none of the communications 
received from Governments during the reporting period disputed that the offenders sentenced to 
death were younger than 18 years at the time of the offence. In cases where a genuine dispute 
does exist, the Government is obligated to give the benefit of any doubt to the individual 
concerned. In other words, the inadequacy of birth registration arrangements cannot be invoked 
to the detriment of an individual who can reasonably contest an official claim that the age of 
majority had been attained at the time of the relevant offence. 
35. A third obstacle, invoked especially by the State that is responsible for the great majority 
of the executions of juveniles, concerns the requirements of Islamic law. Thus, the main 
argument advanced by the Islamic Republic of Iran is that, where the death penalty is provided 
as retribution (<i>Qesas</i>) for murder, the &#8220;enforcement of Qesas depends upon the request to be 
made by guardians of the murder victim; and the Government is solely delegated to carry out the 
verdict, on behalf of the former&#8221; (A/HRC/8/3/Add.1, p. 223). The Government asserted that, as a 
consequence of this principle, it could not enforce the prohibition of the death penalty for 
juvenile offenders in cases where it is imposed as <i>Qesas</i>. On the same grounds, the Government 
argued that its authorities had no power to grant pardon or commutation of the death sentence in 
a <i>Qesas </i>case. It added that it strived &#8220;to apply mechanisms, such as the provision of financial 
assistance to the guardians, which might result in receiving the required consent [to the juvenile 
offender being pardoned] from them&#8221;. It is beyond the scope of my mandate to examine the 
validity of this argument in terms of Islamic law, but it is noteworthy that none of the other 
States in which Islamic law is applicable has seen the need to invoke this exception. 
</p>
<p>36. In terms of international law, however, it is clear, as I have indicated in response to the 
specific cases,<b>15</b> that the obligation to eliminate capital punishment for offences committed by 
persons below 18 years of age cannot be confined to the role played by the judicial authorities, 
thus permitting the parallel existence of a whole separate regime designed to satisfy additional 
retribution claims asserted by the victim&#8217;s family. No such additional considerations are 
contemplated in either article 37 (a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child or article 6 (5) 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. To permit such a separate regime, 
and for the State to be able to assert that it has no power over that regime, would be to 
comprehensively undermine the system of international human rights law. This also helps to 
explain why such an exemption has not been invoked by other States in an effort to facilitate the 
continuation of the juvenile death penalty. 
37. In some States, the juvenile death penalty can be abolished by judicial decision (as in the 
United States of America in March 2005)<b>16</b> alone. In others, the actions required will be more 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>15
</b>  See for example the communications to the Islamic Republic of Iran and to Sudan in 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1. 
<b>16
</b></p>
<p>  <i>Roper v. Simmons</i>, 543 U.S. 551 (2005). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>diverse. Whatever the means employed, the result must be that all laws that permit the execution 
of juvenile offenders are repealed, the judiciary must end the practice of sentencing juvenile 
offenders to death, and a moratorium must be placed on the execution of any individuals already 
sentenced under pre-existing laws. A review of current developments in the relevant jurisdictions 
in this regard is instructive. 
</p>
<p>38. In January 2005, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran informed the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child that all executions of persons who had committed crimes under the 
age of 18 had been halted. This was reiterated in a note verbale of 8 March 2005 to OHCHR, in 
which it explained that the ban had been incorporated into the draft bill on juvenile courts, which 
was before Parliament for ratification.<b>17</b> I have sought confirmation of the current status of the 
bill in eight communications, but no reply addressing this issue has been received.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>39. In the meantime, the death penalty continues to be imposed upon juveniles and to be 
carried out in relation to them. Reliable reports suggest that there are at least 130 juvenile 
offenders currently on death row in Iran. I have sent 24 communications relating to 30 different 
cases of juvenile offenders sentenced to death or executed, but there has been no real movement 
of any kind towards bringing the Islamic Republic of Iran into compliance with its obligations 
under international law. Since 2004, I have been requesting a visit to the country, which has 
issued a standing invitation to all special procedures to visit. Despite several high-level meetings 
in Geneva, no dates have ever been set. 
</p>
<p>40. Recent cases continue to be deeply troubling. B.Z. was found guilty of killing a man 
in 2005, when he was aged 16. On 14 February 2008, the Government informed me that the 
judicial system, on the basis of human considerations, had entered the case into conciliation 
process and was seriously following it with the hope for final settlement. Therefore, carrying out 
the penalty was not in its programme of work (A/HRC/8/3/Add.1, p. 223). B.Z. was executed in 
Shiraz six months later, on 26 August 2008.<b>19</b> Another case is that of Delara Darabi, who was 
convicted of murdering a relative when she was 17, in 2003. She is alleged to have confessed in 
an attempt to save her boyfriend who was the responsible party, but she then withdrew her 
confession. On 19 April 2009, she was reportedly granted a two-month stay of execution by the 
Head of the Judiciary, but this order was ignored and she was executed less than two weeks later, 
on 1 May 2009. 
</p>
<p>41. In Papua New Guinea, the legislature is reported to be considering a draft juvenile 
justice act that would exclude the imposition of the death penalty for juvenile offenders.<b>20</b>

</p>
<p>Southern Sudan abolished the death penalty for juveniles when it adopted its Interim 
Constitution in 2006, but there remained at least six offenders on death row sentenced for crimes 
committed as minors.<b>21</b> The Interim National Constitution of the Sudan adopted in 2005, 
however, maintains an exception for &#8220;cases of retribution or <i>hudud</i>&#8221; in the prohibition of the 
imposition of the death penalty on a person under age 18 (art. 36 (2)). In August 2008, a 
counter-terrorism court in Khartoum sentenced a 17 year-old found guilty of having taken part in 
the Justice and Equality Movement attack against an omdurman in May 2008 to death on charges 
of <i>hiraba</i> (brigandage), a <i>hudud</i> offence.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>42. The execution of juvenile offenders is an affront to the fundamental principles of humane 
treatment and a blatant violation of international law. The insistence by one State in particular on 
continuing to impose and carry out such sentences thus represents a major challenge to the 
willingness of the Council to carry out the mandate entrusted to it.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  The killing of witches 
</b></p>
<p>43. The persecution and killing of individuals accused of practising so-called &#8220;witchcraft&#8221; - the 
vast majority of whom are women and children - is a significant phenomenon in many parts of 
the world, although it has not featured prominently on the radar screen of human rights monitors. 
This may be due partly to the difficulty of defining &#8220;witches&#8221; and &#8220;witchcraft&#8221; across cultures - 
terms that, quite apart from their connotations in popular culture, may include an array of 
traditional or faith healing practices and are not easily defined. The fact remains, however, that 
under the rubric of the amorphous and manipulable designation of witchcraft, individuals (often 
those who are somehow different, feared or disliked) are singled out for arbitrary private acts of 
violence or for Government-sponsored or tolerated acts of violence. In too many settings, being 
classified as a witch is tantamount to receiving a death sentence. 
</p>
<p>44. While there has been a steady trickle of reports from civil society groups alleging the 
persecution and killing of persons accused of being witches, the problem has never been 
addressed systematically in the context of human rights. There is little systematic information 
available on the numbers of persons so accused, persecuted or killed, nor is there any detailed 
analysis of the dynamics and patterns of such killings, or of how the killings can be prevented. 
The lack of attention paid to the issue is especially true of the various United Nations human 
rights bodies that might have been expected to have engaged in in-depth examination. A 
prominent exception is the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR), which acknowledges in its guidelines that women are still identified as witches in 
some communities and burned or stoned to death. These practices may be culturally condoned in 
the claimant&#8217;s community of origin but still amount to persecution.<b>23</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Defining &#8220;witchcraft&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>45. Defining witches and witchcraft is not an easy task. &#8220;Witchcraft&#8221; has denoted many 
different practices or beliefs at different times and in diverse cultures. In some cultures, belief in 
witchcraft is rare; in others, people see it as &#8220;everyday and ordinary, forming as it does an 
integral part of their daily lives&#8221;.<b>24</b> Such beliefs are not confined to any particular strata of 
society, whether in terms of education, income or occupation. Both the concept and the 
terminology also vary from one scholarly discipline to another. In Western Europe and the 
United States, witchcraft and the persecution of so-called witches are often associated with the 
witch-hunts and trials that took place there through the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries. 
Today, in the social sciences, and especially in the disciplines of religious studies, anthropology 
and ethnology, a wide range of contemporary beliefs and practices termed &#8220;witchcraft&#8221; or 
&#8220;sorcery&#8221; are studied around the world. 
</p>
<p>46. In the popular imagination, witchcraft is often associated with the infliction of harm on 
people or property through the purported exercise of supernatural powers. In sociological and 
anthropological terms, it can be described as a phenomenon that is invoked to explain 
misfortune by attributing it to the evil influence of someone, either from within or outside the 
community. Thus witchcraft has historically been employed to bring about &#8220;the death of some 
obnoxious person, or to awaken the passion of love in those who are the objects of desire, or to 
call up the dead, or to bring calamity or impotence upon enemies, rivals and fancied 
oppressors&#8221;.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>47. Alternatively, witchcraft may refer to or be associated with, for example, neo-paganism, 
shamanism or traditional healers. Some have emphasized its close links to moral and broader 
belief systems and portrayed it more benignly as providing a framework of moral agency that 
enables believers to make sense of otherwise seemingly inexplicable coincidences or 
happenings.<b>26</b> It is also associated with positive connotations such as healing or cleansing,<b>27</b> 
and as a means for articulating and coping with psychological problems.<b>28</b> In some regions, 
traditional communities had elders who acted as mediums in communicating with spirits from 
the other world and who were widely respected.<b>29</b>

<p>48. Older scholarship tended to emphasize the pitfalls of taking the meaning and significance 
attached to the term &#8220;witchcraft&#8221; in any given context and seeking to transpose it to other 
settings.<b>30</b> More recently, however, comparative studies have become much more common.<b>31</b> 
Ronald Hutton, for example, has identified five characteristics generally shared by those who 
believe in witches and witchcraft across different cultures and time periods: (a) witches use 
non-physical means to cause misfortune or injury to others; (b) harm is usually caused to 
neighbours or kin rather than strangers; (c) strong social disapproval follows, in part because of 
the element of secrecy and in part because their motives are not wealth or prestige but malice and 
spite; (d) witches work within long-standing traditions, rather than in one-time only contexts; 
and (e) other humans can resist witches through persuasion, non-physical means 
(counter-magic), or deterrence including through corporal punishment, exile, fines or 
execution.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Human rights, extrajudicial executions and witchcraft 
</b>49. The relevance of the practice of witchcraft to human rights is clearly a complex matter, and 
it is not possible to do justice to it within the confines of a report of this nature. Perhaps the most 
appropriate starting point is to examine the contexts in which attention has been brought to the 
human rights consequences of the phenomenon in recent years. Any such survey is inevitably 
incomplete, but it can nevertheless provide an insight into the nature of the challenges that need 
to be addressed:  
</p>
<p> (a) The killing of accused witches was reported as a significant phenomenon in the 
Central African Republic. Articles 162 and 162 bis of the country&#8217;s criminal code indicate that a 
person convicted of &#8220;witchcraft&#8221; (<i>charalatinsme </i>and<i> sorcellerie</i>) can face capital punishment, 
a prison sentence or fine. While the death penalty does not appear to have been used recently for 
this purpose, there were many reports of individuals being killed by private citizens or 
sometimes by the army after having been accused of witchcraft;<b>33</b>

<b>31
</b></p>
<p>  Ashforth has argued that, while witchcraft is not indicative of any single belief system, there 
may be a broadly applicable witchcraft paradigm. Adam Ashforth, &#8220;AIDS, Witchcraft and the 
Problem of Power in Post-Apartheid South Africa&#8221;, Institute for Advanced Study, paper No. 10,

<p>  See A/HRC/11/2/Add.3. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (b) In the context of the universal periodic review, issues have arisen about the fight 
against traditional practices such as sorcery and infanticide of the so-called &#8220;witch children&#8221; in 
Gabon,<b>34</b> and about the psychological trauma, physical harm, social exclusion and 
impoverishment suffered by alleged witches in Burkina Faso;<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p> (c) The Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
considered problems relating to the persecution of witches on a number of occasions. With 
regard to India, in 2007, the Committee noted its concern about the practice of witch-hunting, 
which it characterized as an extreme form of violence against women (CEDAW/C/IND/CO/3). It 
recommended that the State party adopt appropriate measures to eliminate the practice, to 
prosecute and punish those involved, and provide for rehabilitation of, and compensation to, 
victimized women. It also linked the issue to the struggle for control over land by recommending 
that the necessary measures be identified on the basis of an analysis of such causes. In 2002, the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, also drew attention 
to these problems in India, Nepal and South Africa;<b>36</b> 
</p>
<p> (d) In examining the report on Ghana, the Committee received information alleging that 
some 2,000 witches and their dependents were confined in five different camps.<b>37</b> A member of 
the State party delegation acknowledged the existence of the camps, but said that their character 
had changed over the years. She called for community sensitization, especially of the chiefs, 
before laws could be enacted and warned that the persecution of witches could [otherwise] turn 
into an underground practice.<b>38</b> The Committee subsequently expressed its concern about the 
persistence of the belief in witchcraft and the subjection of women in witch camps to violence. It 
called for the elimination of these practices through legislative action and education and 
awareness-raising campaigns.<b>39</b> After a visit to Ghana, the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women called upon the Government to demystify the beliefs around witchcraft and 
sorcery and criminalize acts of undue accusations of persons of causing harm through the use of 
supernatural powers;<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p> (e) The Committee has received estimates of up to 1,000 witches being killed annually 
in the United Republic of Tanzania;<b>41</b>

<p> (f) In 1998, the Committee recommended further research into the prevalence of witch 
burning in South Africa, and called for the prohibition and eradication of such practices.<b>42</b> The 
South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission granted amnesty to 33 individuals accused 
of killing alleged witches.<b>43</b> In relation to Mozambique, the Committee expressed concern about 
the situation of older women, who were subject to accusations of witchcraft, and urged the State 
party to challenge such traditional views;<b>44</b> 
</p>
<p> (g) With regard to Angola, in 2004, the Committee on the Rights of the Child called for 
immediate action to eliminate the mistreatment of children accused of witchcraft, including by 
prosecuting the perpetrators of this mistreatment and intensive education campaigns that involve 
local leaders.<b>45</b> The same issue was taken up in almost identical terms four years later by the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;<b>46</b> 
</p>
<p> (h) The role of witch doctors has also been raised. In Mali, the traditional practice of 
giving a girl in marriage to a witch doctor for religious reasons still persists;<b>47</b> in the 
United Republic of Tanzania, concern has been raised about the practice of hunting down and 
murdering albinos so that their body parts can be used by witch doctors;<b>48</b> 
</p>
<p> (i) In Papua New Guinea, provincial police commanders in two highlands provinces, 
Eastern Highlands and Chimbu, reportedly told journalists that there had been more than 
50 sorcery-related killings in their provinces in 2008. Other independent sources estimate that 
there have been up to 500 attacks against women accused of practising witchcraft that have 
resulted in torture and murder;<b>49</b> 
</p>
<p> (j) In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, civil society reports suggest that most of 
the 25,000 to 50,000 children living on the streets of Kinshasa are there because they have been 
accused of witchcraft and rejected by their families. In 2009, the Committee on the Rights of the

<p>Child expressed concern that a large number of children are labelled as witches and consequently 
suffer serious stigmatization. It observed that violence against children accused of witchcraft was 
increasing, and that children were being kept as prisoners in religious buildings where they were 
exposed to torture and ill-treatment or even killed under the pretext of exorcism. The Committee 
called for effective measures to prevent children from being accused of witchcraft, including 
through continuing and strengthening public awareness-raising activities, particularly directed at 
parents and religious leaders and by addressing the root causes, inter alia, poverty. It also 
recommended legislative and other measures to criminalize making accusations against children 
of witchcraft, efforts to prosecute those responsible for violence and ill-treatment against alleged 
child witches, and programmes to promote the recovery and reintegration of child victims;<b>50</b> 
</p>
<p> (k) In Nigeria, a civil society organization, the Child Rights and Rehabilitation Network, 
works primarily with what it claims to be a large and increasing number of children abandoned 
or persecuted on the grounds that they are witches or wizards. In the Kisii District of Kenya, 
police officers reported, in early 2008, the killing of eight women and three men aged between 
80 and 96, all of whom were accused of being witches. Reports noted that belief in witchcraft is 
widespread in the area, but local officials emphasized the need for people to avoid taking the law 
into their own hands; 
</p>
<p> (l) In Nepal, various groups have also reported the persistence of traditional beliefs 
about witchcraft that largely concern elderly women and widows in rural areas. Exorcism 
ceremonies involve the public beating and abuse of suspected witches by shamans or village 
elders. It has been reported that the existing law is inadequate to prevent these abuses and that no 
system is in place to provide compensation for those persecuted;<b>51</b> 
</p>
<p> (m) In Mexico, a case was reported in July 2008 in which the police had charged three

daughter who they believed were committing acts of witchcraft;

</p>
<p>51. The first is that the number of so-called witches killed or otherwise persecuted is high in 
the aggregate. Responses to witchcraft frequently involve serious and systematic forms of 
discrimination, especially on the grounds of gender, age and disability. In addition, the relatives 
of the witches are also often subjected to serious human rights violations. 
</p><p>52. In response, international human rights bodies have dealt only sporadically with the issue 
and have focused mainly on the need for consciousness-raising and education. For the most part, 
the response has been a very limited one and the complexity of the challenges has tended to be 
glossed over. 
</p>
<p>53. At the national level, legal approaches vary greatly. A significant number of States have 
legislation providing for the punishment of witchcraft. Few appear to make regular use of such 
laws routinely. In some States, such as the Central African Republic, witchcraft is a capital 
offence. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, a pending draft bill to amend the Islamic Penal Code 
of 1991 prescribes the death penalty for any Muslim who is involved with witchcraft and 
promotes it in the society as a profession or sect, but not for non-Muslims. Where the formal 
legal system is silent, traditional or customary law will often be used. Customary approaches 
vary from a heavy emphasis on mediation to severe and even deadly punishments.<b>53</b> 
</p>
<p>54. In 1998, in South Africa, a national conference on witchcraft violence called for the repeal 
of the Witchcraft Suppression Act of 1957, in part because it could in fact be fuelling witchcraft 
violence. It called for new legislation to adopt a pragmatic approach acknowledging the belief in 
witchcraft and the possibility that some forms are benign. It called for clear definitions of 
&#8220;witch&#8221;, &#8220;wizard&#8221; and &#8220;witchcraft&#8221;, and an emphasis on conciliation and mediation.<b>54</b> Other 
studies, however, have highlighted the inherent contradictions between a judicial approach that 
&#8220;objectifies <i>sorcellerie</i> as always evil and hence to be completely eradicated&#8221; and local discourse 
on witchcraft, which views it more positively &#8220;as a special force that can be used for various 
ends&#8221;.<b>55</b> 
</p>
<p>55. Commentators are sceptical of the value of judicial approaches in many settings: &#8220;Where 
cases of witchcraft have entered the formal judicial system in Africa, the results have generally 
not been salutary for the health of that system or the cause of justice.&#8221;<b>56</b> The available evidence 
from human rights sources also counsels against the criminalization of witchcraft. The first

<p>reason relates to the difficulty of defining with any accuracy the conduct being proscribed. The 
second is the difficulty of ensuring respect for other rights, including cultural rights and freedom 
of speech and religion in such contexts. In the vast majority of cases examined, the offence has 
been defined in a vague and open-ended manner, which lends itself almost unavoidably to abuse. 
The vaguely defined elements of the &#8220;crime&#8221; can easily operate to permit those with a personal 
grudge or enmity to accuse others of having practised witchcraft. A third reason is empirical 
evidence, which shows that, in most instances, the criminalization of witchcraft is interpreted as 
legitimizing the punishment of accused witches in vigilante-like fashion, with no regard for the 
specific details of the alleged conduct, no due process protections being accorded to the accused, 
and no evidentiary burdens being met. Instead, there is usually a flagrantly discriminatory 
approach that results in the singling out of those who are simply &#8220;different&#8221;, feared or disliked. 
The accused witches are then often killed by vigilantes or mobs. 
</p>
<p>56. Even in States that have detailed laws providing for the punishment of witches, the law 
does not always explicitly address penalties for the persecution or killing of witches. Where it 
does, it sometimes permits the defence to invoke witchcraft as an extenuating circumstance 
warranting a lesser sentence. Where Governments identify genuinely abusive practices on the 
part of those accused of witchcraft, the challenge is to identify which criminal laws have been 
violated by the conduct and not to use the nebulous, catch-all label of &#8220;witchcraft&#8221;. Similarly, 
those who live in fear of witches should be educated and sanctioned to act within the law and on 
the basis of a criminal code that respects human rights when taking measures against those 
whom they believe to be engaging in harmful acts. In such circumstances, it is wholly 
unacceptable to invoke a subjective and highly manipulable accusation of witchcraft as the basis 
for either arbitrary private acts of violence or for Government-sponsored or tolerated acts of 
violence. 
</p>
<p>57. For present purposes, the most important point is to ensure that all killings of alleged 
witches are treated as murder and investigated, prosecuted and punished accordingly. In most of 
the cited problem situations, the Governments concerned have not been accused of playing an 
active part in the persecution or killings of witches. There are, however, questions as to whether 
they have met their due diligence obligations to prevent such killings. These require 
Governments to take all available measures to prevent such crimes and prosecute and punish 
perpetrators, including private actors.<b>57</b> Indeed, there is an interesting historical parallel with 
anti-lynching statutes in the United States, which were proposed in response to the almost 
5,000 lynchings reported between 1882 and 1968. They were explicitly designed to go beyond 
the simple criminalization of the murder involved, and provided severe penalties for State or 
municipal officials who failed to take reasonable steps to prevent a lynching. In addition, any 
county in which a lynching occurred would have to compensate the victim&#8217;s family.<b>58</b>

</b>  This would include religious groups that designate children as witches, leading to 
</p>
<p>stigmatization and persecution.

51<i> Journal of Southern History</i>, 1985. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>58. It is also important for the problems surrounding the persecution and killing of witches to 
be reflected in the guidelines and operational programmes of development agencies working in 
countries in which there is a significant level of belief in witchcraft. In addition to providing 
education and practical programmes to address the situation, protection should be arranged for 
individuals accused of witchcraft and who are at risk of retribution or even death outside the 
framework of the law. 
</p>
<p>59. The relevant legal authorities in States should examine carefully, and with an open mind, 
claims by asylum-seekers and others to be actual or potential victims of witchcraft-related 
practices and of community responses thereto. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  The use of lethal force in the process of policing public assemblies 
</b></p>
<p>60. The use of lethal force by law-enforcement officials<b>59</b> is an issue that arises frequently in 
my communications with Governments.<b>60</b> While challenges arise in diverse contexts, the 
policing of assemblies seems to be especially problematic. A survey of the communications sent 
between 2005 and 2008 reveals the ubiquitous nature of this issue. These communications 
consistently raise certain underlying issues, including the lack or inadequacy of laws and 
regulations governing the use of force by police; general rules or training for law enforcement on 
the dispersal of assemblies; specific instructions and/or guidance given to law enforcement 
dispersing assemblies; non-lethal incapacitating weapons for law enforcement; investigations 
and judicial or other inquiries into allegations of misconduct; disciplinary actions or 
prosecutions; penal or administrative sanctions; reparations or compensation for victims or their 
families; and public accountability in terms of the publication of results of investigations. 
</p>
<p>61. To be sure, the challenges involved in policing assemblies are complex. Balancing the 
need to maintain order with the need to respect the right to life, freedom of expression and the 
right to assemble peacefully presents a unique set of difficulties for States. It is proposed that a 
detailed study be undertaken to identify the principal problems experienced in relation to 
policing assemblies in the past and to recommend best practices that might be taken into account 
by Governments in the future. These challenges deserve more sustained analysis than they have 
received to date within the international human rights regime. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  The international human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>62. Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that no one 
should be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. Article 3 of the Code of Conduct for Law

</p>
<p>Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials,<b>62</b> though not in and of themselves binding law, provide 
an authoritative and convincing interpretation of the limits the prohibition on arbitrary 
deprivation of life places on the conduct of law-enforcement forces. The Basic Principles also 
provide further and more specific guidance on the use of force in the context of policing 
assemblies.<b>63</b> These principles derive from the interaction between the right to peaceful assembly 
and the right to life. 
</p>
<p>63. The principles contained in the various international obligations should in turn be reflected 
in the policy and operational documents adopted at the national level. While States retain 
significant discretion in the specific approach they adopt, international human rights law points 
in the direction of a range of measures which should be adopted in this regard. They include: 
(a) the implementation of a legal framework designed to ensure both effective law enforcement 
and respect for human rights, including the right to peaceful assembly; (b) the provision of 
training for law-enforcement personnel focusing on both theory and practice; (c) operational 
policies and procedures to assist and guide law enforcement in controlling assemblies within the 
legal framework; and (d) disciplinary and other sanctions designed to promote compliance. The 
combination of measures ensuring the best possible balance will vary according to the structure 
of policing and other factors from one State to another. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  The need for a set of best practices 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Basic Principles provide an indispensable guide to the main issues that need to be 
addressed if a State is to respect and ensure the right of individuals not to be arbitrarily deprived 
of their lives.<b>64</b> The Basic Principles do not, however, provide the sort of operational guidance 
which would be of great assistance to police forces and Governments in designing and 
implementing their policies for dealing with such situations. In order to shed systematic light on 
these issues, I propose to survey existing practices for the policing of assemblies by 
law-enforcement officials, including consultation with relevant stakeholders, with a view to 
identifying a set of best practices that might provide assistance and guidance in relation to such 
activities. 
</p>
<p>65. Potential areas of study might include training of law-enforcement officials; planning for 
assemblies; the use of intelligence in policing assemblies; operational policies; intervention by 
law-enforcement, including use of force, dispersal, stop and search, detention and arrest; 
post-incident debriefing; the use of legal support; and liability and accountability. I plan to 
present the results of this research to the Council in the course of 2010.

<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Reprisals against persons cooperating with special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>Intimidation of, or retaliation against, those cooperating with special procedures 
mandate holders is a problem that threatens the very foundations of the Council&#8217;s work in 
protecting human rights. Urgent measures are needed to respond to any such reported 
incidents. The following steps should be taken: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Council should urge Governments, United Nations field presences and 
special procedures mandate holders to give particular attention to the protection of persons 
who have cooperated with a mandate holder; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Given the need to be able to respond promptly and meaningfully to any reports 
of serious or continuing harassment, the Council should define appropriate mechanisms to 
make representations to the Government concerned in a timely and effective manner and 
to monitor situations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Civil society organizations and States through their diplomatic missions should 
continue to enhance arrangements to provide financial and other assistance to individuals 
who are at risk, including, where necessary, providing assistance in relocation to a secure 
place; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Coordination Committee for Special Procedures should pursue this issue 
following an exchange of views among mandate holders at their annual meeting. 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Execution of juvenile offenders 
</b>67. <b>The prohibition on executing juvenile offenders is a clear and very important 
violation of international human rights standards. It is being openly and systematically 
flouted in one Member State, in violation of that State&#8217;s treaty obligations. In its 
resolution 10/2, the Council urged all States to ensure that the practice was eliminated 
and requested special procedures mandate holders to make specific recommendations in 
this regard, including proposals for advisory services and technical assistance measures. 
The President of the Council should designate a member of the Council Bureau to seek to 
visit the Islamic Republic of Iran to engage in consultations with all stakeholders with a 
view to identifying appropriate measures that can be taken to bring an immediate halt to 
the sentencing and execution of juvenile offenders. 
</b></p>
<p><b>C.  The killing of witches 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Council should acknowledge that it is entirely unacceptable for individuals 
accused of witchcraft to be killed, including through extrajudicial processes. It should call 
upon Governments to ensure that all such killings are treated as murder and investigated, 
prosecuted and punished accordingly.
