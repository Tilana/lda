Net loss of $105.9 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $107.7 million, or
$1.26 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2016 and a net loss of $157.1 million, or $1.89 per
diluted share, in the second quarter of 2015.
•
Adjusted net loss, a non-GAAP financial measure, of $1.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in
the second quarter of 2016, excluding certain non-cash items of $103.8 million resulting from a
full-cost ceiling impairment charge of $78.2 million, a non-cash loss on derivatives of $26.6
million and a net deferred gain on asset sales of $1.0 million.
•
Adjusted earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depletion, depreciation and
amortization and certain other items (“Adjusted EBITDA”), a non-GAAP financial measure, of
$39.0 million, an increase of 126% sequentially, as compared to $17.2 million in the first quarter
of 2016, and a decrease of 42% year-over-year, as compared to $66.7 million in the second
quarter of 2015.
•
Lease operating expenses (“LOE”) of $5.17 per BOE, a decrease of 28% sequentially, as
compared to $7.14 per BOE in the first quarter of 2016, and a decrease of 16% year-over-year,
as compared to $6.18 per BOE in the second quarter of 2015.
•
As previously disclosed in Matador’s July 18, 2016 Operational Update, well results, drilling
times and well costs continue to improve in both the Wolf and Rustler Breaks prospect areas.
Matador has either approached or achieved its year-end 2016 drilling time and well cost targets
by mid-year.
•

Management Comments
Joseph Wm. Foran, Matador’s Chairman and CEO, commented, “As evidenced by our second
quarter results, Matador’s ongoing efforts to drill ‘better wells for less money’ is continuing to pay
dividends, even in today’s challenging oil and natural gas price environment. As I said in our
latest annual report, in this environment, we must and will focus on those things we can control in
our operations, and we are confident our asset teams will continue to work together creatively to
meet this challenge and to add real value for our shareholders through execution and innovation,
as they have done in the past. Increases in production and reserves, improvements in well costs
and total unit costs and expected additions to our inventory of engineered drilling locations in the
Delaware Basin reflect these achievements.
“One of the goals we highlighted at our Analyst Day presentation in early February 2016 was
funding our ‘outspend’ in 2016, the same challenge we met successfully in 2015 with the $143
million sale of our cryogenic natural gas processing plant in Loving County, Texas and strategic
financings. Today, we have a number of options to close the remaining funding gap, ranging from
our undrawn line of credit to a sale of or joint venture with one of our midstream assets or a sale
of or joint venture with one or more of our non-core oil and natural gas assets. We are evaluating
and considering a number of interesting options. In doing so, we are determined to work
methodically and carefully to maximize the financial and operational value of our various assets
to our ongoing exploration and production needs.
“Finally, as we look ahead to the second half of 2016 and 2017, we are confident that, as they did
in this quarter, our people, properties and financial resources will continue to deliver the positive
results our shareholders expect and deserve.”
Second Quarter 2016 Operating and Financial Results
Production and Revenues
Average daily oil equivalent production increased 18% sequentially from 23,846 BOE per day
(48% oil) in the first quarter of 2016 to 28,022 BOE per day (48% oil) in the second quarter of
2016, and increased 5% year-over-year from 26,601 BOE per day (52% oil) in the second quarter
of 2015. Matador’s second quarter 2016 average daily oil equivalent production of 28,022 BOE
per day was the best quarterly result in the Company’s history.
Average daily oil production increased 18% sequentially from 11,473 barrels per day in the first
quarter of 2016 to 13,516 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2016, and decreased 2% year-
over-year from 13,847 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2015. Matador’s second quarter
2016 average daily oil production of 13,516 barrels per day was the second best quarterly result
in the Company’s history, exceeded only by the second quarter of 2015, a period during which
Matador decreased its drilling program from five operated rigs in the first quarter of 2015 to two
operated rigs in the second quarter of 2015.
Average daily natural gas production increased 17% sequentially from 74.2 million cubic feet per
day in the first quarter of 2016 to 87.0 million cubic feet per day in the second quarter of 2016,
and increased 14% year-over-year from 76.5 million cubic feet per day in the second quarter of
2015. Matador’s second quarter 2016 average daily natural gas production was the best
quarterly result in the Company’s history.
These second quarter increases in oil and natural gas production exceeded the Company’s
expectations and were primarily attributable to both the productivity of recent completions, as well
as the flush production resulting from a total of 19 gross (16.4 net) operated horizontal Wolfcamp
A and B wells placed on production in the Wolf and Rustler Breaks prospect areas during the
second quarter, including three new tests of the Blair shale (deepest tested bench of the
Wolfcamp B) that produced comparable volumes of oil to previous Wolfcamp B tests, but with
higher volumes of natural gas.

Oil and natural gas revenues increased 58% sequentially from $43.9 million in the first quarter of
2016 to $69.3 million in the second quarter of 2016, and decreased 21% year-over-year from
$87.8 million in the second quarter of 2015. Realized oil and natural gas prices increased from
$28.89 per barrel and $2.04 per thousand cubic feet in the first quarter of 2016 to $42.84 per
barrel and $2.10 per thousand cubic feet, respectively, in the second quarter of 2016, and
decreased from $54.37 per barrel and $2.78 per thousand cubic feet, respectively, in the second
quarter of 2015.
Total realized revenues, including realized hedging gains, increased 41% sequentially from
$51.0 million in the first quarter of 2016 to $71.8 million in the second quarter of 2016, and
decreased 29% year-over-year from $101.6 million in the second quarter of 2015. Realized
hedging gains, primarily from oil and natural gas hedges, were $2.5 million in the second quarter
of 2016, as compared to realized hedging gains of $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2016 and
$13.8 million in the second quarter of 2015.
Net Income (Loss) and Earnings (Loss) Per Share
For the second quarter of 2016, Matador reported a net loss of approximately $105.9 million, or
$1.15 per diluted common share on a GAAP basis, as compared to a net loss of approximately
$107.7 million, or $1.26 per diluted common share, in the first quarter of 2016, and as compared
to a net loss of $157.1 million, or $1.89 per diluted common share, in the second quarter of 2015.
Virtually all of the second quarter 2016 net loss (GAAP basis) was attributable to non-cash items,
and excluding those items from the net loss resulted in an adjusted net loss, a non-GAAP
financial measure, of approximately $1.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted common share.
Matador’s net loss (GAAP basis) for the second quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by (1) a
non-cash, unrealized loss on derivatives of $26.6 million and (2) a non-cash, full-cost ceiling
impairment of $78.2 million. Matador’s net loss for the second quarter of 2016 was favorably
impacted and mitigated by (1) improved oil and natural gas prices, as compared to the first
quarter of 2016, (2) a realized gain on derivatives of $2.5 million, (3) a non-cash gain on asset
sales of $1.0 million and (4) significant reductions in total unit operating expenses sequentially
and year-over-year.
For a reconciliation of adjusted net income (non-GAAP) and adjusted earnings (loss) per
common share (non-GAAP) to net income (loss)(GAAP) and earnings (loss) per common share
(GAAP), please see “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 126% sequentially from $17.2
million in the first quarter of 2016 to $39.0 million in the second quarter of 2016, and decreased
42% year-over-year from $66.7 million in the second quarter of 2015. The sequential increase in
Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in both oil and natural gas production
and realized oil and natural gas prices during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the first
quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to
the decline in oil and natural gas prices between the respective periods.
For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) to net
income (GAAP) and net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP), please see “Supplemental
Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
Operating Expenses
Production Taxes and Marketing
Production taxes and marketing expenses on a unit-of-production basis increased 14%
sequentially from $3.64 per BOE in the first quarter of 2016 to $4.14 per BOE in the second
quarter of 2016, and decreased 2% year-over-year from $4.24 per BOE in the second quarter of
2015. Production taxes and marketing expenses of $4.14 per BOE in the second quarter were
slightly below the Company’s projections of $4.25 per BOE for 2016.
4
Lease Operating Expenses (“LOE”)
Lease operating expenses on a unit-of-production basis decreased 28% sequentially from $7.14
per BOE in the first quarter of 2016 to $5.17 in the second quarter of 2016, and decreased 16%
year-over-year from $6.18 per BOE in the second quarter of 2015. LOE of $5.17 per BOE for the
second quarter of 2016 was below the low end of Matador’s 2016 LOE estimates that were
projected to decline from $6.50 to $5.50 per BOE throughout the course of the year and
represented a significant improvement in the Company’s LOE per unit-of-production over prior
periods.
This decrease in unit-of-production lease operating expenses was primarily attributable to
several key factors, including (1) decreased field supervisory costs as a number of third-party
contractors became full-time Matador employees during the second quarter, (2) decreased water
disposal costs attributable to Matador’s own salt water disposal facilities, as well as new water
disposal agreements negotiated with third parties, (3) decreased supervisory and chemical costs
associated with the Company’s Eagle Ford operations and (4) increased oil equivalent
production both sequentially and year-over-year.
Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”)
Depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses on a unit-of-production basis decreased 8%
sequentially from $13.33 per BOE in the first quarter of 2016 to $12.25 per BOE in the second
quarter of 2016, and decreased 43% year-over-year from $21.39 per BOE in the second quarter
of 2015. The decrease in DD&A expenses resulted both from the increases in Matador’s total
proved reserves between the respective periods, as well as the decreases in unamortized
property costs resulting from full-cost ceiling impairments in 2015 and 2016.
Full-cost ceiling impairment
Matador recorded a full-cost ceiling impairment of $78.2 million for the second quarter of 2016, as
reflected on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the
three months ended June 30, 2016.
Matador uses the full-cost method of accounting for its investments in oil and natural gas
properties. Due to the sharp decline in commodity prices since mid-year 2014, the unweighted
trailing 12-month arithmetic average oil and natural gas prices that exploration and production
companies are required to use in estimating total proved reserves and present value, discounted
at 10% (“PV-10”), have also declined significantly. At June 30, 2016, these average oil and
natural gas prices were $39.63 per barrel and $2.24 per MMBtu, respectively, as compared to
$42.77 per barrel and $2.40 per MMBtu, respectively, at March 31, 2016. This decline in the
trailing 12-month unweighted average commodity prices of $3.14 per barrel for oil and $0.16 per
MMBtu for natural gas continued to impact the overall discounted value of the Company’s proved
oil and natural gas reserves. Thus, although Matador’s proved oil and natural gas reserves grew
by 6% in the second quarter of 2016 (and have grown by 12% in the first six months of 2016), the
PV-10 of its proved reserves declined. As a result, the Company’s net capitalized costs
exceeded the full-cost ceiling by $78.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Matador anticipates additional full-cost ceiling impairments could be dictated in future periods
until the trailing 12-month unweighted average oil and natural gas prices used to estimate total
proved reserves and PV-10 are no longer declining.
General and administrative (“G&A”)
General and administrative expenses on a unit-of-production basis decreased 15% sequentially
from $6.07 per BOE in the first quarter of 2016 to $5.18 per BOE in the second quarter of 2016,
and decreased 3% year-over-year from $5.35 per BOE in the second quarter of 2015. General
and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2016 also included non-cash, stock
compensation expense of $1.30 per BOE, as compared to $1.03 per BOE in the first quarter of
2016 and $1.16 per BOE in the second quarter of 2015.

Our estimated proved reserves, Standardized Measure and PV-10 were determined using
index prices for oil and natural gas, without giving effect to derivative transactions, and were
held constant throughout the life of the properties. The unweighted arithmetic averages of the
first-day-of-the-month prices for the period from July 2015 through June 2016 were $39.63 per
Bbl for oil and $2.24 per MMBtu for natural gas, for the period from January 2015 through
December 2015 were $46.79 per Bbl for oil and $2.59 per MMBtu for natural gas and for the
period from July 2014 through June 2015 were $68.17 per Bbl for oil and $3.39 per MMBtu for
natural gas. These prices were adjusted by property for quality, energy content, regional price
differentials, transportation fees, marketing deductions and other factors affecting the price
received at the wellhead. We report our proved reserves in two streams, oil and natural gas,
and the economic value of the natural gas liquids associated with the natural gas is included
in the estimated wellhead natural gas price on those properties where the natural gas liquids
are extracted and sold.
(3)One thousand barrels of oil.
(4)One billion cubic feet of natural gas.
(5)
(6)
One thousand barrels of oil equivalent, estimated using a conversion ratio of one Bbl of oil per
six Mcf of natural gas.
PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of PV-10 (non-GAAP) to
Standardized Measure (GAAP), please see “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures”
below.
Matador’s estimated total proved oil and natural gas reserves were 95.5 million BOE at June 30,
2016, an all-time high, including 52.3 million barrels of oil and 258.7 billion cubic feet of natural
gas, with a Standardized Measure of $468.3 million (GAAP basis) and a PV-10, a non-GAAP
financial measure, of $473.2 million, an increase of 12% as compared to estimated total proved
oil and natural gas reserves of 85.1 million BOE at December 31, 2015, including 45.6 million
barrels of oil and 236.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas, with a Standardized Measure of $529.2
million and a PV-10 of $541.6 million.
Proved oil reserves increased 15% from 45.6 million barrels at December 31, 2015 to 52.3
million barrels at June 30, 2016, and increased 29% from 40.6 million barrels at June 30, 2015.
At June 30, 2016, approximately 55% of the Company’s total proved reserves were oil and 45%
were natural gas. By comparison, at June 30, 2015, approximately 47% of the Company’s total
proved reserves were oil and 53% were natural gas. Primarily as a result of the continued decline
in oil and natural gas prices used to estimate proved reserves at June 30, 2016, certain of
6
the Company’s proved undeveloped reserves were reclassified to contingent resources and are
no longer considered proved reserves under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) guidelines.
The reserves estimates in all periods presented were prepared by the Company’s internal
engineering staff and audited by an independent reservoir engineering firm, Netherland, Sewell
& Associates, Inc. These reserves estimates were prepared in accordance with the SEC’s rules
for oil and natural gas reserves reporting and do not include any unproved reserves classified as
probable or possible that might exist on Matador’s properties.
For a reconciliation of PV-10 (non-GAAP) to Standardized Measure (GAAP), please see
“Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
Operational Update
Matador provided a detailed summary of its second quarter 2016 operations and well results in a
separate release on July 18, 2016. Readers are referred to that release for additional information
on the Company’s second quarter operations and achievements, which can be found on
Matador’s website at www.matadorresources.com on the News page under the Investors tab.
Midstream Update
Matador’s midstream operations continue to grow and expand. As of July 2016, Matador’s
midstream operations included approximately 90 miles of high pressure steel pipeline, primarily
for oil and natural gas gathering in the Delaware Basin, but also in South Texas and Northwest
Louisiana, and 30 miles of poly pipe, primarily for water gathering in the Delaware Basin. The
Company also owns and operates a commercial salt water disposal facility in its Wolf prospect
area in Loving County, Texas, where it is disposing of approximately 45,000 barrels per day of
salt water for both Matador and third parties.
Matador is currently building a cryogenic natural gas processing plant and the associated natural
gas gathering system in the Rustler Breaks prospect area to support its ongoing and future
development efforts there. The Rustler Breaks processing plant is expected to have an inlet
capacity of approximately 60 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, and at August 3, 2016, the
installation of this plant is nearing completion. The construction of this processing plant continues
to proceed on time and on budget, and Matador expects the plant to become operational later in
August. The Company has also completed the installation and testing of the 12-inch natural gas
gathering line running throughout the length of its Rustler Breaks acreage position, and this
natural gas gathering line is now being used to gather much of Matador’s natural gas production
at Rustler Breaks.
Delaware Basin Acreage Update
At December 31, 2015, Matador held 157,100 gross (88,800 net) acres in the Permian Basin,
primarily in the Delaware Basin in Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico and Loving County,
Texas. Between January 1 and August 3, 2016, the Company added approximately 6,400 gross
(3,100 net) acres in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas, bringing Matador’s total Permian
Basin acreage position to 161,900 gross (91,100 net) acres, almost all of which is located in the

During the second quarter of 2016, Matador also acquired mineral ownership in approximately
7,900 gross (1,700 net) acres in its Rustler Breaks, Wolf and Ranger/Arrowhead prospect areas.
Approximately 50% of these minerals were being leased by Matador, 25% were leased to other
operators and 25% were unleased.
Capital Spending Update
Matador incurred total capital spending of approximately $198.0 million during the first six months
of 2016, in line with the $192.0 million in capital spending anticipated at mid-year.
At August 3, 2016, the Company had no outstanding borrowings and approximately $0.8 million
in outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility, and the borrowing base under its
revolving credit facility was $300 million. Matador has ample liquidity to continue its three-rig
drilling program in the Delaware Basin for the remainder of 2016 and 2017.
Hedging Positions
From time to time, Matador uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to
commodity price risk associated with oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and to protect
its cash flows and borrowing capacity.
At August 3, 2016, Matador had the following hedges in place, in the form of costless collars, for
the remainder of 2016.
•
Approximately 1.2 million barrels of oil at a weighted average floor price of $42 per barrel and a
weighted average ceiling price of $61 per barrel.
•
Approximately 6.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas at a weighted average floor price of $2.63 per
MMBtu and a weighted average ceiling price of $3.62 per MMBtu.
Matador estimates that it now has approximately 50% of its anticipated oil production and
approximately 55% of its anticipated natural gas production hedged for the remainder of 2016
based on the midpoint of its updated production guidance.
At August 3, 2016, Matador had the following hedges in place, in the form of costless collars, for
2017.
•
Approximately 1.6 million barrels of oil at a weighted average floor price of $39 per barrel and a
weighted average ceiling price of $48 per barrel.
•
Approximately 14.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas at a weighted average floor price of $2.38
per MMBtu and a weighted average ceiling price of $3.48 per MMBtu.

2016 Guidance Update
At August 3, 2016, Matador affirmed or increased certain elements of its 2016 guidance as
summarized in the highlights section at the beginning of this release.
At August 3, Matador provides the following update of its anticipated production profile for the
remainder of 2016.
•
Oil production is expected to increase by 6 to 7% in the third quarter and by approximately the
same amount again in the fourth quarter of 2016.
•
Natural gas production is expected to decline by about 8 to 9% in the third quarter and then by
another 4 to 5% in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of (1) declines in the flush production
from new wells completed in the Delaware Basin in the second quarter, (2) a shift in Matador’s
drilling program for the remainder of 2016, including moving one rig to its Ranger/Arrowhead
prospect area, where gas-oil ratios are much lower and (3) anticipated natural gas production
declines attributable to essentially no drilling activity in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville shale
plays during 2016.
•
Total oil equivalent production is expected to remain relatively flat to second quarter 2016
production volumes during the remaining two quarters of 2016, with oil production continuing to
grow and the oil volume mix increasing from approximately 48% by volume in the second
quarter to approximately 55% by volume in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increasing
percentage of oil production should continue to improve the Company’s operating margins
throughout the remainder of 2016.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDA
This press release includes the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted
EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and
external users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts,
investors, lenders and rating agencies. “GAAP” means Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles in the United States of America. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA helps it
evaluate its operating performance and compare its results of operations from period to period
without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. The Company defines Adjusted
EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depletion, depreciation and
amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations, property impairments, unrealized
derivative gains and losses, certain other non-cash items and non-cash stock-based
compensation expense, and net gain or loss on asset sales and inventory impairment. Adjusted
EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss) or net cash provided by operating activities as
determined by GAAP.
Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net
income (loss) or net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with
GAAP or as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance or liquidity. Certain items
excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components of understanding and assessing a
company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure. Adjusted
EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because all
companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. The following table
presents the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the
GAAP financial measures of net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities,
respectively, that are of a historical nature. Where references are pro forma, forward-looking,
preliminary or prospective in nature, and not based on historical fact, the table does not provide a
reconciliation. The Company could not provide such reconciliation without undue hardship
because the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA numbers included in this press release are
estimations, approximations and/or ranges. In addition, it would be difficult for the Company to
present a detailed reconciliation on account of many unknown variables for the reconciling items,
including future income taxes, full-cost ceiling impairments, unrealized gains or losses on
derivatives and gains or losses on asset sales and inventory impairments. For the same reasons,
we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could
be material to future results.

Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Share
This press release includes the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted net income (loss) and
adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted common share.  These non-GAAP items are measured as
net income (loss) attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders, adjusted for dollar
and per share impact of certain items, including unrealized gains or losses on derivatives, the
impact of full cost-ceiling impairment charges, if any, and nonrecurring transaction costs for
certain acquisitions along with the related tax effect for all periods.  This non-GAAP financial
information is provided as additional information for investors and is not in accordance with, or an
alternative to, GAAP financial measures.  Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may
be different than similar measures used by other companies.  The Company believes the
presentation of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted common
share provides useful information to investors, as it provides them an additional relevant
comparison of the Company’s performance across periods and to the performance of the
Company’s peers.  In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments for items
of income and expense that are often excluded by securities analysts and other users of the
Company’s financial statements in evaluating the Company’s performance. The table below
reconciles adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted common share to
their most directly comparable GAAP measure of net income (loss) attributable to Matador
Resources Company shareholders.

PV-10
PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the
most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of
income taxes on future net revenues. PV-10 is not an estimate of the fair market value of the
Company’s properties. Matador and others in the industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare
the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies and of the potential return on
investment related to the companies’ properties without regard to the specific tax characteristics
of such entities. PV-10 may be reconciled to the Standardized Measure of discounted future net
cash flows at such dates by reducing PV-10 by the discounted future income taxes associated
with such reserves.
