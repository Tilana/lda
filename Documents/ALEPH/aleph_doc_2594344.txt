FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
  
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part I, Item 2, contains “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 - that is,
statements related to future events. In this context, forward-looking statements may address our
expected future business and financial performance, and often contain words such as “expects”,
“anticipates”, “intends”, “plans”, “believes”, “will”, “should”, “could”, “would” or “may” and other
words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to
different degrees, uncertain. For Centrus Energy Corp., particular risks and uncertainties that
could cause our actual future results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-
looking statements include, risks and uncertainties related to the adoption of fresh start
accounting; risks related to our significant long-term liabilities, including material unfunded
defined benefit pension plan obligations and postretirement health and life benefit obligations;
risks relating to our outstanding 8.0% paid-in-kind (“PIK”) toggle notes (the “PIK Toggle Notes”)
maturing in September 2019, including the potential termination of the guarantee by United
States Enrichment Corporation (“Enrichment Corp.”) of the PIK Toggle Notes; risks related to the
limited trading markets in our securities; risks related to our ability to maintain the listing of our
common stock on the NYSE MKT LLC; the continued impact of the March 2011 earthquake and
tsunami in Japan on the nuclear industry and on our business, results of operations and
prospects; the impact and potential extended duration of the current supply/demand imbalance in
the market for low-enriched uranium (“LEU”); uncertainty regarding our ability to commercially
deploy competitive enrichment technology; our dependence on others for deliveries of LEU
including deliveries from Russia under a commercial supply agreement (the “Russian Supply
Agreement”) with the Russian government entity Joint Stock Company “TENEX”; risks related to
our ability to sell the LEU we procure pursuant to our purchase obligations under our supply
agreements including the Russian Supply Agreement; risks related to trade barriers and contract
terms that limit our ability to deliver LEU to customers; risks related to actions that may be taken
by the U.S. government, the
2
Russian government or other governments that could affect our ability or the ability of our sources
of supply to perform under contract obligations, including the imposition of sanctions, restrictions
or other requirements; risks relating to our sales order book, including uncertainty concerning
customer actions under current contracts and in future contracting due to market conditions and
lack of current production capability; risks associated with our reliance on third-party suppliers to
provide essential services to us; pricing trends and demand in the uranium and enrichment
markets and their impact on our profitability; movement and timing of customer orders; the impact
of government regulation including by the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission; the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies (including
lawsuits and government investigations or audits); risks and uncertainties regarding funding for
the American Centrifuge project and our ability to enter into an extension of the new agreement
with UT-Battelle, LLC, the management and operating contractor for Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, for continued research, development and demonstration of the American Centrifuge
technology; the competitive environment for our products and services; the potential for further
demobilization or termination of the American Centrifuge project; risks related to the current
demobilization of the portions of the American Centrifuge project including risks that the schedule
could be delayed and costs could be higher than expected; changes in the nuclear energy
industry; the impact of financial market conditions on our business, liquidity, prospects, pension
assets and insurance facilities; revenue and operating results can fluctuate significantly from
quarter to quarter, and in some cases, year to year; and other risks and uncertainties discussed in
this and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report
and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that attempt to advise
interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business. We do not undertake to
update our forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the
date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q except as required by law.

CENTRUS ENERGY CORP.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Centrus Energy Corp. (“Centrus”
or the “Company”), which include the accounts of the Company, its principal subsidiary United
States Enrichment Corporation (“Enrichment Corp.”) and its other subsidiaries, as of and for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, have been prepared pursuant to the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management,
necessary for a fair statement of the financial results for the interim period. Certain information
and notes normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) have been omitted pursuant to
such rules and regulations. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Certain
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes and Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
New Accounting Standards
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued comprehensive
guidance for revenue recognition and has since issued further implementation guidance. The
core principle of the standard is that revenue should be recognized when an entity transfers
promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity
expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The standard will supersede current
guidance in effect and may require the use of more judgment and estimates, including estimating
the amount of variable revenue to recognize over each identified performance obligation. The
standard requires additional disclosures to describe the nature, amount and timing of revenue
and cash flows arising from contracts. The standard will become effective for Centrus beginning
with the first quarter of 2018 and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting
period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. Early adoption
as of the first quarter of 2017 is permitted. Centrus expects to adopt the guidance in the first
quarter of 2018 and is evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to assess an entity’s ability to
continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosures in certain circumstances. The
standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early
adoption is permitted. The implementation of the standard is not expected to have a material
impact on Centrus’ consolidated financial statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The
standard requires the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a reduction in
the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of a deferred charge asset. Centrus
adopted the standard with retrospective application beginning with the first quarter of 2016. The
reclassification of debt issuance costs did not have a material impact on Centrus’ consolidated
financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use
asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
The standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and
requires expanded disclosures of lease arrangements. Centrus is evaluating the impact of
adopting this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
9
In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance for stock compensation that simplifies several aspects
of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash
flows. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. Centrus is evaluating the impact of adopting this
new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
2. SPECIAL CHARGES
The cessation of enrichment at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (the “Paducah GDP”) and
evolving business needs have resulted in workforce reductions since July 2013. In the six
months ended June 30, 2015, special charges included related termination benefits of $3.8
million, less $0.3 million for employee severance paid by the Company and invoiced to the U.S.
Department of Energy (“DOE”) for its share of employee severance pursuant to the USEC
Privatization Act.
In September 2015, Centrus completed a successful three-year demonstration of American
Centrifuge technology at its facility in Piketon, Ohio. The demonstration effort was primarily
funded by the U.S. government. As a result of reduced program funding, Centrus incurred a
special charge of $8.7 million in the third quarter of 2015 for estimated employee termination
benefits, consisting primarily of payments under its pre-existing severance plan. An additional
$0.1 million special charge was incurred in the second quarter of 2016 as an adjustment to
accrued severance benefits for current salary levels. Centrus expects to make payments for these
workforce reductions through 2017.
In the second quarter of 2016, the Company commenced a project to align its corporate structure
to the scale of its ongoing business operations and to update related information technology. The
company incurred advisory costs related to the reengineering project of $0.5 million in the three
months ended June 30, 2016.

3. CONTRACT SERVICES AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY COSTS
The contract services segment includes Revenue and Cost of Sales for American Centrifuge
work Centrus performs as a contractor to UT-Battelle, LLC (“UT-Battelle”), the operator of Oak
Ridge National Laboratory (“ORNL”). The Company’s current contract signed in March 2016 with
UT-Battelle provides for continued development work at the Company’s facilities in Oak Ridge,
Tennessee, through September 30, 2016. The contract is a firm, fixed-price contract that provides
for payments for monthly reports of approximately $2.7 million per month, down from
approximately $6.9 million per month received during government fiscal year 2015 which ended
September 30, 2015.
Although the Company’s prior contract with UT-Battelle expired September 30, 2015, Centrus
continued to perform work at the expected reduced scope as the parties worked toward a
successor agreement. The current contract signed in March 2016 provided for payment for
reports related to work performed since October 1, 2015. Revenue in the six months ended June
30, 2016, includes $8.1 million for March reports on work performed in the three months ended
December 31, 2015, and $16.2 million for reports on work performed in the six months ended
June 30, 2016. Expenses for contract work performed in the six months ended June 30, 2016, are
included in Cost of Sales. Expenses for work performed in the three months ended December 31,
2015, before there was a contract were included in Advanced Technology Costs in 2015.
American Centrifuge expenses that are outside of the Company’s contracts with UT-Battelle,
including demobilization and maintenance costs, are included in Advanced Technology Costs. In
addition to severance costs (see Note 2 - Special Charges) and demobilization costs, Centrus
has begun to incur expenditures in the second quarter of 2016 associated with the
decontamination and decommissioning (“D&D”) of the Piketon facility in accordance with the
requirements of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) and DOE (see Note 12 -
Commitments and Contingencies).
4.  RECEIVABLES

Certain overdue receivables from DOE are included in other long-term assets based on the
extended timeframe expected to resolve claims for payment. Unpaid invoices to DOE totaled
approximately $78 million as of June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, related to filed claims.

Due to the lack of a resolution with DOE and uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of
future collections, the long-term receivable for accounting purposes is $23.0 million as of June
30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, including updated submissions for final indirect rates and
incurred costs, as well as invoices for interest.
Centrus has unapplied payments from DOE that may be used, at DOE’s direction, (a) to pay for
future services provided by the Company or (b) to reduce outstanding receivables balances due
from DOE. The balance of unapplied payments of $19.3 million as of June 30, 2016, and $19.4
million as of December 31, 2015, is included in other long-term liabilities pending resolution of
the long-term receivables from DOE described above.

5. INVENTORIES
Centrus holds uranium at licensed locations in the form of natural uranium and as the uranium
component of low enriched uranium (“LEU”). Centrus also holds separative work units (“SWU”)
as the SWU component of LEU at licensed locations (e.g., fabricators) to meet book transfer
requests by customers. Fabricators process LEU into fuel for use in nuclear reactors.

Inventories owed to customers and suppliers, included in current liabilities, consist primarily of
SWU and uranium inventories owed to fabricators.
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Valuation adjustments of $0.7
million were charged to cost of sales in the six months ended June 30, 2016, including $0.2
million in the second quarter, for the Company’s uranium inventory to reflect declines in uranium
market price indicators.
Uranium Provided by Customers and Suppliers
Centrus held uranium with estimated values of approximately $242 million as of June 30, 2016,
and $437 million as of December 31, 2015, to which title was held by customers and suppliers
and for which no assets or liabilities were recorded on the balance sheet. The reduction reflects a
28% decline in quantities and a 23% decline in uranium spot price indicators. While in some
cases Centrus sells both the SWU and uranium components of LEU to customers, utility
customers typically provide uranium to Centrus as part of their enrichment contracts. Title to
uranium provided by customers generally remains with the customer until delivery of LEU at
which time title to LEU is transferred to the customer, and title to uranium is transferred to
Centrus.

7. INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets originated from the Company’s reorganization and application of fresh start
accounting as of September 30, 2014. The intangible asset related to the sales order book is
amortized as the order book valued at emergence is reduced, principally as a result of deliveries
to customers. The intangible asset related to customer relationships is amortized using the
straight-line method over the estimated average useful life of 15 years. Amortization expense is
presented below gross profit on the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

In June 2016, Centrus repurchased some of the Company’s 8.0% paid-in-kind (“PIK”) toggle
notes (the “PIK Toggle Notes”) pursuant to a pre-arranged trading plan. The PIK Toggle Notes
repurchased had an aggregate principal balance of $26.1 million and accrued interest payable
balance of $0.5 million. The Company paid $9.8 million in cash, of which $1.8 million is included
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of June 30, 2016, and was paid in July 2016. The
gain on the early extinguishment of the PIK Toggle Notes was $16.7 million, net of commissions
and unamortized deferred financing costs totaling $0.1 million.
The pre-arranged trading plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule
10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “10b5-1 Plan”). The 10b5-1 Plan provided
that an independent broker selected by the Company repurchase PIK Toggle Notes on the open
market within specified guidelines on the Company’s behalf. All repurchases were subject to
SEC regulations as well as such other terms and conditions as specified in the 10b5-1 Plan. On
July 11, 2016, the Company terminated the 10b5-1 Plan and subsequently cancelled the PIK
Toggle Notes that were repurchased.
The PIK Toggle Notes pay interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum. Interest is payable semi-annually
in arrears based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The principal amount is
increased by any payment of interest in the form of PIK payments. The Company has the option
to pay up to 5.5% per annum of interest due on the PIK Toggle Notes in the form of PIK
payments. For the semi-annual interest periods ended March 31, 2016, and ending September
30, 2016, the Company has elected to pay interest in the form of PIK payments at 5.5% per
annum. As such, interest for the semi-annual period ended March 31, 2016, was paid as $3.1
million in cash and $6.8 million in PIK payments. Total interest payable at June 30, 2016, is $4.5
million, of which the expected cash portion of $1.4 million is included in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities and the expected PIK portion of $3.1 million is included in other long-term
liabilities.
Financing costs for the issuance of the PIK Toggle Notes were deferred and are being amortized
on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the life of the PIK
Toggle Notes.
13
The PIK Toggle Notes will mature on September 30, 2019. However, the maturity date can be
extended to September 30, 2024 upon the satisfaction of certain funding conditions described in
the Indenture relating to the funding, under binding agreements, of (i) the American Centrifuge
project or (ii) the implementation and deployment of a National Security Train Program utilizing
American Centrifuge technology.
The PIK Toggle Notes rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future
unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company (other than the Issuer Senior Debt as defined
below) and are senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of
the Company. The PIK Toggle Notes are subordinated in right of payment to certain
indebtedness and obligations of the Company described in the Indenture (the “Issuer Senior
Debt”), including (i) any indebtedness of the Company under a future credit facility, (ii) obligations
of, and claims against, the Company under any equity investment (or any commitment to make
an equity investment) with respect to the financing of the American Centrifuge project, (iii)
obligations of, and claims against, the Company under any arrangement with DOE, export credit
agencies or any other lenders or insurers with respect to the financing or government support of
the American Centrifuge project and (iv) indebtedness of the Company to Enrichment Corp.
under the Centrus Intercompany Note.
The PIK Toggle Notes are guaranteed and secured on a subordinated, conditional, and limited
basis by Enrichment Corp. Enrichment Corp will be released from its guarantee without the
consent of the holders of the PIK Toggle Notes upon the occurrence of certain termination events
(other than with respect to an unconditional interest claim). The Enrichment Corp. guarantee
ranks equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of
Enrichment Corp. (other than the Designated Senior Claims as defined below) and is senior in
right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of Enrichment Corp. The
Enrichment Corp. guarantee is subordinated in right of payment to certain obligations of, and
claims against, Enrichment Corp. described in the Indenture (collectively, the “Designated Senior
Claims”), including obligations and claims:
•under a future credit facility;
held by or for the benefit of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) pursuant to any
settlement of any actual or alleged Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) Section
4062(e) event;
held by any party with respect to any equity investment (or any commitment to make an equity
investment) with respect to the financing of the American Centrifuge project;
held by DOE, export credit agencies or any other lenders or insurers with respect to the
financing or government support of the American Centrifuge project; and
•held by the U.S. government.

9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurements, fair value is defined as the
price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair
value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value,
consideration is given to the principal or most advantageous market and assumptions that market
participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The accounting guidance establishes a
fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs
used to measure fair value:
 
•Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as
quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or
similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or model-derived valuations in which
significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by,
observable market data.
•Level 3 – unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists.

(a)
The deferred compensation obligation represents the balance of deferred compensation plus
net investment earnings. The deferred compensation plan is informally funded through a rabbi
trust using variable universal life insurance. The cash surrender value of the life insurance
policies is designed to track the deemed investments of the plan participants. Investment
crediting options consist of institutional and retail investment funds. The deemed investments
are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy because (i) of the indirect method of
investing and (ii) unit prices of institutional funds are not quoted in active markets.
There have been no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the periods presented.
Other Financial Instruments
As of June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the balance sheet carrying amounts for accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities (excluding the deferred compensation
obligation described above), and payables under SWU purchase agreements approximate fair
value because of the short-term nature of the instruments.

In the second quarter of 2016, the level of lump-sum payments under the Company’s non-
qualified defined benefit pension plans resulted in the remeasurement of pension obligations
under settlement accounting rules. The remeasurement resulted in a loss of $0.8 million included
in selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2016. The loss includes
the effect of a decrease in the discount rate used in the measurement of pension obligations from
approximately 4.5% as of December 31, 2015, to approximately 3.7% as of June 30, 2016.
In the second quarter of 2015, the level of lump-sum payments under the Company’s non-
qualified defined benefit pension plans and the Employees’ Retirement Plan of Centrus Energy
Corp. resulted in a remeasurement gain of $3.9 million included in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2015. The gain included the effect of an
increase in the discount rate from approximately 4.1% as of December 31, 2014, to
approximately 4.5% as of June 30, 2015.

11. NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, excluding any
unvested restricted stock. In calculating diluted net income per share, the numerator is increased
by interest and dividends on potentially dilutive securities, net of tax, and the denominator is
increased by the weighted average number of shares resulting from potentially dilutive securities,
assuming full conversion. No dilutive effect is recognized in a period in which a net loss has
occurred.

12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Potential ERISA Section 4062(e) Liability
The Company had been engaged in discussions with the PBGC regarding the status of the
qualified pension plans, including potential liability under ERISA Section 4062(e) related to
employee reductions resulting from ceasing enrichment operations at the Portsmouth and
Paducah GDP facilities. In the event the PBGC were to determine there are funding obligations
under section 4062(e), the Company believes that any such liability would be fully satisfied under
the provisions of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (the
“CFCAA”), which made major changes to ERISA section 4062(e). The CFCAA changes the
criteria for triggering liability under section 4062(e); provides certain exemptions from the
applicability of section 4062(e) to certain events; permits companies to satisfy the liability by
making payments into the pension over seven years, but ends those pension obligations once
the pension reaches a 90% funding level as calculated under the method provided in the
CFCAA; subject to an exception not applicable here, prohibits the PBGC from taking any
enforcement, administrative or other action under section 4062(e) that is inconsistent with the
amendments made by the CFCAA based on events that occurred before the date of enactment
(December 16, 2014); and permits companies to elect to satisfy any liability under section
4062(e) as provided in the CFCAA for an event that had occurred prior to date of enactment as if
such cessation had occurred on such date of enactment.
The PBGC, however, has other authorities under ERISA that it may otherwise consider in
connection with the Company’s qualified defined benefit pension plans. These authorities
include, but are not limited to, initiating involuntary termination of underfunded plans and seeking
liens or additional funding. The Company would seek to defend against the assertion by the
PBGC of any such authorities based on the facts and circumstances at the time. The involuntary
termination by the PBGC of any of the qualified pension plans of Centrus or Enrichment Corp.
would result in the termination of the limited, conditional guaranty by Enrichment Corp. of the PIK
Toggle Notes (other than with respect to certain interest obligations).
The PBGC has indicated it would like the Company to make contributions to the pension in
advance of statutory funding requirements as amended by the Highway and Transportation
Funding Act of 2014. The Company believes it is in the best interest of all stakeholders, including
the PBGC, the covered plan participants and the Company, to continue funding the qualified
pension plans in the ordinary course and expects to do so. There is no assurance that the
Company and the PBGC will reach agreement or that the PBGC will agree with the Company’s
approach.
 
NYSE MKT Listing Standards Notice
On November 17, 2015, Centrus Energy Corp. received notice from the NYSE MKT LLC (the
“NYSE MKT”) indicating that the Company is not in compliance with Sections 1003(a)(i) and (ii)
of the NYSE MKT's Company Guide since the Company reported a stockholders’ deficit as of
September 30, 2015, and net losses in its fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and
2013. The Company submitted a plan to regain compliance with the NYSE MKT’s continued
listing standards and the NYSE MKT notified the Company in January 2016 that it accepted the
plan. With the NYSE MKT’s acceptance of the plan, the Company has until May 17, 2017, to
regain compliance. If the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards by
May 17, 2017, or if the Company does not make progress consistent with the plan, the NYSE
MKT may initiate delisting procedures as appropriate. In the meantime, the Company’s common
stock will continue to be traded on the NYSE MKT, subject to ongoing monitoring by the NYSE
MKT and the Company’s compliance with all other applicable NYSE MKT requirements.

American Centrifuge
Milestones under the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement
USEC and DOE signed an agreement dated June 17, 2002, as amended (the “2002 DOE-USEC
Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties made long-term commitments directed at resolving
issues related to the stability and security of the domestic uranium enrichment industry. DOE
consented to the assumption by Centrus of the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement and other
agreements between the Company and DOE subject to an express reservation of all rights,
remedies and defenses by DOE and Centrus under those agreements as part of Centrus'
Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. The 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement requires Centrus to develop,
demonstrate and deploy advanced enrichment technology in accordance with milestones and
provides for remedies in the event of a failure to meet a milestone under certain circumstances.
DOE has specific remedies under the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement if Centrus fails to meet a
milestone that would adversely impact its ability to begin commercial operations of the American
Centrifuge Plant on schedule, and such delay was within Centrus’ control or was due to its fault
or negligence or if Centrus abandons or constructively abandons the commercial deployment of
an advanced enrichment technology. These remedies include terminating the 2002 DOE-USEC
Agreement, revoking Centrus’ access to DOE’s centrifuge technology that is required for the
success of the American Centrifuge project, requiring Centrus to transfer certain rights in the
American Centrifuge technology and facilities to DOE, and requiring Centrus to reimburse DOE
for certain costs associated with the American Centrifuge project.
The 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement provides that if a delaying event beyond the control and
without the fault or negligence of Centrus occurs that could affect Centrus’ ability to meet an
American Centrifuge Plant milestone, DOE and Centrus will jointly meet to discuss in good faith
possible adjustments to the milestones as appropriate to accommodate the delaying event. The
Company notified DOE that it had not met the June 2014 milestone within the time period
currently provided due to events beyond its control and without the fault or negligence of the
Company. The assumption of the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement provided for under the Plan of
Reorganization did not affect the ability of either party to assert all rights, remedies and defenses
under the agreement and all such rights, remedies and defenses are specifically preserved and
all time limits tolled expressly including all rights, remedies and defenses and time limits relating
to any missed milestones. DOE and Centrus have agreed that all rights, remedies and defenses
of the parties with respect to any missed milestones since March 5, 2014, including the June
2014 and November 2014 milestones, and all other matters under the 2002 DOE-USEC
Agreement continued to be preserved, and that the time limits for each party to respond to any
missed milestones continue to be tolled.
Decontamination and Decommissioning
Centrus leases facilities in Piketon, Ohio, from DOE for the American Centrifuge project. Centrus
has obligations associated with the D&D of the Piketon facility in accordance with the
requirements of the NRC and DOE. At the conclusion of the lease, Centrus is obligated to return
these leased facilities to DOE in a condition that meets NRC requirements and in the same
condition as the facilities were in when they were leased to Centrus (other than due to normal
wear and tear). Centrus must remove all Company-owned capital improvements at the Piketon
facility, unless otherwise consented to by DOE, by the conclusion of the lease term.
Effective October 1, 2015, the U.S. government discontinued funding of the American Centrifuge
demonstration cascade at Piketon. Centrus began voluntary reductions in force in 2015 and
began the D&D process for the Piketon facility in 2016. Costs related to this process totaled $3.7
million in the second quarter of 2016, which were charged to the accrued liability
Decontamination and Decommissioning Obligations. The accrued liability balance is $25.7
million as of June 30, 2016. The Company is experiencing delays in implementing the D&D
process and is working to finalize contractual and regulatory arrangements for the disposition of
materials. The charge to advanced technology costs of $4.7 million in the second quarter of 2016
reflects delays as the Company continues to incur costs as the facility caretaker. The D&D work
is now expected to extend through 2017 and additional costs
19
associated with delays in fully implementing the D&D process may be incurred. The Company is
evaluating the impact the delays will have on future costs.
Centrus is required to provide financial assurance to the NRC and DOE for D&D costs under a
regulatorily-prescribed methodology that includes potential contingent costs and reserves. As of
June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, Centrus has provided financial assurance to the NRC
and DOE in the form of surety bonds totaling $29.4 million, which are fully cash collateralized by
Centrus. Centrus expects to receive cash when surety bonds are reduced and/or cancelled as
the Company fulfills its D&D and lease obligations. The Company has not made a decision on
lease turnover and is continuing to evaluate future uses for the site.
13.  STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY
Rights Agreement
On April 6, 2016 (the “Effective Date”), the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) adopted a
Section 382 Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”). The Board adopted the Rights
Agreement in an effort to protect shareholder value by, among other things, attempting to protect
against a possible limitation on the Company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards
and other tax benefits, which may be used to reduce potential future income tax obligations. As
reported on the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015,
as of December 31, 2015, the Company had federal net operating losses of $324.7 million that
currently expire through 2035.
In connection with the adoption of the Rights Agreement, the Board declared a dividend of one
preferred-share-purchase-right for each share of the Company’s Class A common stock and
Class B common stock outstanding as of the Effective Date. The rights initially trade together with
the common stock and are not exercisable. In the absence of further action by the Board, the
rights would generally become exercisable and allow a holder to acquire shares of a new series
of the Company’s preferred stock if any person or group acquires 4.99% or more of the
outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, or if a person or group that already owns
4.99% or more of the Company’s Class A common stock acquires additional shares representing
0.5% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. The rights
beneficially owned by the acquirer would become null and void, resulting in significant dilution in
the ownership interest of such acquirer.
The Board may exempt any acquisition of the Company’s common stock from the provisions of
the Rights Agreement if it determines that doing so would not jeopardize or endanger the
Company's use of its tax assets or is otherwise in the best interests of the Company. The Board
also has the ability to amend or terminate the Rights Agreement prior to a triggering event.
The Company expects to seek stockholder approval of the Rights Agreement at the 2017 annual
meeting of stockholders. The rights issued under the Rights Agreement will expire if, among
other things, the Rights Agreement is not approved by the Company's stockholders or on April 6,
2019, if the Rights Agreement is so approved.

As of June 30, 2016, there was $0.9 million of unrecognized compensation cost, adjusted for
estimated forfeitures, of which $0.8 million relates to stock options and less than $0.1 million
relates to unvested restricted stock units. Unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the
award using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and is recognized over the vesting period.
Stock options vest and become exercisable in equal annual installments over a three- or four-
year period and expire 10 years from the date of grant.
Assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value option grants follow.

14. SEGMENT INFORMATION
Centrus has two reportable segments: the LEU segment with two components, SWU and
uranium, and the contract services segment. The LEU segment includes sales of the SWU
component of LEU, sales of both the SWU and uranium components of LEU, and sales of
uranium. The contract services segment includes revenue and cost of sales for work that Centrus
performs under a fixed-price agreement as a contractor to UT-Battelle. The contract services
segment also includes limited services provided by Centrus to DOE and its contractors at the
Piketon facility. Gross profit is Centrus’ measure for segment reporting. There were no
intersegment sales in the periods presented. For additional details on each segment, refer to Item
2, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to, the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing
elsewhere in this report.
Overview
Centrus Energy Corp. (“Centrus” or the “Company”) is a trusted supplier of low-enriched uranium
(“LEU”) for commercial nuclear power plants. References to “Centrus”, the “Company”, or “we”
include Centrus Energy Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries as well as the predecessor to
Centrus, unless the context otherwise indicates. LEU is a critical component in the production of
nuclear fuel for reactors that produce electricity. We supply LEU to both domestic and
international utilities for use in nuclear reactors worldwide. Centrus is a leader in the
development of advanced uranium enrichment technology and is performing research and
demonstration work to support U.S. energy and national security.
As a long-term supplier of LEU to our customers, our goal is to provide value through the
reliability and diversity of our supply sources. We provide LEU from multiple sources including
our inventory, long- and mid-term supply contracts and spot purchases. Our long-term objective is
to resume commercial enrichment production and we are exploring alternative approaches to that
end.
We have a contract with UT-Battelle, LLC (“UT-Battelle”), the operator of Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (“ORNL”), to conduct research, development and demonstration of our advanced
centrifuge technology for the U.S. government. We believe that this technology could play a
critical role in meeting our national and energy security needs and achieving our nation’s non-
proliferation objectives.
Business Segments
Centrus has two reportable segments: the LEU segment with two components, separative work
units (“SWU”) and uranium, and the contract services segment.
LEU Segment
Revenue from Sales of SWU and Uranium
The LEU segment is our primary business focus. Revenue from our LEU segment is derived
primarily from:
 
•sales of the SWU component of LEU,
•sales of both the SWU and uranium components of LEU, and
•sales of natural uranium.
The majority of our customers are domestic and international utilities that operate nuclear power
plants, with international sales constituting 41% of revenue from our LEU segment in 2015. Our
agreements with electric utilities are primarily long-term, fixed-commitment contracts under which
our customers are obligated to purchase a specified quantity of the SWU component of LEU (or
the SWU and uranium components of LEU) from us. Our agreements for natural uranium sales
are generally shorter-term, fixed-commitment contracts.
Our revenues, operating results and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter
and year to year. Revenue is recognized at the time LEU or uranium is delivered under the terms
of our contracts. Customer demand is affected by, among other things, electricity markets, reactor
operations, maintenance and the timing of refueling outages. Utilities typically schedule the
shutdown of their reactors for refueling to coincide with the low electricity demand periods of
spring and fall. Thus, some reactors are scheduled for annual or two-year refuelings in the spring
or fall, or for 18-month cycles alternating between both seasons. Customer payments for the
SWU component of LEU historically average approximately $15 million to $20 million per order.
As a result, a relatively
23
small change in the timing of customer orders for LEU due to a change in a customer’s refueling
schedule may cause operating results to be substantially above or below expectations.
Our financial performance over time can be significantly affected by changes in prices for SWU
and uranium. Since 2011, the prices for SWU and uranium have significantly declined. Since our
sales order book includes contracts awarded to us in previous years, the average SWU price
billed to customers typically lags behind published price indicators by several years, which
means that average prices under contract today exceed current market prices.
The long-term SWU price indicator, as published by TradeTech, LLC in Nuclear Market Review,
is an indication of base-year prices under new long-term enrichment contracts in our primary
markets. Following are TradeTech’s long-term and spot SWU price indicators, the long-term
price for uranium hexafluoride (“UF6”), as calculated by Centrus using indicators published in
Nuclear Market Review, and TradeTech’s spot price indicator for UF6:

Our contracts with customers and suppliers are denominated in U.S. dollars, and although
revenue has not been directly affected by changes in the foreign exchange rate of the U.S. dollar,
we may have a competitive price advantage or disadvantage obtaining new contracts in a
competitive bidding process depending upon the weakness or strength of the U.S. dollar. Costs
of our primary competitors are denominated in other currencies.
Cost of Sales for SWU and Uranium
Cost of sales for SWU and uranium is based on the amount of SWU and uranium sold and
delivered during the period and unit inventory costs. Unit inventory costs are determined using
the monthly moving average cost method. Changes in purchase costs have an effect on
inventory costs and cost of sales over current and future periods.
Contract Services Segment
The contract services segment includes revenue and cost of sales for American Centrifuge work
we perform as a contractor to UT-Battelle. The contract services segment also includes limited
services provided by Centrus to DOE and its contractors at the Piketon facility.
American Centrifuge
The Company has a long record as a global leader in advanced technology, manufacturing and
engineering. Our manufacturing, engineering, testing and demonstration facilities and our highly-
trained workforce are deeply engaged in advancing the next generation of uranium enrichment
technology. We are exploring a number of options for returning to domestic production in the
future.
In September 2015, Centrus completed a successful three-year demonstration of the existing
American Centrifuge technology at its facility in Piketon, Ohio, with 120 machines linked together
in a cascade to simulate industrial operating conditions. The demonstration effort was primarily
funded by the U.S. government. Our current government contract with UT-Battelle provides for
continued research, development and demonstration work at the Company’s facilities in Oak
Ridge, Tennessee.
24
The contract services segment includes Revenue and Cost of Sales for American Centrifuge
work Centrus performs as a contractor to UT-Battelle. The current contract is a firm, fixed-price
contract that provides for payments for monthly reports of approximately $2.7 million per month,
down from approximately $6.9 million per month through September 2015. Spending levels to
perform the contract work are consistent with the fixed funding levels. Centrus records an
unbilled receivable and revenue based on the progress towards the achievement of monthly
deliverables. Monthly reports and invoices affirming the achievement of monthly deliverables are
submitted shortly following each month. The achievement of monthly deliverables has resulted in
revenue consistent with the funding levels.
Although our prior contract expired September 30, 2015, Centrus continued to perform work at
the expected reduced scope as the parties worked toward a successor agreement. The current
contract signed in March 2016 provided for payment for reports related to work performed since
October 1, 2015. Revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2016, includes $8.1 million for
March reports on work performed in the three months ended December 31, 2015, and $16.2
million for reports on work performed in the six months ended June 30, 2016. Expenses for
contract work performed in the six months ended June 30, 2016, are included in Cost of Sales.
Expenses for work performed in the three months ended December 31, 2015, before there was a
contract were included in Advanced Technology Costs in 2015.
American Centrifuge expenses that are outside of our contracts with UT-Battelle, including
demobilization and certain site maintenance costs, are included in Advanced Technology Costs.
Centrus has begun to incur expenditures in the second quarter of 2016 associated with the
decontamination and decommissioning (“D&D”) of the Piketon facility in accordance with the
requirements of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) and the U.S. Department of
Energy (“DOE”). Estimated costs for D&D have been accrued and the balance of the liability was
reduced from $29.4 million as of March 31, 2016, to $25.7 million as of June 30, 2016. For
additional details on the D&D of the Piketon facility and related workforce reductions, refer below
to Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Site Services Work and Related Receivables
We formerly performed work under contracts with DOE and its contractors to maintain and
prepare the former Portsmouth GDP for D&D. In September 2011, our contracts for maintaining
the Portsmouth facilities and performing services for DOE at Portsmouth expired and we
completed the transition of facilities to DOE’s D&D contractor for the Portsmouth site.
Additionally, we provided limited services to DOE and its contractors at the Paducah GDP until
the leased portions of the Paducah GDP were returned to DOE on October 21, 2014.
There is the potential for additional revenue to be recognized, based on the outcome of DOE
reviews and audits, as the result of the release of previously established receivable related
reserves. However, uncertainty exists because contract billing periods since June 2002 have not
been finalized with DOE, and we have not yet recognized this additional revenue. Certain
receivables from DOE are included in other long-term assets based on the extended timeframe
expected to resolve claims for payment. Additional details are provided in Note 4 - Receivables
to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
25
2016 Outlook
We continue to anticipate SWU and uranium revenue in 2016 in a range of $250 million to $275
million and total revenue in a range of $275 million to $300 million. We anticipate the SWU sales
volume for 2016 to be comparable to 2015. We expect to end 2016 with a cash and cash
equivalents balance in a range of $200 million to $250 million.
Our financial guidance is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties that could affect
results either positively or negatively. Variations from our expectations could cause differences
between our guidance and our ultimate results. Factors that could affect our results include the
following:
•Additional short-term purchases or sales of SWU and uranium;
•Timing of customer orders, related deliveries, and purchases of LEU or components;
The outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies, including discussions with the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”);
Execution and funding of a new agreement with UT-Battelle, the operator of ORNL, for the
continuation of American Centrifuge development and testing activities in Oak Ridge following
the expiration of our agreement on September 30, 2016; and
Additional costs for American Centrifuge demobilization; decontamination and
decommissioning of the Company’s facility in Ohio; or related to the overall transition of Centrus.

Revenue
Revenue from the LEU segment increased $12.7 million (or 30%) in the three months ended
June 30, 2016, compared to the corresponding period in 2015. The volume of SWU sales
increased 63%, reflecting the variability in timing of utility customer orders. The average price
billed to customers for sales of SWU declined 19%, reflecting the particular contracts under
which SWU were sold during the periods.
Revenue from the LEU segment declined $60.5 million (or 32%) in the six months ended June
30, 2016, compared to the corresponding period in 2015. The volume of SWU sales declined
13%, reflecting the variability in timing of utility customer orders. For the full year, the SWU sales
volume for 2016 is expected to be comparable to 2015. The average price billed to customers for
sales of SWU declined 9%, reflecting the particular contracts under which SWU were sold during
the periods and the trend of lower SWU market prices in recent years. The volume of uranium
sales declined 79% in the six-month period, reflecting the expected decline in uranium deliveries
in 2016 compared to 2015. The average price billed to customers for sales of uranium increased
54% reflecting the particular contracts under which uranium was sold during the periods.
Revenue from the contract services segment declined $12.6 million (or 60%) in the three months
and $17.2 million (or 41%) in the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the
corresponding periods in 2015. The reduced scope of contract work for American Centrifuge
technology services resulted in declines of $12.7 million in the three-month period and $25.5
million in the six-month period. In the six-month period, the decline was partially offset by $8.1
million in revenue for March reports on work performed in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a result of
the contract signed with UT-Battelle in March 2016, revenue in the six months ended June 30,
2016, includes $16.2 million for reports on work performed in the six months ended June 30,
2016, as well as $8.1 million for work in the fourth quarter of 2015.
27
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales for the LEU segment increased $12.6 million (or 34%) in the three months ended
June 30, 2016, compared to the corresponding period in 2015, due to the increase in SWU sales
volumes partially offset by an 18% decline in the average cost of sales per SWU.
Cost of sales for the LEU segment declined $61.5 million (or 35%) in the six months ended June
30, 2016, compared to the corresponding period in 2015, due to lower SWU and uranium sales
volumes and a 13% decline in the average cost of sales per SWU. The declines in cost of sales
per SWU reflect declines in our purchase costs per SWU in recent periods, partially offset by an
increase in costs related to benefits for former GDP employees and other residual costs related to
the Paducah GDP. Refer below to Impact of Legacy Costs.
Our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Valuation adjustments of
$0.7 million were charged to cost of sales in the six months ended June 30, 2016, including $0.2
million in the second quarter, for our uranium inventory to reflect declines in uranium market price
indicators.
Cost of sales for the contract services segment declined $13.7 million (or 61%) in the three
months and $26.3 million (or 60%) in the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the
corresponding periods in 2015, consistent with the decline in contract services revenue for work
performed in the first quarter of 2016. Revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2016, includes
a billing for March reports on work performed in the fourth quarter of 2015. Related expenses
were included in Advanced Technology Costs in 2015 as they were incurred before a contract
was in place.
 
Gross Profit
Our gross profit increased $1.2 million (or 28%) in the three months and $10.1 million (or 90%) in
the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. Gross
profit for the six months ended June 30, 2016, includes $8.1 million in revenue under the March
2016 UT-Battelle contract for reports on work performed and expensed in the fourth quarter of
2015 before there was a contract.
Gross profit for the LEU segment in the three months ended June 30, 2016, increased $0.1
million (or 2%) compared to the corresponding period in 2015. Declines in our SWU purchase
costs per unit in recent periods and the increase in SWU sales volume were largely offset by the
lower average SWU price billed to customers. Our gross profit margin for the LEU segment was
10.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to 13.0% in the corresponding period
in 2015.
Gross profit for the LEU segment increased $1.0 million (or 8%) in the six months ended June 30,
2016, compared to the corresponding period in 2015, due to declines in our SWU purchase costs
per unit in recent periods and the increase in the average price billed for sales of uranium, largely
offset by lower average SWU prices billed to customers. Our gross profit margin for the LEU
segment was 10.7% in the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to 6.7% in the
corresponding period in 2015.
28
Impact of Legacy Costs
The Company ceased uranium enrichment at the Portsmouth GDP in 2001 and the Paducah
GDP in 2013. Included in cost of sales are costs related to benefits for former GDP employees
and other residual costs related to the Paducah GDP. These legacy costs are distinct from the
Company’s current costs of acquiring SWU and uranium for sale. The following table presents
the impact of legacy costs on gross profit for the LEU segment (dollar amounts in millions):

Advanced Technology Costs
Advanced technology costs consist of American Centrifuge expenses that are outside of our
contracts with UT-Battelle, including certain site maintenance costs. Advanced technology costs
in the six months ended June 30, 2016, include demobilization costs for the demonstration
cascade in Piketon. In the second quarter of 2016, the Company commenced with the D&D of the
Piketon facility in accordance with the requirements of the NRC and DOE. Costs related to this
process totaled $3.7 million in the second quarter of 2016, which were charged to the
30
accrued liability Decontamination and Decommissioning Obligations. The Company has
experienced delays in implementing the D&D process and is working to finalize contractual and
regulatory arrangements for the disposition of materials. The charge to advanced technology
costs of $4.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 reflects delays as the Company continues to
incur costs as the facility caretaker.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased $6.2 million in the three
months and $5.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the corresponding
periods in 2015, of which $4.7 million relates to the remeasurement of pension obligations. A
remeasurement in the second quarter of 2016 resulted in a loss of $0.8 million and a
remeasurement in the second quarter of 2015 resulted in a gain of $3.9 million. The loss and
gain are mainly attributable to changes in market interest rates used to measure long-term
pension obligations. Details are provided in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial
statements.
Excluding the effects of the pension obligation remeasurements, SG&A expenses increased $0.6
million (or 3%) in the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the corresponding period in
2015. Overhead costs allocated to SG&A increased $1.2 million in the six-month period, as less
overhead costs are allocated to the reduced scope of work under our contract with UT-Battelle.
Consulting costs increased $0.5 million in the six-month period for work related to business
development, our debt repurchases and our qualified pension plans. Other SG&A expenses,
including for office leases, supplies and other, declined $1.1 million in the six-month period
compared to the prior year.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
Amortization expense for the intangible asset related to the sales order book is a function of SWU
sales volume, which increased in the three-month period and declined in the six-month period
ended June 30, 2016, compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. Amortization expense for
the intangible asset related to customer relationships is amortized on a straight-line basis.
Special Charges for Workforce Reductions and Advisory Costs
In the second quarter of 2016, the Company commenced a project to align its corporate structure
to the scale of its ongoing business operations and to update related information technology. The
company incurred advisory costs related to the reengineering project of $0.5 million in the three
months ended June 30, 2016.
The cessation of enrichment at the Paducah GDP and evolving business needs have resulted in
workforce reductions since July 2013. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, special
charges consisted of termination benefits of $2.9 million and $3.8 million, respectively, less $0.3
million in the six-month period for severance paid by the Company and invoiced to DOE for its
share of employee severance.
Other Income
Other Income consists of net gains on sales of assets and property no longer needed for
operations.
Gain on Early Extinguishment of Debt
In June 2016, we repurchased PIK Toggle Notes having an aggregate principal and accrued
interest balance of $26.6 million for cash payments of $9.8 million. The gain on the early
extinguishment of the notes was $16.7 million, net of commissions and unamortized deferred
financing costs totaling $0.1 million.
31
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes
There was no income tax provision for the three months and there was an income tax benefit of
$0.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. There was no income tax provision for the
three months and there was an income tax benefit of $0.3 million for the six months ended June
30, 2015. The income tax benefit in both six-month periods resulted from discrete items for
reversals of previously accrued amounts associated with liabilities for unrecognized benefits.
Because there is a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, pretax losses in
continuing operations, and losses in Other Comprehensive Income, there was no income tax
provision for the six months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, although there were income tax
benefits resulting from discrete items.
Net Loss
Our net loss was $2.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, and $15.1 million in the
three months ended June 30, 2015. The favorable variance of $12.2 million is the result of the
gain on the early extinguishment of debt, the decline in special charges and the increase in gross
profit, partially offset by the effects of remeasurements of pension plan obligations and other
increases in SG&A expenses.
Our net loss was $17.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, and $30.5 million in the
six months ended June 30, 2015. The favorable variance of $13.0 million is the result of the gain
on the early extinguishment of debt, the increase in gross profit including the $8.1 million in
billings for March reports on technology services work performed and expensed in the fourth
quarter of 2015, and the decline in special charges, partially offset by higher advanced
technology costs and the effects of remeasurements of pension plan obligations and other
increases in SG&A expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We ended the second quarter of 2016 with a consolidated cash balance of $174.5 million. We
anticipate having adequate liquidity to support our business operations for at least the next 12
months. Our view of liquidity is dependent on our operations and the level of expenditures and
government funding for the American Centrifuge program. Liquidity requirements for our existing
operations are affected by the timing and amount of customer sales and our inventory purchases.
Substantially all revenue-generating operations of the Company are conducted at the subsidiary
level. Centrus’ principal source of funding for American Centrifuge activities is provided (i) under
the contract with UT-Battelle, the operator of ORNL; and (ii) from Centrus’ wholly owned
subsidiary United States Enrichment Corporation (“Enrichment Corp.”) to Centrus and its 100%
indirectly owned subsidiary American Centrifuge Operating, LLC pursuant to two secured
intercompany financing notes (the “Intercompany Notes”). The financing obtained from
Enrichment Corp. funds American Centrifuge activities pending receipt of payments related to
work performed under the contract with UT-Battelle, American Centrifuge costs that are outside
the scope of work under the contract with UT-Battelle, including demobilization costs and
contract termination costs resulting from reductions in scope of work, and general corporate
expenses, including cash interest payments on our 8% paid-in-kind (“PIK”) toggle notes (“PIK
Toggle Notes”). The Company has the option to pay up to 5.5% per annum of interest due on the
PIK Toggle Notes in the form of PIK payments. For the semi-annual interest periods ended March
31, 2016, and ending September 30, 2016, the Company has elected to pay interest in the form
of PIK payments at 5.5% per annum.
Capital expenditures are expected to be insignificant for at least the next 12 months.
32
We believe our sales order book in our LEU segment is a source of stability for our liquidity
position. Centrus’ sales order book extends for more than a decade. Although we see limited
uncommitted demand for LEU prior to the end of the decade based on current market conditions,
we continue to seek and make additional sales, including sales for delivery during that time
period.
In September 2015, Centrus completed a successful three-year demonstration of the American
Centrifuge technology at its facility in Piketon, Ohio. U.S. government funding for American
Centrifuge is now limited to research, development and demonstration work at our facilities in
Oak Ridge, Tennessee. We notified our American Centrifuge employees in September 2015 of
possible layoffs as a result of reduced program funding and undertook voluntary reductions in
2015. We commenced involuntary workforce reductions beginning in the first quarter of 2016.
Centrus expects to make payments for these workforce reductions through 2017.
The Company has incurred demobilization and maintenance costs for the Piketon facility that are
included in Advanced Technology Costs. In addition to severance and demobilization costs, we
have begun to incur expenditures in the second quarter of 2016 associated with the D&D of the
Piketon facility in accordance with the requirements of the NRC and DOE. Costs related to this
process totaled $3.7 million in the second quarter of 2016, which were charged to the accrued
liability Decontamination and Decommissioning Obligations. The accrued liability balance is
$25.7 million as of June 30, 2016. The Company is experiencing delays in implementing the
D&D process and is working to finalize contractual and regulatory arrangements for the
disposition of materials. The charge to advanced technology costs of $4.7 million in the second
quarter of 2016 reflects delays as the Company continues to incur costs as the facility caretaker.
The D&D work is now expected to extend through 2017 and additional costs associated with
delays in fully implementing the D&D process may be incurred. The Company is evaluating the
impact the delays will have on future costs.
Centrus has previously provided financial assurance to the NRC and DOE for D&D and lease
turnover costs in the form of surety bonds of approximately $16 million and $13 million,
respectively, which are fully cash collateralized by Centrus. Centrus expects to receive cash
when surety bonds are reduced and/or cancelled as the Company fulfills its D&D and lease
obligations. The Company has not made a decision on lease turnover and is continuing to
evaluate future uses for the site.
In the event that funding by the U.S. government is further reduced or discontinued, the American
Centrifuge project may be subject to further demobilization, costs, delays and termination. Any
such actions may have a material adverse impact on our ability to deploy the American
Centrifuge technology and on our liquidity.

Operating Activities
The net reduction of $50.9 million in the SWU purchase payables balance, due to the timing of
purchase deliveries, was a significant use of cash in the six months ended June 30, 2016.
American Centrifuge expenses have been a major use of cash, including demobilization
expenses and D&D expenditures. Sources of cash included the monetization of inventory
purchased in prior periods. Inventories declined $50.0 million in the quarter, less an increase in
receivables from utility customers of $22.1 million. The net loss of $17.5 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2016, net of non-cash expenses, was a use of cash.
 
In the corresponding period in 2015, monetization of inventory provided cash as inventories
declined $118.1 million due to sales deliveries exceeding product received under SWU
purchase agreements. In addition, accounts receivable declined $31.8 million due to
monetization in the first quarter without increased sales and billings. The net reduction of the
SWU purchase payables balance of $116.9 million, due to the timing of purchase deliveries, was
a significant use of cash in the six-month period. The net loss of $30.5 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2015, net of non-cash expenses, was a use of cash.
Investing Activities
Capital expenditures totaled $2.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, including
leasehold improvements of $1.7 million that were funded by the owner of the Company’s
corporate headquarters. The Company funded leasehold improvements and furniture totaling
$1.2 million. There were no significant capital expenditures in the corresponding period of 2015.
Cash collateral deposits decreased $0.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, and $4.0
million in the corresponding period of 2015, commensurate with declines in surety bonds
required for waste disposition.
Financing Activities
In June 2016, Centrus repurchased PIK Toggle Notes having an aggregate principal balance of
$26.1 million and accrued interest payable balance of $0.5 million for cash payments of $9.8
million, of which $1.8 million is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of June
30, 2016, and was paid in July 2016.

We had been engaged in discussions with the PBGC regarding the status of our qualified
defined benefit pension plans. Refer to Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies to the
condensed consolidated financial statements.
Capital Structure and Financial Resources
Our debt consists of PIK Toggle Notes with a principal amount of $228.3 million as of June 30,
2016, and $247.6 million as of December 31, 2015. In June 2016, we repurchased some of the
PIK Toggle Notes pursuant to a pre-arranged trading plan. The PIK Toggle Notes repurchased
had an aggregate principal balance of $26.1 million and accrued interest payable balance of
$0.5 million. The Company paid $9.8 million in cash, of which $1.8 million is included in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of June 30, 2016, and was paid in July 2016. The
gain on the
34
early extinguishment of the PIK Toggle Notes was $16.7 million, net of commissions and
unamortized deferred financing costs totaling $0.1 million. Additional details on the PIK Toggle
Notes and the pre-arranged trading plan are provided in Note 8 - Debt to the condensed
consolidated financial statements.
We are managing our working capital to seek to improve the long-term value of our LEU
business and are planning to continue funding the Company’s qualified pension plans in the
ordinary course because we believe that is in the best interest of all stakeholders. We expect that
any other uses of working capital will be undertaken in light of these strategic priorities and will
be based on the Company’s determination as to the relative strength of its operating performance
and prospects, financial position and expected liquidity requirements. In addition, we expect that
any such other uses of working capital will be subject to compliance with contractual restrictions
to which the Company and its subsidiaries are subject, including the terms and conditions of the
indenture. The Company continually evaluates alternatives to manage our capital structure, and
may opportunistically repurchase, exchange or redeem the PIK Toggle Notes or other Company
securities from time to time, even in the absence of any agreement with the PBGC.
NYSE MKT Listing Standards Notice
On November 17, 2015, we received notice from the NYSE MKT LLC (the “NYSE MKT”)
indicating that the Company is not in compliance with Sections 1003(a)(i) and (ii) of the NYSE
MKT's Company Guide since the Company reported a stockholders’ deficit as of September 30,
2015, and net losses in its fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013. We submitted
a plan to regain compliance with the NYSE MKT’s continued listing standards and the NYSE
MKT notified us in January 2016 that it accepted our plan. With the NYSE MKT’s acceptance of
the plan, we have until May 17, 2017, to regain compliance. If the Company is not in compliance
with the continued listing standards by May 17, 2017, or if the Company does not make progress
consistent with the plan, the NYSE MKT may initiate delisting procedures as appropriate. In the
meantime, our common stock will continue to be traded on the NYSE MKT, subject to ongoing
monitoring by the NYSE MKT and our compliance with all other applicable NYSE MKT
requirements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Other than outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds, our SWU purchase commitments and
the license agreement with DOE relating to the American Centrifuge technology disclosed in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, there were no
material off-balance sheet arrangements, obligations, or other relationships at June 30, 2016, or
December 31, 2015.
New Accounting Standards Not Yet Implemented
Reference is made to New Accounting Standards in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated
financial statements for information on new accounting standards.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
At June 30, 2016, the balance sheet carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and payables under SWU purchase
agreements approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of the instruments.
We have not entered into financial instruments for trading purposes. At June 30, 2016, our debt
consisted of the PIK Toggle Notes with a principal amount of $228.3 million. The estimated fair
value of the PIK Toggle Notes was $90.5 million based on the most recent trading price as of
June 30, 2016.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Centrus maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by Centrus in reports it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, Centrus carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon, and
as of the date of, this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
concluded that disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
June 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted
with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters, individually and
in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations or
consolidated financial condition.
