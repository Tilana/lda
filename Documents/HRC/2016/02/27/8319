<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twelfth session from 3 
to 14 October 2011. The review of Swaziland was held at the 4th meeting on 4 October 
</p><p>2011. The delegation of Swaziland was headed by Chief Mgwagwa Gamedze, Acting 
Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs. At its 8th meeting held on 6 October 2011, 
the Working Group adopted the report on Swaziland. 
</p>
<p>2. On 20 June 2011, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Swaziland: Cameroon, Hungary and 
Switzerland. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Swaziland: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted and a written presentation made in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/SWZ/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/SWZ/2 and Corr.1); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/SWZ/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Switzerland, the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Netherlands was transmitted to Swaziland 
through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic 
review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Swaziland indicated that its national report to the Human Rights Council had been 
prepared by an inter-ministerial committee on the UPR. Membership of the Committee 
included representatives from the Commission on Human Rights and Public Administration 
and civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>6. In 2005, Swaziland adopted its Constitution with a justiciable Bill of Rights. The 
Constitution also establishes the independent Commission on Human Rights and Public 
Administration, the mandate of which is to investigate complaints concerning alleged 
violations of fundamental rights and freedoms. The first members of the Commission took 
office in September 2009. The provisions of the Constitution are substantially permissive to 
enable the Commission to carry out its mandate. The Commission has powers to make 
findings on human rights complaints against private and public institutions to remedy, 
correct or reverse instances of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>7. Swaziland is party to six of the core international human rights instruments. 
Moreover, on 25 September 2007 Swaziland signed the Convention on the Rights of People 
with Disabilities. Under the Constitution, ratification of international agreements requires a 
resolution supported by at least two thirds of the members of Parliament in a joint sitting. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation has conducted training for 
members of Parliament on, among other instruments, the Convention on the Rights of </p>


<p>People with Disabilities, and that instrument has been tabled before Parliament for 
ratification. Further, the Government is considering becoming party to all outstanding 
international human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>8. Swaziland acknowledged that the State had not met its reporting obligations under 
the international human rights instruments. For that reason, Swaziland requested technical 
assistance and capacity-building in the areas of treaty body reporting and following up on 
concluding observations and recommendations of special procedures and mechanisms of 
the United Nations, including national monitoring of the implementation of international 
human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p>9. Swaziland stated that, being a small and vulnerable economy, it had the added 
challenge of heightened exposure to external shocks. That had historically diminished the 
ability of the Government to efficiently underwrite some of the human rights that had 
financial implications. That situation had been further exacerbated by the prevailing global 
economic crisis. The crisis had triggered a slowdown and in some instances an outright 
retraction of the economic and social progress achieved by many developing countries 
during the past decades; that made the achievement of the internationally agreed 
development goals a difficult task. 
</p>
<p>10. In spite of the numerous economic challenges facing the country, Swaziland had 
continued to prioritize the provision of free primary education. In the grades where the 
Government did not yet provide free education, it offered free text- and workbooks, free 
stationery, free exercise books, school furniture, feeding programmes and improved 
infrastructure. However, its endeavour to ensure accessible education was negatively 
affected by the fiscal crisis that the country was experiencing. 
</p>
<p>11. In fulfilment of the right of access to health services, the Government had for the 
past 15 years provided free primary health-care services for the nation. Specific 
developments directed to increasing access to health included highly subsidized secondary 
and tertiary health-care services and highly subsidized specialist health-care services for the 
disadvantaged population through a special medical fund, as well as the decisions to keep 
the health sector as a priority and to spare it from the budgetary cuts. 
</p>
<p>12. To improve the quality of services provided to the nation, the Government revised 
the Essential Health Care Package in 2010, to be responsive to the present-day disease 
burden within the population. The Government had recently launched a programme for the 
provision of free medical treatment for the elderly. 
</p>
<p>13. With regard to food security, Swaziland was committed to ensuring that all its 
people had access to adequate quality food at all times in order for them to live healthy and 
productive lives<i>.</i> In 2008, the Government had adopted the Poverty Reduction Strategy and 
Action Programme (PRSAP), which presented a poverty reduction framework. Food 
security was one of the pillars of the framework. Between 2008 and 2010, the financial 
resource allocation from Government sources to the Ministry of Agriculture had increased 
from about 5 per cent to 8 per cent of the national budget. Also, sectoral policies had been 
developed to increase household and national food security. 
</p>
<p>14. With regard to the rights of children, the Constitution provides the legal framework 
for the protection of children. In 2009, the Government had adopted the National Children&#8217;s 
Policy, which was aimed at promoting, protecting and fulfilling the rights of all children in 
the country. In 2011, it had introduced to Parliament the Child Welfare and Protection Bill, 
intended to give effect to the provisions of the Constitution and the country&#8217;s obligations 
</p>
<p>under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Moreover, there were a number of social 
services for orphaned and vulnerable children groups. </p>


<p>15. Women&#8217;s right to equality and non-discrimination is protected by the Constitution. 
An audit of existing laws for compliance with the Constitution and the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) had been 
completed. As a result of the audit, a cluster of family laws had been drafted and were 
waiting to be tabled in Parliament. Also, in 2010 the Government had adopted a national 
gender policy; the primary objective of the policy was to ensure equitable access by all 
persons to education, training, health services and control over resources such as land and 
credit for improved quality of life. Furthermore, the country had made significant strides in 
increasing the number of women in public sector employment.   
</p>
<p>16. Swaziland responded to advance questions<b> </b>asked by Member States. With regard to 
political rights, political parties were not banned. The Constitution protected the right to 
freedom of association, which includes the right to form and belong to political parties. 
However, by virtue of the Constitution, elections to public office were by individual merit 
and therefore political parties could not field candidates in national elections. The King&#8217;s 
Proclamation to the Nation of 12 April 1973 had been superseded by the Constitution of 
2005. 
</p>
<p>17. With regard to privately owned media houses, there were no restrictions on private 
ownership of print media. All newspaper titles and magazines were privately owned. A 
communications bill aimed at liberalizing the electronic media space had been tabled before 
Parliament and was expected to be passed by the end of November 2011. 
</p>
<p>18. With regard to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), Swaziland was considering 
becoming party to that Optional Protocol and to all outstanding international human rights 
instruments. On extrajudicial killings and torture, all killings were investigated by the law 
enforcement officers and normal criminal investigation. Where there was sufficient 
evidence, criminal proceedings were instituted. In cases of deaths in custody, inquests were 
held.  
</p>
<p>19. With regard to the right to life, the delegation stated that it was protected by the 
Constitution. Swaziland was not a State party to the Second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death 
penalty, and retained the death penalty. Capital punishment was not mandatory and it may 
be imposed only on adults convicted of murder without extenuating circumstances. The 
ultimate punishment may be carried out only pursuant to a final judgment pronounced by 
the Supreme Court. The death penalty had last been carried out in 1983. In effect, 
Swaziland, though a retentionist State in law, was abolitionist in practice. 
</p>
<p>20. With regard to the Commission on Human Rights and Public Administration, the 
Government had drafted a bill that would fully operationalize the Commission and ensure 
that it operated in accordance with the principles relating to the status of national 
institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles). The bill 
was before Cabinet and would be tabled before Parliament in 2012. 
</p>
<p>21. On existing gaps and challenges &#8211; some highlighted in the advance questions 
submitted by Member States &#8211; Swaziland wished to ask the international community and 
other cooperating partners for support in the alignment of national laws with the 
Constitution and its international human rights obligations. The Government of Swaziland 
was alive to the challenges that confronted the judiciary. It sought to meet those challenges 
and was working tirelessly to engage the stakeholders in trying to find a lasting solution to 
the impasse. While the Government was aware of the fact that the judicial challenges 
adversely affected the promotion and protection of human rights, it was approaching the 
issue with a full appreciation of the doctrine of the separation of powers. </p>


<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>22. During the interactive dialogue, 47 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report.  
</p>
<p>23. Algeria<b> </b>welcomed the measures taken by Swaziland to respond to the challenges 
identified in its national report, including through its plans and programmes of action 
related to the realization of constitutional rights, such as the rights to life and to education, 
and the efforts towards the protection of vulnerable groups and the fight against poverty 
and HIV/AIDS. It stated the importance of support from the international community. 
Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. Lesotho stated that Swaziland deserved commendation for realizing the right to 
education, as well as for the Child Welfare and Protection Bill of 2011. The policies of 
Swaziland with regard to people living with disabilities were appreciated. Lesotho 
expressed the hope that the spirit and determination with which Swaziland addressed the 
right to education and protection of children could be applied to other human rights 
challenges and was ready to share its experiences with Swaziland.  
</p>
<p>25. Cuba noted that the socio-economic difficulties faced by Swaziland had caused an 
increase in poverty. It welcomed that the State&#8217;s main priority was the elimination of 
extreme poverty, and also welcomed its efforts to prevent and control tuberculosis and 
other transmissible diseases, to combat HIV, and to ensure universal free education by 
</p><p>2015. Cuba noted that about 82 per cent of births had been assisted by health professionals 
and that malaria had decreased. Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Zimbabwe commended the achievements made by Swaziland in education, health, 
food security and the advancement of women&#8217;s rights. Zimbabwe made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Singapore<b> </b>stated that despite its challenges, Swaziland had made progress in 
important areas, such as increased access to improved water resources. It noted that 
Swaziland had rightly prioritized HIV/AIDS on its overall development agenda. Singapore 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. France welcomed the de facto moratorium on death penalty. However, it noted that 
death penalty sentences continued to be pronounced. It expressed concern at the use by 
authorities of the 2008 law on the suppression of terrorism, to restrict freedom of 
expression. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. China noted with appreciation that the Government had formulated a poverty 
reduction strategy and action plan and that it had made great efforts in the areas of health 
and education. China noted that Swaziland was still facing difficulties in areas such as 
reduction of maternal mortality, and that gender inequality still existed. It appealed to the 
international community to provide Swaziland with constructive assistance so that it could 
achieve the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>30. India took note of the positive achievements of Swaziland in the area of elementary 
education. It encouraged Swaziland to strengthen further the programme for free medical 
treatment for the elderly, and welcomed the initiation of the process for drafting the human 
rights commission bill and a leadership code of conduct bill. India encouraged Swaziland to 
enhance women&#8217;s empowerment.   
</p>
<p>31. Canada acknowledged the Constitution. It regretted the insufficient implementation 
of reforms and expressed concern at the continuing ban of political parties and the lack of 
democratic space to exercise freedom of expression and association. Canada also expressed 
concern at the reports of excessive use of force, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial 
executions. It noted the challenges faced by Swaziland regarding HIV/AIDS, vulnerable </p>


<p>children, economic situation, and discrimination against women. Canada made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Mozambique<b> </b>noted that the 2005 Constitution laid down a legal framework for 
Government efforts towards the enhancement of the enjoyment of human rights. It 
commended Swaziland for establishing the Commission on Human Rights and Public 
Administration. It praised the Government for the introduction of free primary education 
and health care. It encouraged the Government to continue its efforts towards the adoption 
of Child Welfare and Protection Bill. Mozambique made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>33. Hungary noted with satisfaction the adoption of the National Children&#8217;s Policy in 
2009 and requested more information about concrete achievements thus far. It stated that 
Swaziland retained the death penalty in its statute books. Also, freedom of assembly and 
association was severely restricted. Hungary made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>34. Ghana welcomed the initiatives undertaken by Swaziland to increase free education 
and school enrolment, and to ensure the right to food, gender equality, and the provision of 
social services for the most vulnerable groups. While noticing that the Constitution 
addressed the principle of non-discrimination, Ghana noted the discriminatory practices 
against women persisting in Swaziland. It also noted the continuing allegations of arrest 
and detention following peaceful protest actions. Ghana made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Slovakia<b> </b>commended Swaziland for the establishment of the trafficking task force, 
taking also a positive note of the adoption of the National Gender Policy and the National 
Children&#8217;s Policy. It noted that there were allegations of police employing interrogation 
methods contravening constitutional provisions. Slovakia expressed concern about reported 
restrictions concerning the freedom of expression, such as under the Proscribed 
Publications Act or the Suppression of Terrorism Act. Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Switzerland<b> </b>expressed alarm at the many allegations of extrajudicial executions and 
torture committed by the security forces and stated that victims should receive justice. It 
noted that there were no political parties because of existing restrictions and that there were 
also few private media organizations. It was impossible for women to open bank accounts 
and to register property titles. Also, the independence of the human rights commission was 
not guaranteed and access to this commission was restricted. Switzerland made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>37. Norway expressed concern at the systematic violations of freedom of assembly and 
association in Swaziland, including through the suppression of political parties. Norway 
expressed grave concern at the reports of forceful disruptions of peaceful marches, rallies 
and protests, including through the use of violence and arbitrary detention. It was alarmed 
at the extensive use of pretrial detention, ill-treatment and alleged torture in police custody. 
Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Turkey<b> </b>praised the efforts by Swaziland to ratify key international human rights 
instruments. It welcomed the establishment of the National Children&#8217;s Coordination Unit, 
while drawing the attention of all relevant parties to its financial difficulties. Turkey 
commended the Government for establishing the Anti-Corruption Commission. It drew the 
attention of the international community to the importance of the support given to 
Swaziland in its efforts. Turkey made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Australia<b> </b>welcomed further progress on the implementation of the Optional Protocol 
to CAT, the first Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women. It encouraged Swaziland to improve and strengthen its 
democratization efforts and its health services. Australia urged Swaziland to take steps to 
reduce the high rates of chronic malnutrition and mortality for children under five years of </p>


<p>age, and to abolish the death penalty and corporal punishment. It expressed concern about 
the overcrowding and poor conditions in prisons. Australia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>40. Germany asked what steps were being taken to overcome the limited access to clean 
water and sanitation. It noted the restrictions of freedom of expression, in particular the 
Proscribed Publications Act. Germany also noted that in 2010, only 30 per cent of births 
had been registered, even though such registration was the entry point for access to all 
public services and education. It asked what steps the Government was taking to ensure 
birth registration for all children. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Slovenia<b> </b>commended Swaziland for establishing the Commission on Human Rights 
and Public Administration. It noted that enabling legislation was needed to fully 
operationalize the Commission. Slovenia welcomed the Constitution, which had introduced 
significant changes with respect to non-discrimination and the rights of women. It remained 
concerned about reports of discriminatory cultural practices against women. It asked about 
the necessary measures taken to effectively ensure gender equality. Slovenia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. South Africa<b> </b>stated that Swaziland had alluded to a lack of resources which 
impacted on its ability to guarantee human rights to its citizens. It sought clarification on 
whether there was a timeline for implementing laws that were still awaiting ratification by 
Parliament. South Africa supported the appeal by Swaziland for technical assistance and 
capacity-building in the completion of treaty body reports. It referred to recommendations 
made by a tripartite high-level mission following a visit to Swaziland, and enquired as to 
what those recommendations entailed and whether their implementation had yielded any 
significant results. South Africa made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>43. Brazil<b> </b>welcomed that the eradication of extreme poverty, and ensuring food security, 
were priorities of Swaziland and that, despite serious socio-economic challenges, the State 
had increased investment in health care. It noted that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS required 
additional efforts. Brazil welcomed the measures taken to improve access to free education, 
but was concerned at the persistence of discrimination against women, and restrictions to 
civil and political rights. It encouraged Swaziland to pursue constitutional reforms. Brazil 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. The United States of America<b> </b>welcomed the establishment of the independent 
Commission on Human Rights and Public Administration, and the trafficking task force. It 
expressed deep concern that the legislation to fully operationalize the Commission had not 
yet been passed. It asked how Swaziland planned to ensure the protection of the freedoms 
of assembly, association and expression. It called on Swaziland to protect the rights of 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people. The United States made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Spain<b> </b>recognized the efforts made by Swaziland in the promotion and protection of 
human rights, in particular the incorporation of human rights protection in the Constitution, 
and the creation of a national commission on human rights. Spain made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>46. Sweden noted that domestic legislation needed to be harmonized with the  
Constitution and international human rights law. Sweden was concerned that the 
independence of the Commission on Human Rights and Public Administration had been 
questioned and that its powers remained unclear. Sweden expressed hope that the optional 
protocols to the instruments ratified by Swaziland would also be ratified, and expressed 
concern at the enactment of the Suppression of Terrorism Act. Sweden made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. Indonesia<b> </b>applauded the policy of Swaziland to guarantee children the right to free 
education in primary school. It appreciated the effort to alleviate poverty through the 
adoption of the Poverty Reduction Strategy and Action Programme. It commended the </p>


<p>steps taken in areas such as the right to health, especially in relation to HIV/AIDS. 
Indonesia encouraged Swaziland to continue its positive efforts. Indonesia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Swaziland appreciated the questions and recommendations made by Member States 
and observers. It highlighted some of the issues they had raised. With regard to the death 
penalty, although Swaziland had not carried out the death penalty since 1983, some 
countries stated that Swaziland must fully abolish it. The delegation reiterated that 
Swaziland was an abolitionist State in practice and recalled that since 1983, the sentences in 
42 of the 45 death penalty cases had been commuted to life imprisonment. Regarding 
instances in customary laws where women are marginalized, the delegation reported that 
the Constitution provided for ownership of land by women regardless of their marital 
status. In addition, Parliament had recently enacted the Deeds Registry (Amendment) Bill, 
which enables women married in community of property to register land in their own 
names. 
</p>
<p>49. On sexual orientation, Swaziland advised that to date no one had been prosecuted 
for sexual orientation offenses. As the world revolved, Swaziland would look into the 
possibility of adopting a policy on the issue. On the issue of torture and extrajudicial 
killings, Swaziland highlighted that any person who had been tortured was free to seek 
redress. All extrajudicial killings were investigated, including cases of deaths in custody. 
On the rights of the child, the delegation reported that there were legislations pending in 
Parliament, such as one on sexual offences and domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>50. Regarding political parties, Swaziland underlined that they were not banned. A 
reference was made to the 1973 Decree that had banned political parties, but in the 
Constitution of 2005, the freedom of association and the freedom to belong to any political 
party were protected. There was only an obligation for each party to have and use its 
constituency during the election in order to ensure direct representation in Parliament. On 
the issue of the Suppression of Terrorism Act, Swaziland indicated that, given the rate of 
terrorism, it had sought assistance from countries and cooperating partners to put in place 
that legislation. Member States were of the view that that legislation was used to suppress 
freedom of association. Swaziland underlined that it would need assistance from Member 
States in aligning the legislation with international human rights norms, similar to the 
assistance it had received from the International Labour Organization in putting in place 
other labour/human rights legislation. 
</p>
<p>51. On the issue of operationalizing the Commission on Human Rights and Public 
Administration, Swaziland indicated some progress in that area, such as the creation of nine 
critical posts that would investigate human rights violations. Swaziland reported that birth 
registration had been decentralized to all the regions. All parents were encouraged to 
register their children, a process that could be completed at Ministry of Home Affairs 
offices, which were located in all regions, as well as at all major hospitals through a 
programme initiated by UNICEF. On the impact of the gender policy, Swaziland recalled 
that that policy had been approved only in 2010, but promised to report on its impact during 
the next UPR cycle. 
</p>
<p>52. Argentina<b> </b>commended Swaziland for having in its Constitution a chapter dedicated 
to the promotion and protection of human rights and freedoms. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>53. Uruguay acknowledged the efforts of Swaziland to promote and protect human 
rights. It highlighted the State&#8217;s commitment regarding food security and welcomed the act 
of 2010 on free and compulsory primary education. Uruguay noted the discriminatory 
cultural practice against women in Swaziland. While welcoming that the Constitution 
raised the issue of non-discrimination, Uruguay expressed concern at the de facto </p>


<p>discrimination against the most vulnerable groups of children, and that corporal punishment 
was legally practiced. Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. The Democratic Republic of the Congo<b> </b>underlined Swaziland&#8217;s social allocation for 
the elderly as an important advancement in favour of social human rights to be seen on the 
African Continent. It noted that there were a number of contradictions between the common 
law and the local customary laws, and that some laws were in conflict with the international 
human rights norms. It asked about the actions the country intended to take to resolve those 
conflicts. 
</p>
<p>55. The United Kingdom welcomed the steps taken by Swaziland towards democracy, 
and expressed hope that the uncertainty regarding the status of political parties could 
resolved to enable free and fair elections. It inquired as to how Swaziland planned to 
strengthen the implementation of section 24 of its Constitution, which provided for freedom 
of expression and peaceful acts of assembly. The United Kingdom encouraged Swaziland 
to investigate allegations of torture. It made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>56. The Holy See noted the efforts made by Swaziland to achieve free primary 
education, to improve access to health for older persons, to provide drinking water to the 
population and to eliminate pediatric AIDS, and that an independent national human rights 
institution had been established. However, it also noted some difficult challenges faced by 
Swaziland, such as reducing poverty and child and maternal mortality rates. It expressed 
hope that the enactment of new programmes and campaigns would prove useful. The Holy 
See made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Morocco commended the brave self-criticism of Swaziland which, among other 
things, called upon the Human Rights Council and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to provide the country with guidance and support in fulfilling its 
international obligations. It asked about the mandate of the Commission on Human Rights 
and Public Administration in terms of the promotion of access to justice and non-repetition 
of violations. Morocco made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Romania<b> </b>stated that the commitment of Swaziland to the Millennium Development 
Goals was commendable. It noted the National Gender Policy adopted in 2010 and stated 
that women still suffered from discriminatory laws and practices. Romania was aware of 
the challenges faced in offering care and services to orphaned or vulnerable children and 
considered the setting up of the Neighbourhood Care Points to be a helpful measure. It 
stated that engaging with human rights mechanisms would be beneficial in identifying 
weaknesses and strengthening respect for human rights. Romania made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>59. Malaysia appreciated the recognition by Swaziland of various challenges faced in its 
efforts to improve socio-economic development and in the promotion and protection of 
human rights. It also noted the measures undertaken by Swaziland regarding poverty 
eradication and social services, in particular in the areas of health and education. Malaysia 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Uganda<b> </b>commended the Government of Swaziland for the concrete steps taken to 
try to meet the Millennium Development Goals related to health. It noted with appreciation 
that the most vulnerable, such as the elderly and persons with disabilities, were exempt 
from paying hospital charges. It commended the Government for striving to ensure that its 
female population was accorded particular Constitutional protection. Uganda made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>61. Latvia<b> </b>stated that there was room for improvement in the area of cooperation by 
Swaziland with special procedures mandate holders. It made a recommendation.   
</p>
<p>62. Burkina Faso welcomed the fact that Swaziland was party to most of the main 
human rights instruments. It noted the measures taken in favour of older persons, such as </p>


<p>the benefits regime for older persons, as well as the 2005 programme on free medical 
services for older persons. Burkina Faso appreciated efforts deployed by Swaziland to 
provide education to children deprived of liberty. Burkina Faso made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Portugal<b> </b>welcomed the cooperative attitude of the Government in the process. It 
expressed serious concern about the alarming dimension of HIV/AIDS and the situation of 
children orphaned as a consequence of HIV/AIDS. It enquired whether the country 
intended to amend the legal provisions, including the Penal Code, so as to replace the death 
penalty with other penalties that did not include cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments. 
Portugal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Mexico acknowledged the actions taken by Swaziland to promote the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health and to attain universal access to free 
education by 2015. It also noted the efforts of Swaziland to eradicate transmissible diseases 
and to eliminate the risks related to food security. Mexico called on the international 
community to respond positively to the requests for assistance formulated in chapter VI of 
the national report of Swaziland. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Trinidad and Tobago<b> </b>applauded Swaziland for implementing initiatives to curb the 
HIV/AIDS pandemic. It stated that work remained to be done to remove the existing 
barriers to equal treatment of women, and that discriminatory cultural practices prevented 
Swaziland from achieving its full potential. Also, democracy in Swaziland could be better 
cemented by allowing a more open system of freedom of thought and expression. Trinidad 
and Tobago made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>66. Burundi welcomed the creation of the independent Commission on Human Rights 
and Public Administration. It congratulated Swaziland for enacting a law on free primary 
education and encouraged the Government in its efforts to turn this decision into reality. It 
noted with satisfaction that Swaziland took in charge children orphaned by HIV/AIDS, 
notably by ensuring the funding of their secondary school education and by establishing 
community centres. Burundi made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>67. Mauritius commended the measures taken by Swaziland to enhance the enjoyment 
of human rights by its population, such as poverty reduction strategies and policies 
regarding access to health care and education, including free schools kits and feeding 
programmes. Mauritius noted the challenges of Swaziland related to reporting obligations 
under treaties, and called upon the international community to provide the capacity-
building and technical assistance identified in paragraph 112 of the national report.  
</p>
<p>68. Qatar<b> </b>welcomed the fact that Swaziland had ratified several conventions, and that 
the Constitution provided for a human rights commission. It stated that Swaziland had 
made great efforts to promote human rights. It noted that in 2008 Swaziland had adopted a 
plan of action to combat poverty and had also made efforts to ensure the rights to education 
and health through the adoption of plans and programmes. Qatar made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. Botswana welcomed the commitment of Swaziland to ensure food security; the 
Poverty Reduction Strategy and Action Programme, which increased allocation to 
agricultural projects; the 2010 Free Primary Education Act; and the task force on 
prevention of trafficking. It noted the challenges regarding the reduction of child and 
maternity mortality and HIV/AIDS. Botswana hoped that the international community 
would provide Swaziland with technical assistance regarding treaty body reporting, 
developing a national human rights strategy and action plan, and harmonizing domestic law 
with international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>70. Nigeria<b> </b>stated that it was highly commendable that the Commission on Human 
Rights and Public Administration had powers to make findings on human rights 
complaints. It welcomed the commitment of Swaziland to attaining food security and noted </p>


<p>the numerous Government policies in that regard. Nigeria commended Swaziland for the 
gains made in the area of education.  
</p>
<p>71. Chad<b> </b>noted with satisfaction the legislation and other measures put in place by the 
Government, including with respect to access to free primary education and health-care 
services. It also noted with satisfaction the rate of 30 per cent of representation of women 
among the Government&#8217;s employees. It called upon the international community to provide 
Swaziland with the support needed to face the considerable challenges it was still facing. 
Chad made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>72. The United Republic of Tanzania noted with great satisfaction the efforts made by 
Swaziland to promote and protect human rights despite its immense challenges, and 
appealed for the support of the international community. It acknowledged the importance 
given by Swaziland to free education and health services and to address HIV/AIDS. The 
United Republic of Tanzania made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>73. Cameroon<b> </b>expressed its satisfaction with the tangible results achieved by Swaziland 
in the areas of education, health, democracy and freedoms. It took note of the legislative 
measures that had been taken in promoting and protecting civil and political rights, as well 
as economic, social and cultural rights. Cameroon encouraged Swaziland to continue to 
strengthen its activities with a view to overcoming all the difficulties highlighted in its 
national report. 
</p>
<p>74. Swaziland<b> </b>noted the constructive recommendations and questions by Member 
States. On the total abolishment of the death penalty, it indicated that that the issue would 
require a national debate. On the issue related to contradictions in civil and customary laws, 
Swaziland recognized that some of its cultural practices could be perceived to be against 
human rights. However, it would endeavour to harmonize those cultural practices with the 
doctrine of human rights. It stressed that the Constitution had identified those practices 
which should be dealt with only by the customary law in order to minimize instances of the 
conflict between the two sets of laws. Swaziland emphasized that the Constitution was the 
supreme law of the land. On the child welfare and protection bill, Swaziland reported that 
the bill would become law by mid-2012. With regard to addressing the conflict between 
common and customary laws, the Government intended to revive the Law Review 
Commission, which would develop common and customary laws in a way that would give 
effect to the values of the Constitution and harmonize the two. 
</p>
<p>75. On the ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance and the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, Swaziland reiterated that it 
would consider ratifying all outstanding human rights treaties. On sexual offences and 
gender-based violence, it stated that a bill on sexual offences and domestic violence was 
pending before Parliament and that the Ministry of Justice would take all necessary 
measures to ensure that the bill passed in Parliament. Regarding the use of corporal 
punishment, the Government would consider enacting legislation that banned the use of 
corporal punishment as a judicial sentence for adults. On the issue of finding places in 
schools for children leaving prison in the middle of the school year, it stated that the 
Department of Correctional Services would take measures, including earlier identification 
of those children in order to take remedial actions. Regarding its reporting obligations to 
treaty bodies, Swaziland recognized the challenges in that area and therefore requested 
assistance from OHCHR. </p>
