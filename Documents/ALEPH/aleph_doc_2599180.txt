SUMMARY
The  Pitman  property,  located  north  and  northeast  of  Terrace,  B.  C.,  comprises  39  mineral 
tenures with total area 13,337.52 hectares.  Tenures are owned by Casa Minerals Inc., a junior 
mineral  exploration  company,  which  company  has  entered  into  a  letter  of  intent  (LOI)  dated 
May  2,  2011,  to  give  Metron  Capital  Corp.  the  optional  opportunity  to  acquire  an  undivided 
50%  interest  in  the  tenures  by  making  cash  payments,  incurring  specified  expenditures  and 
issuing  common  shares.    The  transaction  is  subject  to  its  acceptance  by  the  TSX  Venture 
Exchange and other governing bodies and agencies.
The  Pitman  tenures  include  several  historic  molybdenum  and  gold  prospects  that  have  been 
explored  by  drilling  and,  in  some  case,  underground  development.  Other  prospects  have  not 
been advanced beyond the earliest stages of trenching or technical surveys.  Important factors 
that contribute to renewed interest in the Pitman-Borden area include an expanded geological 
database due to work by provincial geoscientists, recent (2008) apparent exploration success at 
the Zymo copper-gold porphyry property located east of Borden Glacier, and a province-wide 
resurgence of mineral exploration due in part to robust prices for all mineral commodities.
Casa  Minerals  Inc.  in  2008  conducted  field  work  on  most  parts  of  the  Pitman  property  and 
continued  that  work  in  2010.    The  2008  work  included  magnetometer  surveys  and  MMI  soil 
sampling  and  the  more  recent  work  was  directed  to  prospecting  and  rock  chip  sampling  in 
selected parts of the property: the Pitman-Borden database was enhanced by analyses from 850 
MMI  soil  samples  and  approximately  100  rock  chip  samples.    450  MMI  soil  samples  are  in 
storage  and  will  be  analysed  when  funds  are  available.    Work  in  2010  was  directed  to  the 
WoMo  prospect  area  located  at  high  elevation  west  of  Skeena  River  where  rock  sampling 
returned strong gold, copper and molybdenum values, and to Clore River and Keap Creek areas 
east  of  Skeena  River.  The  property  was  enlarged  to  include  the  Paddy  Mac  mineral  tenures 
where  historic  work,  including  underground  workings,  has  returned  strong  gold  values.    The 
company's  work  is  still  in  early  stages  but  has  resulted  in  identification  of  multiple  sites  that 
warrant further examination.
A program of work designed to further evaluate all of the Pitman tenures is presented in this 
report.  Recommendations are presented in three parts:
(1) High elevation work West of Skeena River – Stage 1 -
(2) High elevation work West of Skeena River – Stage 2 -
(3) Work East of Skeena River – Stage 1 -
Total Estimated Cost of Proposed Programs of Work -
$249,262
$450,000
$  92,920
$792,982.

INTRODUCTION
1.1
Introduction
This  report  was  prepared  for  Casa  Minerals  Inc.,  a  Vancouver,  B.  C.  mineral  exploration 
company, in order to provide information concerning that company’s mineral properties, their 
history and geologic settings, and their exploration potential and to present recommendations 
for  further  evaluation  work.    This  report  is  National  Instrument  43-101  and  Form  43-101F1 
compliant and its authors are Qualified Persons as defined in the Instrument and both authors 
have  examined  in  the  field  different  parts  of  the  properties.    The  report  was  initially  dated 
January 25, 2011 and has been revised slightly to include a transaction pursuant to a Letter of 
Intent dated May 2, 2011 to option a 50% undivided interest in the property to Metron Capital 
Corp., a Capital Pool Company.
The  Pitman  mineral  tenures,  located  north,  northeast  and  east  of  Terrace  in  the  Omineca 
Mining Division, British Columbia, Canada, are owned by Casa Minerals Inc., a Vancouver-based 
mineral exploration company.  The tenures cover several areas of historic prospecting interest, 
including the Pitman and WoMo molybdenite prospects and the Gold Dome, Lynda, Lindy and 
Paddy Mac base metal and gold sites.  Casa Minerals Inc. has completed programs of research 
and field work in order to better define the mineral potential of its property.
This  report  comprises  a  review  of  district  geology,  mineral  exploration  history,  detailed 
drawings to illustrate layouts of Mobile Metal Ion geochemical surveys and rock sample data.  
Magnetic  data  from  two  grids,  Pitman  and  Keap  are  included.    Information  has  been 
integrated in order to plan further property work that will help determine the technical merits 
of the various mineral zones and may lead to discovery of additional prospective areas.
The report will be submitted in support of a listing application to allow the company's shares to 
be  listed  on  a  national  stock  exchange  and  will  support  financing  initiatives  intended  to 
provide funds to be used for furthering exploration work on the subject properties.  Much of 
the current data included in this report has been included in separate reports submitted to the 
British Columbia Ministry of Mines in support of Statements of Work to extend the expiry dates 
of the mineral tenures.

1.1.1 TransactionTerms
By  terms  of  a  Letter  of  Intent  (LOI)  dated  May  2,  2011,  Casa  Minerals  Inc.(Casa)  optioned  an 
undivided 50% interest in the Pitman property to Metron Capital Corp. (Metron), a Capital Pool 
Company  listed  on  the  TSX  Venture  Exchange..  The  LOI  includes  terms  and  conditions  that, 
subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval, will constitute Metron’s Qualifying Transaction (QT) 
and will qualify that company as a “Tier 2” issuer on the Exchange.  The TSX Venture Exchange 
has in no way passed upon the merits of the proposed Qualifying Transaction.
The  LOI  includes  the  following  terms:  Metron  will,  upon  signing  the  LOI,  make  a  non-
refundable cash payment to Casa of $17,500 (paid) and on the closing date of the QT will make 
a  second  cash  payment  to  Casa  of  $17,500  and  issue  to  Casa  400,000  shares  of  Metron.  
Following the Closing Date, Metron may exercise the option by making further cash payments 
totaling $700,000 and issuing a further 2,900,000 common shares over a period of four years 
and incurring exploration expenditures totaling $3,200,000 over a period of five years.
On exercise of the Option, Casa and Metron will form a 50%/50% joint venture, with funding 
of further work on a proportional basis under the direction of a management committee with 
voting rights proportional to ownership percentage.  Failure of a party to contribute in full to 
funding  of  planned  programs  will  result  in  dilution  of  that  party’s  interest.    If  either  party  is 
diluted to 10%, their interest will convert to a 10% net profits interest royalty.

PropertyDescriptionandLocation
The  Pitman  property  and  the  formerly  related  Borden  property  of  Casa  Minerals  Inc.  are 
located  from  20  to  40  km  northeast  and  north  of  Terrace,  British  Columbia,  Canada,  in  the 
Skeena  Mountains  of  the  Coast  Crystalline  Complex  (Figures  1-1,  1-2).    The  mineral  tenures 
extend from south of Zymoetz River in the south, north northwesterly across the Skeena River 
to Doreen flag stop on the CNR (Figures 1-2) and comprise 39 tenures as listed in Table 1. Total 
area is 13,337.52 hectares.
Mineral  titles  are  held  by  Casa Minerals  Inc.  and  may  be  maintained  for an  indefinite  period 
provided only that assessment work (aka "annual labour") is filed, along with appropriate fees, 
in  a  timely  fashion.    Tenures  bear  a  burden  of  expenditures  of  $4.00  per  hectare  per  year 
during the initial three year period and $8.00 per hectare per year thereafter.  In the case of 
the Pitman mineral tenures, the annual work requirement in the initial three years, which for 
most will expire in 2011, is approximately $48,199; thereafter the annual work requirement will 
be  approximately  $96,308.    If  qualifying  expenditures  are  insufficient,  tenures  may  be 
maintained  by  payment  of  cash  in  lieu  of  work.    Work  expenditures  can  be  applied  as
Casa Minerals Inc. – Pitman Projects
Page 4 of 92
assessment work to a maximum of ten years. All Pitman property tenures are in good standing 
to  September  01,  2011  and  will  be maintained  in  good  standing  thereafter  by  application  of 
exploration expenditures incurred during the 2011 and subsequent field seasons or by payment 
of appropriate cash in lieu of work.
Tenures  specifically  grant  access  to  minerals  and  other  natural  values  but  do  not  include 
ownership rights to surface, land, water or  forests.  Extraction of minerals, et al., other than 
for quality testing purposes, is governed by permits issued by the Ministry of Energy, Mines and 
Petroleum  Resources.    Prospecting  and  other  early  stage  work  not  involving  road  building, 
drilling, camp building and similar mechanical disturbances, requires filing of a Notice of Work.  
More elaborate work may require consultation with First Nations and Forestry as a prerequisite 
to permit applications.  As of the date of this report, no Notice of Work has been submitted 
with respect to the 2011 program of work.
Metron  Capital  Corp.,  by  agreement  dated  May  2,  2011,  between  Metron  and  Casa  Minerals 
Inc., has been granted an option to acquire a 50% option in the Pitman property.
1.4
Accessibility,Climate,LocalResources,InfrastructureandPhysiography
The  Pitman  tenures  extend  in  elevation  from  Skeena  River  (elevation  120  m)  to  high  alpine 
terrain:  highest points are in excess of 2500 m.  The Pitman tenures located west of the Skeena 
River  are  characterized  by  rugged  heavily  forested  slopes  that  rise  steeply  from  the  river.    A 
legacy of logging roads suitable for use by four-wheel drive equipped vehicles provides access 
to many of the Pitman tenures situated west of the river but helicopter deployment is essential 
for positioning field crews at work sites or campsites at WoMo, Paddy Mac and other higher 
elevation  locations.    In  addition  to  the  above-cited  Pitman  area,  the  mineral  tenures  extend 
irregularly south to south of Zymoetz River.  Logging roads that lead easterly from Highway 16 
provide  access  to  several  of  the  tenures,  notably  via  Zymoetz  River,  aka  "Copper  River", 
Kleanza Creek and Legate Creek.
The whole Skeena district lies within the Coast Mountains and is subject to West Coast Marine 
climate conditions:  summers are pleasantly warm, with moderate rainfall, winters are gloomy 
and  have  heavy  snow  and  rainfall.    Winter  field  work  is  severely  hampered  by  inclement 
weather that interferes with helicopter supported operations:  ground-based winter operations 
have  to  be  equipped  to  manage  snow  accumulations.    Annual  precipitation  recorded  at 
Terrace, 27 km southwest of the main Pitman area, is 129.5 cm. but the mountains undoubtedly 
receive greater amounts of both rainfall and snowfall.
Terrace, B. C., population 11,320, is a reliable source of equipment, personnel and expediting 
services  required  by  mineral  explorers.    A  full  service  airport  has  daily  connections  to 
neighboring towns (Smithers, Prince Rupert) and to Vancouver.  Other factors of importance to 
miners, including hydro-electric power, a water supply, good roads and family support concerns 
such as schools and hospitals, are also present.

The  Pitman  area  is  in  the  Nass  Range  of  the  Coast  Mountains  physiographic  province  of  the 
Canadian  Cordillera  (Bostock,  1948).    The  area  lies  immediately  east  of  the  main  Coast 
Intrusions and has similar rugged topography governed by small, high energy streams that are 
incised into the terrain.  Slopes above the treeline are gentler with a few prominent, sharply 
sculpted arrêts that escaped glaciations.

History
The  earliest  records  of  mineral  exploration  in  the  Terrace  area  are  found  in  reports  of  the 
Provincial  Mineralogist  in  1884  who  was  aware of  gold-seekers  at  work  on  the  Skeena  River 
and some of its tributaries.  Several streams yielded small quantities of fine gold and some were 
sufficiently  "rich"  to  encourage  mining  by  simple  mechanized  methods.    Rewards  were 
consistently  erratic  and  were  frequently  disrupted  by  floods  that  damaged  the  workings.  
Prospectors have been at all times active in the area, searching for bedrock gold sources and for 
base metal occurrences.
The Pitman site was recognized as a molybdenite occurrence in 1957 by Joe Bell, a Terrace area 
trapper and prospector, who staked the O'Molly 1 - 6 inclusive claims and attracted the interest 
of Heustis Molybdenum Corporation.  Figure 1-3 illustrates the locations of historic drill holes 
that  have  been  directed  to  the  Pitman  prospect  and  Figures  1-4  and  1-5  are  vertical  assay 
sections
Heustis  Molybdenum  Corporation  in  1958  conducted  geological  mapping,  trenching  and  a 
small amount of x-ray-size diamond drilling work, (hole diameter 1 7/16 inches).  Records show 
that  Heustis  defined  two  areas  of  molybdenum  mineralization:    the  upper  area  reportedly 
included a 54 foot (16.46 m) wide zone that averaged 0.47% MoS2; the lower area was entirely 
in an aplite formation and averaged 0.10% MoS2 with no width recorded (Kruchkowski, 1980, 
p.  6).    Canex  Aerial  Exploration  in  1964  conducted  geological  mapping  and  geochemical 
sampling and drilled six holes with total length 1621 feet (494 m) and in 1965, collected soil 
samples and drilled a further 1939 feet (591 m) in four holes. Note that the foregoing data are 
historic, cannot be verified and are not NI 43-101 compliant but are included in the interests of 
full disclosure of property data.
The  following  historic  information  is  believed  to  have  originated  in  a  1965  project  report 
authored  by  W.  D.  T(h)ompson  (sic)  and  is  abstracted  verbatim  from  an  assessment  report 
prepared in 1980 for E & B Explorations Ltd. that pre-dates adoption of National Instrument 43-
101:  the data should not be relied upon as the sole reference in any evaluation of the Pitman 
part of the Casa Minerals Inc. property.  Although not specified in the source report, it appears 
from context that assay averages are measuring MoS2 not Mo.  Intervals are reported in feet 
not metres.  The terms "indicated reserves" and "geologic reserves" are not compatible with NI 
43-101 definitions and no longer have validity in technical reports.

On the basis of their drilling Canex estimated non-NI43-101 compliant total indicated reserves 
of approximately 2.5 million tons grading 0.14 percent molybdenite; geologic reserves totaling 
about  1.2  million  tons  grading  0.14  percent  molybdenite"    (Kruchkowski,  1980,  p.  7,  ARIS 
report #7993).
[The foregoing figures are not NI 43-101 compliant and should not be relied upon exclusively in 
any evaluation of the Pitman property]
E & B Explorations Ltd. in 1980 drilled four inclined holes with total length 615.1 metres to test 
"…depth  and  lateral  continuity  of  MoS2  mineralization  intersected  in  the  1965  Canex  No.  6 
diamond drill hole……and the relationship of MoS2 mineralization to flat lying intrusive dykes" 
(Kruchkowski,  op  cit.  p.1).    The  E  &  B  report  includes  a  discussion  of  the  regional  and  local 
geology and complete and detailed drill core logs and assay certificates.  The author noted that 
the  "best  section"  encountered  was  from  138  to  144  metres  in  DH  79P-1,  being  6  metres  of 
0.119  percent  MoS2,  and  that  "The  MoS2  content  appears  to  increase  with  depth  in  all  the 
holes" (Kruchkowski, op cit. p. 1).  The report recommended drilling two 700 metre long holes 
to "…check for mineralization at depth and provide a better understanding of the geology" 
(op cit. p. 2).
The  Pitman  tenures,  in  addition  to  the  Pitman  molybdenite  prospect,  include  several  historic 
properties that have attracted the attention of prospectors and other explorers at various times 
in the past one hundred years.  Those properties are discussed elsewhere in this report.

GEOLOGICALSETTING
2.1
Introduction
The  geology  of  the  general  Terrace  and  Skeena  River  areas  has  been  mapped  by  officers  of 
both the Geological Survey of Canada, particularly S. Duffell and J. G. Souther in 1953 - 1955, 
and  G.  Woodsworth,  et  al.,  in  1985,  and  the  British  Columbia  Ministry  of  Energy,  Mines  and 
Petroleum Resources in 2006 to the present.  Mineral resources in the mid-1930s were studied 
and reported by E. D. Kindle of the GSC (Kindle, 1937a, b).  Other studies have been conducted 
by mining companies and prospectors.  The rugged terrain demands strenuous efforts on the 
ground and helicopter support to gain access to upper slopes is essential.  Casa Minerals Inc., in 
addition  to  ground  based  surveys,  has  used  satellite  imagery  and  computer  methods  to 
investigate gross geologic features.
2.2
RegionalGeology
Duffel  and  Souther  (1964)  established  the  regional  geologic  framework  of  the  Terrace  area.  
Their pioneering work suffered from a lack of knowledge of the geologic history of the area, in 
particular they gathered some of the first fossil collections to help clarify geologic successions.  
Their work highlighted the presence of sedimentary and volcanic rocks of late Paleozoic to late 
Mesozoic age and the complex configuration of the contacts of the dominant Coast Intrusions 
and related smaller equivalent bodies.  Recent focused studies by British Columbia Geological 
Survey Branch scientists benefited from the work of Duffel and Souther and the more recent 
efforts  of  Woodsworth  and  they  have  been  fortunate  to  be  able  to  collaboratively  extend 
information from the Interior Plateau physiographic province into the mountains.  Figures 2-1, 
Geology Map and 2-1- Legend, of this report were copied in their entirety from a 2007 report 
of regional mapping conducted in 2006 by J. Nelson, et al. (Nelson and Kennedy, 2007, p. 151).  
This represents the first detailed geologic synthesis of the area that lies south of the Bowser 
Basin (the Lower Cretaceous age units) and straddles the Skeena River fault zone.  Also shown 
to the west are the Kitsumkalum graben structure, the Kleanza pluton of Early Jurassic age and 
the Carpenter Creek and Newtown plutons of Eocene age, and numerous fractures that create 
the  mosaic  pattern  exhibited  by  the  bedded  units.    Small  red  coloured  triangles  and  crossed 
tool symbols on Figure 2-2 show an abundance of mineral showings and mines, of which only a 
small number have actually achieved production.
The  regional  tectonic  framework  reflects  the  transition  from  the  massive  uplift  event  that 
emplaced the Coast Intrusions in the west to the more passive sedimentary-volcanic terrain of 
the  western  Interior  Plateau.    Additionally,  the  epirogenic  subsidence  of  the  Bowser  Basin  is 
witnessed by low angle normal fault(s) that are traced along the north edge of Figure 2-1.  The 
Skeena  River  fault  zone  is  interpreted  as  a  north-northeast  thrust  with  at  least  3500  metres 
stratigraphic throw (Nelson, et al., 2007, p. 155).  Significantly, Nelson, et al. do not discuss in 
any  detail  the  so-called  Skeena  Arch,  formerly  defined  as  a  northeast  uplift  accompanied  by
Casa Minerals Inc. – Pitman Projects
Page 16 of 92
relatively small plutons, collectively referred to as the Skeena Intrusions, and it is not apparent 
if that concept has been abandoned or superceded by recent studies.
Apart from the Early Jurassic Kleanza pluton and the post-kinematic (Nelson's term) Carpenter 
Creek and Newtown Creek plutons of Eocene age, the region of the Pitman mineral tenures is 
underlain by Telkwa Formation (Lower Jurassic age, principally flows and tuffs) and Smithers 
Formation (Lower-Middle Jurassic, mostly sandstone) of the Hazelton Group bedded rocks that 
pass  upward  into  the  Bowser  Lake  clastic  formation  with  arkose,  sandstone,  mudstone  and 
similar  units.    The  Telkwa  and  equivalent  formations  elsewhere  in  the  Cordillera  are  host  to 
many  of  the  province's  most  important  mineral  deposits,  including  the  majority  of  the 
porphyry-style copper and copper-molybdenum deposits.
2.3
LocalGeology
The  Pitman  tenures,  as  shown  in  Figures  1-2  and  2-1,  extend  awkwardly  over  a  north-south 
distance  of  40  km  and  include  geologically  distinct  terrains  separated  by  the  Skeena  River 
thrust fault.
West  of  the  Skeena  River,  Bowser  Lake  group  sedimentary  rocks,  and  to  a  limited  extent 
Telkwa  formation  volcaniclastic  rocks,  are  varyingly  metamorphosed  due  to  proximity  to  the 
large granitic plutons.  Several significant mineral occurrences are found at the periphery of the 
intrusions and also wholly within those bodies.  Vein-type deposits with gold values occur at 
Gold  Dome  (MINFILE  103I  047),  and  porphyry-style  molybdenum  mineralization,  with  pyrite, 
chalcopyrite,  magnetite  and  specularite, 
is  found  at  Pitman  (MINFILE  no.  103I  046).  
Molybdenite-bearing quartz veins occur in hornfelsed Bowser Lake Group sedimentary units at 
WoMo (MINFILE 103I 122), and in quartz-pyrite veins at the Lynda prospect (MINFILE 103I 121).
East of Skeena River, the intrusive bodies are mostly of Early Jurassic age and are emplaced in 
volcanic members of the Lower Jurassic Telkwa formation.  The northern parts are dominantly 
andesitic,  the  southern,  dacitic  in  composition  (Nelson  and  Kennedy,  2007).    Sedimentary 
members to a great extent comprise re-worked volcanic strata and especially north of Mt. Sir 
Robert, dark maroon coloured dykes are abundantly present.
Figure 2-2 illustrates the distribution of mineral occurrences included in MINFILE.

2.4
RegionalGeochemistry
The  Pitman  tenures  are  located  in  NTS  map-sheet  103I  that  was  the  subject  of  a  Regional 
Geochemical Survey project in 1978, with additional data added in 1995 and 2008.  Large areas 
of particularly mountainous terrain were inaccessible to samplers.
Geological  Survey  Branch  personnel,  led  by  Dr.  J.  Nelson,  have  been  conducting  mapping 
projects in the Terrace area in recent years and have obtained multi-element analyses from a 
large  number  of  bedrock  samples.    Analyses  have  been  published  in  various  reports  that 
provide a library of data that is not specifically directed to mineral exploration.  Some bedrock 
samples,  including  some  from  Pitman  tenures,  have  significant  to  spectacular  metal  analyses.  
Figures 2-4-1 to 2-4-6 in Appendix 1 of this report illustrate the locations and metal analyses of 
various of the GSB bedrock samples.
Working with data obtained from the GSB database, Terracad Geoscience has plotted historic 
geochemical  data  from  the  Pitman-Gold  Dome  tenures  and  from  tenure  no.  568616  (Borden 
area).  Figures 2-4-7 to 2-4-12 in Appendix 2 of this report illustrate analytical data.  Sources of 
data  are  principally  reports  of  assessment  work  filed  by  prospectors  and  mineral  exploration 
company personnel and the quality of the data in terms of collection, handling and processing 
is unknown.  The data plots show several areas with elevated levels of various metals and will 
be used in the future as a guide for further geochemical sampling.

RegionalMagneticData
Regional magnetic data for the Pitman area is illustrated in Figure 2-5, Total Magnetic Intensity 
– Terrace Area.  Casa Minerals Inc. mineral tenures are also outlined in that Figure.
Combined with geologic data (Figure 2-1) the magnetic patterns show that WoMo, Gold Dome, 
Paddy Mac, Helen and Pitman mineral occurrences are located in and on the fringe of the very 
strongly  magnetic  Carpenter  Creek  pluton.    The  northeastmost  extension  of  the  mineral 
tenures are in proximity to the equally strongly magnetic terrane assigned to the Nanika and/or 
Topley  Plutonic  Suites  of  granodioritic  intrusive  rocks  that  reportedly  host  the  Zymo  copper-
gold-silver  porphyry-style  prospect  (discussed  in  section  10).    Casa’s  Keap  Creek  prospect  is 
underlain by a very strongly magnetic granodiorite body that is similar to and almost certainly 
related to the Coast Intrusions. Clore Creek, at the south end of Casa’s tenures, lies within a 
broad  area  of  Lower  Jurassic  age  Hazelton  Group  volcaniclastic  rocks  that  are  only  weakly 
magnetic.

DEPOSITTYPES
3.1 WestofSkeenaRiver
Several molybdenum prospects located west of Skeena River and north of Terrace, B. C. have 
been in recent years the object of exploration programs.  Favourable metal prices and available 
financings  enabled  junior  companies  to  undertake  both  "grassroots"  exploration  and  more 
advanced  technical  surveys  and  drill  programs  that  were  directed  to  historic  mineral 
occurrences.    Mineralization  is  in  almost  all  instances  related  to  the  Carpenter  Creek granitic 
pluton  and  includes  porphyry-style  molybdenum  or  molybdenum-copper  occurrences,  and 
quartz veining and silicification near or at the hornfelsed contact aureole of that pluton with 
volcanic and volcaniclastic formations.
3.2
EastofSkeenaRiver
Although a large number of mineral occurrences are found east of Skeena River in the valleys 
of Zymoetz River, Kleanza Creek, Chimdemash Creek, St. Croix Creek and Legate Creek, most 
are  small  hornfels-related  pyritic  zones  with  trivial  amounts  of  copper  and  occasionally  zinc, 
lead  and  silver  values  (Figure  2-2).    A  small  number  achieved  production  due  to  particularly 
favourable circumstances, i.e. times of high metal prices and demand, but few were successful.  
Local  prospectors  have  at  various  times  in  recent  years  carried  out  small  programs  of 
prospecting  and  sampling.    Adverse  field  conditions,  including  steep  slopes  and  dense 
vegetation,  undoubtedly  inhibited  such  investigations  but  roads  built  and  maintained  by 
logging interests have facilitated access, bridged steeply incised streams and generally greatly 
facilitated mineral exploration work.
The following descriptions relate to two distinctly different types of mineral occurrences that 
typify the contrasting metallogeny observed east of the Skeena River:
Lindy prospect
The Lindy copper silver prospect (MINFILE 103I 145), located at high elevation in the uppermost 
Kleanza  Creek  area,  occurs  in  Telkwa  formation  red-coloured  andesitic  calc-alkaline  volcanic 
rocks.    Chalcopyrite,  bornite  and  tetrahedrite  occur  in  sheared  andesite.  This  occurrence  is 
classified as "LO1 - subvolcanic Cu-Ag-Au (As-Sb)" and "DO3 - volcanic redbed Cu".
Dardanelle
The  Dardanelle  property,  (MINFILE  No.  103I  107)  located  north  of  Zymoetz  River,  comprises 
strong quartz veins in which sulphide lenses carry erratically distributed gold and copper values.  
The sheared contact of a quartz-albite dyke in granodiorite provides the structural host of the 
veins.    Historic  underground  workings  are  extensive  and  the  vein  is  reported  to  have  been 
traced underground and on surface for more than 2 km (Burton, 2005, quoted by Nelson, et. 
al., 2008).
Casa Minerals Inc. – Pitman Projects
Page 24 of 92
4.0 MINERALIZATION
Casa Minerals Inc. in 2007 acquired a large number of mineral tenures in an area that extends 
both east and west from the Skeena River.  The Company's exploration strategy is to further 
develop  known  sites  and  to  search  for  additional  mineral  occurrences.    The  awkward  claim 
configuration  links  several  areas  where  sampling  as  part  of  regional  geochemical  and 
geological  surveys  by  provincial  government  geoscientists  found  indications  of  high  metal 
contents.
Regional  mapping  and  sampling  by  government  scientists  provides  by  definition  a  very  thin 
database  of  metal  analyses  but  serves  to  confirm  prospectors'  knowledge  that  the  Pitman 
property lies in a geologic environment that is richly endowed with base and precious metals.  
The  government-generated  historical  geochemical  data  and  the  regional  bedrock  sampling 
show a very broad range of metal values over the large and geologically diverse expanse of the 
Pitman property, including some samples with very high values.
4.1 WestofSkeenaRiver
Casa  Minerals  Inc.  tenures  located  west  of  the  Skeena  River  are  highly  prospective  for 
molybdenum occurrences and Casa is but one of several companies pursuing the same type of 
"target"  in  that  part  of  the  district.    The  prospecting,  et  al.,  model  is  of  a  molybdenite-rich 
phase of the complex package of Coast Intrusions-related plutons and adjoining rock types that 
is sufficiently large and well mineralized to constitute a "porphyry" deposit:  i.e. several tens or 
hundreds of million tonnes.
Local geology of the Casa Minerals Inc. tenures west of the Skeena River is influenced by their 
location close to the Carpenter Creek granite pluton of Eocene age and by the complex Skeena 
River zone of detachment and/or thrust faulting and dextral displacement (Nelson, et al., 2007, 
p.155).    Bowser  Lake  Group  sedimentary  formations  lie  to  the  north,  separated  from  the 
plutonic suite by low angle shearing/faulting typical of the margin of a subsiding sedimentary 
basin.    Molybdenite  occurrences  have  been  classified  (in  MINFILE  mineral  inventory)  as 
"Porphyry Mo (Low F-type)".
The Pitman deposit
The  Pitman  molybdenite  prospect  (MINFILE  No.103I  046)  has  been  explored  by  geological 
mapping,  geochemical  sampling  and  diamond  drilling  (see  Figures  1-3  to  1-5).    Canex  Aerial 
Exploration  in  1963  and  1964  drilled  ten  holes  and  estimated  a  non-NI  43-101-compliant
resource  of  approximately  2.5  M  tons  grading  0.14%  Mo  and  1.2  M  tons  grading  0.14%  Mo 
(quoted by Kruchkowski, 1980).  Four holes were drilled in 1979 by E & B Explorations Ltd.  All 
holes intersected quartz monzonite, quartz diorite and andesitic and siliceous hornfels as well 
as quartz veinlets (Kruchkowski, 1980).  Molybdenite occurs in fractures and, to a lesser extent, 
in quartz veins, in association with chalcopyrite, magnetite and specular hematite.  The E & B

drilling  returned

unimportant tungsten values.  Their report of drilling only four holes includes the observation 
that molybdenum values appear to consistently increase with depth.
Drill Hole 79P-1 intersected the following MoS2 values:
4.88 to 76.0 metres
71.1m  0.014% MoS2
76.0 to 90.0 metres
14.0m  0.07 %  MoS2

130.0 to 144.0 metres  14.0m  0.08 %  MoS2
including
138.0 to 144.0 metres    6.0m  0.119% MoS2

in DDH 79P-4  was

The Pitman location is plotted in Figure 2-2.  It lies close to a contact between the Carpenter 
Creek  Pluton  and  a  pendant  of  Troy  Ridge  facies  of  Bowser  Lake  sedimentary  rocks.    The 
molybdenite  association  with  hornfelsed  sedimentary  rocks  and  granitic  intrusions  is  a  very 
common one world-wide.
The Gold Dome prospect
The  Gold  Dome  prospect  (MINFILE  No.  103I  047)  is  situated  at  high  elevation  south  of  Mt. 
Knauss and in the headwaters area of Carpenter Creek.  Mineralization is described in historic 
accounts  (MINFILE  Record  Summary)  as  "intrusion-related  Au  pyrrhotite  veins"  in  plutonic 
rocks.  A 1945 Ministry of Mines Annual Report entry records a 36 cm sample from one of the 
veins that assayed 17.5 g/tonne gold and 2085 g/tonne silver.  A grab sample from another vein 
assayed 20.4 g/tonne gold, 1765 g/tonne silver, 1.76% copper, 1.32% lead and 5.2 % zinc (Geol. 
Surv. Canada Memoir 329).  Nelson and Kennedy in 2006 (Nelson and Kennedy, 2007, p. 159) 
took  seven  samples  of  bedrock  and  "float"  from  the  Gold  Dome  area.    Locations  and  major 
metallic  element  analyses  are  plotted  in  inset  diagrams  in  Figures  4-1  to  4-3  of  this  report.  
Separate from the gold, et al. occurrences, patches and streaks of scheelite occur in northeast 
striking, southeast dipping, narrow quartz veins.  The MINFILE classification is two-fold:  IO5 - 
polymetallic veins and IO2 - intrusion related Au pyrrhotite veins.
Figures 2-1 and 2-2 show that Gold Dome is located entirely within the Carpenter Creek Pluton 
and  in  proximity  to  WoMo  and  Lynda  prospects.    Further  work  may  reveal  some  common 
factors  contributing  to  the  mineralization  and,  possibly,  continuity  from  site  to  site  of  the 
mineralizing system.

Lynda prospect
The Lynda prospect (MINFILE No. 103I 121) occurs west of Skeena River at the headwaters of a 
tributary  of  Fiddler  Creek.    Molybdenite  and  minor  chalcopyrite  are  present  in  a  zone  with 
dimensions  460  metres  by  150  metres  and  vertical  range  of  300  metres  that  lies  within  a 
granitic  intrusion.    The  latter  is  emplaced,  similarly  to  the  Pitman  prospect,  at  the  contact 
between  a  lobe  of  the  Carpenter  Creek  pluton  of  Eocene  age  and  metasedimentary  and 
metavolcanic  members  of  Hazelton  and  Bowser  Lake  formations  of  Upper  Jurassic  age.  
Regional magnetic data (see below and Figure 8) show that it is located in an area of intense 
magnetic  response.    Mineralization,  comprising  molybdenite,  chalcopyrite  and  pyrite,  is 
reported  (Schindler  and  Barker,  1966,  ARIS  report  #0866)  to  accompany  moderate  to  intense 
sericitization, moderate amounts of feldspathization, and weakly expressed argillization.  The 
assessment report describes a 100 foot long mineralized structure that was chip sampled in ten 
foot  intervals  and  returned  on  a  weighted  average  basis  0.04%  MoS2  and  0.04%  Cu.    Float 
samples from elsewhere in the intrusive "plug" assayed 0.23% MoS2, 1.30% MoS2 and 1.38% 
MoS2.  The occurrence is classified as "Porphyry Mo (Low F-type). 
Paddy Mac prospect
The  Paddy  Mac  prospect  (MINFILE  No.  103I  154)  was  added  to  the  Pitman  mineral  tenure 
package  in  November  2010.    A  quartz  vein  in  Bowser  Lake  Group  metasedimentary  rocks 
mineralized  with  pyrite,  chalcopyrite,  galena,  arsenopyrite  and  pyrrhotite,  is  exposed  in  a 
cirque wall for 430 metres.  Width varies from 10 to 76 cm and averages 60 cm.  The Minfile 
summary includes non-NI 43-101 compliant sample assay data as follows:
36 cm with 172 g/tonne gold and 122 g/tonne silver
50 cm with 12.3 g/tonne gold and 185 g/tonne silver
373.7 g/tonne gold and 253.7 g/tonne silver, 0.6% Cu, 0.38% Pb (no width given)
97.2 cm with  77.74 g/tonne gold and 144.48 g/tonne silver – described as hangingwall
vein, and
67 cm with 1.03 g/tonne gold and 123.84 g/tonne silver – described as footwall vein
21 chip samples with average width 36 cm with 19.54 g/tonne gold and 176.22 g/tonne
silver.
Although the data quoted above is not specific with respect to locations and is non-NI 43-101 
compliant, they serve to illustrate that the Paddy Mac prospect over substantial widths carries 
possibly important amounts of gold and silver.
Dorreen prospect (aka Fiddler)
The Dorreen prospect (MINFILE No. 103I 048) includes an historic mine that was developed in 
several episodes.  Production as recorded in the Minfile entry includes
Casa Minerals Inc. – Pitman Projects
Page 27 of 92
1924  –  80  tonnes  with  on  average  57.26  g/tonne  Au,  205.71  g/tonne  silver,  1.3%  Cu,
6.2% Pb and 5.8% Zn
1926 – 8 tonnes of similar metal content
1952 – 476 tonnes from which were recovered 3226 g Au, 8118 g Ag, 3137 kg Pb, and
1324 kg Zn.
A quartz vein that occurs in a bedding plane fault in Hazelton Group argillite has been traced 
for 100 metres with width up to 1.7 metres.  Minerals include chalcopyrite, covellite, galena, 
pyrite, sphalerite, tetrahedrite and arsenopyrite (ref. GSC Mem. 212).  The property was actively 
worked in 2008 but details are not available.
Note that the above-quoted production figures are non-NI 43-101 compliant.
WoMo prospect
The WoMo prospect (MINFILE No.103I 122) lies at high elevation on the southern slopes of Mt. 
Knauss and a ridge that separates the drainages of east flowing Carpenter Creek and north-
northeast  flowing  Knauss  Creek.    East-west  striking  quartz  veins  occur  in  the  contact  zone 
between  the  Carpenter  Creek  intrusion  of  the  Coast  Plutonic  Complex  quartz  diorite  and 
granodiorite  and  Cretaceous  Bowser  Lake  Group  metasedimentary  rocks.    The  intensity  of 
magnetic  response  is  moderate  to  weak.    Principal  minerals  of  interest  are  molybdenite  and 
chalcopyrite that occur in fractured and altered portions of both terranes.  Historic work on the 
property  by  a  Cominco  exploration  crew  in  1981  that  included  rock  and  soil  geochemical 
sampling,  outlined  the  mineralization  that  was  already  defined  by  prospecting  and  returned 
anomalous  copper  analyses  (defined  as  in  excess  of  250  ppm  Cu)  and  molybdenum  analyses 
(defined  as  in  excess  of  25  ppm  Mo)  in  the  contact  area.    Rock  chip  samples  from  the  main 
mineral zone exposures returned numerous values in excess of 400 ppm copper and 100 ppm 
molybdenum. Notable sections referred to in the assessment report (ARIS No. 10,440) include
485 ppm Mo across 2.4 metres
285 ppm Mo across 3.9 metres
5280 ppm Cu across 4.5 metres.
Elevated  silver  and  weakly  elevated  gold  values  were  also  obtained.    Despite  the  property's 
name, tungsten analyses were uniformly low.
A  three  person  prospecting/sampling  crew  was  engaged  by  Casa  Minerals  Ltd.  in  2010  to 
initiate  that  company’s  investigations  in  the  WoMo  prospect  area.    Their  work  located  the 
principal mineral zone and followed it discontinuously for several hundreds of metres.  32 rock 
chip  samples  were  analysed  by  ICP-MS  methods  and  several  returned  high  values  in 
molybdenum,  copper  and  gold  and  substantiated  historic  and  more  recent  (Nelson  and 
Kennedy  (2007))  descriptions  of  the  mineralization:    Nelson  and  Kennedy  in  2006  conducted

suggested that shearing in both the intrusives and country rocks (of Bowser Lake Group) may 
extend  from  Dorreen  Mine  in  the  north  to  Paddy  Mac  and  Gold  Dome  in  the  south  and 
"….represent  the  peripheral  Au-Ag-base  metal  enrichments  to  the  main  porphyry  system" 
(ibid., p. 160).  They also described the 200 metre by 1000 metre zone of intense clay-sericite 
alteration with chalcopyrite and molybdenite in quartz vein stockworks that was also sampled 
in 2010.  The occurrence is classified as "Porphyry Mo (Low F-type)".
Section  5  of  this  report  includes  descriptions  of  Casa’s  2010  program  of  work  on  the  WoMo 
prospect.

EastofSkeenaRiver
East of the Skeena River, tenures were prospected and sampled by Casa Minerals Inc. personnel 
in  2008  in  anticipation  of  locating  additional  copper  and/or  copper-molybdenum  deposits, 
possibly  with  important  amounts  of  gold  and  silver.    Elevated  gold  analyses  were  obtained 
from several pyrite-in-quartz and pyritic hornfels zones, the latter being identified by gossan-
type  weathering.    Provincial  geologists  had  reported  a  number  of  vein  clusters  in  Telkwa 
formation  volcaniclastic  rocks  from  which  they  obtained  impressively  high  concentrations  of 
copper, gold and silver (Nelson and Kennedy, 2007; Nelson, et al., 2008 and Figures 2-4-1 to 2-4-
6 in Appendix 1).  Casa Minerals Inc. geologists and prospectors examined parts of that area 
and observed veinlets of tetrahedrite-quartz-carbonate, with broad selvages of bleaching that 
are  thought  to  be  feldspathization  and/or  carbonate  alteration.    Eastfield  Resources  Ltd.  in 
partnership with Canadian Gold Hunter, was at that time exploring the Zymo property located 
immediately  east  of  Casa  tenures  where  "at  least  two  large  copper-gold  porphyry,  intrusion 
related" zones in Stikine Terrane were being investigated (Eastfield website).
Rapid  recession  of  alpine  glaciers  in  recent  decades  has  exposed  large  areas  that  were 
previously ice covered.
The following descriptions are based in part on field observations by the authors and also on 
information provided by prospectors and contractors employed by Casa Minerals Inc. and from 
ARIS files and publications of the provincial government.
Keap Creek Prospect Area
Keap Creek is a north-flowing tributary of Kleanza Creek that falls steeply from the northeast 
side  of  the  O.  K.  Range  [aka  the  Okay  Range].    The  entire  lower  slope  has  been  clear-cut 
logged,  with  a  few  remnant  patches of  old-growth  timber  (mostly  hemlock  and  western  red 
cedar), and has been re-forested in recent years.  Higher elevation parts, above a natural cliff 
escarpment, are mostly forested.  Casa's interest arose from a rock sample taken by GSB crews, 
05-TB-45-02,  that  returned  on  analysis  26.5  ppb  gold,  2,232,000  ppb  silver,  1.12%  copper, 
1.28% lead, 10.94% zinc and 5.79 ppm Mo (location is shown on Figure 2-4-2 in Appendix 1) 
but has not been confirmed in the field).

Clore River Prospect Area
Clore River is a north-flowing tributary of Zymoetz River located at the south most extent of 
Casa Minerals Inc. tenures (tenures no. 578708, 578710, shown in Figure 2).  Pyrite-sericite-silica 
alteration zones occur with a large number of fractures hosted by metamorphosed (hornfelsed) 
sedimentary members of the Lower Jurassic Telkwa formation.  Mineralization has been found 
over  an  area  of  several  tens  of  square  metres  and  possible  extensions  are  obscured  by 
vegetation.    Apart  from  reconnaissance  type  RGS  program  sampling  by  Geological  Survey 
Branch  (GSB)  geoscientists,  there  is  no  record  of  work  prior  to  that  of  Casa  and  insufficient 
work has been completed to enable estimation of the exploration potential in this area.  At the 
stream-side  location  shown  in  Figure  2-4-4,  Nelson,  et  al.  of  the  GSB  reported  a  2  metre 
discontinuous rock chip sample that returned analytical values of 3801 ppm copper, 0.43 ppm 
molybdenum,  0.5  ppm  gold,  14,200  ppb  silver,  9.24  ppm  lead  and  295.3  ppm  zinc,  and  a  2 
metre  continuous  chip  sample  with  13,500  ppm  copper,  0.38  ppm  molybdenum,  15,847  ppb 
silver, 295.5 ppb gold, 4.43 ppm lead and 298.3 ppm zinc (Nelson, et al. 2008).
Lindy Prospect (aka Frisco) (see also previous section)
The Lindy copper-silver prospect is an historic occurrence that comprises quartz porphyry dykes 
and sills in andesite in which a shear zone is locally mineralized with chalcopyrite, bornite and 
tetrahedrite.  The location was not visited in the 2008 field season.

EXPLORATION
Magnetometer
Casa  Minerals  Inc.  personnel  during  summer  2008,  worked  with  a  six  person  contract  crew 
employed by Geotronics Surveys Ltd. to conduct preliminary investigations of several parts of 
the Pitman-Borden mineral tenures.  The crew was based in Terrace, B. C. and traveled to the 
work sites daily by four-wheel drive equipped vehicles, and occasionally by helicopter.  Work 
sites  were  determined  by  Casa's  field  manager  and  field  locations  were  recorded  by  GPS 
measurements. 
surveys  employed  a  Geometrics  Proton  Precession 
Magnetometer,  Model  G-856,  and  field  observations  were  corrected  for  diurnal  and  other 
aberrations by comparison with a base station instrument that periodically during the survey 
recorded magnetic intensity at a fixed point.  Soil samples were taken as recommended by MMI 
Technology,  developers  of  the  method:    samples  were  taken  from  approximately  a  constant 
depth  below  the  interface  between  leaf  and  twig  litter  on  surface  and  the  underlying  soils.  
Analyses were performed by SGS Laboratories of Lakefield, Ontario, following a procedure that 
employs a proprietary mixture of leachate solutions to extract particular suites of metals.  The 
MMI method measures loosely held metal ions that have been transported to the near-surface 
environment  in  interparticle  fluids  that  move  by  capillary  action.    Analyses  for  46  elements 
were reported and complete analytical data and UTM coordinates are included in Appendix 3 
of this report.

Clore River
Casa  Minerals  in  2008  on  the  Clore  River  part  of  the  Pitman-Borden  property  completed  a 
program of MMI soil sampling on a grid of four parallel lines with total length four kilometers, 
a two line partial grid and a 750 metre traverse in an area 1.5 km northeast (Figure 5-1).  [MMI 
analyses  measure  the  readily  extracted  metal  ion  content  of  samples  and  differ  substantially 
from conventional analyses that usually measure all or substantially all of the metal present in 
the -80 mesh fraction of samples.]
Figures  5-2  to  5-6  illustrate  MMI  sample  determinations  for  silver,  gold,copper,  molybdenum 
and zinc.  Figure 5-7 illustrates the location of British Columbia Geological Survey samples and, 
for  the  MMI  samples,  the  total  metallic  content,  the  sum  of  Ag+Au+Cu+Pb+Zn  contents.  
Figures 5-2 to 5-7 inclusive are placed in Appendix 2 of this report.
The  government  rock  chip  samples  and  Casa  Mineral's  MMI  samples  in  2008  provided 
indications of strong metal enrichment in the Clore River area but coverage was too restricted 
to show useful information concerning the nature and distribution of metal values.  Because 
insufficient  work  had  been  done  to  determine  the  merits  of  the  area,  further  prospecting, 
mapping,  sampling,  and,  possibly,  magnetometer  surveys  were  recommended.    In  2010  the 
Casa  field  crew  returned  to  the  Clore  River  site  and  sampled  several  areas  where  pyrite  is 
disseminated  in  felsic  alteration.    Eighteen  rock  samples  were  analysed  by  ICP  methods:  
notable observations include the following:
Molybdenum values are uniformly low, from 0.2 to 1.3 ppm.  This is in contrast to areas
in proximity to the Carpenter Creek pluton that are generally enriched in molybdenum.
Copper values vary from 21.7 to >10000 ppm; many samples contain >3000 ppm.
Lead and zinc values are low.
Silver values are high relative to most regional values:  the maximum, 56.4 ppm Ag, is
from sample KK 10-10 that returned >10000 ppm copper.
Gold values vary from <0.5 ppb to 660 ppb.
The locations of 2010 bedrock samples, numbered KK 1 – 10 to KK 18 – 10 are shown in Figure 
5-1  and  Figures  5-8a,  8b,  and  8c  show  rock  sample  analyses.    The  33  element  ICP-MS 
determinations  are  reported  in  Certificate  of  Analysis  VAN10004822  that  is  included  as 
Appendix 5 of this report.

Keap Creek
Keap  Creek  is  a  northeasterly  flowing  tributary  of  Kleanza  Creek,  a  large  stream  that  joins 
Skeena  River  fifteen  kms  north  of  Terrace,  B.  C.    Access  from  Highway  16  is  by  the  Bornite 
Mountain  Road  which  is  followed  to  km  15  and  thence  southerly  on  unmaintained  logging 
roads.  Most of the Kleanza Creek drainage basin, including Keap Creek, has been logged and 
re-forested.
Government geologists in 2006 found evidence of strong pyritization in silicified volcanic rocks 
east of Skeena River (Nelson and Kennedy, 2007, p. 161).  A sample from a road side location 
near the upper part of Keap Creek returned 2,232,000 ppb silver, 26.5 ppb gold, 11,230 ppm 
copper, 12,800 ppm lead and 109,400 ppm zinc.  Casa Minerals Inc. in 2008 conducted a limited 
amount of follow-up work in the area, comprising roadside MMI sampling at 50 metre intervals 
along  3.5  km  of  road,  and  at  25  metre  intervals  on  a  three  line  grid.    Locations  of  Casa 
Mineral’s  2008  MMI  samples  and  2010  rock  samples  are  illustrated  in  Figure  5-9  and  total 
metallic content is plotted in Figure 5-10.  Magnetometer observations on the small grid are 
plotted in Figure 5-11. Figures 5-12 to 5-16 inclusive illustrate silver, gold, copper, molybdenum 
and  zinc  values  obtained  from  MMI  soil  geochemical  samples.    Figures  5-12  to  5-16  inclusive 
have been placed in Appendix 3.
The  BCGS  rock  chip  sample  data  was  validated  by  the  road  side  MMI  sample  data  but  the 
magnetic pattern shown in Figure 5-11 is not diagnostic.  Further prospecting was conducted in 
the  Keap  Creek  area  in  2010  and  38  rock  samples  were  analysed.    Several  samples  returned 
strongly  anomalous  metal  values,  (Figure  5-17a,-17b,  and  -17c  (included  in  Appendix  3)), 
including  two  samples  with  more  than  3200  ppb  gold  and  five,  with  more  than  10000  ppm 
copper.  Analytical results were received several weeks following the completion of field work 
and there was no opportunity to conduct follow up work.  There is no confirmation that the 
exact site of the strongly anomalous Nelson and Kennedy samples was re-visited.  As a general 
observation,  the  apparent  “high”  copper  background  may  reflect  a  regional  or  formational 
factor,  with the  strong  copper values  being  representative  of discrete  mineralized structures.  
Keap Creek mineralization remains enigmatic and further work is recommended elsewhere in 
this report.
The 2010 Keap Creek rock samples are numbered KC 1-10 to KC 38-10 in Figures 5-17a to 5-17c 
and their ICP-MS analyses are reported in Certificate of Analysis VAN10004822 that is included 
in Appendix 5 of this report.
Pitman-Gold Dome-WoMo Area
The Pitman-Gold Dome-WoMo area comprises all tenures west of the Skeena River and includes 
the Pitman molybdenum prospect, and the Gold Dome, Linda, Paddy Mac and WoMo gold and 
molybdenum zones. MMI sampling in 2008 was conducted along a network of logging roads 
and the survey extended from low elevation near the Skeena River to high elevation near the 
Gold Dome. Figure 5-18 illustrates the locations of MMI samples taken in 2008 and rock samples 
taken in 2010.  Figures 5-19 to 5-23 illustrate silver, gold, copper, molybdenum and zinc values

obtained from MMI geochemical soil samples. Figures 5-19 to 5-23 inclusive have been placed in 
Appendix 4 of this report. Figure 5-24 illustrates total metallic content of MMI samples.  Also in 
2008 a small grid in the area immediately west of the Pitman prospect was both MMI sampled 
and surveyed using a proton precession magnetometer (Figure 5-25). The WoMo prospect part 
of the area was neither examined nor worked on in 2008 but was examined in some detail in 
2010.
Magnetometer  observations  on  the  small  grid  plotted  in  Figure  5-25  present  an  incomplete 
pattern  and  apart  from  showing  a  wide  range  of  magnetic  intensity  are  not  helpful.    Much 
broader grid coverage in that area is required.  A helicopter-borne geophysical survey may be 
useful.
A  helicopter-supported  three  person  field  crew,  comprising  two  geologists  and  one  junior 
geologist, in 2010 established a camp at high elevation close to the WoMo mineral zone and 
examined and sampled an extensive zone of strong sulphide alteration. Strong molybdenum, 
copper  and  gold  values  substantiated  historic  data  and  re-inforced  the  observations  of  the 
provincial  geologists  who  suggested  that  the  broad  zone  of  alteration  and  sulphide 
mineralization  represents  “…the  peripheral  Au-Ag-base  metal  enrichments  to  the  main 
porphyry system" (Nelson and Kennedy, 2007, p. 160).  Figure 5-26a illustrates locations of 2010 
program  talus  fines  and  rock  samples  along  with  gold  and  silver  analyses,  Figure  5-26b 
illustrates  copper  and  molybdenum  values,  and  Figure  5-26c  illustrates  lead  and  zinc  values.  
Sample  descriptions  and  33  element  ICP-MS  determinations  as  reported  in  Certificate  of 
Analysis VAN10003509, are included in Appendix 5 of this report.
The  analytical  data  from  the  various  2010  WoMo  samples  indicate  that  copper  and 
molybdenum values are “high”, reflecting the samplers’ attempts to determine the merits of 
the  area  and  the  fact  that  exposures  of  bedrock  in  stream  channels  are  almost  invariably 
comprised  of  sulphide-altered  rock.    Intervening  areas  are  covered  by  soil  or  felsenmeer  and 
were not sampled. No additional follow-up work has been directed to the WoMo part of the 
Pitman  property  but  the  area  is  clearly  defined  as  “anomalous”  in  metals  of  interest  and 
further work is recommended in a separate section of this report.
The  Paddy-Mac  mineral  tenures  were  acquired  by  Casa  Minerals  Inc.  subsequent  to  the  2010 
field season. The property is contiguous to the various Pitman tenures and comprises an area of 
rugged topography typical of the Coast Mountains of British Columbia.  The property includes 
two  adits:    an  upper  adit  35  feet  (10.7  metres)  in  length  that  followed  a  shear  zone,  and  a 
lower adit 30 feet (10.5 metres) in length that followed a 12 inch quartz vein. Relevant historic 
data from the period 1980 to 1986 includes several programs of chip sampling of a series of 
quartz veins that are exposed in steep cliffs.  As reported in ARIS #20504, seven samples were 
taken  in  1980  by  Holt  Engineering  Ltd.  ,  a  further  27  samples  were  taken  by  experienced 
mountaineers  employed  by  Bema  Industries  Ltd.,  and  in  1986,  26  samples  were  taken  by 
Canamax  Resources  Inc.  Burton  Consulting  Inc.  in  1990  conducted  geological  mapping  and 
sampling  traverses  and  took  five  samples.    The  latter  group  reported  that  “Economic 
mineralization within and immediately surrounding the quartz veins consists of visible galena

and  chalcopyrite  with  erratic  gold  and  silver  values  detected  by  assaying.    The  mode  of 
occurrence of the gold and silver is not known.  Gold assays of up to 10.800 oz/ton have been 
obtained from selected samples” (Symonds, 1990, p.13).
The  Paddy  Mac  tenures  have  not  been  examined  by  the  authors  but  available  data,  which, 
although not NI 43-101 acceptable, is believed to be reliable, includes selected samples that, as 
cited  above,  assayed  as  high  as  10.800  oz/ton  gold  and  7.40  oz/ton  silver  over  0.30  metre 
thickness.  Other  samples  returned  gold  assays  that  are,  given  current  gold  and  silver  prices, 
highly attractive and that confirm that a gold enriched system is present, Sample locations and 
descriptions are poorly documented but further work is recommended elsewhere in this report.
6.0 DRILLING
Casa Minerals Inc. has not undertaken any drilling on any of its mineral tenures.  The Pitman 
molybdenum  prospect  was  in  the  past  explored  by  at  least  14  diamond  drill  holes  and  BC 
Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources assessment report 07993 provides drill core 
logs and brief descriptions of the historic drilling (Kruchkowski, 1980).  The mineral zone was 
intersected  in  most  of  the  holes  but  the  extent  and  orientation  of  a  mineral  zone  was  not 
determined.
7.0
SAMPLINGMETHODANDAPPROACH
A  contract  field  crew  of,  variously,  between  four  and  seven  persons,  completed  the  2008 
program of property work on the Pitman tenures.  Experience and skill levels of workers varied 
but  crew  chiefs  were  observed  in  the  field  to  be  competent  to  organize,  supervise  and 
implement the MMI soil sampling method and to complete the magnetic surveys.  824 samples 
were  taken  from,  variously,  small  grids  or  traverses  and  many  samples  were  from  roadside 
locations, some of which may have been disturbed by construction and traffic.
MMI theory and methods are discussed in Section 5.0 of this report.  Casa's data are presumed 
to  be  accurate  and  reliable  but  the  MMI  method  is  a  relatively  recent  innovation  that  was 
developed in Australia where field conditions are quite unlike those in northern coastal British 
Columbia.  It has been tried and demonstrated to be effective in many other parts of the world 
but is not accepted by all geoscientists as a good alternative to conventional geochemical soil 
survey practice.
The Pitman samples are believed to be of good quality and reasonably representative of the 
terrain.  Data were received long after the 2008 field season ended but follow-up work in the 
field  to  confirm  or  expand  data  from  sites  that  gave  apparently  anomalous  results  was 
recommended.
Casa Minerals Inc. – Pitman Projects

The great majority of MMI sample analyses returned very low metal values, in the single and 
double digit ppb ranges.  The higher values are, according to MMI technology and experience, 
significant as they represent the vertical migration of metal ions from a bedrock source.  They 
cannot  however  be  reliably  correlated  with  conventional  historic  soil  sample  analyses  that 
represent all soil components and are treated with a much more aggressive leach.  Note that 
much of the MMI sampling followed roads and geographic contours and cannot with ease be 
depicted in a report.  The MMI analytical data base was reviewed and areas of apparently high 
metal occurrences were noted for future follow-up field inspection and sampling.

SAMPLEPREPARATION,ANALYSESANDSECURITY
MMI soil samples in 2008 were accumulated at the base camp (motel) as recommended by MMI 
Technology, until completion of the field work.  Soil samples were placed in standard 'ziplock' 
type bags and then packed in an orderly manner in stout cardboard boxes.  At the end of the 
job, all samples were shipped by commercial transport truck to the SGS Laboratory in Lakefield, 
Ontario.  Due to the preliminary nature of the survey work and the fact that Casa Minerals Inc. 
was  a  closely-held,  private,  non-trading  company,  the  project  did  not  attract  any  particular 
interest in the community and there was no evidence of any interference of any kind with the 
samples.
The  Casa  Minerals  Inc.  project  supervisor,  Peter  Burjoski,  was  not  involved  in  any  aspect  of 
sample gathering or processing, all of which were under the care of the contractor's party chief 
and  there  were  no  opportunities  for  interference  of  any  kind  by  either  the  public  or  by 
personnel identified with Casa Minerals Inc.
The  SGS  Laboratory  in  Lakefield,  Ontario  processed  the  Casa  Minerals  Inc.  2008  MMI  soil 
samples  following  that  laboratory's  standard  procedures.    SGS  has  offered  assaying,  analysis 
and umpiring services for several decades and is an ISO 9002 accredited testing laboratory.  No 
check assays, blanks, duplicates or standard samples were submitted to the laboratory but that 
facility regularly performs and reports a number of internal quality control routines that ensure 
the integrity of its instruments and procedures. 1241 samples were analysed.
The  2010  rock  chip  samples  from  the  WoMo,  Keap  Creek  and  Clore  River  areas  were 
accumulated at the respective base camp or motel sites until completion of field work and then 
were transported by the field personnel directly to the analytical laboratory in Vancouver, B. C.  
Samples were at no time exposed to interference by “outsiders”.  Laboratory procedures were 
in accord with current practice and the laboratory employed adequate internal quality control 
methods to ensure that satisfactory data were delivered to the client.
In the authors' opinion, the chain of custody and the analytical services provided with respect 
to  the  Casa  Minerals  Inc.  samples  are  entirely  appropriate  and  the  analytical  data  can  be 
unhesitatingly accepted as adequate for purposes of evaluating grassroots-stage samples.

The MMI method of applied geochemistry was introduced to the mineral exploration industry 
in 1992 and has found broad acceptance but, nonetheless, has to be implemented carefully.

As  discussed  in  the  preceding  section  of  this  report,  due  to  the  early-stage  nature  of  the 
investigation  of  the  Pitman  mineral  tenures,  no  data  verification  procedures  were 
implemented.    If  work  progresses  to  a  more  advanced  type  of  work,  such  as,  for  instance, 
detailed chip sampling of mineral zones or diamond drilling, it will be necessary to attend to 
security and quality assurance and quality control topics.
10.0 ADJACENTPROPERTIES
The Casa Minerals Inc. tenures are in many instances situated close to other "active" properties, 
several of which may have been investigated by their owners during the 2008 and 2010 field 
seasons.  No attempt was made to either identify or monitor such work.
TTM Resources Ltd. in 2007 investigated a molybdenum property located west of Skeena River 
and  southwest  of  the  Pitman  prospect.    TTM  Resources  Ltd.  is  a  molybdenum-seeking  junior 
company with other advanced-stage exploration projects in British Columbia.  East of Skeena 
River,  the  Dardanelle  property,  a  copper-gold  prospect  that  has  a  long  history,  was  being 
explored by a New Westminster-based prospector-geoscientist.  Immediately east of the then 
Borden part of Casa's claims, the 10,660 hectare Zymo copper-gold-silver porphyry property was 
explored  in  2008  by  a  joint  venture  of  Eastfield  Resources  Ltd.  and  Canadian  Gold  Hunter 
Resources Inc. that completed induced polarization surveys and a drilling program of 1,554.5 
metres in six holes.  Drilling was directed to the Hobbes Zone and the j.v. reported success in 
intersecting  "…significant  intervals  of  copper-gold  mineralization…"  in  all  drill  holes  (News 
release, Jan. 19, 2009).  The Hobbes is closely associated with a strong magnetic anomaly with 
dimensions  of  at  least  6  km  by  2  to  3  km.    A  second  area,  the  FM  Zone,  is  located  4.5  km 
northeast of the Hobbes and is reported to be a porphyry-related high sulphidation gold-silver-
zinc  replacement  occurrence  (Eastfield  website).    The  authors  are  not  aware  of  any  work  at 
Zymo subsequent to the 2008 program of surveys and drilling.  Knauss Creek Mines Ltd. in 2009 
performed  a  substantial  amount  of  work  on  the  Knauss  Mountain  property  located 
immediately northeast of WoMo:  details of that work are not available.

13.0 OTHERRELEVANTDATAANDINFORMATION
This technical report includes all relevant data and information concerning the Pitman mineral 
tenures.    The  operator,  Casa  Minerals  Inc.,  commenced  work  on  the  tenures  during  summer 
2008 and continued that work in the 2010 field season.  Casa has attempted to locate and place 
on record all available data, along with details of its 2008 and 2010 work.  A large amount of 
additional information concerning the regional geological setting, which is quite complex due 
to  its  location  at  the  transition  from  the  Coast  Crystalline  Belt  to  the  Intermontane 
physiographic  belt,  is  available  in  publications  of  the  Geological  Survey  of  Canada,  the 
Geological Survey  Branch  of  the  B. C.  Ministry  of  Energy, Mines  and  Petroleum  Resources,  in 
theses, and in technical papers published in juried periodicals and elsewhere.  Such academic 
and  technical  discussions  are  beyond the  scope  of  this  report which  is  intended  to  provide  a 
description and evaluation of a series of mineral prospects that are at a "grassroots" or slightly 
more advanced stage.  It is believed that the authors have presented a comprehensive technical 
report that is relevant, understandable and not misleading.

INTERPRETATIONANDCONCLUSIONS
Casa Minerals Inc. has begun what may become a lengthy process of evaluating a very large 
and  diverse  array  of  mineral  tenures,  some  of  which  have  attractive  possibilities  of  hosting 
worthwhile mineral deposits.  The evaluation has to date been focused on some of the most 
accessible "target" areas and those with some history of exploration.  Metron Capital Corp. has 
optioned  a  50%  interest  in  the  Pitman  property  and  will  provide  funding  to  enable  further 
exploration.
West of Skeena River, initial work by Casa in 2008 and 2010 was directed to several areas of 
molybdenite  mineralization  and  to  polymetallic  vein  zones.    Additional  work  is  required  to 
complete evaluation of the various areas. The authors have concluded that further work is fully 
justified  and  have  outlined  in  general  terms  recommended  programs  of  work  to  better 
evaluate  the  mineral  tenures.    Casa  Minerals  Inc.,  in  order  to  provide  funds  required  to 
continue  exploration  of  the  Pitman  tenures,  optioned  a  50%  interest  in  those  tenures  to 
Metron Capital Corp.  Following completion of the recommended work, Metron Capital Corp. 
and Casa Minerals Inc. will be able to focus their future efforts on the most prospective mineral 
zones.
East  of  Skeena  River,  Casa  Minerals  Inc.  in  2008  completed  initial  work  in  the  form  of 
reconnaissance, prospecting and rock and MMI soil sampling.  Two areas were partially gridded 
and soil sampled:  Clore River and Keap Creek (a tributary of Kleanza Creek). The company has 
received analytical data from those grids and although results were inconclusive, further work, 
including geophysical surveys (induced polarization and resistivity surveys) was recommended.  
Some  MMI  soil  geochemical  analyses  indicate  strong  metal  values  and  further  sampling  and 
prospecting are required to determine their source(s).
Casa Minerals Inc. – Pitman Projects
Page 38 of 92
In 2010, a field crew conducted geological reconnaissance and bedrock sampling in the WoMo, 
Clore River and Keap Creek areas.  Geological work confirmed that mineral zones in the areas 
comprise pyritization and other types of alteration similar to that found in proximity to granitic 
intrusions  in  many  parts  of  the  Coast  Mountains.    Precious  metal  and  copper  analyses  are 
mixed,  with  some  samples  having  high  values  that  warrant  more  detailed  follow-up  work  in 
the  form  of  detailed  mapping  and  trenching.    Rugged  terrain  and  other  access  difficulties 
demand  extra  caution  while  working  in  the  areas  and  also  in  the  past  have  inhibited 
prospecting work.
14.1 PitmanProspect
The Pitman molybdenum prospect has two known mineral zones exposed in steep terrain.  One 
zone  at  relatively  low  elevation  has  been  drilled  with  some  success  by  two  operators.  
Mineralization  is  hosted  by  the  Carpenter  Creek  pluton  that  is  also  the  site  of  several  other 
molybdenum  prospects  and  a  small  number  of  polymetallic  vein  occurrences.    Historic  work, 
including prospecting, soil geochemistry and drilling, has not determined the size and limits of 
the  mineralization,  nor  has  it  exhausted  the  possibilities  of  finding  extensions  to  the  known 
zones  nor  the  possibility  of  finding  additional,  new,  similar  occurrences.  Sampling  in  2008  in 
the  vicinity  of  the  historic  molybdenum  occurrences  demonstrates  strong  potential  for 
expanding the zone beyond the area that was drilled in previous work campaigns.
14.2 WoMoProspect
The  WoMo  porphyry-style  molybdenite  zone  is,  speculatively,  in  the  opinion  of  government 
geoscientists,  possibly  continuous  with  similar  prospects  exposed  in  nearby  stream  drainages.  
The zone has apparent dimensions of 1000 by 800 metres (MINFILE data) and, on the basis of 
Casa’s work in 2010, may be much larger, following the contact alteration halo adjacent to the 
Carpenter Creek granodioritic pluton.  Mineralization comprises molybdenite and chalcopyrite 
mineralization in disseminations and quartz veins at and near the sheared and altered contact 
between  granodiorite  and  hornfelsed  sediments.   High  gold values  are  erratically  distributed 
and include some that warrant further sampling. The mineralization has not been drilled.  The 
showings  are  near  and  higher  than  tree  line  and  are  accessible,  for  practical  purposes,  by 
helicopter.
14.3 GoldDomeProspect
The  Gold  Dome  prospect  has  not  been  examined  in  the  field  by  Casa  Minerals  personnel. 
Quartz  veins  carry  gold,  silver  and  base  metal  mineralization  and  it  appears  that  past 
exploration was focused on the individual veins, which are narrow:  exploration in search of a 
larger  shear-related  mineral  zone  may  be  more  rewarding.    Geological  mapping  and 
geochemical sampling will determine the overall dimensions of the zone that will then have to 
be confirmed by diamond drilling.  Gold Dome is aligned geographically (and geologically) with 
Paddy Mac, WoMo and Lynda prospects and there may be a subtle geologic structure that can 
be used as an exploration tool.

14.4 LyndaProspect
The Lynda prospect has not been examined in the field by Casa Minerals personnel.  Available 
information,  in  ARIS  reports  and  government  publications,  indicate  that  the  property  has 
characteristics of a porphyry-style molybdenum-copper deposit.  It is situated in a complex of 
granitic intrusions, and volcanic and sedimentary rocks and is host to molybdenite and minor 
chalcopyrite in quartz-pyrite veins.  Prevailing alteration includes strong sericitization and local 
feldspathization (MINFILE data) that extends onto adjoining mineral tenures.
14.5 CloreRiverProspect
The Clore River tenures are located in an area where strikingly high metal values were obtained 
by  government  geologists  from  chip  samples.    Initial  prospecting  by  Casa  Minerals  personnel 
found disseminated sulphide mineralization in andesitic volcanic rocks and an MMI soil sample 
grid was placed over the principal area of interest.  Analytical results were mildly encouraging 
and  it  was  determined  that  further  investigations  were  warranted.    Work  in  2010  included 
further  prospecting  and  bedrock  sampling  of  and  near  the  mineral  zones  and  the  resulting 
analyses indicate that some areas of strong copper mineralization are present and that other 
metals of interest, including gold, are also present.
14.6 KeapCreekProspect
Keap Creek, a tributary of Kleanza Creek, features a number of fractures with quartz and pyrite 
mineralization.  Regional work by government geologists identified high gold (26.5 ppb) and 
extremely  high  silver  values  (2,232,000  ppb)  in  one  rock  sample.    Casa  Minerals  conducted 
preliminary prospecting work and grid sampled part of the most prospective area.  Analytical 
results  from  MMI-type  samples  were  mixed  and  further  work  was  recommended.      Work  in 
2010  included  further  prospecting  and  bedrock  sampling  but  it  is  not  certain  that  the  zone 
found and sampled by the government geologists was revisited.
14.7 PaddyMacProspect
The Paddy Mac Prospect lies at high elevation west of Skeena River and comprises several zones 
of  gold  bearing  quartz  veining  hosted  by  hornfelsed  metasedimentary  rocks  of  the  Bowser 
Lake  Group  and  mineralized  with  pyrite,  chalcopyrite,  galena,  arsenopyrite  and  pyrrhotite.
The present owners, Casa and Metron, have not directed any work to the area.
15.0 RECOMMENDATIONS
The  following  recommendations  are  organized  in  three  parts:  (1)  Pitman  area  (2)  Prospects 
West of Skeena River and (3) Prospects East of Skeena River.  Each part is divided into phases:  
Phase  1  is  prospecting  and  technical  survey  work  that  will  have  as  its  objective  definition  of 
drillable  targets;  Phase  2,  which  is  dependent  upon  a  positive  evaluation  of  Phase  1, 
recommends either geophysical surveys or diamond drilling of one or more and, possibly all, of 
the targets.
Casa Minerals Inc. – Pitman Projects
Page 40 of 92
15.1 PitmanMolybdeniteZone
Historic  drill  results  from  the  Pitman  molybdenite  occurrence  are  mildly  encouraging  and 
strongly suggest that the area of molybdenite mineralization extends well beyond the area of 
historic diamond drilling.  Further drilling to confirm historic data and to expand the zone of 
known  mineralization  is  warranted.  It  is  recommended  that  in  a  Phase  1  program  the  area 
should be further explored by prospecting, geochemical soil sampling, either conventional or 
MMI-type,  and,  if  practical,  a  small  amount  of  induced  polarization  and  resistivity  surveying. 
Geophysical work may require heavy line cutting.  Phase 2, if warranted by Phase 1 work, will 
include four or five diamond drill holes that should be directed to the area of historic drilling in 
order to confirm the old data and to expand the dimensions of the mineral zone or zones.
Phase 1 work will require a budget of $25,000 and if geophysical surveys are included, $50,000.
The Phase 2 program of diamond drilling is likely to include at least five drill holes with total 
length 2000 metres.  Cost of drilling program @ estimated all-in cost of $150/metre -  $300,000.
Total estimated cost of Phase 1 and Phase 2 programs on the Pitman zone -
$350,000.
15.2 ProspectsWestofSkeenaRiver
Casa’s  mineral  tenures  located  west  of  the  Skeena  River  include,  in  addition  to  the  Pitman 
molybdenite property, several historic prospects situated at high elevation, namely the Lynda, 
Gold  Dome,  Paddy  Mac  and  WoMo prospects.    The  prospects  have  similar  characteristics  and 
may have continuity along the contact area of the Carpenter Creek pluton with volcaniclastic 
members of Hazelton Group units. The possible continuations should be prospected, sampled 
and geologically mapped.  Magnetic, induced polarization and resistivity surveys, if they can be 
applied  in  the  steep  mountainous  terrain,  may  be  useful  in  determining  the  relationship 
between WoMo and nearby mineral zones.  Diamond drilling will almost certainly follow.
Casa’s high elevation mineral showings and prospects, namely the WoMo, Paddy Mac, Gold Dome, 
and Lynda areas, should be carefully prospected, geologically mapped, and sampled by suitably 
trained  and  equipped  persons  to  further  outline  their  size  and  characteristics  and  possible 
continuity.  As  necessary,  a  two  or  four  person  crew  equipped  with  complete  camp  gear  and 
suitable  communications  should  be  positioned  in  a  temporary  camp  by  helicopter  near  each 
prospect.  The crew will prospect, map and sample the mineral zones and then arrange to be 
re-supplied,  if  necessary,  and  moved  to  another site.    Because  of  the  difficult  and  hazardous 
field  conditions  in  the  area  it  will  be  desirable  to  have  an  expediter  or  other  company 
representative in Terrace to maintain contact with the field crew.  Following assessment of the 
prospecting  and  geological  work,  a  geophysical  survey  crew  should  complete,  where 
warranted,  magnetic,  induced  polarization  and  resistivity  surveys  to  better  define  areas  of 
apparent  merit.    All  property  data  should  then  be  reviewed  and,  again  where  warranted, 
target areas should be explored by diamond drill holes.  The latter stage of work is described as 
Phase 2 in the following paragraphs.

15.3 EastofSkeenaRiver
Work  east  of  Skeena  River  may  be  organized  separately  from  work  west  of  the  River  and 
operate either at the same time as the work is in progress west of the River or, using the same 
crew,  sequentially.    If  done  at  the  same  time,  accommodation,  supervision  and  expediting 
arrangements in Terrace will benefit both project areas.  Alternatively, the single crew could 
complete  work  west  of  the  Skeena  River  and  then  proceed  to  the  east  side.    That  schedule 
would ensure continuity and facilitate quality control at the cost of prolonging the field season 
and increasing costs of supervision.
Much, if not all, of the work on tenures located east of Skeena River can be conducted using 
four wheel drive equipped vehicles on logging roads.  For planning purposes, it is assumed that 
a  four  person  field  crew  with  a  FWD  vehicle  will  be  accommodated  at a motel  in  Terrace  or 
nearby and travel daily to the work site.  A series of shallow bedrock trenches will provide fresh 
material for sampling and expose unweathered rock that will enable better evaluation of the 
mineral zone or zones.
There is no provision in this estimate for Phase 2 work nor for diamond drilling work of any 
kind but the latter option is, of course, available if dictated by results obtained in Phase 1.
Phase  1  work  will  include  further  grassroots  type  prospecting,  geological  reconnaissance, 
geochemical soil sampling, and trenching (contracted).  Four persons for one month.

17.2 ERIKA.OSTENSOE,P.Geo.
4306 West 3rd Avenue
Vancouver, B.C., V6R 1M7.
I, Erik A. Ostensoe, P. Geo., do hereby certify that:
1.
I am a consulting geologist.
2. 
I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Honours Geology from the University 
of British Columbia in 1960.  In addition, in 1966 I completed course requirements for a Master 
of Science degree in Geology at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario,
3. 
I  am  a  member  in  good  standing  of  the  Association  of  Professional  Engineers  and 
Geoscientists  of  the  Province  of  British  Columbia,  member  no.  18,727,  and  of  the  Northwest 
Territories and Nunavut Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists, licensee L1943.
I have worked as a geologist for more than forty-five years since my graduation from
4. 
university.
5. 
I have read the definition of "qualified person" set out in National Instrument 43-101 
("NI 43-101") and hereby certify that by reason of my education, affiliation with a professional 
association  (as  defined  in  NI  43-101)  and  past  relevant  work  experience,  I  fulfill  the 
requirements to be a "qualified person" for the purposes of NI 43-101.
6. 
I am responsible jointly with Garry Payie, P. Geo. for the preparation of all sections of 
the  Technical  Report  titled  “TECHNICAL  REPORT,  PITMAN  PROPERTY,  SKEENA  RIVER  AREA, 
OMINECA  MINING  DIVISION,  NORTHWESTERN  BRITISH  COLUMBIA,  CANADA”  dated  May  4, 
2011  and  revised  May  4,  2011. 
I  examined  parts  of  the  Casa  Minerals  Inc.  mineral  tenures 
located east of Skeena River on July 25 and October 5, 2008 and parts of the mineral tenures 
located west of Skeena River on October 6, 2008 and I worked on the WoMo prospect part of 
the tenures in the period July 17 through 22, 2010.
7. 
I have not had prior involvement with the Terrace, B. C. area mineral properties that are 
the  subject  of  the  Technical  Report  and  I  do  not  own  any  mineral  tenures  in  the  Omineca 
Mining Division of British Columbia.  I am a Director and shareholder of Casa Minerals Inc. and 
as such am not at arm’s length from that Company.  I was engaged by Metron Capital Corp. to 
assist Garry Payie, P. Geo. in preparing the accompanying technical report and I will receive a 
professional  fee  for  geological  services  in  accordance  with  mineral  exploration  industry 
practices.
I  am  not  aware  of  any  material  fact  or  material  change  with  respect  to  the  subject 
8. 
matter  of  the  Technical  Report  that  is  not  reflected  in  the  Technical  Report,  the  omission  to 
disclose which makes the Technical Report misleading.
I  am  not,  due  to being a  Director  of Casa Minerals  Inc.,  fully  independent of  Metron
9. 
Capital Corp. the issuer, applying all of the tests of section 1.5 of National Instrument 43-101
Casa Minerals Inc. – Pitman Projects
Page 48 of 92
I have read National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1, and the Technical Report
10. 
has been prepared in compliance with that instrument and form.
11. 
I  consent  to  the  filing  of  the  Technical  Report  with  any  stock  exchange  and  other 
regulatory authority and any publication by them for regulatory purposes, including electronic 
publication  in  the  public  company  files  on  their  websites  accessible  by  the  public,  of  the
