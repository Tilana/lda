Raw coal and salable coal production of Ordos Neng Hua decreased as compared with that of the first half of 2015 due to active maintenance
and production reduction activities of coal mines belonging to Ordos Neng Hua in responses to the national policies of industrial production

(II)
MAJOR RISKS FACED BY THE COMPANY, IMPACT AND MEASURES
Risks arising from macro-economy
The world economy is still weak in recovery and structural contradiction of domestic market is prominent. Thus the macro-economy’s continuous
downturn pressure remains high. The coal market presents recovery as a result of coal production capacity reduction policy formulated by state
government. However, the foundation is still unstable, fluctuation risk still exists.
Counter measures: The Group grasps state policy orientation, optimizes and adjusts structures in regions, industries, products and investment to
promote transformation from high-carbon industry to low-carbon industry, from traditional industry to new type of traditional industry, to emerging
industry with high efficiency and thus adapts new normal in development. The Group sticks to the “Two Engines” strategy and strengthens
coordinated development of entity, finance and trade industry, promotes the company to achieve transformation to innovation-driven, quality and
profitability and connotative development to unleash innovation and profitability vigor in a maximum way. The Group lays emphasis on taking
advantage of the two markets at home and abroad and pluralistic industry and products to enhance mastery and initiative of responding to market
fluctuation
Risks arising from safety production
Although the entire management level of safety production is above the industry average, coal mining, coal chemical and power generation, the
three main business sectors of the Company are of high hazardous nature and of complex uncertainties caused by production environment,
natural disaster, etc.. Safety production is significant to the sustainable and stable development of the Company.
Yanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited  Interim Report 2016      31
CHAPTER 4 BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT – CONTINUED
Counter measures: The Group stringently enhances implementation of safety responsibility at all levels, intensifies regulation execution process
assessment and supervision on key positions. Strengthens technical management and input in safety to promote systematic safety assurance
level. The Group reinforces construction of safety supervision team, devotes great effort to safety supervision inspection and executes safety
responsibility accountability system in a strict way; increases comprehensive management and pre-control in key areas and significant hidden
dangers, prevents occurrence of significant safety accidents to ensure safety production of the company.
Risks arising from trade business
In recent years, the Group’s trade volume has continuously presented substantial growth. Affected by the market demand change and price
fluctuation, trade profitability is relatively low. Moreover, with the unceasing development of diversified trade projects of the Company, business
staff are not familiar with the new trade mode and incompetent to catch up with the fast pace of trade work.
Counter measures: The Group focuses on both social recruitment and self training and expedites the construction and cultivation for
professional team in terms of trade business, legal affairs and risk control to improve specialized operation capability. The Group reinforces the
risk management and control on procedures of trade service, contract, fund approval, etc., formulates unified standard for trade contracts and
promotes the institutionalization, standardization and normalization management on trade work to avoid trade risks to the greatest extent.
Risks arising from accounts receivable
In recent years, the accounts receivable of the Company keep increasing tendency. The decelerated macro economic growth and declined
operating performance of some customers results in the ability to repay debts decreased and turnover time prolonged, which increases the
difficulty in the collection of accounts receivable.
Counter measures: The Group strictly examines and approves the credit line and term of customers, ensure the matching guarantee or pledge
provided by credit-granting customers to control the accounts receivable effectively and cut down occupying funds. The Group pays more
attention to clearing up the debts repayment of accounts receivable and strictly put the responsibility investigation into practice. The Group
strengthens the prevention and control to risk sources and improves dynamic supervisory mechanism to reduce the risk of accounts receivable
effectively.
Risks arising from project implementation
The construction projects of the Group cover wide areas with a great investment amount. Several projects have more difficulties in obtaining
approval. We face the risk in approval and long construction cycle.
Counter measures: The Group sets up a work team regarding projects procedure, formulates time schedule for procedures of these construction
projects and accelerates progress of procedures to ensure smooth construction of these projects. The Group strictly carries out three controls,
namely: investment control, time schedule control and quality control, implements responsibility appraisal of main construction player and main
operator in a stringent manner to ensure the commercial production on schedule and the achievement in the anticipated income of the projects.

EARNINGS/(LOSS) PER SHARE AND PER ADS
The calculation of the earnings/(loss) per share attributable to equity holders of the Company for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June
30, 2015 is based on the profit for the period of RMB375,236,000 and loss for the period of RMB50,626,000 and on the weighted average
4,912,016,000 shares in issue during the period excluding the ordinary shares repurchased and held as treasury shares and 4,918,400,000 shares
in issue during the period ended June 30, 2015 respectively.
The earnings per ADS have been calculated based on the profit for the relevant periods and on one ADS, being equivalent to 10 H shares.
On December 31, 2014, the Company’s subsidiary issued subordinated capital notes. Noteholders will be permitted to convert the subordinated
capital notes into 1,000 Yancoal Australia Limited ordinary shares.
Diluted earnings/(loss) per share for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is the same as the basic earnings/ (loss) share as there is no
dilutive effect of subordinated capital notes on potential ordinary shares outstanding.

FAIR VALUES
The fair value of available-for-sales investment is determined with reference to quoted market price. The fair values of the forward foreign
exchange contracts are estimated based on the discounted cash flows between the contract forward rate and spot forward rate. The fair value of
other financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow
analysis.
The directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortized cost in the consolidated
financial statements approximate their fair values.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
The following table presents the carrying value of financial instruments measured at fair value across the three levels of the fair value hierarchy.
The levels of fair value are defined as follows:
Level 1:   
Level 2:
Level 3:
fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on
observable market data (unobservable inputs).
