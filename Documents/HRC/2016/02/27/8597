<p><b>I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context undertook 
an official visit to the World Bank Group from 26 October to 1 November 2010. She 
wishes to express her sincere gratitude to the President of the World Bank Group for the 
invitation, the constructive dialogue and the support of the World Bank staff throughout the 
visit.  
</p>
<p>2. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with staff of the World Bank and the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC) working in different sectors and regions, as well as 
with members of its Board. She also met with the secretariat of the Inspection Panel and 
with officials of the Independent Evaluation Group. The visit was preceded by 
consultations with non-governmental organizations and independent experts. 
</p>
<p>3. The main purpose of the mission was to explore the relation between the policies 
and projects supported by the World Bank Group and the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>4. In this context, the Special Rapporteur analysed the relationship between these 
policies, projects and the obligation of the borrowers (States or private institutions) in terms 
of the right to adequate housing as defined in international law. In particular, the Special 
Rapporteur considered the role played by the World Bank in supporting the States to 
progressively realize the right to adequate housing, acknowledging that the institution&#8217;s 
developmental mandate is implemented on the basis of the borrower&#8217;s ownership of any 
World Bank-financed project or programme. The Special Rapporteur also looked at the 
possible negative impacts of these policies and projects from a right to adequate housing 
perspective. Finally, the Special Rapporteur assessed to what extent the World Bank Group, 
as an international legal personality, is bound by international human rights law, and the 
consequences arising from this. 
</p>
<p>5. The right to adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of 
living is recognized in various international human rights instruments, including the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 11).1 As interpreted 
by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, &#8220;the right to housing should 
not be interpreted in a narrow or restrictive sense which equates it with, for example, the 
shelter provided by merely having a roof over one&#8217;s head or views shelter exclusively as a 
commodity. Rather it should be seen as the right to live somewhere in security, peace and 
dignity&#8221;.2 In line with this interpretation, &#8220;adequacy&#8221; is measured against a list of key 
factors including: legal security of tenure; availability of services, materials, facilities and 
infrastructure; affordability; habitability; accessibility; location; and cultural adequacy.3

</p>
<p><b> II. The right to adequate housing and the housing, shelter and 
urban policies promoted by the World Bank Group 
</b></p>
<p>6. In the 1970s, the World Bank started to become active in the housing sector, 
focusing its action mostly on financing the upgrading of slums and on providing site-and-
services projects in cities of middle and low income. In the 1980s, this approach lost ground 
to policy-based loans focusing mainly on reforming housing market and housing finance. 
As a result, in the 1990s the World Bank mainly promoted an &#8220;enabling markets&#8221; approach 
to housing. This approach was aligned to the prevalent paradigm of the decade and namely, 
the promotion of macroeconomic policies through structural-adjustment loans. The World 
Bank has explained that this development had resulted from the institution&#8217;s understanding 
that simple upgrading policies could not have far-reaching sustainable impact if the urban 
poor did not have enough jobs, income and purchasing power, or if the urban governments 
did not address the broader policy and regulatory issues that impacted land and housing 
availability in the first place. The World Bank has described the reforms under this 
approach as focusing on such issues as &#8220;securing land property rights, providing access and 
cost recovery for infrastructure, and improving the balance sheets of housing institutions. 
&#8230; The hope has been that pushing this and other aspects of the formal sector housing 
systems &#8220;down market&#8221;, eventually would reach lower income households&#8221;.4  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the recent assessment of the World Bank on these 
policies, which acknowledges that: 
</p>
<p>despite some successes, affordability problems persist and informality in the housing 
and land sectors abounds. By [around 2005], it became clear that the enabling-
markets approach was &#8216;far too sanguine&#8217; about the difficulties of creating well 
functioning housing markets where everyone is adequately housed at a reasonable 
share of income on residential land available at a reasonable price. The general 
principles of enabling markets&#8230;must be combined with sensible policies and 
pragmatic approaches to urban planning and targeted subsidies for the urban poor.5  
</p>
<p>8. In this context, the Special Rapporteur also welcomes the November 2009 World 
Bank Urban and Local Government Strategy. This new strategy consolidates the previous 
assessment made in the framework of the pro-poor macroeconomic development World 
Bank strategy reinforced in the last decade and it marks again a shift in the approach of the 
institution towards housing and urbanization. This new strategy recognizes the need for 
investing public money on housing, the need for interventions to overcome market failures6 
and it is open to different approaches in housing policies, including rental housing schemes. 
It also recognizes the need for a national housing policy &#8211; departing from the radical 
decentralization approach that the World Bank supported in the past. Finally, this new 
strategy recognizes that urbanization is not only inevitable, it is also a support of economic 
growth and poverty reduction.7 
</p>
<p>9. Notwithstanding this positive development, the Special Rapporteur believes that 
there are important challenges which are not adequately addressed in the new sector

<p>strategy of the World Bank, in particular regarding access to land and land management. 
The institution has to address these challenges in order to implement its new strategy on the 
ground.  
</p>
<p>10. The World Bank has acknowledged that one of the main challenges of successful 
and up-scale slum upgrading and pro-poor operations is access to land, which is deeply 
affected by its complex &#8220;political economy&#8221; within cities.8 A human rights-based approach 
to housing can help to face this challenge by understanding housing as an inherent social 
value, beyond its market and financial value. The World Bank has recognized that it is 
impossible to reach the poor and the most vulnerable groups and individuals by mobilizing 
only the private market housing supply. However, the World Bank has not recognized that 
neither can the poor be reached by relying only on the market land supply. In other words, 
from a human rights perspective, the land component of housing should also been seen as a 
public good. 
</p>
<p>11. For decades, the World Bank has promoted land policies aimed mostly at formalizing 
land titling, based on and supported by private ownership tenure systems. The experience of 
the World Bank has shown the complexity of implementing these programmes which, aligned 
with the general approach of &#8220;enabling markets&#8221; and &#8220;unlocking land values&#8221;, were directed 
more at opening urban land markets to globalized housing finance than at securing land tenure 
for the poor. Some projects implemented under this framework (including one which was 
submitted to the Inspection Panel in 2009)9 have contributed to raising the vulnerability of the 
poor, particularly by exposing them to forced evictions.  
</p>
<p>12. From a right to adequate housing perspective, and in order to reach the poor, 
security of tenure for the most vulnerable sectors of the society should be promoted by the 
World Bank through its projects and policies, recognizing and mobilizing different tenure 
and titles systems, including collective ones. In this context, the Special Rapporteur has 
been informed of an important initiative undertaken by the World Bank to support in 
different cities the granting an informal/interim form of tenure security through street 
addressing projects in urban neighbourhoods.  
</p>
<p>13. Finally, the Special Rapporteur would like to underline that in the 1990s, through 
policy-based loans, the World Bank had in many countries promoted reforms of housing 
policies. While in a large number of countries this has been translated into the 
establishment of a mortgage market accessible to sectors of the population who had never 
before accessed credit, this kind of mortgage credit has not benefitted the lowest income 
populations. Furthermore, these policies also led to an increase in the prices of urban land 
and therefore created significant problems of affordability even for the middle classes. 
These strategies have also increased the &#8220;peripheralization&#8221; and have promoted urban 
sprawl in a process that contradicts the model proposed by the new World Bank urban 
strategy to promote a sustainable urban environment.10

<p><b> III. The right to adequate housing and the safeguards and 
sustainability policies of the World Bank Group 
</b></p>
<p>14. Beside the housing and urban policies promoted by the World Bank Group and 
embedded in its projects, the Special Rapporteur also considered the relationship between

</p>
<p>specific projects supported by the Group and the right to adequate housing. In this 
framework, the Special Rapporteur paid particular attention to the safeguards and policies 
put in place by the Group to address the social and environmental impacts of the projects it 
finances &#8211; the &#8220;do no harm&#8221; policies.  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur believes that the safeguards developed by the World Bank, 
in particular the safeguards on involuntary resettlements, as well as the sustainability 
policies developed by IFC (particularly the Policy and Performance Standards on Social 
and Environmental Sustainability, as well as the Performance Standard on Land 
Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) can be important tools for seeking to ensure the 
respect of the right to adequate housing. These safeguards and policies contain de facto 
elements of human rights, but there are significant differences regarding the contents and 
procedures.11 The Special Rapporteur recommends that the World Bank Group use the 
current process of revision of both the World Bank and IFC safeguards and policies12 as an 
opportunity to reframe them from a human rights perspective and in accordance with 
current human rights standards. In this context the Special Rapporteur wishes to restate her 
willingness to actively collaborate with the World Bank Group. 
</p>
<p>16. With regard to the World Bank safeguards, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that 
while they cover in detail the issue of involuntary resettlement, they ignore other possible 
social impacts concerning housing which are therefore not adequately addressed by the 
institution.13  
</p>
<p>17. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that while development policy 
loans represent in an average year about 25-30 per cent of the World Bank portfolio,14 it is 
unclear how exactly the social impact of these loans is taken into account by the institution, 
despite the fact that it is required to assess possible distributional and social impacts of 
policies supported by development policy loans. Finally, with regard to the emergency 
loans established in cases of post-disaster reconstruction &#8211; which also represent an 
increasing share in the World Bank portfolio &#8211; the Special Rapporteur understands that the 
safeguards are applicable, but in a later stage, namely, in the preparation of the post-project 
phase. Issues related to land tenure systems and access to land are key elements in the 
reconstruction phase and can lead to increased vulnerability and exposure to housing rights 
violations if not addressed at an early stage. In this context, the Special Rapporteur believes 
that it is crucial to recognize the need to act promptly and to undertake a mapping of 
property and a land tenure analysis in order to then be able to adequately apply the 
safeguards and design proper reconstruction projects. These actions should take place 
immediately after the emergency phase and while preparing a social assessment. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the broader scope of the IFC sustainability policy 
and performance standards as it covers a wider range of the social impacts that projects can

 14 The World Bank informed the Special Rapporteur that this proportion has been stable over the last 
</p>
<p>decade. During the financial crisis that began in 2008, the share of development policy operations in 
total World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)/ International 
Development Association) financing rose from 29 per cent during the fiscal years 2005-2007 to 37 
per cent in the fiscal years 2008-2010, while IBRD financing through development policy operations 
rose sharply, reaching 47 per cent in the fiscal year 2010. </p>

<p>have on housing. However, she noted with concern that there is an ongoing trend at IFC to 
work with intermediaries&#8217; financial institutions and that in this framework the IFC policies 
and performance standards are not fully applied. In these cases, IFC only requires the 
intermediaries to have a management system in accordance with the IFC standards as far as 
corporate good governance is concerned and this is supervised only on a sample, not 
project-by-project, basis. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> IV. Accountability mechanism 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur believes that the establishment of accountability 
mechanisms such as the World Bank Inspection Panel and the IFC Multilateral Investment 
Guarantee Agency (MIGA) Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman have been helpful to 
indirectly scrutinize the impact of the World Bank Group projects on human rights, 
including the right to adequate housing, and to hold the Group accountable. However, both 
the Inspection Panel and the IFC/MIGA Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman have been 
mandated to investigate only situations related to the alleged incompliance by the World 
Bank or the IFC/MIGA with their own respective policies and procedures, thus a large 
number of projects cannot be investigated by those particular mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>20. Most of the complaints received by these mechanisms are linked to human rights 
issues, but due to their limited &#8220;jurisdiction&#8221; they cannot address the full spectrum of 
human rights problems that can be generated by a World Bank Group project. Finally, even 
with limited development on this issue, it is still unclear whether and to what extent these 
mechanisms could refer to international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>21. Although the findings of these mechanisms are not legally binding, the Special 
Rapporteur appreciates their positive impact on the creation of incentives for the World 
Bank Group staff to properly implement their &#8220;do no harm&#8221; policies and procedures, as 
well as on the influences on projects similar to those subject to a request for inspection.15   
</p>
<p>22. As a complement to these mechanisms, and in order to strengthen the accountability 
of the World Bank Group and to integrate the affected communities in the process of 
settlements of disputes generated by projects financed by the Group, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Group consider establishing, at the local level, mechanisms of 
mediation and grievance redress independent both from the borrower and the World Bank 
Group. 
</p>
<p>23. Finally, the World Bank Group, besides lending to States and private sectors, has 
also provided non-lending analytical and advisory services and has been a knowledge-
disseminating institution throughout the world, especially on public policies. This role was 
particularly important during the Washington Consensus period and it had a great impact on 
the policy reforms undertaken during the 1980s and 1990s. In the current new context, the 
World Bank Group should as a matter of priority acknowledge the perverse effects of the 
policies promoted in the 1980s and 1990s (especially on the most poor and vulnerable), 
provide the countries concerned with support to mitigate those effects and include human 
rights when designing its new policies.
