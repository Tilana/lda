<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
conducted a country visit to Latvia from 25 to 31 October 2008 during which she met with 
government officials and representatives of non-governmental organizations, and visited centres 
engaged in protecting the rights of the child. 
</p>
<p> The purpose of the visit was to explore the incidence of the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography in Latvia as well as to examine and assess the system of child 
protection more generally, including the availability of specific measures designed to protect 
child victims of sale or sexual exploitation, such as rehabilitation and social reintegration. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur observes that significant efforts have been made at the legislative 
and policy levels in the area of protecting the rights of the child. The number of reported cases of 
child prostitution and trafficking of children for sexual purposes is low. However, all actors with 
whom the Special Rapporteur met were of the view that child pornography, mainly via the 
Internet, was on the rise. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that vigilance is required and 
that efforts should be concentrated on prevention, including the provision of adequate training 
and sufficient human and financial resources, to ensure effective measures to protect children 
and prevent violations. 
</p>
<p> An increasing number of families in difficulty are incapable of protecting their children. 
Difficulties are mainly financial, or alcohol- or abuse-related. Coupled with the proliferation of 
tourism, easy accessibility of new methods of information technology by children, increasing 
demand in the sex industry and the establishment of increasingly structured trafficking networks, 
children are increasingly vulnerable to risk of abuse, violence and exploitation. The Special 
Rapporteur recalls the importance of a holistic approach to the fundamental rights of children, 
paving the way for the implementation of social policies which favour children, youth and the 
family. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, 
Najat M&#8217;jid Maalla, undertook a visit to Latvia from 25 to 31 October 2008 at the invitation of 
the Government of Latvia. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur warmly thanks the Government of Latvia for its hospitality and 
collaboration in facilitating meetings with officials from various branches of the Government. 
She welcomes the openness and frankness with which the authorities discussed issues 
concerning the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography and the child protection 
system more generally. She also thanks the Government for its cooperation prior to, during and 
following the visit. 
</p>
<p>3. In Riga, the Special Rapporteur met with representatives of the Ministries of Foreign 
Affairs, of Welfare, of Education and Science, of the Interior (including the Office of Citizenship 
and Migration and the State Police), of Justice, and of Children, Family and Integration Affairs.<b>1</b> 
The Special Rapporteur also met with the State Inspectorate for the Protection of Children&#8217;s 
Rights, with the Ombudsman and representatives of the Children&#8217;s Rights Department of the 
Office of the Ombudsman and with members of the Parliamentary Subcommittee on Human 
Rights and Social Affairs, and visited the border control post with Belarus in Silenes, the 
Minor&#8217;s Police Unit in Riga and the I&#316;&#291;uciems Prison for women and girls in Riga. She also met 
with a senior official from the International Organization for Migration. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur also met with various non-governmental organizations dealing 
with violence against children and visited seven centres and institutions dealing with protection 
of the rights of the child in Riga, the Tukums region and in Daugavpils, and met with members 
of the local press (Latvian- and Russian-speaking). 
</p>
<p>5. In her report to the ninth session of the Human Rights Council, in September 2008 
(A/HRC/9/21), the Special Rapporteur identified the following objectives of her mandate: 
 (a) A better understanding of the situation of the sale of children, child prostitution and 
child pornography and of contributing factors (socio-economic, cultural and environmental); 
</p>
<p> (b) Implementation of a comprehensive child protection system that ensures the best 
interest of the child and encompasses prevention and care as well as medical, psychological, 
social and legal support for child victims, rehabilitation, social reintegration of children and 
promotion of the rights of the child; 
</p>
<p> (c) Effective and concerted local, national, regional and international coordination and 
cooperation. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  As of 1 January 2009, the Ministry of Children and Family Affairs took over the Secretariat of 
</p>
<p>the Special Assignments Minister for Social Integration, establishing the Ministry of Children, 
Family and Integration Affairs. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.1 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>6. With this in mind, the objective of the visit was to explore the incidence of the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography in Latvia and to seek information on issues 
such as online child pornography, illegal adoptions and possible cases of transfer or sale of the 
organs of children. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s objective was also to examine and assess the 
system of child protection more generally, including the availability of specific measures 
designed to protect child victims of sale or sexual exploitation, such as rehabilitation and social 
reintegration. To these ends, the Special Rapporteur met with a range of governmental and 
non-governmental authorities, which enabled her to obtain information and share her thoughts 
and ideas with representatives from various segments of the child protection system. 
</p>
<p>7. Throughout the visit, the Special Rapporteur consistently sought the views of interlocutors 
on what could be improved in the system, so that she could prepare conclusions and 
recommendations that were targeted and useful and that would ultimately be &#8220;owned&#8221; by the 
main stakeholders themselves. 
</p>
<p>8. At the close of the visit, the Special Rapporteur shared her preliminary thoughts and 
observations with the Government. 
</p>
<p>9. In preparation of her mission and her report, the Special Rapporteur consulted material 
from United Nations sources, such as the latest concluding observations of the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child (CRC/C/LVA/CO/2), Latvia&#8217;s second periodic report to the Committee 
(CRC/C/83/Add.16) as well as Latvia&#8217;s response to the questionnaire on the United Nations 
Study on Violence against Children. The Special Rapporteur also consulted various reports of 
non-governmental organizations. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Latvia for 
its initiative and cooperation in providing information prior to, during and following the mission 
at the request of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur would like to stress at the outset, echoing the frequent statements 
of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the importance of adopting a holistic approach to 
addressing the root causes, such as poverty and underdevelopment, that contribute to the 
vulnerability of children to sale, prostitution, pornography and sex tourism. This includes paying 
particular attention to the protection of children who are especially vulnerable to these practices, 
such as children in street situations, children from dysfunctioning families, children belonging to 
minorities, migrant children, children living in remote areas and those living in poverty. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  GENERAL BACKGROUND/CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  History 
</b></p>
<p>11. Latvia regained its independence in 1991, at which time it re-established international 
diplomatic ties and joined the United Nations. Its capital, Riga, is the largest of the cities in the 
three Baltic States. Ethnically, the population of 2.2 million is approximately 59 per cent of 
Latvian origin and 27.7 per cent of Russian descent. It is a parliamentary republic, with a 
Head of State, Head of Government and unicameral legislature (the Saeima), and is composed 
of 109 local municipalities and 9 republican cities. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/23/Add.1 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>12. Latvia joined the European Union in 2004, at which time economic emigration increased 
considerably. It is a member of the Council of Baltic Sea States and held the presidency 
from 2007 to 2008. The Council has a Working Group for Cooperation on Children at Risk. 
</p>
<p>13. The recent global financial crisis was cited by all interlocutors as having had an impact on 
most aspects of Latvian society, including the availability of funding for social programmes and 
implementation of policies. In early 2009, Valdis Dombrovskis and his five-party coalition 
became the third Government in 15 months in Latvia. The Government of former Prime Minister 
Ivars Godmanis had resigned amid tensions triggered by the economic crisis. Unemployment 
reached 9.5 per cent in February 2009. The Special Rapporteur received reports that 10 per cent 
of each ministry&#8217;s budget was recently cut. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  International and regional legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>14. Latvia is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (hereinafter 
&#8220;the Optional Protocol&#8221;). It is not a party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and 
has only signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>15. Latvia is party to the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime and 
the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and 
Children, supplementing the Convention (Palermo Protocol), acceded to ILO Convention 
No. 182 concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst 
Forms of Child Labour in 2001 and ILO Convention No. 138 concerning the Minimum Age for 
Admission to Employment. Latvia has also ratified the 1993 Hague Convention on the 
Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. 
</p>
<p>16. At the regional level, Latvia ratified the European Convention on Human Rights, the 
Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings in 2008 and the 
Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime in 2007, but has not ratified the Council of Europe 
Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse. Latvia 
has also acceded to the Convention on the Establishment of the European Police Office (the 
Europol Convention). 
</p>
<p>17. Latvia adopted the Stockholm Declaration and Agenda for Action adopted at the World 
Congress against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in 1996 and reaffirmed its 
commitment at the Yokohama conference in 2001. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.1

</p>
<p><b>III.  SITUATION ANALYSIS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Scope of the sale of children, child prostitution 
and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur observes that State agencies, parliamentarians and 
non-governmental organizations in Latvia alike are all deeply concerned with the phenomenon 
of child sexual exploitation. She notes a low number of cases reported by child protection 
authorities and the media of child victims of prostitution, or trafficking of children for purposes 
of sexual exploitation. She received no reports of illegal adoptions or of transfers of children&#8217;s 
organs. 
</p>
<p>19. According to the Ministry of Justice, between 2005 and 2007, no persons were convicted 
of the offences of compelling a minor to engage in prostitution, compelling a juvenile to engage 
in prostitution, or unlawful act in handling adoptions. 
</p>
<p>20. Regarding the offence of trafficking with respect to a minor (section 154,<b>1</b> paragraphs 2 
and 3 of the Criminal Law), the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that, according to 
the Latvian Court Information System, one person in 2005 and seven persons in 2007 were 
convicted under that section. However, the Ministry of Justice informed the Special Rapporteur 
that it does not possess any information on whether those persons were convicted for an offence 
with respect to a minor or a juvenile. 
21. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that in 2008, no persons were convicted 
of criminal offences committed against children falling within the terms of reference of the 
Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>22. On the other hand, according to the Ministry of Justice, one person was convicted of 
procuring or using a juvenile in the production (manufacturing) of pornographic or erotic 
materials in 2005 and one in 2007 (no convictions in 2006 or 2008). In both instances, the 
penalty was a suspended sentence. 
</p>
<p>23. The Anti-Trafficking Unit of the State Police provided the Special Rapporteur 
with statistics on human trafficking, including of children (in the sense of section 154<b>1 </b> 
of the Criminal Law<b>2</b>), and on violations of provisions regarding pornography 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  Paragraph 2 of section 154<b>1</b> stipulates that for a person who commits human trafficking with 
</p>
<p>respect to a minor, the applicable sentence is deprivation of liberty for a term of not less than 
5 years and not exceeding 12 years, with confiscation of property. &#8220;Human trafficking&#8221; is 
defined in section 154<b>2</b> as follows, and incorporates the definition contained in the Palermo 
Protocol: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;(1) Human trafficking is the recruitment, conveyance, transfer, concealment or reception of 
persons for the purpose of exploitation, committed by using violence or threats or by means of 
fraud, or by taking advantage of the dependence of the person of the offender or of his or her 
state of helplessness, or by the giving or obtaining of material benefits or benefits of another 
nature in order to procure the consent of such person, upon which the victim is dependent. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/23/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>(section 166 of the Criminal Law). The number of cases of trafficking of children for 
purposes of sexual exploitation between 2004 and 2008 is shown below: 
</p>
<p>2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 
1 criminal 
procedure; 
1 minor victim 
</p>
<p>0 3 criminal 
procedures; 
3 minor victims 
</p>
<p>2 criminal cases; 
5 minor victims 
</p>
<p>2 criminal cases; 
4 minor victims 
</p>
<p>In the cases in 2007, there was no <i>corpus delicti</i>. The 2008 cases are ongoing. 
</p>
<p>24. On the other hand, there has been a sharp increase in cases of violations of provisions 
regarding pornography falling under section 166 (4) of the Criminal Law on the Violation of 
Provisions Regarding Importation, Production and Distribution of Pornographic or Erotic 
Materials. The Government provided information indicating that the sharp increase was due to 
the fact that in December 2007 section 166 was amended by the addition of a provision 
stipulating that if the acts provided for in paragraphs 3 and 4 are committed by an organized 
group, the applicable sentence is deprivation of liberty for a term of not less than 5 years and not 
exceeding 15 years, with confiscation of property and with police supervision for a term not 
exceeding three years. The number of such cases is shown below: 
</p>
<p>2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 
1 3 6 4 48 
</p>
<p>25. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur observes that the low number of reported cases of the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography does not necessarily reflect the actual 
scope of the phenomena. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur remarks that the system of 
standardized information-gathering and recording needs to be strengthened. She also observes 
that the low number of reported cases may also be a result of the small number of children who 
address their cases to the authorities, out of fear or shame. Similarly, the Special Rapporteur 
warns that a low rate of convictions does not necessarily reflect the scope or incidence of these 
acts. 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>&#8220;(2) The recruitment, conveyance, transfer, concealment or reception of minor persons for the 
purpose of exploitation shall be recognized as human trafficking also in such cases, if it is not 
connected with the utilization of any of the means referred to in Paragraph one of this Section. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;(3) Within the meaning of this Section, exploitation is the involvement of a person in 
prostitution or in other kinds of sexual exploitation, the compulsion of a person to perform 
activities or to provide services, the holding of a person in slavery or other similar forms thereof 
(debt slavery, serfdom or the compulsory transfer of a person into dependence upon another 
person), and the holding a person in servitude or the unlawful removal of a person&#8217;s tissues or 
organs.&#8221; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.1 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>26. In fact, all interlocutors agreed that the phenomena of child pornography and child sex 
tourism were on the rise. Abusers, paedophiles and sex tourists are increasingly using various 
methods to attract children, mainly through the Internet. Further, some interlocutors warned of 
the need to be prudent regarding increasing risks of trafficking in children due to Latvia&#8217;s 
accession to the Schengen area treaty. 
</p>
<p>27. Representatives of non-governmental organizations told of a troubling trend in the 
situation of children. While in the year 2000 problems were related to poverty and alcohol 
addiction, more recently the cases relate to children whose parents are unemployed; poverty has 
generally been on the rise. While many children still live at home, they spend a lot of their time 
in the streets, and the types of drugs consumed are stronger. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur observes on the basis of the information shared with her that an 
increasing number of families in difficulty are incapable of protecting their children. Difficulties 
are mainly financial, or alcohol- or abuse-related. As a result, children are increasingly 
vulnerable to the risk of abuse, violence and exploitation. 
</p>
<p>29. Regarding children being charged with or convicted of the aforementioned offences, 
in 2006, one minor was convicted of sending a person for sexual exploitation and of doing so 
as part of a group of persons, in violation of section 165<b>1</b> (2) of the Criminal Law. The minor 
was 16 years of age and was given a suspended sentence. 
</p>
<p>30. Between 2005 and 2008, no minors were convicted of the following offences: trafficking 
with respect to a minor; compelling a minor to engage in prostitution; compelling a juvenile to 
engage in prostitution; unlawful act in handling adoptions. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Legislation, institutional mechanisms, policies and programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Legislation 
</b></p>
<p>31. Latvia has undertaken numerous reforms to harmonize its domestic legislation with the 
international and regional instruments to which it is party. The Law on the Protection of the 
Rights of the Child defines a &#8220;child&#8221; as a person who has not attained 18 years of age. Article 51 
provides that &#8220;for violence against a child, encouraging or forcing a child to take part in sexual 
activities, exploitation or involvement of a child in prostitution, the persons at fault shall be held 
liable as prescribed by law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>32. The Criminal Law of Latvia provides for the crime of compelling a minor (person 
under 18 years of age) to engage in prostitution, imposing a penalty of a prison term of up 
to 6 years; for compelling a juvenile (person under 14 years of age), the penalty is a term 
of 5 to 12 years (sect. 164 (4)). 
</p>
<p>33. The age of criminal liability in Latvia is 14 years, and the age of sexual consent is 16 years. 
</p>
<p>34. Section 154<b>1</b> (2) provides that for a person who commits human trafficking with respect to 
a minor, the applicable sentence is from 5 to 12 years of deprivation of liberty, with confiscation 
of property. If it is committed with respect to a juvenile, the sentence is from 10 to 15 years of 
prison, with confiscation of property, and with or without police supervision for a term not 
exceeding three years. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/23/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>35. Section 165<b>1</b> of the Criminal Law prohibits sending a person for the purpose of sexual 
exploitation. 
</p>
<p>36. Article 50 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of the Child prohibits the 
involvement of a child in the manufacture, distribution and showing of materials of an erotic or 
pornographic nature. Amendments to the Law on the Protection of the Rights of the Child also 
prohibit the presence of children, without the written permission of an educational institution 
during school hours and between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. (if the local municipality has not determined 
stricter restrictions), in Internet caf&#233;s and other similar premises where payment for Internet and 
computer game services are provided. 
</p>
<p>37. Section 166 (3) of the Criminal Law provides that the procurement or use of minors in the 
production (manufacturing) of pornographic or erotic materials is punishable by a term of up to 
six years&#8217; imprisonment, or a fine not exceeding 80 times the minimum monthly wage. In the 
case of procuring or using juveniles, it is punishable by a term of 5 to 12 years (sect. 166 (4)). 
</p><p>38. The Special Rapporteur notes the definition of &#8220;child pornography&#8221; in article 1 (2) of the 
Law on the Restriction of Pornography, and is encouraged by the fact that the legal provisions 
also cover online child pornography. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that 
electronic communications vendors have the duty to inform users regarding the possibility of 
installing a content filter, which restricts access to material containing erotica and pornography, 
and to ensure the installation of such filters if the subscriber and the vendor have mutually so 
agreed. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that the State Police cooperate with Internet 
service providers and telecommunications companies in order to facilitate control of online child 
pornography. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur also notes that while there is no explicit, specific definition of 
&#8220;sale of children&#8221;, the actual offence is covered and regulated by several legal acts, in conformity 
with the Optional Protocol. The definition and prohibition of &#8220;sale of children&#8221; is covered under 
the following provisions of the Criminal Law: sections 154<b>1</b> and 154<b>2</b> on human trafficking, 
section 169<b>1</b> on unlawful acts in handling of adoptions, section 139 on unlawful removal of tissue 
and organs from a human being, as well as articles 15 and 51 (1) of the Law on the Protection of 
the Rights of the Child on protection from exploitation and protection from illegal activities, 
respectively. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur notes that Latvia&#8217;s State party report further to the Optional 
Protocol was due on 22 March 2008 but has yet to be submitted. She strongly encourages Latvia 
to submit its report as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>41. Article 9 (3) of the Optional Protocol deals with the obligations incumbent on States 
parties to take measures to ensure appropriate assistance to child victims, including their full 
social reintegration and their full physical and psychological recovery. Article 51 (2) of the Law 
on the Protection of the Rights of the Child provides that a child who is a victim of a criminal 
offence, exploitation, sexual abuse, violence, or any other unlawful, cruel or demeaning acts 
shall, in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Cabinet, be provided with emergency </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.1 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>assistance free of charge, in order that the child may regain physical and mental health and 
reintegrate into society. Such medical treatment and reintegration shall take place in an 
environment favourable to the health, self-esteem and honour of a child, carefully guarding the 
child&#8217;s intimate secrets. 
</p>
<p>42. Article 51 (3) of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of the Child furthermore imposes 
the duty on every person to inform the police or another competent institution regarding violence 
or any other criminal offence directed against a child. For failing to inform, the persons at fault 
shall be held liable as prescribed by law. 
</p>
<p>43. The Law on the Protection of the Rights of the Child sets out provisions regarding special 
institutions and resources to be allocated by the State to provide medical treatment and 
rehabilitation free of charge to child victims of violence. It is prohibited for a child victim of 
violence or other illegal act to be left without psychological or other form of care. Expenses are 
covered by the State and every municipality is responsible for enforcing the rights of children 
who have suffered from violence (art. 52). The Law on Social Services and Social Assistance 
provides in its article 7 that the State shall ensure the social rehabilitation of victims of 
trafficking in human beings. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur also received information regarding penalties imposed against 
minors who have violated the regulations on prostitution. The Regulations of the Cabinet of 
Ministers on the restriction of prostitution prohibit those under 18 years of age from engaging in 
prostitution. According to article 174 of the Latvian Administrative Violations Code, the penalty 
for minors who violate the Regulations is a fine in an amount ranging from LVL 250 to 
LVL 500. Article 12 of the Latvian Administrative Violations Code provides for the application 
of compulsory measures of a correctional nature to minors between 14 and 18 (this is also 
provided for in section 66 of the Criminal Law); they may also be applied to minors between 11 
and 14 who have committed a violation regarding which administrative liability has been 
provided for in the law. Section 65 of the Criminal Law outlines the rules for the application of 
punishment against minors. 
</p>
<p>45. In view of the prohibition imposed on children engaging in prostitution and the penalties 
for violating that prohibition, the Special Rapporteur strongly insists that child victims of the 
offences covered by the Optional Protocol should not, as such, be either criminalized or 
penalized. Whether a person under 18 years of age consents to such activities (pornography or 
prostitution) is irrelevant. As the age of sexual consent is 16, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that Latvian law clearly stipulate that a child under 18 years of age is unable to 
consent to any form of sexual exploitation, including child pornography and child prostitution. 
Furthermore, all possible measures should be taken to avoid the stigmatization and social 
marginalization of such children. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has clearly and 
consistently maintained this position. 
</p>
<p>46. Regarding adoption, article 3 (5) of the Optional Protocol imposes the obligation on States 
parties to take all appropriate legal and administrative measures to ensure that all persons 
involved in the adoption of a child act in conformity with applicable international legal 
instruments. The Optional Protocol in fact provides that improperly inducing consent, as an 
intermediary, for the adoption of a child in violation of applicable international legal instruments 
on adoption constitutes sale of children. In this vein, the Special Rapporteur observes that </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/23/Add.1 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>section 169 of the Criminal Law of Latvia addresses buyers, sellers and intermediaries of illegal 
acts of adoption. The penalty for giving consent to the adoption of a minor for the purpose of 
acquiring property is deprivation of liberty for up to two years, or community service, or a fine 
not exceeding 40 times the minimum monthly wage. If a person asks consent for adoption 
personally, or does so as an intermediary, through the use of violence, threats, by means of fraud, 
bribes or other illegal means, as well as for intermediation, that person faces deprivation of 
liberty for up to four years or community service, or a fine not exceeding 80 times the minimum 
monthly wage, with or without confiscation of property. 
</p>
<p>47. The Law on Social Services and Social Assistance stipulates that family care should be 
primarily pursued involving a foster family or guardian, and only in the case of failure of such 
measures may the child be referred to continuous social care and a social rehabilitation 
institution. 
</p>
<p>48. Most interlocutors were nevertheless of the view that despite positive efforts made in terms 
of legal reform, implementation of such laws and regulations is the main challenge for Latvia. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>49. A number of Government ministries are responsible for various aspects of the child 
protection system of Latvia. More particularly, the issues of the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography, their underlying root causes and mechanisms to protect 
victims thereof are dealt with in various respects by several State or local institutions, including 
the Ministry for Children, Family and Integration Affairs (which supervises the State 
Inspectorate for the Protection of Children), the Ministry of Welfare, the Ministry of Education 
and Science, the State Police, the Minors&#8217; Police Unit and the Orphans&#8217; Courts. The Office of the 
Ombudsman (Children&#8217;s Rights Department) also plays a vital role. 
</p>
<p>50. The Ministry for Children and Family Affairs (the predecessor to the Ministry for 
Children, Family and Integration Affairs) was established in 2004. It coordinates the cooperation 
between State and local government institutions within the scope of their competence in 
protecting the rights of the child and family rights issues. In cooperation with the Ministries of 
Education and Science, the Interior, Justice, Welfare, Health and others, the Ministry for 
Children, Family and Integration Affairs formulates draft long-term State policy in the field of 
the protection of the rights of the child. It prepares the relevant reports to be submitted to the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child. It also supervises and manages methodologically the 
activities of the Orphans&#8217; Courts. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Ministry organizes 
annual training for heads of Orphans&#8217; Courts. Furthermore, the Government provided the Special 
Rapporteur with statistics regarding the number of inspections conducted in Orphans&#8217; Courts, 
noting that there is a constant increase in the number of consultations provided by the Ministry. 
The Special Rapporteur also observes the decreasing number of decisions of Orphans&#8217; Courts 
that have been appealed. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about information 
received from interlocutors about the lack of sufficiently clear guidelines and standards 
regarding the work of Orphans&#8217; Courts. 
</p>
<p>51. Some of the activities of the Ministry include providing financial support to municipalities 
for establishing centres and preschools; providing psychological consultation for families free of 
charge; developing programmes on Internet safety; awareness-raising on how to prevent </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.1 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>violence; provision of education for families; strengthening of training of police and social 
workers; and awareness-raising regarding the risks of pornography. One main activity 
undertaken is the dispatch of inspectors to Orphans&#8217; Courts, a function which used to be within 
the purview of the Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p>52. As a result of the recent financial crisis, 10 per cent of the Ministry&#8217;s budget was cut, but 
the Special Rapporteur was assured of the Ministry&#8217;s commitment to maintaining its 
programmes. For instance, while some inspectors are being regrouped by region, social services 
programmes such as benefits, alimony and social security were being maintained. 
</p>
<p>53. The State Inspectorate for Protection of Children&#8217;s Rights was established in 2005 under 
the Ministry for Children, Family and Integration Affairs to supervise and monitor compliance 
with regulations in the field of child rights protection. In its supervisory and monitoring capacity, 
it carries out inspections (in some cases planned visits, in others following complaints) in 
orphanages, boarding schools, schools and preschools, swimming pools, Internet cafes, gambling 
halls, nightclubs, summer camps, prisons, psychiatric hospitals and other places, and makes 
recommendations if an infringement is detected.  
</p>
<p>54. The State Inspectorate undertakes consultations, provides methodological assistance, 
interviews children to obtain their views and carries out awareness-raising. Inspectors have 
received legal, social and pedagogical training for 40 hours and receive special training once a 
month. There are 18 inspectors working throughout 4 regions of Latvia, but the Special 
Rapporteur was informed that this number would be reduced in 2009 due to financial constraints. 
The representatives of the State Inspectorate expressed their wish that more funding be allocated 
to the institution, particularly to increase the number of inspectors and social workers. They also 
indicated their desire to be given the possibility to provide more advice on the way in which 
child protection policy is being implemented. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur notes that the State Inspectorate cooperates with other ministries in 
order to do its work effectively. For instance, the Ministry of Education and Science reported 
that it actively cooperates with the State Inspectorate. 
</p>
<p>56. The availability to victims of complaints procedure mechanisms that are accessible and 
child-friendly is one of the main ways to protect child victims and, in some instances, to prevent 
violations. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the Children&#8217;s Hotline (8006008) 
that is supported by the State Inspectorate. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Hotline 
has been operational since 1 February 2006 and provides free of charge anonymous consultations 
for children in crisis situations and allows others as well to report violations of children&#8217;s rights. 
The reports are immediately forwarded by employees of the Hotline to State inspectors or to 
other responsible authorities, including the police. According to information received, girls are 
66.15 per cent of callers, and the age group 12-15 comprises 54.12 per cent of callers. The 
majority of issues raised relate to problems with friends or peers. Funding for the Children&#8217;s 
Hotline is mainly provided by the State budget, and it is currently operational from 8 a.m. 
to 11 p.m. on working days, 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturdays. Funding for the operation of the 
Hotline on Sundays is provided by private organizations. Interlocutors appeared to hail the 
Hotline as a successful operation, but again identified the need for continued funding. The 
Ombudsman&#8217;s Office also runs a free telephone hotline accessible to children. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/23/Add.1 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur also met with the Ombudsman and with representatives of the 
Children&#8217;s Rights Department of the Office of the Ombudsman. The Office of the Ombudsman 
replaced the Latvian National Human Rights Office in 2007. There is no specific Ombudsman 
for Children in Latvia. The Ombudsman informed the Special Rapporteur that while reported 
cases of child prostitution and child pornography are not widespread, the Office of the 
Ombudsman still reacts in individual cases. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Office of the 
Ombudsman to continue to act within its mandate to ensure that, even if cases are not 
widespread, action is taken. 
</p>
<p>58. The Ombudsman&#8217;s Office has the mandate to initiate a verification procedure, and has the 
right to enter premises at any time and without a special permit to visit closed-type institutions, 
to move freely within the institutions, to visit all premises and to meet in private the persons held 
in closed-type institutions. More specifically, the Ombudsman may hear the opinion of a child 
without the presence of his or her parents, guardians, or employees of educational or childcare 
and instructional institutions, if the child so wishes. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that the Office of the Ombudsman works in 
close cooperation with the State Inspectorate on elaborating legal provisions. The Office also 
refers certain complaints to the State Inspectorate because the latter can issue sanctions. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur visited and met with representatives of the Minors&#8217; Police Unit in 
Riga. The territory of Riga is subdivided into 15 sections. Fifty-seven police officers are 
assigned to the Minors&#8217; Unit. The police officers often pick up children who are &#8220;lost&#8221; in the 
streets, some between 14 and 16 years old, often from Afghanistan, Germany or Denmark. The 
Special Rapporteur was informed that, once children are in the Unit, they may remain there for 
anywhere from a few hours to five days. Efforts are made to place them in crisis centres as soon 
as possible, so that they may be cared for. However, there are reportedly insufficient places in 
existing crisis centres. If the child does not have any identity papers, the police check their 
existing database, or try to contact the parents; otherwise, they may contact immigration 
services. The police mentioned that in general, they believe what the child tells them. They 
cooperate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and consular offices in case of need and 
immigration/customs also have spaces to keep children if necessary. 
</p>
<p>61. Article 8 of the Optional Protocol deals with the protection of child victims of the practices 
prohibited under the Protocol throughout the entire criminal justice process. In particular, it 
requires that States parties, taking into account the principles of child participation and the best 
interests of the child, take measures which recognize both the special vulnerability of children 
who have been exposed to these crimes and their special needs as victims/witnesses. These 
measures may include the use of child-sensitive procedures, including interview rooms designed 
for children. The Special Rapporteur observed that there are special listening areas for children 
set aside in police stations. The Special Rapporteur also notes relevant provisions of the Criminal 
Procedure Law regarding special features of the examination of a minor (sect. 152) and 
examination of a minor with the intermediation of a psychologist (sect. 153). 
</p>
<p>62. The Ministry of Welfare, in particular the Social Affairs Department and the Social 
Rehabilitation Department, mostly provides financial support to the municipalities for social 
programmes. It organizes calls for tenders regarding particular activities and then selects the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.1 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>municipal institution or non-governmental organization. Some interlocutors observed that this 
financial scheme and the granting of tenders was based more on which organization could 
provide the cheapest, rather than the most effective service.  
</p>
<p>63. In 2006, the Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed concern about the lack of 
coordination between the various institutional mechanisms and entities to monitor 
implementation of the Convention throughout Latvia, including between the national and local 
levels.<b>3</b> During the visit, most interlocutors identified the need for improved coordination 
between ministries and for effective means of evaluating work and output.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  Policies and programmes 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur noted that governmental and non-governmental authorities alike 
have instituted a variety of programmes (in addition to those already mentioned above) designed 
to protect the rights of child victims of certain offences and in some cases to prevent violations, 
including child prostitution and child pornography.  
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur visited the I&#316;&#291;uciems Prison for women and girls and met with the 
heads of the Social Rehabilitation Department of the detention centre. The Special Rapporteur 
was impressed by the care and methodology employed by the caretakers at this centre. She 
witnessed a child-rights approach to the care, rehabilitation and follow-up of the girls. Social 
rehabilitation programmes implemented include programmes to encourage forward-looking 
thinking, and programmes to prepare the girls for discharge and reintegration in society by 
acquiring and developing basic skills. The Special Rapporteur was informed of the limited 
funding available for psychological, drug and addiction counselling for the girls, as most such 
expertise is currently being provided on a voluntary basis. As such, all the support programmes 
were implemented in this centre by the employees themselves without any additional financing, 
and there is no additional financing allocated for any such programmes in 2009.  
</p>
<p>66. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur was also informed of projected plans to open 
another detention centre for women and girls and encourages the Government of Latvia to ensure 
that funds are made available for such a programme, ensuring that a child-rights approach is 
integral to all implemented programmes. The Special Rapporteur also encourages the 
Government of Latvia to continue to explore alternatives to deprivation of liberty for children, 
including probation, mediation, community service or suspended sentences. In this regard, the 
Government provided information regarding a Concept on Policy of Criminal Penalties, adopted 
by the Cabinet of Ministers on 9 January 2009, which aims at applying alternative penalties to 
deprivation of liberty. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue such 
initiatives, all the while ensuring that a child rights-based approach is integrated in all cases 
where such policies are targeted at children. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur received information from the Ministry for Children and Family 
Affairs regarding efforts undertaken to decrease the number of children in childcare institutions 
and, overall, to decrease the number of institutions. She was informed of promising policies 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>undertaken to promote adoption and foster care, in particular favouring national over foreign 
adoptions since 2004. The number of foreign adoptions used to be three to four times more than 
national adoptions, whereas today, the number of national adoptions is almost double the number 
of foreign adoptions. The Government reported that at 31 December 2008, 1,351 adoptable 
children were registered in the database and 479 of them were already living in a family, 
leaving 872 (64.5 per cent) for whom adoptive families had to be found. In 2008, 73 children 
were taken into pre-adoption care in national adopters&#8217; families, which was 15 more than in 
</p><p>2007. Of the remaining adoptable children, the Government reported that 484 of them had a 
disability or serious health problem. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to 
pursue measures to encourage the adoption of children in these two categories, including 
psychological and financial support to adoptive families, medical and psychological follow-up 
and support of those children, as well as awareness-raising campaigns. In 2008, 83 foreign 
adopters were granted permission to adopt children from Latvia, 31 less than in 2007. The 
Minister reported that as of 2003, several legislative acts were passed in implementation of the 
1993 Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of 
Intercountry Adoption. The Minister added that procedures binding Orphans&#8217; Courts&#8217; decisions 
regarding adoptions are now more clearly prescribed. 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the resources available, both financial and 
human, to the State Inspectorate for Children&#8217;s Rights be strengthened and that the reaction time 
in following up on investigations be shortened.  
</p>
<p>69. Regarding trafficking, the Special Rapporteur was informed about the National 
Programme against Human Trafficking (2004-2008). The Government has also established an 
anti-trafficking working group that includes representation from Government and NGOs 
involved in anti-trafficking efforts. This working group developed programmes to increase 
public awareness of trafficking and to provide assistance to victims. The members include the 
Ministry of Welfare, the Ministry of Education and Science, the Ministry of Family and 
Children&#8217;s Affairs and the local police. The Special Rapporteur was informed of training 
seminars run by the Ministry of Education and Science for educators on how to recognize cases 
of trafficking or abuse, and on how to warn students of such dangers. 
</p>
<p>70. The Office of the Ombudsman organizes training courses and awareness-raising seminars 
for the individuals who sit on Orphans&#8217; Courts. The Ombudsman admitted that often authorities 
such as the police are not sufficiently experienced or trained in detecting child pornography, and 
would require human rights training in general. This concern was echoed by officials at the 
Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p>71. One concern is that while there are awareness-raising initiatives about the rights of the 
child, such programmes are often not targeted at the children themselves, thereby potentially 
decreasing their impact. Article 9 (2) of the Optional Protocol provides that States parties shall 
encourage the participation of the community and, in particular, children and child victims in 
such information and education and training programmes, including at the international level.  
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur stresses the importance to be placed on the availability of recovery 
and rehabilitation services for child victims of the relevant offences, to ensure their full social 
reintegration and their full physical and psychological recovery, further to article 9, paragraph 3, 
of the Optional Protocol. Such measures should also be accessible and should reach all children </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.1 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>throughout the country. Furthermore, so that services can be useful and effective, the persons 
who work with victims must be equipped with the necessary legal and psychological training to 
be able to deal with the very delicate issues involved in their rehabilitation (article 8, 
paragraph 4, of the Optional Protocol). The Special Rapporteur notes that social, psychological, 
medical and legal assistance were made available to child victims of violence. Nevertheless, she 
expresses concern about reports that no outreach work is done on the streets. 
</p>
<p>73. Some non-governmental organizations integrate a multidisciplinary approach in their work 
with children, incorporating social work, psychological and art therapy, and legal counselling. In 
one case, however, an in-house treatment/shelter for children and mothers, with follow-up work, 
had to close its doors in January 2008 due to a lack of sufficient funding. Currently, 
municipalities are the main funders of rehabilitation and care centres. Interlocutors also stressed 
the need for separate funding for follow-up of children after they leave the centre. One clear 
example brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur is the lack of proper follow-up, if 
there is any, of foster/adoptive families after placement/adoption. In this regard, the Government 
informed the Special Rapporteur of Regulation No. 111 on the Procedure of Adoption of the 
Cabinet of Ministers (11 March 2003) which sets a mandatory requirement for follow-up of 
adoptive families. Orphans&#8217; Courts are charged with follow-up of national adoptions, while 
foreign adoptions are supervised by the receiving country which, in turn, submits an assessment 
report to the Ministry of Children and Family Affairs. The follow-up period is two years after the 
adoption. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this information, but stresses the importance of 
effective implementation of these regulations, and that the Government should ensure the 
follow-up and monitoring of both adopted children and those children who leave centres but who 
are not adopted.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern about information received regarding problems 
faced by certain crisis and rehabilitation centres, mostly related to the decrease in their funding 
and the limited number of places available. She received reports that several centres, or certain 
programmes of certain centres, have been closed down in recent years due to lack of funding. 
Such funding is heavily dependent on the State and the municipalities. The level of training of 
the relevant professionals was also raised as a concern by several interlocutors. The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes the information received from the Government regarding legal acts 
concerning the training of professionals, including State inspectors for the protection of the 
rights of the child, State and municipal  police officials working with children&#8217;s files, heads of 
Orphans&#8217; Courts, managers of educational institutions and those of childcare institutions, judges 
and public prosecutors.<b>4</b> Nevertheless, in the light of information received from various sources, 
the Special Rapporteur encourages the Government of Latvia to ensure that such training is

<p>A/HRC/12/23/Add.1

</p>
<p>consistently implemented and refreshed at regular intervals. The Special Rapporteur stresses the 
importance of a methodology with a child rights-based approach, taking into consideration the 
opinion of the child and the best interest of the child. Access to psychological counselling by 
parents and children alike, particularly in the regions, must be ensured. 
</p>
<p>75. She also notes the absence of clear, definable partnership agreements between the 
Government and non-governmental organizations regarding the implementation of initiatives and 
programmes. The Special Rapporteur was informed of certain cooperation projects between the 
Ministry of the Interior and NGOs in EU-funded projects; of the Nordic-Baltic pilot project to 
support women victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation; and of memorandums of 
understanding between the Ministry of the Interior and numerous NGOs to increase the quality 
of decisions. The Special Rapporteur supports such initiatives and encourages detailed 
partnership agreements to be undertaken between the Government and non-governmental 
organizations which recall the respective undertakings of the parties and contain detailed actions, 
expected outcomes, follow-up and evaluation modalities, as well as the allocated budget. 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur observed that Latvia has undertaken various initiatives in an effort 
to prevent violations of the rights of the child. For instance, she notes awareness-raising and 
information campaigns on the rights of the child, drug addiction, trafficking in human beings, 
violence and online child pornography. Police inspectors from the Minors&#8217; Unit organize trips to 
schools to discuss prevention of violence and trafficking. The Special Rapporteur recommends 
that such programmes be continued in the longer term. They should be targeted not only at 
children but also at parents and the general public, in order to promote behaviour and attitudes 
that are based on respect for dignity, and physical and moral integrity. 
</p>
<p>77. In meetings with members of the local press, the Special Rapporteur was informed that 
journalists often felt they were given too large a responsibility when it came to these issues. They 
have played the role of investigators in recent cases of allegations of child pornography, while 
they insist that that is not their job. They also reported a lack of follow-up to some of the cases 
that are reported in the media. They reported receiving some training on the rights of the child. In 
this regard, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government ensure that the utmost care 
is taken to investigate and follow up on all cases of violence, abuse and other infringements of 
children&#8217;s rights mentioned in the media. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Ongoing actions 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur notes significant efforts made to put into place a Central Statistics 
Bureau for the purpose of centralizing all data, including data relating to the situation of children. 
Nevertheless, she expresses concern at the lack of a centralized system containing disaggregated 
data (by gender, age, type of violation and sentences imposed), particularly regarding children. 
While some ministries have such data, the Special Rapporteur recommends that they be 
centralized and shared with other ministries to ensure consistency and reliability of information. 
</p>
<p>79. The Ombudsman&#8217;s Office also foresees the creation of an Internet site designed to raise 
awareness about the issue of violence against children. This initiative is intended to be coupled 
with an information campaign in schools on the same issue. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/23/Add.1 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p><b>D.  International assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>80. Latvia has been a member of Interpol since 1992. Latvia cooperates with Baltic and 
Eastern European Governments to combat regional organized crime groups that engage in 
trafficking. For instance, it has signed bilateral agreements with Belarus, Estonia, Lithuania, 
Kyrgyzstan, Poland, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Uzbekistan 
to implement mutual legal assistance measures. The Special Rapporteur was informed by border 
control guards at Silenes that Latvia cooperates with other EU countries in maintaining a shared 
database of information on individuals and materials. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> The Special Rapporteur notes that significant efforts have been made at the 
legislative level in the area of protecting the rights of the child. Nevertheless, while the 
number of reported cases of child prostitution and trafficking of children for sexual 
purposes is low, all actors with whom the Special Rapporteur met were of the view that 
child pornography, mainly via the Internet, was on the rise. The Special Rapporteur is of 
the opinion that vigilance is required and that efforts should be directed towards 
prevention. 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> In fact, children are increasingly vulnerable and at risk of commercial sexual 
exploitation, given the proliferation of tourism, easy accessibility to new methods of 
information technology by children, increasing demand in the sex industry and the 
establishment of increasingly structured trafficking networks. 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> The Special Rapporteur recalls that preventing and combating these phenomena are 
directly linked to the capacity of a society to adopt a holistic approach to the fundamental 
rights of children, paving the way for the implementation of social policies which favour 
children, youth and the family and the elaboration of creative and innovative responses 
from both the public and the private sector. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> In this regard, the Special Rapporteur makes the following recommendations to the 
Government of Latvia: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Child victims of the offences covered by the Optional Protocol should not, as 
such, be either criminalized or penalized and that all possible measures should be taken to 
avoid their stigmatization and social marginalization, consistent with various 
recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Such action may decrease 
the level of shame/fear in children in reporting cases; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Latvian law should clearly stipulate that a child under 18 years of age, 
irrespective of the legal age of consent to sexual activity, is unable to consent to any form of 
sexual exploitation, including child pornography and child prostitution; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The participation of children should be strengthened on all issues concerning 
them, and their views should be given due weight; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Adequate training should be provided to the relevant authorities for combating 
cybercrime, particularly online child pornography, in order to effectively detect violations; </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/12/23/Add.1 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p><b> (e) Internet service providers and telecommunications companies should continue 
to be involved in initiatives to combat and prevent online child pornography; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) While noting the existence of the Hotline for children, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends the strengthening of complaints mechanisms for children placed in alternative 
care institutions, or who are victims of violence or abuse, all the while ensuring their 
effectiveness and guaranteeing the protection, privacy and confidentiality of the children; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Resources available, both financial and human, to the State Inspectorate for 
Children&#8217;s Rights should be strengthened, and there should be prompt follow-up to
