</p>
<p>Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and 
</p>
<p>Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, adopted 
</p>
<p>by the General Assembly in its resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970,

<p> <i>Guided also</i> by the provisions of article 1 of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights, which affirm that all peoples have the right to self-determination,

<p> <i>Guided further</i> by the International Covenants on Human Rights, the Universal 
</p>

<p>2002, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further</i> the conclusion of the International Court of Justice, in its advisory

</p>
<p>the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, along with measures 
</p>
<p>previously taken, severely impedes the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the resolutions adopted in this regard by the Commission on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, the last of which was resolution 2005/1 of 7 April 2005, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination in accordance 
</p>
<p>with the provisions of the Charter, the relevant United Nations resolutions and declarations, 
</p>
<p>and the provisions of international covenants and instruments relating to the right to self-
</p>
<p>determination as an international principle and as a right of all peoples in the world, as it is 
</p>
<p>a <i>jus cogens</i> in international law and a basic condition for achieving a just, lasting and 
</p>
<p>comprehensive peace in the region of the Middle East, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the inalienable, permanent and unqualified right of the Palestinian 
</p>
<p>people to self-determination, including their right to live in freedom, justice and dignity and 
</p>
<p>to establish their sovereign, independent, democratic and viable contiguous State; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also reaffirms</i> its support for the solution of two States, Palestine and Israel, 
</p>
<p>living side by side in peace and security; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Stresses</i> the need for respect for and preservation of the territorial unity, 
</p>
<p>contiguity and integrity of all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges</i> all Member States and relevant bodies of the United Nations system to 
</p>
<p>support and assist the Palestinian people in the early realization of their right to self-
</p>
<p>determination; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Decides</i> to continue the consideration of this question at its twenty-second 
</p>
