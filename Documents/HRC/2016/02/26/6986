Second session 
Agenda item 2 
</p>
<p><b>IMPLEMENTATION OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 60/251 
OF 15 MARCH 2006 ENTITLED &#8220;HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>Finland (on behalf of the European Union):  draft decision 
2006/&#8230;  Darfur 
</b></p>
<p> The Human Rights Council decides to adopt the following text: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;1. The Human Rights Council welcomes the Darfur Peace Agreement, signed in 
Abuja, as well as the measures already taken towards its implementation.  It calls on all 
parties that have not yet done so to sign the Agreement in compliance with the relevant 
United Nations resolutions. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;2. The Council notes with deep concern the seriousness of the human rights and 
humanitarian situation in Darfur and calls for an immediate end to the ongoing violations 
of human rights and international humanitarian law.  It emphasizes the primary obligation 
of the Government of the Sudan to protect all individuals against violations, including 
sexual and other forms of gender-based violence and the use of child soldiers.  It calls on 
all parties to put an effective end to all acts of violence against civilians, with a special 
focus on vulnerable groups, including women and children, while permitting the return of 
all internally displaced persons to their homes. 
</p>
<p>GE.06-14526  (E)    041006 </p>

 <p></p>
<p>&#8220;3. The Council notes that the Darfur Peace Agreement stipulates the principles of 
</p>
<p>enhancing accountability and preventing impunity.  It calls on all parties to put an end to 
impunity and to cooperate fully in the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement 
and relevant United Nations resolutions in this regard, inter alia by assisting in bringing 
to justice those responsible for grave crimes under international law. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;4. The Council calls on all parties, whether or not they have signed the Darfur 
Peace Agreement, to ensure full and unfettered access of monitors of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights deployed in the Sudan to all 
places of detention and to ensure the full, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian 
assistance to those in need in Darfur. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;5. The Council welcomes the cooperation established by the Government of the 
Sudan with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan and calls 
upon the Government to continue and intensify its cooperation with the Human Rights 
Council and its mechanisms by implementing the various recommendations.  It requests 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the Council at its 
third session on progress in this regard. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;6. The Council calls upon the international community at large and donor countries 
and peace partners in particular to honour their pledges of support and to provide urgent 
and adequate financial and technical assistance in the promotion and protection of 
human rights.&#8221;
