<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted by the Intergovernmental Working Group on the 
Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action in 
accordance with resolution 11/12 and decision 3/103 of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the session 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Intergovernmental Working Group held its eighth session from 11 to 22 
October 2010. The participants discussed draft conclusions and recommendations on 
protection of children, migration and employment, pending from the seventh session of the 
Working Group. The participants reviewed the progress on implementation of 
recommendations adopted at the seventh session of the Working Group. The delegates also 
shared experiences, including on good practices, implementation of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action (DDPA) and the Outcome Document of the Durban 
Review Conference. The participants discussed the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the 
DDPA. Furthermore, a thematic discussion on structural discrimination was held and 
presentations by experts were followed by interactive discussions. The Working Group 
adopted conclusions and recommendations on the aforementioned themes. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Attendance  
</b></p>
<p>3. The session was attended by representatives of Member States, observers from non-
Member States of the United Nations as well as observers from intergovernmental and non-
governmental organizations (see annex I). 
</p>
<p>4. During the session, presentations on the theme of structural discrimination were 
made by the following panellists: Mirjana Najcevska, Chairperson of the Working Group of 
Experts on People of African Descent; Ion Diaconu, Rapporteur of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination; Ferdous Ara Begum, member of the Committee on

and Programme of Action. </p>


<p><b> B. Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>5. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navanethem Pillay, 
opened the first meeting of the eighth session on 11 October 2010. She recalled that 2011 
will mark the tenth anniversary of the DDPA. She also noted that a number of steps had 
been taken to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, but 
that more efforts still needed to be undertaken to achieve the goals of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action. She stressed that priority should be placed on 
national action plans. The High Commissioner noted that the themes of protection of 
children, migration and employment were on the agenda of the eighth session of the 
Working Group and that the eighth session also included a discussion on good practices put 
into place by States to end racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance. She encouraged States to propose effective and creative ideas to commemorate 
the tenth anniversary of the DDPA. Finally, the High Commissioner welcomed the 
discussion of structural discrimination that the Working Group would engage in, noting the 
importance of the collection of disaggregated data in identifying such discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Election of the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>6. At the first meeting, on 11 October 2010, Mohamed Siad Douale, Permanent 
Representative of Djibouti to the United Nations, was elected Chairman-Rapporteur by 
acclamation. Mr. Douale reiterated his strong commitment to the fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Adoption of the agenda and programme of work 
</b></p>
<p>7. During its first meeting, the Working Group adopted the agenda for its eighth 
session (A/HRC/16/WG.3/1, see annex II) and its programme of work (see annex III), 
which was slightly modified during the following days to accommodate changes in the 
timing of the meetings. The Working Group held its last meeting on Friday afternoon, 22 
October 2010. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Statements 
</b></p>
<p>8. The European Union paid tribute to the work of the High Commissioner, the 
Secretariat and Mr. Douale and emphasized that the DDPA is a cornerstone of the global 
fight against racial discrimination. The European Union reaffirmed that it was determined 
to continue its efforts in implementing the agreed principles and operational 
recommendations of the DDPA. 
</p>
<p>9. Costa Rica, speaking on behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean 
States, recalled that the fight against discrimination remained a priority. It called on the 
Working Group to engage efficiently in the combat against racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance and reaffirmed the necessity of coordinating with other 
human rights institutions to achieve the goals of the DDPA. 
</p>
<p>10. Finally, Nigeria, speaking on behalf of the African Group, recalled that the DDPA 
constituted a comprehensive action-oriented document that embodied the commitment of 
the international community to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance. Nigeria noted, however, that effective practical steps and measures still 
needed to be taken by States towards achieving the goals enshrined in the DDPA. Nigeria 
reiterated the strong commitment of the African Group to implement the DDPA. </p>


<p><b> IV. Discussion and adoption of draft conclusions and 
recommendations from the seventh session of the Working 
Group on protection of children, migration and employment 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Chairperson recalled that on 1 and 2 September 2010, a number of delegations 
had participated in informal consultations that had been convened to facilitate the 
finalization of the draft conclusions on the themes of children, employment and migration 
considered at the seventh session of the Working Group. The Working Group agreed that 
the discussions on the drafts would be informal, while the discussions to adopt the 
recommendations would be formal. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Protection of children 
</b></p>
<p>12. In his opening remarks, the Chairperson stated that the draft conclusions and 
recommendations on protection of children had been agreed upon on 2 September 2010 in 
the framework of informal consultations in preparation of the eighth session of the Working 
Group. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Migration 
</b></p>
<p>13. In the framework of informal consultations, delegates speaking on behalf of regional 
groups and as representatives of their own countries discussed the draft on migration with 
proposals of amendments made. The group agreed on recommendations and conclusions on 
migration in the afternoon meeting of 12 October 2010. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Employment 
</b></p>
<p>14. In the framework of informal consultations, delegates speaking on behalf of regional 
groups and as representatives of their own countries discussed the draft on employment 
with proposals of amendments made. The group agreed on recommendations and 
conclusions on employment in the afternoon meeting of 13 October 2010.  
</p>
<p>15. Formal discussions were resumed on the afternoon of 13 October 2010. The 
European Union stated that the draft conclusions and recommendations on protection of 
children, migration and employment needed final confirmation by their capitals before 
adoption. Several delegates noted that this was not in line with usual practice and should 
not constitute a precedent for the Working Group&#8217;s future procedure.  
</p>
<p>16. The draft conclusions and recommendations on protection of children, migration and 
employment were formally adopted in the morning meeting of 14 October 2010. The 
European Union indicated that it would likely make a statement at the end of the session 
and asked for the statement to be included in the report. A debate was held between 
delegates as to when such an explanation would be held and the Chairperson decided that it 
would be held at the end of the session. Following the question raised by one delegate as to 
whether the conclusions and recommendations should be put in an annex of the report of 
the seventh session of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective 
Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, the Chairperson 
decided that these conclusions and recommendations would be included in the present 
report. 
</p>
<p>17. The European Union also recalled article 16 of the report of the seventh session of 
the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the DDPA and </p>


<p>reiterated that it was their understanding that any additional appropriations related to the 
conclusions and recommendations on protection of children, migration and employment 
would be met from within existing resources. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Review of progress on implementation of recommendations 
adopted at the seventh session of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>18.  Mr. Boychenko, Chief of the Anti-Discrimination Section proceeded to explain the 
progress of the Office in implementing the recommendations adopted at the preceding 
session. He stressed the efforts of the Office to incorporate the implementation of the 
DDPA in the human rights mainstreaming both within the United Nations as well as with 
regional and international organizations. He stated that the Office continued its efforts to 
increase awareness on the Working Group recommendations and to place the information it 
collects on its website. Mr. Boychenko also stressed that the Office was in the process of 
reinforcing the national capacity-building component of its programme. To that effect, he 
mentioned that two regional workshops on the design and implementation of national 
action plans against racial discrimination, addressed to French-speaking African countries, 
had taken place in 2009. The Office had organized a similar workshop for 21 English-
speaking African countries, to take place in December 2010 in Addis Ababa. He shared the 
efforts of the Office to increase participation of relevant treaty monitoring bodies and 
special-procedure mandate holders, including the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, as well as to invite experts, in particular the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to 
have interactive discussions with the Working Group. Mr. Boychenko reiterated the 
commitment of the office to move from recommendations to changing realities on the 
ground. 
</p>
<p>19. Following the statement made by the chief of the Anti-Discrimination Section, 
several delegates thanked him for his comprehensive report, expressed their support for the 
work of the section and stressed the important role to be played by the section in filling the 
gap between recommendations and implementation on the ground. 
</p>
<p>20. The European Union underlined its intention to discuss proposals on how to improve 
the effectiveness of the work of the Durban follow-up mechanisms. Several delegates 
protested at the intention to introduce such a discussion, recalling that paragraph 124 of the 
Outcome Document of the Durban Review Conference requests the Human Rights Council 
to conduct such work. Other delegates stated that, while the request contained in paragraph 
124 is directed at the Human Rights Council, a discussion on the subject by the Working 
Group would be productive.  
</p>
<p>21. Draft recommendations and conclusions on review of progress on the 
implementation of recommendations adopted at the seventh session of the Working Group 
were discussed. Whether or not to make reference, in the conclusions and recommendations 
of the eighth session, to article 124 of the Outcome Document of the Durban Review 
Conference was also discussed. Delegations speaking on behalf of regional groups and as 
representatives of their own countries informed the room that they would not be in a 
position to adopt conclusions and recommendations relating to the eighth session without 
first consulting their capitals. </p>


<p><b> VI. Sharing of experiences, including on good practices, 
implementation of the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the 
Outcome Document of the Durban Review Conference 
</b></p>
<p>22. The representative of Brazil stated that, although some forms of structural 
discrimination persisted in Brazilian society, a number of policies aimed at promoting equal 
guarantees to the full enjoyment of all human rights by sectors of its population that had 
historically faced discrimination had been undertaken by the Government of Brazil. In 
2009, the National Plan for the Promotion of Racial Equality had been launched to 
overcome persisting racial inequalities in Brazil by promoting affirmative action policies. 
Also in 2009, the third National Human Rights Plan, aimed at combating structural 
inequalities, had been adopted. In July 2010, President Lula enacted the &#8220;Statute of Racial 
Equality&#8221; aimed at reinforcing the obligation of the State and society to guarantee equal 
opportunities to the country&#8217;s African descendent population.  
</p>
<p>23. The European Union stated that it had adopted a number of instruments designed to 
combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, such as a 
directive that implements the principle of equal treatment between people irrespective of 
racial or ethnic origin and a framework decision that aims at combating certain forms and 
expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law, through criminal 
sanctions.  
</p>
<p>24. The representative of Italy stated that a recent plan of action had been launched by 
the City of Rome to facilitate the integration of Roma people and provide these 
communities with better living conditions. The pilot project aimed at resettling 6,000 Roma 
in the capital in order to provide them with better social and health services, as well as to 
empower their community.  
</p>
<p>25. The representative of the Netherlands stated that the Netherlands had adopted a law 
establishing at the local level a nationwide network of anti-discrimination bureaus that were 
responsible for registering complaints submitted to them in a central database and providing 
assistance, such as mediation services and assistance for persons who lodged complaints 
with the Equal Treatment Commission. The delegate pointed out that two studies with 
regard to the fight against racism and discrimination had been published. The Working 
Conditions Act had been amended and now obliged employers to pursue anti-
discrimination policies. Instructions had been given to police and public prosecution 
services with the aim of attaining closer cooperation among relevant actors and a more 
targeted approach to discrimination at the regional level. 
</p>
<p>26. The representative of South Africa expressed appreciation to the High 
Commissioner for her efforts in mainstreaming the DDPA in the United Nations system. 
The representative stated that his Government has taken a number of steps to implement the 
DDPA, including the adoption of legislation and practical measures, with active 
engagement of international and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), political parties, 
the national human rights institution, the private sector, the media and civil society. South 
Africa had sought to promote the fight against racism at the 2010 International Federation 
Association of Football Clubs &#8220;Football Wold Cup&#8221;, including by the display of a banner 
with the words &#8220;Say No to Racism&#8221;. A counter-xenophobia unit had been established with 
the mandate to promote a human rights-based culture in Government and civil society in 
respect to immigration control. In this regard, training programmes have been initiated for 
officials interacting with refugees and migrants, and measures have been taken to facilitate </p>


<p>and simplify the issuance of residence permits to those entitled to them, and detect and 
deport illegal foreigners. 
</p>
<p>27. The representative of Norway stated that discrimination on prohibited grounds was 
proscribed by several laws, among others, the Anti-Discrimination Act, which transformed 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination into 
national law. Further anti-discrimination legislation was being drafted upon the proposal of 
a commission appointed for that purpose. The Equality and Anti-Discrimination 
Ombudsman supervises implementation of above-mentioned legislation and decides on 
individual complaints, along with the Equality and Anti-Discrimination Tribunal. 
Furthermore, an institution had been established to promote integration and diversity. 
Norway launched the Plan of Action to combat Racism and Discrimination in 2002 and the 
Plan of Action to Promote Equality and Prevent Ethnic Discrimination in 2009, 
incorporating recommendations of the Durban Declaration. Included were policy measures 
to safeguard and develop Sami languages, culture and social life. Furthermore, the Plan of 
Action for the promotion of integration and inclusion of the immigrant population had been 
launched. 
</p>
<p>28. The representative of Costa Rica stated that, of the recommendations made during 
the universal periodic review to Costa Rica, some recommended amending legislation to 
conform to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and 
prepare and adopt a national action plan against racism. With the support of the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) regional office, on 27 
and 28 September 2010 a seminar had been held with the aim of discussing national action 
plans and racial discrimination. Over two days, various participants addressed the main 
recommendations made to Costa Rica during the universal periodic review regarding the 
fight against discrimination and its own national perspective on an issue that was under the 
responsibility of all. During the seminar, experiences regarding efforts of other Latin 
American countries were discussed such as those of: Argentina, Brazil and Mexico and. 
United Nations agencies also shared their viewpoints on the issue of discrimination in Costa 
Rica and other countries. The main conclusions of the seminar were that there was a strong 
need to prepare a national plan against racism and topics such as education, culture and 
health were elements that should be adequately addressed as part of common efforts. 
</p>
<p>29. The representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
stated that its &#8220;Programme for Government&#8221; made clear its country&#8217;s determination to take 
concerted action to tear down barriers to equal opportunities, including by setting up 
measures for black, Asian and minority ethnic communities with relation to employment. It 
was stated that there had been success in programmes aimed at narrowing the gap between 
children from disadvantaged backgrounds and their peers in education, and that further 
programmes with that aim would be conducted. The delegate highlighted that the Race 
Relations Act 1976 had been amended in 2000 to add, inter alia, the duty of public bodies 
to give due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination and to promote equality of 
opportunity and good race relations. In 2005, the first race equality strategy was launched, 
forming the basis for a renewed programme of action. In 2010, the Equality Act came into 
force and, in 2011, a new Public Sector Equality Duty to promote equality on grounds of 
race, disability and gender will be put in place. 
</p>
<p>30. The representative of Nigeria, speaking on behalf of the African Group, stated that 
the Executive Council of the African Union, following its meeting in Sirte, Libya, in 2009, 
had appealed to member States to implement all commitments emanating from the 
international and regional conferences, and to formulate national policies and plans of 
action to prevent, combat and eliminate racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance. The Ministers, at that meeting, had further urged the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights to strengthen the interaction and synergy </p>


<p>between the various organs and structures concerned and ensure effective coordination with 
the relevant African groups with a view to adopting a common African position in various 
international forums. 
</p>
<p>31. An observer from an NGO expressed concern about the situation of indigenous 
peoples, in particular in relation to the suppression of their right to self-determination and 
the right to territory in many parts of the world. He suggested that the Working Group make 
a recommendation to the treaty monitoring bodies, in particular the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, to exercise their mandate to the fullest extent with 
regard to the rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>32. The delegate speaking for the Commission for Human Rights (Ombudsman) of the 
Republic of Azerbaijan stated that the institution of the Ombudsman had been established 
with the mandate to protect human rights and freedoms of all citizens, including by 
examining individual complaints. The Ombudsman had since undertaken various activities 
in relation to the right to non-discrimination, such as: awareness-raising campaigns on the 
promotion of rights contained in, inter alia, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Racial Discrimination; measures for the provision of rights, particularly freedom of 
religion, for members of national minorities; and establishing collaboration with relevant 
international and regional organizations. In 2006, the National Action Plan on the 
Protection of Human Rights, including provisions for the elimination of discrimination and 
the protection and development of the heritage of national minorities, had been approved by 
Presidential Decree and a working group had been established for the coordination of its 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>33. An observer from an NGO underlined the important role of national action plans in 
the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and the 
necessity of evaluation of their accomplishments. The observer expressed satisfaction that 
the International Year for People of African Descent was to be held in 2011 and underlined 
the importance of it being a sustainable event. 
</p>
<p>34. With reference to paragraph 50 of the Outcome Document of the Durban Review 
Conference requesting OHCHR to place examples of best practices provided by 
stakeholders on its homepage, Yury Boychenko, chief of the Anti-Discrimination Section, 
asked the Working Group to consider providing parameters for validation of best practices. 
Upon proposal of a delegate speaking on behalf of a regional group, OHCHR agreed to 
prepare a note on activities undertaken in that regard providing the basis for a discussion to 
be held during the ninth session of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. The tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action 
</b></p>
<p>35. A delegate speaking on behalf of a regional group presented proposed elements for 
the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the DDPA, including the mobilization of 
political will; resuscitation of the Independent Eminent Experts&#8217; Group; holding of a high-
level plenary event; round-table discussions during the sixteenth session of the Human 
Rights Council; linkage with the International Year for People of African Descent; and the 
nature of the outcome to be a short and concise declaration. 
</p>
<p>36. A delegate speaking on behalf of an intergovernmental organization emphasized the 
importance of mobilization of political will on the anti-racism agenda at the highest level 
and proposed to deliberate on progress achieved within the United Nations human rights 
system on preparation of complementary standards to prevent and combat new forms of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. </p>


<p>37. A delegate stated that the commemoration should be a positive event reflecting 
achievements since the adoption of the DDPA rather than its weaknesses. The event should 
further aim at giving visibility and advocacy to the Durban documents and at awareness-
raising amongst civil society. This proposal was widely supported by other delegations 
speaking on behalf of regional groups and as representatives of their own countries. 
</p>
<p>38. A delegate proposed to appoint high-profile persons as goodwill ambassadors for the 
above-mentioned purposes. 
</p>
<p>39. Several delegates speaking on behalf of regional groups and as representatives of 
their own countries expressed doubts about the effectiveness and necessity of the 
Independent Eminent Experts&#8217; Group with reference to article 124 of the Outcome 
Document of the Durban Review Conference. While various delegates stated that the 
Working Group&#8217;s mandate did not extend to discussing the effectiveness of the Durban 
mechanisms, other delegations argued that the Working Group could submit 
recommendations to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>40. A delegate speaking on behalf of a regional group recalled that a comprehensive 
review of the DDPA had been undertaken in 2009 at the Durban Review Conference and, 
in this regard, expressed doubt about the added value of the formulation of a declaration as 
an outcome document of the commemoration of tenth anniversary of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p>41. At the request of the Chair, a representative of the Anti-Discrimination Section of 
OHCHR noted that discussions on the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and on the International Year for People of 
African Descent were under way within the office. In that regard, it was confirmed that no 
additional resources would be requested to meet the recommendations on the tenth 
anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action as adopted 
by the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>42. A delegate speaking on behalf of a regional group noted that the commemoration of 
the tenth anniversary of the DDPA would be a good opportunity for the Human Rights 
Council to improve the efficiency of the work of the Durban follow-up mechanisms, 
pursuant to paragraph 124 of the Outcome Document of the Durban Review Conference. A 
delegate opposed this suggestion, stating that the commemoration should only be the 
occasion to raise further awareness on the DDPA and that it had no links with the Durban 
follow-up mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>43. Following a discussion on General Assembly resolution 64/148 and the intention 
expressed by some delegates to propose a resolution on the activities that would take place 
to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the DDPA, it was noted that no resolution would 
be discussed during the present session of the Working Group. Similarly, following 
concerns raised by some delegates, it was reiterated that the Working Group should make 
its recommendations to the Human Rights Council rather than to the General Assembly.  
</p>
<p>44. An observer from an NGO stressed the importance of taking the opportunity of the 
commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the DDPA to further raise awareness on issues 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p>45. An observer speaking on behalf of an NGO noted that the commemoration of the 
tenth anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action would be the 
opportunity to include the right to self-determination of people living under occupied 
territory in related actions. </p>


<p><b> VIII. Thematic discussion on structural discrimination</b>1<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Definitions, approaches and trends 
</b></p>
<p>46. Mirjana Najcevska, Chairperson of the Working Group on People of African 
Descent, Ion Diaconu, member of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, and Githu Muigai, Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance made presentations on definitions, 
approaches and trends of structural racial discrimination. Ferdous Ara Begum, member of 
the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, gave a presentation 
on the gendered nature of structural discrimination in the field of migration and 
employment. 
</p>
<p>47. Following statements and questions raised by several delegates, the importance of 
identifying structural discrimination in the context of the application of the DDPA, the need 
for States to adopt specific legislation and policies, and the usefulness of collecting 
disaggregated data were discussed. The positive role of education in providing 
empowerment to people was also highlighted. A delegate noted in that regard that his 
country incorporated elements of African history and culture within its school history 
textbooks to give more visibility to people of African descent. 
</p>
<p>48. A delegate noted that the term &#8220;structural discrimination&#8221; was still controversial, as 
there was no consensus among academics as to how it operated. Several delegates and 
panellists stressed that, while structural discrimination was about individual rights, it was 
the overall system creating such discrimination that needed to be addressed. A delegate 
from an NGO called upon the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to 
fully implement its mandate by transmitting petitions to the appropriate United Nations 
bodies. 
</p>
<p>49. Waleed Sadi, Vice-Chairperson of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, made a presentation on the Committee&#8217;s perception of structural discrimination. 
Hatem Kotrane, member of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, made a presentation 
on structural discrimination with regard to children. Ana Elizabeth Cubias Medina, member 
of the Committee on Migrant Workers, made a presentation on structural discrimination 
with regard to migrant workers. 
</p>
<p>50. During the discussion following the panellists&#8217; presentations, questions were raised 
on the structural dimensions of racial discrimination, the usefulness of statistics and 
disaggregated data &#8211; in particular with regard to the attribution of individuals to groups and 
the potential misuse of such data, how to avoid adverse effects of positive measures and 
whether or not the perception of one unified human race was to be embraced.  
</p>
<p>51. One delegate stated that the organization of his State was federalist, based on ethnic 
groups. Mr. Diaconu pointed out that, while territorial organization was an autonomous 
responsibility of States, it was important to ensure that the different regions were equally 
represented and treated on a national level. 
</p>
<p>52. Several observers from NGOs expressed concern about the negation of minority 
groups&#8217; right to use their own language, expressed regret that there were no experts invited 
from groups working outside the United Nations in the field of racial discrimination and 
inquired about progress made by OHCHR on a project initiated after the World Conference 
</p>

<p>against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance concerning 
parameters for measuring racism in different regions. 
</p>
<p>53. One delegate raised the issue of linking, in an operational manner, the collection of 
disaggregated data with the DDPA. Several delegates and members of NGOs strongly 
affirmed that racism was not in decline, but rather, new manifestations of racism were 
emerging.  
</p>
<p>54. Responding to questions raised by delegates, Mr. Sadi specified that, although the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights did not use the term structural 
discrimination, it was working on the phenomenon of structural discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  National action plans as a tool to address issues pertaining to structural 
discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>55. Alvaro Bello, Director of the School of Anthropology of the University of Tumaco, 
made a presentation on national action plans as a tool to address issues pertaining to 
structural discrimination. Kgamadi Kometsi, National Coordinator on racism and non-
discrimination of the Human Rights Commission of South Africa, made a presentation 
which outlined research done on one of the disadvantaged communities in South Africa.  
</p>
<p>56. Following the presentations of Mr. Bello and Mr. Kometsi, discussions were held on 
the importance of data collection, outreach and communication, and the need to implement 
national action plans for States who have not yet done so. One delegate called for States to 
recognize the reality of racism and racial discrimination and the long-term impact of 
colonialism on societies. 
</p>
<p>57. Following questions raised by delegates, Mr. Kometsi said that the choice of the 
various actors who would participate in the drafting of the national action plan as well as a 
lack of resources were among the challenges faced by the drafters of the South African 
national action plan. Responding to a question by a delegate, Mr. Kometsi stressed the 
importance of establishing an independent body specifically mandated to monitor the 
national action plan.  
</p>
<p><b> C.  Approaches at regional and national levels 
</b></p>
<p>58. Marcello Scarone Azzi, Chief of the Struggle against Discrimination and Racism 
Section in UNESCO, made a presentation on the organization&#8217;s efforts against 
discrimination in education and the fight against discrimination at a structural level. Jo&#227;o 
Carlos Nogueira, Vice-Minister of the Secretariat of Policies for the Promotion of Racial 
Equality in Brazil, made a presentation highlighting his country&#8217;s policies for the promotion 
of racial equality. Jerald Joseph, Executive Director of Dignity International, Malaysia, 
made a presentation on the South&#8211;East-Asian regional response to discrimination 
</p>
<p>59. Following the presentations made by the panellists, several delegates paid tribute to 
the efforts of Brazil in the fight against discrimination and, more specifically, the enactment 
of the Statute of Racial Equality. Responding to a question raised by a delegate, Jo&#227;o Carlos 
Nogueira stressed the positive impact of affirmative action policies in the fight against 
discrimination, referring in particular to the access of Afro-Brazilian students to higher 
education. In response to a point raised by a panellist, a delegate explained that, although 
his country had not ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, it complied with the standards thereof. 
</p>
<p>60. In further discussions between delegates and panellists, it was stated that the fight 
against discrimination implied a wide participation by civil society actors and </p>


<p>communication campaigns guaranteed by freedom of speech. In that context, Mr. Azzi 
explained that UNESCO has been using sports by involving a football club in a campaign 
against racism and discrimination. He suggested that similar campaigns be extended for the 
next Olympic Games and Football World Cup. Discussions also highlighted the need to 
ensure quality of education in addition to equal access to education.  
</p>
<p>61. Stefan Olsson, Head of Unit &#8220;Equality, Action against Discrimination: Legal 
Questions&#8221;, Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities 
of the European Commission, made a presentation on the content and practice of the 
Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal 
treatment in employment and occupation and Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 
implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or 
ethnic origin &#8211; known as the &#8220;Racial Equality Directive&#8221; &#8211; in the European Union. Edna 
Santos Roland, the Independent Eminent Expert Group, presented the Latin American and 
Caribbean experience in approaches to structural discrimination.  
</p>
<p>62. One delegate expressed concerns about obstacles that arose in relation to the use of 
statistical data. Mr. Joseph noted, with reference to Ms. Santos Roland&#8217;s presentation, that 
the South-American model would set high standards to courts throughout the world.  
</p>
<p>63. Responding to a question raised by Mr. Joseph, Mr. Olsson stated that any 
undocumented migrant worker in the European Union would in theory be protected by the 
directives in question and could therefore take a case related to the violation of the rights 
guaranteed therein to a court in any member State. Mr. Olsson further explained, however, 
that member States could still expel an undocumented migrant worker in such a case 
because of his or her illegal status, in accordance with national law. 
</p>
<p>64. Ms. Santos Roland stated, with reference to a question raised by a delegate, that 
Brazil was the country with the largest number of affirmative action programmes in South 
America, followed by Colombia. The country&#8217;s affirmative action programmes were 
established mainly in the field of education. 
</p>
<p>65. Mr. Olsson responded to a question raised by a delegate by stating that the directives 
presented earlier included the possibility for member States of the European Union to 
implement such measures, provided that they did not constitute discrimination. In that 
context, he also referred to the case law of the European Court of Justice and the difficulty 
of adopting positive measure without violating the principle of equal treatment. 
</p>
<p>66. Mr. Olsson explained, with reference to a question raised by a delegate, that, while 
the terms race and racial discrimination were not defined in European Union directives 
because the organization did not recognise the concept of race, some member States applied 
criteria similar to those established by the British House of Lords in a case from the 1980s 
on access to education by a Sikh boy. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Final statements 
</b></p>
<p>67. Final statements were made by delegates speaking on behalf of regional groups and 
as representatives of their own countries to pay tribute to the Chairperson for his efforts to 
facilitate the Working Group&#8217;s work in an efficient and action-oriented way during its 
seventh and eighth sessions. 
</p>
<p>68. The delegate speaking on behalf of the European Union explained its position on the 
conclusions and recommendations on migration, in particular on the paragraph referring to 
ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Their Families. The delegate stated that European Union member States had 
considered signing and ratifying this instrument, as a matter of priority, however, the text of </p>


<p>the Convention raised several insurmountable difficulties for them. It was indicated that the 
scope of that instrument, which covered both workers in regular and irregular situations, 
treating them on equal footing, posed a problem since both European Union immigration 
policy and national policies clearly distinguished between the two. The status of legally 
residing immigrants in the European Union member States was identical to that of European 
Union nationals, in terms of education, health assistance, housing, social security or pension 
treatment. One of the priorities of the European Union was to combat irregular migration, 
especially as organized by human rights trafficking networks. The delegate added that, 
although irregular migrants were not automatically granted a right to reside on the territory 
of European Union member States, their human rights were fully respected. This 
fundamental distinction between regular and irregular migration was an integral element of 
the European Union&#8217;s Global Approach to Migration. The delegate stated that it was 
unlikely that European Union member States would ever be in a position to sign and ratify 
the Convention and the lesson to be drawn from that example was that, when drafting new 
United Nations instruments, due care should be given to their universal nature. Additionally, 
the delegate reaffirmed that the European Union had understood that the recommendation 
contained in paragraph 85 (a) of the present report referred to regular migrants.  
</p>
<p><b> X. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Conclusions and recommendations from the seventh session of the 
Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Protection of children

commitments related to the protection of children as contained in the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action and the Outcome Document of the Durban 
Review Conference.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Working Group further calls upon all relevant bodies, such as the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, to take into 
consideration the respective paragraphs on protection of children in the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action and the Outcome Document of the Durban 
Review Conference.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Working Group invites Member States to include in their periodic reports 
to the Committee on the Rights of the Child information on measures undertaken to 
implement the respective paragraphs on protection of children from the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action and the Outcome Document of the Durban 
Review Conference.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Working Group invites Member States and other stakeholders, including 
relevant human rights bodies and international organizations, in particular the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the Committee on the Rights of the Child, to 
submit to OHCHR all pertinent information, inter alia, relevant legislation, good 
practices and reports related to child protection against racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, which will be placed on the website of OHCHR.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Working Group encourages Member States to ensure registration of 
children at birth in accordance with paragraph 56 of the Durban Programme of 
Action.  </b></p>


<p>74. <b>The Working Group invites Member States to intensify awareness-raising 
activities, in partnership with children, national human rights institutions, regional 
organizations, civil society organizations and other stakeholders, to combat the 
pernicious effects that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance have upon children. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Working Group encourages Member States to prohibit violence against 
children, in accordance with the Convention of the Rights of the Child and the Durban

<p>76. <b>The Working Group invites Member States to ensure that children in 
vulnerable situations have appropriate access to child protection systems, including 
health care, education, social services and housing, in accordance with relevant 
international obligations. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Working Group recognizes that the success of these conclusions and 
recommendations will require political will and adequate funding at the national, 
regional and international levels, and international cooperation.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Working Group further recommends that the following issues pertinent to 
the subject of the protection of children against racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance form the basis, among others, for further 
discussions by this body during its future sessions: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Assessment of the implementation by all stakeholders, including 
Member States, of relevant provisions from the Durban Declaration and Programme 
of Action and the Outcome Document of the Durban Review Conference and the 
submissions to OHCHR foreseen in paragraph 72 of the present report, with a view 
for the Working Group to formulate recommendations, if necessary, on how 
implementation could be bolstered; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b) In-depth discussion on the situation of children who suffer racism and 
intolerance with the participation of relevant special procedures and treaty bodies 
with the aim of defining adequate approaches and specific policy responses.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Migration 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Working Group acknowledges that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Migration occurs on a cross-regional, as well as intraregional basis;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Rising violence against migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers poses a 
serious threat to social cohesion and is linked to racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c)  The challenges faced by migrants are today compounded by new 
threats, such as the global financial crisis and economic downturn, climate change, 
food insecurity and organized crime, and encourages international organizations, 
academic institutions, Member States and civil society to carry further studies on 
these threats and their link with racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Working Group calls upon Member States to consider ratifying the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families, as a matter of priority. </b></p>


<p>81. <b>The Working Group reaffirms that Member States are under obligation to 
protect fully and effectively the human rights of all migrants, regardless of their 
immigration status, in accordance with their obligations under international law. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Working Group invites States to: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Adopt a human rights-based approach to migration and take measures 
towards that goal;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Design and implement awareness-raising campaigns and activities on 
migration aiming to prevent and eliminate negative perceptions of migrants, with 
particular emphasis on the promotion of intercultural dialogue and the values of 
solidarity, respect, tolerance and multiculturalism;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Formulate and implement training programmes for law enforcement, 
immigration and border officials, with a view to sensitizing them to racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Adopt specific measures, including laws, on the protection of migrants 
and address the specific needs and vulnerabilities of migrants, in particular with 
regard to access to justice, health, education, housing and employment, in accordance 
with their obligations under international law and their commitments under the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Take measures to facilitate the integration of migrants, with due respect 
to their cultures; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Put in place institutional frameworks and laws that effectively protect 
women and children migrants; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Adopt national action plans against racism that provide for the 
protection of migrants and are based on cooperation between Government, 
employers, trade unions and civil society and ensure their implementation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Identify, broadly disseminate and share good practices on migration;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Implement their obligations under relevant International Labour 
Organization (ILO) and United Nations conventions, inter alia, ILO Convention No. 
111 (1958) concerning Discrimination in respect of Employment and Occupation, the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Urge cooperation among social partners, civil society and Governments 
in effectively implementing the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the 
Outcome Document of the Durban Review Conference;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) Combat and eliminate negative stereotyping of migrants in public 
discourse. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Working Groups invites ILO, the International Organization for 
Migration, OHCHR, the United Nations Development Programme, UNESCO, the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNICEF, the United 
Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women and all other 
relevant international, regional, interregional and subregional organizations to take 
further actions, regarding racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance linked to migration, in accordance with their mandates. </b></p>


<p>84. <b>The Working Group invites employers, trade unions, politicians and civil 
society to take action with regard to the problems of migration and its link to racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Working Group recognizes that migration (and associated increased 
labour mobility) represents one of the long-term solutions to labour and skills needs in 
evolving economies throughout the world. The Working Group believes that 
immediate measures and policy responses are required to mitigate the negative impact 
of any economic and/or financial crisis on the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of migrant workers. In this regard the human rights of migrant workers 
should be guaranteed in particular in the context of the overall efforts to promote a 
comprehensive approach to overcome crises. In this regard, the Working Group 
recommends four broad areas for intervention:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Shoring up just and decent work conditions and protection of migrant 
workers in destination countries;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Taking measures to combat trafficking and forced labour of migrant 
workers, regardless of their immigration status;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Enhancing employment creation and social safety-net protections for 
returning migrants in countries of origin and recognizing the importance of fostering 
international cooperation in this regard; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Taking all appropriate legal and administrative measures to prevent and 
combat the manifestations and acts of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance against migrants, including on the basis of religion or belief, and to 
prosecute perpetrators of violent acts; and emphasizing the necessity to appropriately 
address the stereotypes often applied to migrants. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Employment 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Working Group urges States to consider ratifying and fully implementing 
ILO Convention No. 111and ILO Convention No. 100 (1951) concerning Equal 
Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value, as a matter of 
priority. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Working Group calls upon Member States to consider ratifying the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families, as well as other relevant United Nations conventions, as a 
matter of priority.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Working Group urges States to adopt legislation, where they have not 
already done so, that in particular prohibits racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance in accessing employment and protects workers from such 
discrimination in the workplace.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Working Group calls upon States, in collaboration with various 
stakeholders, in particular employers and trade unions, to implement effective 
awareness-raising campaigns and training programmes to combat racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and negative stereotyping in the 
workplace.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Working Group encourages States to establish observatories at the 
national level to monitor racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance in relation to employment, including mechanisms for the reception of 
complaints and measures for addressing racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance, where it is found to exist. </b></p>


<p>91. <b>The Working Group requests that examples of relevant legislation, good 
practices and other pertinent information related to non-discrimination in the area of 
employment be placed on the website of OHCHR. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Working Group urges States to ensure the prevention and detection of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in the workplace 
through effective training for officials operating in the framework of existing relevant 
national mechanisms and bodies, including, as appropriate, labour inspectors, to 
detect and prevent such discrimination in the workplace.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Working Group calls upon States to adopt measures promoting equal 
employment opportunities in the public service aimed at eliminating discrimination 
against members of communities subject to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Working Group encourages employers to provide scholarships, mentoring, 
internships and other similar measures to members of communities that are subject to 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in accessing 
employment. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Working Group encourages employers to consider implementing, when 
and where appropriate, the practice of using anonymous applications for job 
vacancies, as one of the effective tools to prevent and eliminate discrimination based 
on the name or ethnic origin of the applicant. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Progress in implementation of recommendations adopted at the 
preceding session of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Working Group commends the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights and OHCHR for their efforts to ensure the implementation of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action in combating racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and requests that the Office 
prepares and makes available well in advance of the ninth session of the Working 
Group a note providing an overview of initiatives undertaken by OHCHR since the 
eighth session of the Working Group with regard to ensuring progress on 
implementation of recommendations adopted by the Working Group, during its eighth 
session.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Working Group reiterates its support to the efforts by the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue mainstreaming the implementation 
of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the Outcome Document of 
the Durban Review Conference in the whole United Nations system.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Working Group reiterates the necessity of developing and effectively 
implementing national action plans, as a tool for combating racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and welcomes the activities 
undertaken in this regard by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights. The Working Group reiterates its call on States to draft, revise as 
necessary and fully and effectively implement national action plans against racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and invites OHCHR to 
continue to assist States in this regard.  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Working Group urges Member States, international and regional 
organizations, civil society and other stakeholders to reply promptly to requests for 
information, including on collection of best practices and national action plans, sent by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. </b></p>


<p>100. <b>The Working Group notes with appreciation the efforts made by the 
Chairperson of the Working Group to promote the effective implementation of 
recommendations contained in the report of the seventh session of the Working 
Group, in particular those related to the methodology of the Working Group, and 
encourages the Chairperson to continue his efforts in that regard. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Working Group recommends that the Human Rights Council adopt at its 
next session the necessary measures for the full observance of article 124 of the 
Outcome Document of the Durban Review Conference. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. The tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action  
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The Working Group recalls the decision of the Human Rights Council to 
dedicate two working days of the eighth session of Working Group to preparing for 
the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The Working Group reaffirms that the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action provides the most comprehensive United Nations framework for combating 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and takes note with 
appreciation of the convening by the General Assembly of a one-day plenary event to 
commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action during the high-level segment of the sixty-sixth session of the 
General Assembly in 2011. The Working Group: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Recommends that the one-day plenary event during the high-level 
segment of the General Assembly should aim to mobilize political will, reaffirming 
commitment to the full and effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and

Year for People of African Descent. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The Working Group suggests that the commemoration by the Human Rights 
Council of the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination should 
focus on themes pertinent to the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action and the International Year for People of 
African Descent. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Structural discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Structural discrimination &#8212; definitions, approaches and trends  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Working Group acknowledges the complexity of the phenomenon of 
structural discrimination and its evolving nature, and highlights that further efforts 
are needed with a view to exploring it in the context of the fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Working Group, however, takes note that some of the views expressed 
during the panel discussion indicate that, in general terms, structural discrimination 
may refer to rules, norms, practices, patterns of attitudes and behaviour in institutions 
and other societal structures that represent obstacles to groups or individuals in 
achieving equal rights and opportunities. Such discrimination may be either open or 
hidden and could occur intentionally or unintentionally.  
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The Working Group also takes note that some of the views expressed during 
the panel discussion indicate that, in general terms, structural racial discrimination 
may refer to racist, xenophobic, intolerant or at face value neutral patterns of 
behaviour and attitudes within societal structures that may have disproportionate 
effect on specific individuals or groups of individuals in relation to their race, colour, 
descent or national or ethnic origin. According to some of the views expressed during 
the panel discussion, the existence of such discrimination is related inter alia to the 
persistence of deeply rooted racial prejudice and negative stereotypes in societies that 
perpetuate inequality.  </b></p>


<p>109. <b>Bearing in mind the above, the Working Group concludes that measures, 
including affirmative and positive measures, should be considered during further 
work on the phenomenon of structural discrimination.  
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The Working Group therefore encourages relevant United Nations human 
rights mechanisms, including the Human Rights Council&#8217;s Advisory Committee to 
consider further studying, within their respective mandates, the phenomenon of 
structural discrimination in the context of combating racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance.    
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. National action plans 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The Working Group encourages OHCHR to develop a practical tool to assist 
stakeholders, including Governments, national human rights institutions, international 
and regional organizations and civil society to develop and implement national action 
plans against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>The Working Group encourages OHCHR to continue convening regional and 
national workshops on development and implementation of national action plans 
against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</b></p>
<p><b> XI. Presentation and adoption of the report on the eighth session 
</b></p>
<p>113. On 22 October 2010, the draft report was adopted ad referendum, and the Working 
Group decided to entrust the Chairperson-Rapporteur with its finalization. </p>
