</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders conducted an 
official visit to Honduras from 7 to 14 February 2012, during which she met with senior 
officials and human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur describes the legal and institutional 
framework in Honduras for the promotion and protection of human rights. She then 
</p>
<p> details the current situation faced by human rights defenders in Honduras in the 
exercise of their legitimate activities, including by defenders working as journalists; 
defenders working on economic, social and cultural rights, including those working on the 
rights of indigenous communities; Afro-Honduran communities; defenders working on 
environmental and land issues; women defenders and defenders working on women and 
children&#8217;s rights; defenders working on the rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender 
and intersex community; lawyers, prosecutors and judges; and staff members of the 
National Commissioner for Human Rights. Owing to the nature of their activities, human 
rights defenders continue to be vulnerable to the risk of extrajudicial executions, enforced 
disappearances, torture and ill-treatment, arbitrary arrest and detention, death threats, 
attacks, surveillance, harassment, stigmatization, displacement and forced exile. 
</p>
<p>  
 * The summary of the present report is circulated in all official languages. The report, which 
</p>
<p>is annexed to the summary, is circulated in the language of submission and in Spanish only.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251 and Human Rights Council 
resolution 7/8, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders conducted 
an official visit to Honduras from 7 to 14 February 2012, at the invitation of the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Honduras for extending an 
invitation to her and for its cooperation throughout the visit. The Special Rapporteur also 
expresses her appreciation to the Office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator in 
Honduras and the Human Rights Adviser of the United Nations country team for their 
excellent support in the preparation of, and during, the visit.  
</p>
<p>3. The purpose of the visit was to assess the situation of human rights defenders in 
Honduras in the light of the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, 
Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 
53/144.<b> </b>An examination of the legal framework in the country, institutional policies and 
mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights were of particular 
importance to this assessment. 
</p>
<p>4. A request to visit Honduras was made by the previous mandate holder, Hina Jilani, 
in 2008. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for having extended an open 
invitation to special procedures, on 12 May 2010, and a specific invitation to 14 special 
procedures mandate holders in October 2011. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur travelled to Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba. She 
had the opportunity to meet with the President of Honduras, the Minister for Justice and 
Human Rights, the Minister for the Development of Indigenous Peoples and Afro-
descendants, two deputy Ministers for Foreign Affairs, the deputy Minister for Defence, the 
deputy Minister for the Interior and Population, the deputy Minister for Security, the 
Director of the National Agrarian Institute, the President of the Human Rights Commission 
of the National Congress, the President and two magistrates of the Supreme Court of 
Justice, staff members of the Office of the Public Prosecutor, the National Commissioner 
for Human Rights (CONADEH) and the three members of the National Committee for the 
Prevention of Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (CONAPREV). 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that she was not able to meet the Minister for Foreign 
Affairs, the Minister for Security, the Minister for Defence, the Procurator General and the 
Minister for the Interior and Population. 
</p>
<p>6. In addition to the authorities in Tegucigalpa, the Special Rapporteur held meetings 
in San Pedro Sula with the Governor and the regional representatives of the Head of the 
Regional Office of the National Commissioner for Human Rights in the Department of 
Cort&#233;s, while in La Ceiba she had the opportunity to meet the Governor of Atl&#225;ntida, the 
head of the Regional Office of the National Commissioner for Human Rights and the 
Regional Prosecutor for Human Rights. Owing to security constraints, she was unable to 
visit the region of Bajo Agu&#225;n (Department of Col&#243;n). The Special Rapporteur also met 
with a very wide and diverse segment of civil society representatives and human rights 
defenders and with members of the diplomatic community and United Nations agencies.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>7. On 28 June 2009, the President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, was overthrown in a 
coup d&#8217;&#233;tat. The subsequent de facto Government was headed by the President of Congress, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Roberto Micheletti. General elections were held in November 2009 and were won by 
Porfirio Lobo. 
</p>
<p>8. During and after the coup, Honduran military and security forces perpetrated serious 
and systematic human rights violations. On 26 January 2010, the day before President Lobo 
took office, the National Congress approved an amnesty law for the events that took place 
between 1 January 2008 and 27 January 2010. Although the law states that human rights 
violations are exempt from the amnesty, the ambiguous language used in the law has been 
the source of concern, including that of the Inter-American Commission for Human 
Rights.1  
</p>
<p>9. Since the Government of Mr. Lobo took office, there have been certain positive 
human rights developments, such as the establishment of the Ministry of Justice and 
Human Rights, the Ministry for the Development of Indigenous Peoples and Afro-
descendants and a national preventative mechanism for the prevention of torture. In 
addition, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established in 2010 in order to 
clarify the events surrounding the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat. In July 2011, the Commission concluded in a 
report that serious human rights violations, particularly political persecutions, had been 
perpetrated, and recommended the implementation of profound political and institutional 
reforms to improve the protection of human rights.2 
</p>
<p>10. As a consequence of the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat, international investment in the country was 
seriously affected, resulting in the deterioration of the economic and social situation. 
According to the National Statistics Institute, in 2010, 60 per cent of the population of 
Honduras lived in poverty, and 39 per cent in extreme poverty.  
</p>
<p>11. The education system is also a serious concern. Students should receive classes 
approximately 200 days per year; however, owing to poor quality education and frequent 
teacher strikes, they currently only receive half the classes. Approximately 50 per cent of 
the population is younger than 18 years of age, and the lack of access to education is having 
a serious negative impact on the security and economic situation of the country. 
</p>
<p>12. Violence and insecurity are key concerns. According to the World Study on 
Homicide of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Honduras has the 
highest rate of violent death in the world; for example, in 2010, the rate of violent deaths 
reached 82.1 such deaths per 100,000 inhabitants.3 The pervasive violence is the result of a 
number of factors, including an increase in organized crime and drug trafficking. The police 
force itself is responsible for serious human rights violations and corruption, which has led 
to the increase in the use of private security providers. 
</p>
<p>13. The high levels of impunity, corruption, poverty and inequality, compounded by 
with increasing criminality and violence, have negatively affected the confidence of the 
Honduran people in national institutions. Social and political polarization still prevails, 
particularly within civil society organizations.

</p>
<p><b> III.  Legal and institutional framework for the promotion and 
protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. International level 
</b></p>
<p>14. As at February 2012, Honduras was a State party to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (1997), the First (2005) and Second (2008) Optional Protocols 
thereto; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1981); the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1983); the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child (1990) and the two Optional Protocols thereto; the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (1996) and the Optional Protocol thereto (2006); the International Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (2002); the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families (2005); the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2008) and the 
Protocol thereto (2010); the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance (2008) and the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 
(No. 169) of the International Labour Organization (ILO).  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur notes that Honduras is not yet a State party to the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women or the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>16. International treaties are part of the legal framework of Honduras, and take 
precedence over national legislation, as stipulated by articles 15 and 18 of the Constitution 
of Honduras. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Domestic level 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Constitution 
</i></p>
<p>17. The Constitution was approved in 1982 and has been modified several times 
thereafter. In the preamble thereto, reference is made to the strengthening and perpetuation 
of the rule of law in order to ensure that society is politically, economically and socially 
just. The importance of providing &#8220;conducive conditions for the full realization of man, as a 
human being, in terms of justice, freedom, security, stability, pluralism, peace, 
representative democracy and the common good&#8221; is also stressed.  
</p>
<p>18. The mandate of the National Commissioner for Human Rights is described in article 
59 of the Constitution, which also, in article 60, declares punishable any discrimination on 
grounds of sex, race, class or any other ground injurious to human dignity. The Constitution 
also recognizes a broad range of human rights, including inter alia, the right to freedom of 
expression and opinion (art. 72), the rights to freedom of association and assembly (art. 78), 
the right to freedom of movement (art. 81) and the right to work (art. 127). It furthermore 
recognizes the guarantee of habeas corpus (art. 182).  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Law No. 153-95 on the National Commissioner for Human Rights  
</i></p>
<p>19. Law No. 153-95 describes the structure of the office of the National Commissioner 
for Human Rights (Comisionado Nacional de los Derechos Humanos) and sets out its 
functions. Every six years a person can be chosen as National Commissioner by the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>National Congress, with re-election possible for one additional term (for a total duration of 
12 years).  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Decree No. PCM-027-2011 on the Law of the Organization, Functions and Competences of 
</i></p>
<p><i>the Executive Power  
</i></p>
<p>20. Decree No. PCM-027-2011 on the Law of the Organization, Functions and 
Competences of the Executive Power (Reglamento de Organizaci&#243;n, Funcionamiento y 
Competencias del Poder Ejecutivo) establishes in its article 87-D and E the Ministry of 
Justice and Human Rights, and specifies its functions.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Law No. 219-2011 on the Judicial Council and Judicial Career  
</i></p>
<p>21. The Judicial Council, not yet in existence at the time of the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur, will be responsible for the administration and supervision of judges, including 
in relation to their appointment and promotion and the application of disciplinary measures.  
</p>
<p>22. While the Special Rapporteur notes the positive nature of Law No. 219-2011 on the 
Judicial Council and Judicial Career (Ley del Consejo de la Judicatura y la Carrera 
Judicial), given that it strengthens the independence of the judiciary, she considers that the 
Council as envisaged has a number of shortcomings with regard to its capacity to safeguard 
the independence of the judiciary. The leadership in the Council by the President of the 
Supreme Court may generate political interference and affect the legitimacy of the 
judiciary.  
</p>
<p><i> (e) Law No. 9-99-E on Criminal Procedure 
</i></p>
<p>23. Law No. 9-99-E on Criminal Procedure (C&#243;digo Procesal Penal) establishes the 
function of special judge (juez de ejecuci&#243;n) in charge of monitoring the execution of 
sentences and security measures, and of ensuring that preventive detention and prison 
sentences are carried out in accordance with the law and on the basis of judicial decisions.  
</p>
<p><i> (f) Law No. 156-1998 on the National Police 
</i></p>
<p>24. Law 156-1998 on the National Police (Ley Org&#225;nica de la Polic&#237;a Nacional) moves 
the authority for the Police force from the Ministry of Defence to the Ministry of Security. 
The National Police is responsible for investigating offences and acts under the authority of 
the Ministry of Security, to prevent, discourage and combat offences, and restore law and 
order (art. 37); and manage penitentiaries and ensure their security (art. 52).  
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about the extensive investigative 
responsibilities of the Police, especially given its widespread involvement in human rights 
violations. This has contributed to the general climate of impunity in the country and puts 
prosecutors and staff of human rights institutions at risk.  
</p>
<p><i> (g) Specialized Law No. 32-2011 on the Promotion of Non-governmental Organizations for 
</i></p>
<p><i>Development 
</i></p>
<p>26. Article 3 of Specialized Law No. 32-2011 for the Promotion of Non-governmental 
Organizations for Development defines these organizations as private entities not affiliated 
to a political party, non-profit, without trade union, work-related or religious goals, and 
with objectives that contribute to humanitarian development. The legal personality or the 
incorporation of a non-governmental organization may be suspended or cancelled for, inter 
alia, failing to submit an annual report and a financial report for two or more consecutive 
years (art. 26). The Special Rapporteur is of the view that the law should be revised to bring 
it into compliance with international human rights standards. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p><i> (h) Law No. 252-2010 prohibiting the Financing of Terrorism  
</i></p>
<p>27. Law No. 252-2010 prohibiting the Financing of Terrorism (Ley contra el 
Financiamiento de Terrorismo) defines terrorist activities as those crimes that are defined in 
international conventions relating to terrorism to which Honduras is a party, as well as &#8220;any 
other act that has the aim of causing death or serious bodily harm to a civilian or to any 
other person&#8221;, when the purpose of said act or event, owing to its nature or context, is &#8220;to 
</p>
<p>intimidate the population or to oblige a Government or an international organization to 
carry out or to abstain from carrying out a given act&#8221;.  </p>
<p>28. Reportedly, Law No. 252-2010 has created legal uncertainty for non-governmental 
organizations and limited their right to freedom of association. Chapter XIII of the law sets 
out obligations and rules for non-profit organizations, including registering with the Unit 
for the Registration and Monitoring of Civil Associations (art. 56), and informing the 
authorities of all donations of more than $2,000 (art. 58). Furthermore, the competent 
authority may, by means of an administrative order, suspend or dissolve a non-profit 
organization that has &#8220;knowingly encouraged, promoted, organized or committed terrorist 
</p>
<p>acts or financed such acts&#8221; (art. 60).  
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the valuable role played by human rights 
defenders may be affected by the adoption of vague laws. For this reason she recommends 
that such laws be revised in order to create a more favourable environment for civil society 
organizations. 
</p>
<p><i> (i) Law No. 185-95 on the Framework of the Telecommunications Sector  
</i></p>
<p>30. Law No. 185-95 on the Framework of the Telecommunications Sector (Ley Marco 
del Sector de Telecomunicaciones) establishes the conditions for obtaining a radio 
broadcasting license for a radio frequency. It grants authorities the power to revoke or 
cancel broadcasting licenses on the grounds of national security concerns.  
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur received information that Law No. 185-95 interferes in the 
creation and development of alternative media, particularly community radio stations. In 
cases where there is more than one interest in obtaining a particular radio frequency, a 
tender for the license is held, in which community radio stations are, however, at a 
disadvantage against commercial radio companies. Many journalists who use alternative 
media for the promotion of human rights in rural and poor communities have been 
negatively affected by this concession process. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the right of the State to grant State bodies legal 
powers to revoke or cancel broadcasting licenses on the grounds of national security. She 
is, however, concerned that these policies may continue to apply outside the context of a 
formal state of emergency. In her opinion, the law is in breach of international standards 
regarding the freedom of expression and should therefore be revised. 
</p>
<p><i> (j) Law No. 143-2010 on the Regulatory System of Public and Private Associations  
</i></p>
<p>33. Law No. 143-2010 on the Regulatory System of Public and Private Associations 
(Ley del R&#233;gimen Regulador de las Asociaciones P&#250;blico Privada) regulates public and 
private associations in order to increase investment and national development. The Special 
Rapporteur received information that communities living in areas where projects are being 
developed were not consulted, and that there has been an increase in the number of 
evictions, particularly affecting indigenous and afro-Honduran communities. She was also 
informed that certain projects are causing serious environmental pollution and that the 
health of the population is being affected. In her opinion, all public and private associations 
should be regulated in accordance with international human rights standards. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. General shortcomings in the legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur has taken note of significant deficiencies in the full 
implementation of legal instruments, a situation that adversely affects the work and safety 
of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur observes that the absence of a specific legal framework for 
the protection of human rights defenders contributes to their situation of vulnerability. She 
firmly believes that the adoption of a national law on their protection would enhance and 
give legitimacy to their work, and contribute to the improvement and strengthening of the 
framework for national dialogue with civil society. Such a law should be enacted as a 
matter of priority.  
</p>
<p>36. During her meeting with the President of the Human Rights Commission of the 
National Congress, the Special Rapporteur welcomed the openness expressed to examine 
the possibility of drafting such a law.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional framework  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Law enforcement authorities and defence 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur met with the Deputy Minister for Security and the Deputy 
Minister for Defence.  
</p>
<p>38. While recognizing the existence of corruption in the police force, the Deputy 
Minister for Security pointed out that measures and reforms were being devised and 
implemented. The Deputy Minister also referred to the substantial shortcomings in their 
training and capacity, as well as the incidence of arbitrary detentions and excessive use of 
force. She recognized that the police does not have a dedicated unit with vetted officers for 
providing protection, and that the institution does not manage to protect all persons with 
precautionary measures issued by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. He 
furthermore highlighted the refusal by certain victims to be assigned police protection. 
</p>
<p>39. It is of grave concern to the Special Rapporteur that most of the human rights 
violations reported were allegedly attributable to law enforcement authorities. In the light of 
the investigative responsibility of the police, she noted a systematic failure to report 
violations against defenders when police officers are alleged to have been responsible. The 
Special Rapporteur notes that the need for police reform is widely acknowledged by all 
public institutions and civil society; she therefore recommends the implementation of 
holistic policies to effectively combat impunity in the country. 
</p>
<p>40. The Deputy Minister for Defence pointed out that the military was entrusted with 
autonomous functions in public order enforcement, in accordance with a constitutional 
amendment passed in November 2011. The military is currently conducting joint operations 
with the police; to date, however, no detentions have been undertaken by the army without 
the presence of the police. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the lack of trust in the police is leading to 
the use of the military for policing functions, and reminds the Government that the military 
should not assume such a role. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur met with three magistrates in Tegucigalpa, including the 
President of the Supreme Court, who stated that the performance of the judiciary had been 
affected by the general climate of impunity in the country. The Special Rapporteur was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>informed that the judiciary is hampered by a lack of human and financial resources and a 
backlog in investigations of human rights violations, many of which are poorly undertaken.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur also received information indicating a lack of independence 
and impartiality in the judiciary. Such a situation undermines both the effectiveness of the 
administration of justice and the potential role of judges as human rights defenders. 
Protection remedies, such as habeas corpus and the writ of <i>amparo</i>, have become 
illusionary mechanisms. The Special Rapporteur observes that the Supreme Court 
previously had excessive administrative and disciplinary powers over judges and exercised 
arbitrary control over their careers. She furthermore notes that the incertitude over the 
tenure of judges is detrimental to the exercise of their functions.  
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the fact that an independent and effective 
judicial system is essential if widespread impunity is to be tackled. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Public prosecutors 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur met with members of the Office of the Public Prosecutor, 
including the Human Rights Unit. Prosecutors pointed out their dependency on the 
investigative capacity of the police and the fact that the judiciary regularly refused to act on 
the pretext that the necessary information was lacking. 
</p>
<p>46. The ability of the Office of the Public Prosecutor to undertake effective and 
impartial criminal investigations is seriously undermined by the alleged participation and 
collusion of police force members in committing crimes, including serious violations of 
human rights. The Special Rapporteur received information from various sources indicating 
that police agents, including at the senior levels, had impeded and obstructed investigations. 
She was also informed that the Human Rights Unit of the Office of the Public Prosecutor 
was affected by political interference and lack of resources, and that its staff had received 
death threats. The protection measures available to witnesses and victims are extremely 
limited. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur considers that the Office of the Public Prosecutor should be 
allocated additional resources and that its independence should be strengthened. 
</p>
<p><b> 4.  National Commissioner for Human Rights  
</b></p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur met with the National Commissioner for Human Rights, 
who is responsible for the promotion and protection of human rights by means of, inter alia, 
monitoring the rights established in the Constitution and human rights treaties ratified by 
Honduras, and for immediately addressing and following up on any allegations of human 
rights violations. All other public powers and public institutions must treat the 
investigations carried out by the National Commissioner as a priority. According to article 
45 of the National Commissioner Law, the National Commissioner is to submit an annual 
report to Congress describing the general situation of human rights in the country. The 
National Commissioner is in charge of addressing recommendations to public authorities. 
</p>
<p>49. The National Commissioner for Human Rights informed the Special Rapporteur of 
the small number of petitions the institution had received from human rights defenders, 
mainly owing to problems in the dialogue with non-governmental organizations. He also 
acknowledged delays in handling complaints owing to a lack of staff and financial 
resources. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur also met with the regional representatives of the National 
Commissioner for Human Rights in Cort&#233;s and Atl&#225;ntida. Both reportedly maintain an open 
dialogue with local civil society representatives.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>51. The National Commissioner for Human Rights is a key institution for human rights 
defenders seeking redress. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, for several reasons, 
the role of the National Commissioner has been marginalized by different sectors of 
society; however, most of the defenders she met during the mission voiced their 
disappointment and distrust in the current functioning of the institution. Several defenders 
pointed out that the leadership of the institution had lost credibility following the coup.4 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the importance of having a strong and 
independent human rights institution in compliance with the Paris Principles. She believes 
that the institution should be more proactive, becoming a bridge between the Government 
and civil society. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Ministry of Justice and Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur met with the Minister for Justice and Human Rights twice. 
On the basis of article 87-D, E of the Law on the Organization, Functions and Competences 
of the Executive, the Ministry has the responsibility to promote, coordinate, implement and 
evaluate all justice and human rights policies, and to ensure coordination for the effective 
implementation of policies by relevant entities, inter alia, the Executive and the judiciary, 
as well as the Procurator General, the Public Prosecutor and the National Commissioner for 
Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>54. The Minister stated that the protection of human rights defenders was a main 
concern for her institution. She pointed out that a human rights defender unit had been 
created within the institution, which was in charge of ensuring the implementation of the 
protection measures requested by national authorities and international organizations, 
including more than 380 precautionary measures issued by the Inter-American Commission 
on Human Rights. A direct telephone line had been established for the purpose of 
requesting protection. Furthermore, the Minister highlighted the fact that her institution was 
currently developing a national plan of action for human rights. 
</p>
<p>55. The creation of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights is a positive development 
for the State in the fulfilment of its responsibility to protect human rights. The Special 
Rapporteur encourages the Ministry to strengthen its efforts to provide protection measures, 
in particular through the formal creation of an inter-institutional protection programme 
focused on practical protection measures in consultation with the beneficiaries, and to 
ensure regular evaluation of their implementation. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Ministry to continue to develop the national 
plan of action in close coordination with relevant stakeholders and entities, including the 
authorities, the National Commissioner for Human Rights and civil society representatives.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Ministry for the Development of Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendants 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the establishment of the Ministry for the 
Development of Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendants, which was created after the 
adopting of Decree No. 203-2010 on the Law on Public Administration. She met with the 
Minister on two occasions. The Ministry is in charge of, inter alia, designing, coordinating, 
implementing and evaluating all policies that promote the economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>  
 4 In October 2011, the Subcommittee on Accreditation of the International Coordinating Committee of 
</p>
<p>National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights downgraded the accreditation 
status of the Comisionado Nacional de los Derechos Humanos de Honduras to B. See

<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>development of indigenous and Afro-descendants communities, and of strengthening the 
exercise by these communities of their rights. 
</p>
<p>58. The Minister expressed his willingness to support communities that were being 
evicted as a consequence of public and private investments. He also stated that education 
was among his priorities. Although several programmes for the development of indigenous 
and Afro-Honduran people had been implemented, the Minister acknowledged that the 
institution did not have a policy or programme for human rights defenders working on the 
rights of these communities. He added that one of the main problems encountered by his 
institution was the lack of resources. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that all of the different voices within these 
communities are not being given equal attention. She received complaints from defenders 
that their petitions had not been taken into account, particularly when their rights had been 
violated by transnational companies. The Special Rapporteur recommends that dialogue 
with all communities be strengthened. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. National Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
</b></p>
<p><b>Treatment  
</b></p>
<p>60. Decree No. 136-2008 created the National Committee for the Prevention of Torture 
and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment to monitor the situation of human rights of 
people in detention. The Special Rapporteur met with three experts from the Committee. 
</p>
<p>61. The Committee is facing challenges raised by the lack of adequate budget 
allocations. In 2011, its offices were attacked, during which time computer equipment and 
information were stolen.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the recommendations provided by the 
Committee are not sufficiently taken into account by other institutions. Given the current 
situation of Honduran detention centres, the Special Rapporteur considers that the 
Committee&#8217;s role should be strengthened in order to guarantee and protect the fundamental 
rights of people in detention. She noted the importance of supporting this institution 
financially and in terms of staff, to guarantee its independence from other Government 
institutions and to ensure prompt compliance with its recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Situation of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>63. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with more than 300 human rights 
defenders engaged in advocating and protecting civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural rights. She is particularly grateful to those defenders who travelled long distances 
to meet her in San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba. From April 2006 to February 2012, the 
mandate holder has sent 29 communications to the authorities on alleged human rights 
violations against defenders, including one after the mission.  
</p>
<p>64.  The Special Rapporteur observed that, because of their legitimate work in 
upholding human rights and fundamental freedoms, certain categories of human rights 
defenders are at particular risk, including journalists; defenders working on economic, 
social and cultural issues, including defenders working on indigenous, Afro-Honduran, 
environmental and land rights issues; defenders working on the rights of women, children 
and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex community (LGBTI); lawyers, 
prosecutors and judges; and the staff of the National Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>65. Owing to the exposed nature of their activities, human rights defenders and their 
families continue to be vulnerable to extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearance, 
torture and ill-treatment, arbitrary arrest and detention, death threats, attacks, surveillance, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>harassment, stigmatization, displacement and enforced exile. Their offices are raided and 
information files stolen. Their rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and 
association are often unlawfully restricted. 
</p>
<p>66. Such violations are commonly attributed to law enforcement authorities. However, 
collusion and/or acquiescence has also reportedly been shown with regard to abuses 
committed by private actors, inter alia, criminal gangs and private security guards. The 
Special Rapporteur was repeatedly informed that impunity for such violations was a 
chronic problem. 
</p>
<p>67. A very large number of human rights defenders are protected by precautionary 
measures taken by the Inter-American system. The Special Rapporteur is disturbed by 
information that the failure of the authorities to provide effective protective measures has 
resulted in human rights defenders being victims of killings, attacks and threats. At the time 
of her visit, more than 380 people in Honduras were beneficiaries of precautionary 
protection measures and a significant number of them expressed grave concern for their 
security. 
</p>
<p>68. Regarding the performance of civil society organizations, the Special Rapporteur 
regrettably noted a lack of cooperation among them, a lack of networks for the protection of 
victims and a lack of knowledge of United Nations mechanisms. She emphasized that 
empowering human rights defenders contributed to their protection.  
</p>
<p>69. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, as a matter of priority, impunity should be 
addressed and human rights defenders should be provided with effective protection. Laws 
that restrict their work should be revised, and the stigmatization of their work should be 
punished.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Defenders working as journalists 
</b></p>
<p>70. Journalists have increasingly been targeted for exposing human rights violations and 
poor governance. An alarming number of journalists have been killed since 2009, and those 
who covered the street protests and denounced human rights violations after the coup were 
particularly vulnerable.  
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the lack of investigations into the attacks 
against journalists, as well as at information received regarding serious violations of and 
restrictions to the freedom of expression, particularly after the coup. She noted that 
measures to restrict the media remain in place and have resulted in self-censorship among 
journalists. Numerous community radio stations were closed shortly after the coup, and 
remain inoperative. Furthermore, according to information received in April 2011, all low 
radio frequencies were suspended, making community radio stations illegal and affecting, 
in particular, the right of rural and indigenous and Afro-Honduran communities to have 
access to information. For instance, she received information that several journalists 
working at the radio station La Voz de Zacate Grande, which supports the land rights 
movement of local farmers, were being prosecuted.  
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur has emphasized that the role of journalists in following up 
on cases at the national level as investigative journalism can make a real difference when 
raising public awareness and shedding light on responsibilities.5  
</p>
<p>  
 5 A/63/288, para. 54.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p><b> B. Defenders working on economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the degree of violence affecting people 
claiming their economic, social and cultural rights, including land rights, by peaceful 
means. She met several representatives of organizations who had been targeted as a 
consequence of their interventions to protect the environment and livelihood of their 
communities or of other communities against projects by private companies or State agents, 
in particular relating to dams, mining and tourism. Many of these defenders live in a 
constant state of fear. Moreover, she received information that community leaders were 
particularly targeted by the police and security guards hired by private companies. 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about concessions made by the 
Government in order to create &#8220;charter cities&#8221;, and the lack of prior consultation on the Law 
on the Regulatory System of Public and Private Associations, given that these initiatives are 
having an impact on the livelihood of rural populations. According to information received, 
Honduras also faces challenges regarding land titles, and land disputes are commonly 
exacerbated by the fact that several people all claim ownership of the same plot of land.  
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur recognized the legitimate right of the Government to 
promote private investment. She recommends, however, that human rights and 
environmental regulations be strengthened to prevent public and private actors from 
committing violations in the communities where they operate.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Defenders working for the rights of indigenous people 
</b></p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur notes that the departments with the highest prevalence of 
indigenous people show the lowest indicators in terms of health and education conditions, 
access to basic services and economic development.  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur is disturbed by the vulnerability and exclusion suffered by 
indigenous peoples in the country. In particular, she notes that there are cases where the 
Government has provided legal licenses to private companies in lands considered ancestral 
by the indigenous communities, without consulting the indigenous peoples concerned, as 
required by ILO Convention No. 169, to which Honduras is a party, and the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Furthermore, human rights defenders 
working on indigenous issues commented on the lack of knowledge of local authorities, the 
judiciary and law enforcement authorities of ILO Convention No. 169. 
</p>
<p>78. Human rights defenders working on indigenous issues also recognize their own lack 
of knowledge in relation to their own rights. The Special Rapporteur welcomed some 
initiatives of cooperation undertaken by the indigenous communities, such as community 
radio stations.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Defenders working for the rights of Afro-Hondurans 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that Afro-descendant communities, like their 
indigenous counterparts, are marginalized and live in areas marked by low social and 
economic indicators. They are concentrated along coastal areas of the Caribbean, 
traditionally vulnerable to natural disasters and to pressure exerted by private companies, 
including tourist projects on the Caribbean coast. Communities are reportedly being evicted 
from their lands, and their claims are not been taken into account by the authorities.  
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur emphasized the fact that the contact of indigenous and Afro-
Honduran people with their ancestral land, water and resources is part of their identity as 
much as their livelihood.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at information received that there was a lack of 
cooperation within Afro-Honduran communities. She recommends that efforts be made to 
strengthen their networks. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Defenders working on environmental and land rights issues 
</b></p>
<p>82. Defenders protecting natural resources (forest, land and water) have been repeatedly 
arrested, beaten and, in some instances, killed because of their activities. Defenders who 
denounce environmental issues and educate citizens about their rights to land and food have 
been branded as members of the resistance, guerrillas, terrorists, political opponents or 
criminals. The Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned at the situation in Valle de Siria, an 
area where children and adults of the community have been poisoned as a consequence of 
the activities of a private mining company. Community leaders who have denounced the 
situation claim that they have not received any redress thorough the authorities. 
</p>
<p>83. In spite of the fact that the Special Rapporteur did not travel to Bajo Agu&#225;n for 
security restrictions, she managed to meet around 40 farmers living in the region, as well as 
the Director of the National Agrarian Institute and a representative of a corporation working 
in the area. She is gravely concerned at the situation of violence and impunity in Bajo 
Agu&#225;n and the deployment of military forces in the area. 
</p>
<p>84. In general, the Special Rapporteur received contradictory information in relation to 
the perpetrators of violence, inter alia, security guards, police officers, the military and 
farmers. She also noticed, however, the high level of politicization, polarization and 
stigmatization among the parties.  
</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur noted the peaceful work carried out by human rights 
defenders in the region. During the period under review, defenders who provided farmers 
with legal assistance were subjected to threats and attacks. She received information that, in 
certain cases, the police refused to register their complaints. 
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur took note of the efforts made by authorities to mediate in 
order to resolve land ownership disputes, and encourages such efforts in order to prevent 
the land conflict in this region from adversely affecting the national situation.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Women defenders and defende</b>rs working on women and children&#8217;s<b> 
rights 
</b></p>
<p>87. During the mission, women&#8217;s organizations raised concerns that, owing to pervasive 
gender discrimination, their complaints of violations against their integrity and work were 
dismissed and that they endured intimidation by the authorities, in particular by members of 
the police force. The Special Rapporteur received information that Gladys Lanza, a human 
rights defender from the &#8220;Visitaci&#243;n Padilla&#8221; Pro-Peace Women&#8217;s Movement, had been 
subjected to repeated threats and intimidation that have not been investigated and that she, 
despite being a beneficiary of precautionary measures, is currently not provided with any 
protection. 
</p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur noted with concern reports that femicide had dramatically 
increased. She has reiterated on several occasions that women defenders are more at risk of 
certain forms of violence and other violations, such as prejudice, exclusion and repudiation, 
than their male counterparts. This is mainly due to the fact that women defenders are 
perceived as challenging accepted sociocultural norms, traditions, perceptions and 
stereotypes about femininity, sexual orientation and the role and status of women in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>society, which often serve to normalize and perpetuate forms of violence and oppression.6 
The Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that the role of women human rights 
defenders be recognized. 
</p>
<p>89. During the period under review, defenders working on children&#8217;s and youth rights 
were also harassed, particularly those working with children in vulnerable situations, such 
as street children, and those working on cases of summary executions of children. 
Defenders who had denounced social cleansing of children and young people by public and 
private actors were specifically targeted. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the case of 
Reinaldo Cruz Palma, a community leader who worked with young people in Ciudad 
Planeta and who disappeared in 2011 while using public transportation. He had previously 
been were mistreated by police officers. The authorities have failed to provide information 
on his case.  
</p>
<p><b> D.  Defenders working for the rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
</b></p>
<p><b>transgender and intersex community 
</b></p>
<p>90. The LGBTI community constitutes another group facing severe discrimination and 
violence in Honduras, particularly since the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat. According to the information 
received, the persistence of acts of violence and attacks against persons belonging to the 
LGBTI community could correspond to patterns of hate crimes by public and private 
agents, including, primarily, the police and private security guards. The Special Rapporteur 
received information that, since June 2009, more than 34 people belonging to the LGBTI 
community had been killed in the country. She addressed an allegation letter in 2010 on the 
killing of the human rights activist Walter Tr&#243;chez, who worked to promote and protect the 
human rights of the LGBTI community. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the criminal 
investigation into his death has not yielded results. 
</p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned that public officials, including high-
ranking authorities, made public statements stigmatizing members of the LGBTI 
community. She received information indicating that human rights defenders working on 
the protection of the rights of LGBTI persons had been threatened and persecuted, 
particularly by police officers, because their work was perceived as defending immoral 
behaviour. In addition, she received information that members of the LGBTI community 
were prohibited from meeting in certain public places by police agents and threatened with 
arbitrary detention. As a consequence of this discrimination, members of the LGBTI 
community live in constant fear of attack. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the State to 
recognize their rights and to strengthen their actions to effectively prevent and investigate 
cases of attacks against relevant defenders.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Lawyers, prosecutors and judges 
</b></p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur observed that lawyers, prosecutors and judges who act as 
human rights defenders had been subjected to death threats or even murdered. Those 
working on cases of impunity for human rights violations or investigating corruption had 
been particularly targeted. 
</p>
<p>93.  The Special Rapporteur received information that prosecutors, particularly those 
working on human rights and environmental issues, had received death threats and that 
their situation had become especially precarious. Furthermore, prosecutors and judges 
</p>
<p>  
 6 A/HRC/16/44, para. 23.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>working on cases in which the police had been involved in crimes were under political 
pressure from high-ranking authorities, including from within the office of the General 
Prosecutor. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the situation of the staff of the<b> </b>Human 
Rights Office of the Public Prosecutor. She believes that the Office is fundamental in 
combating the high level of impunity in the country. She also noted that judges faced 
political pressure, which may affect their independence. In 2010, the Special Rapporteur 
expressed concerned that, in May 2010, four judges and a public attorney were arbitrary 
removed from their posts for allegedly taking part in peaceful demonstrations against the 
coup d&#8217;&#233;tat of 2009. Judges and court officials who participated in demonstrations in favour 
of the Government created after the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat were not subject to the same treatment. 
</p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur received reports that lawyers working for the National 
Commissioner for Human Rights had been threatened. Staff members of the office of the 
National Commissioner were continuously exposed to danger, given that, on many 
occasions, the police were involved in the allegations received by the office. 
</p>
<p>95. Lawyers working on human rights issues were targeted. A lawyer working for the 
non-governmental organization Asociaci&#243;n para una Sociedad m&#225;s Justa was killed in 
2006, and other lawyers working for the organization continued to receive death threats.  
</p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the State to provide lawyers, prosecutors and 
judges with effective protection.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Challenges faced by human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Culture of impunity and lack of protection measures 
</b></p>
<p>97. Honduras faces serious challenges in combating violence and insecurity. Human 
rights defenders stated that, although they were awarded precautionary or provisional 
protection measures by the Inter-American system, they had not been effectively 
implemented. For instance, in 2010, Nah&#250;n Palacios Arteaga, a journalist who had 
conducted research into organized crime, corruption and human rights violations, was 
murdered, despite the precautionary measures granted to him by the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>98. Owing to their fear of the police, many human rights defenders abstain from seeking 
protection, since they believe that contact with the police exposes them to greater security 
risks and potential reprisal.  
</p>
<p>99. The Special Rapporteur met several human rights defenders who observed that the 
police officers assigned to provide them with protection were frequently rotated and lacked 
training. They stated that the lack of knowledge about the police officer assigned to provide 
their protection increased their feeling of insecurity. One human rights defender benefiting 
from precautionary measures commented that the police officers assigned for protection 
were confused about their task and presumed that the human rights defender was on 
provisional release. Consequently, the person who was supposed to be receiving protection 
was treated like a suspect rather than a victim. 
</p>
<p>100. Prosecutors were subjected to threats and pressure by different State and non-State 
actors, and did not receive sufficient protection nor were they able to provide adequate 
protection for witnesses owing to limited human and financial resources. These factors 
limited progress in improving the administration of justice. 
</p>
<p>101. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the fact that the State has an obligation to 
demonstrate due diligence and to take preventative measures to protect persons who are at </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>risk for having defended human rights. The lack of protection for human rights defenders 
increases their vulnerability, obstructs the ability of the authorities to conduct investigations 
and thereby contributes to the cycle of impunity. She recalls the commitments made by 
Honduras during its universal periodic review in 2010 to improve the protection of human 
rights defenders.7 
</p>
<p>102. The Special Rapporteur observes with concern that there has been little or no 
progress in investigating the attacks and threats made against journalists, human rights 
defenders and political activists since 2009. Those responsible for human rights violations 
remain unpunished, and the victims have yet to receive adequate judicial protection or 
reparation. This has negatively affected the credibility and legitimacy of the judicial 
institutions. She believes that the authorities should take concrete steps to reduce impunity 
and to prevent attacks against human rights defenders, thereby restoring trust in the 
country&#8217;s judicial system and in the police.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional capacity and coordination 
</b></p>
<p>103. The Special Rapporteur noted that there were certain institutional overlaps regarding 
the promotion and protection of human rights. She is also concerned that, when she asked 
who was responsible for specific functions, authorities answered that the task mentioned 
was the responsibility of another ministry. For instance, when she asked several high-
ranking officials how the communications sent by her mandate in relation to individual 
cases were dealt with, she did not once receive a clear answer stating which institution was 
responsible. She also received information that some institutions were not cooperating 
among themselves. She is therefore concerned that this lack of coordination and 
cooperation within the Government is worsening the general situation of impunity.  
</p>
<p>104. Information was received on the Inter-Institutional Commission for the Protection of 
Human Rights, headed by the Procurator General. The Commission reportedly includes 
members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Security and the Ministry of 
Justice and Human Rights, and is supposed to meet periodically. Although the Special 
Rapporteur welcomes this initiative, she received information from various stakeholders, 
including authorities, indicating that the Commission failed to provide any effective 
framework for institutional coordination of human rights protection, because it focused on 
responses to international human rights mechanisms rather than on concrete measures at the 
national level.  
</p>
<p>105. The absence of an effective inter-institutional protection programme for human 
rights defenders was a major concern expressed by a majority of stakeholders. The above-
mentioned Inter-Institutional Commission for the Protection of Human Rights should be 
reformed to provide effective inter-institutional coordination of human rights protection. 
</p>
<p>106. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur also noted that several institutions working 
in the field of human rights lacked the resources necessary to carry out their work. For 
instance, the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, the Ministry for Development of 
Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendants, the National Commissioner for Human Rights, 
the Human Rights Office of the Public Prosecutor and the National Committee for the 
Prevention of Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment have not been 
provided with sufficient funds to carry out their fundamental functions.  
</p>
<p>107. The Special Rapporteur also observed a shortage in knowledge among some 
authorities regarding the role and specificities of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>  
 7 A/HRC/16/10. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>108. In general, the Special Rapporteur emphasized the importance of the commitment of 
all authorities to human rights. In this regard, she also emphasized the importance of 
systematic institutional training on human rights standards. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Restrictions on the exercise of fundamental rights 
</b></p>
<p>109. With regard to the legitimate right of human rights defenders to freedom of 
association, the Special Rapporteur received information indicating that human rights 
organizations faced difficulties in gaining the legal recognition required to register from 
authorities and that organizations had been threatened with closure. One of the 
organizations reportedly affected is APUVIMEH, which works with the LBGTI community 
and supports persons affected by HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p>110. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the valuable role played 
by human rights organizations may be affected by legislation aimed at restricting the work 
of civil society organizations, particularly Specialized Law No. 32-2011 on the Promotion 
of Non-Governmental Organizations for Development and Law No. 252-2010 prohibiting 
the Financing of Terrorism.  
</p>
<p>111. The Special Rapporteur has previously stated that, although the registration 
requirement does not necessarily, in itself, violate the right to freedom of association, 
registration should not be compulsory and non-governmental organizations should be 
allowed to exist and carry out collective activities without having to register if they so 
wish.8 
</p>
<p>112. Furthermore, Law No. 185-95 on the Framework of the Telecommunications Sector 
restricts access to radio frequencies and therefore hampers the freedom of expression of 
journalists and local leaders. The Special Rapporteur believes that laws that impede and 
deter defenders from carrying out their legitimate activities should be revised.  
</p>
<p><b> D.  Stigmatization of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>113. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at stigmatization in the media and the 
delegitimizing statements made by public officials against human rights defenders, and 
notes the particular vulnerability of women defenders and defenders working on women&#8217;s 
and children&#8217;s rights, those working on the rights of the LGBTI community, journalists and 
defenders working on social, economic and cultural rights, particularly indigenous and 
Afro-Hondurans and those working on land issues.  
</p>
<p>114. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the State to recognize and support the work and 
roles of all groups, organs and individuals involved in the promotion and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, as this is the first step towards the creation of a 
safe working environment for defenders.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Role of the international community in the protection of 
human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>115. The Special Rapporteur met with members of the diplomatic community and of the 
United Nations country team, including the United Nations Resident Coordinator. She 
</p>
<p>  
 8 A/64/226, para. 59. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>welcomes the role played by the United Nations and diplomatic missions in supporting civil 
society organizations, particularly those working with human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>116. The Special Rapporteur wishes to encourage the use of the Declaration on Human 
Rights Defenders, the European Union Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders and the 
manual thereon, which are useful tools for the promotion of the role of defenders and their 
protection. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>117. The coup d&#8217;&#233;tat <b>of 2009 aggravated institutional weaknesses, increased the 
vulnerability of human rights defenders and provoked a major polarization in society. 
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>The Government of Honduras has taken positive initiatives for the promotion 
and protection of human rights, inter alia, the creation of the Ministry of Justice and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights, the Ministry for Development of Indigenous Peoples and Afro-
</b></p>
<p><b>descendants, and the National Committee for the Prevention of Torture and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment. The Special Rapporteur commends the 
</b></p>
<p><b>report prepared by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, particularly the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations regarding human rights issues.  
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the engagement of the authorities and 
civil society during the universal periodic r</b>eview process and the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>acceptance of a significant number of recommendations, including those relating to 
</b></p>
<p><b>improving the protection of human rights defenders.  
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>The pervasive impunity and absence of effective investigations of human rights 
</b>violations undermine the administration of justice and damages the public&#8217;s trust in 
</p>
<p><b>the authorities. The high levels of impunity are affecting the stability of society.  
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>Defenders face multiple challenges and dangers in their daily work, and the 
State has the responsibility to protect them. In order to do so, the State should 
</b></p>
<p><b>evaluate its current policy framework to promote protection and accountability 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms, strengthen institutional cooperation and ensure effective enforcement of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the law. The Special Rapporteur underlines the responsibility of the State in ensuring 
</b></p>
<p><b>that human rights defenders are provided with effective protection measures in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>prompt manner. Full accountability for violations against defenders is an absolute 
</b></p>
<p><b>priority and perpetrators must be brought to justice. 
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Honduras once again for its 
cooperation during her visit. She welcomes the commitment expressed by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government, including the President himself, to accept and implement her 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations, and its openness to have a constructive dialogue with civil society.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. For the Government of Honduras 
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>The Government should promote awareness of the role and importance of the 
work of human rights defenders, and establish a clear State policy that recognizes 
</b></p>
<p><b>their indispensible work. The President should promote and lead a constructive 
</b></p>
<p><b>dialogue between the authorities and civil society to create a favourable environment 
</b></p>
<p><b>for human rights defenders and to generate trust within the population.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>124. <b>The Government should integrate a human rights approach in the policies of its 
institutions. A holistic approach should be the baseline for establishing a State policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>that provides for the effective operation and comprehensive coordination of public 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions. The Ministry of Justice and Human Rights should lead the reform of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Inter-Institutional Commission for the Protection of Human Rights in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>coordinate effective implementation o</b>f the State&#8217;s human rights protection policy. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>125. <b>As a crucial measure to overcome the distrust in authorities by human rights 
defenders, an adequately resourced protection programme for human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>defenders should be formally established and implemented as a matter of urgency. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Under the leadership of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, an inter-
</b></p>
<p><b>institutional framework should assume responsibility for its implementation in 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultation with beneficiaries. A regular and transparent review of the protection 
</b></p>
<p><b>programme should be ensured.  
</b></p>
<p>126. <b>The process of applying for protective measures provided under such a 
programme should be accessible, and immediate protection should be granted while 
</b></p>
<p><b>the risk situation of the person is being assessed. All measures for the protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights defenders should be planned and agreed upon directly with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals concerned. Furthermore, the existing toll-free 24-hour emergency hotline 
</b></p>
<p><b>for human rights violations should be widely publicized. 
</b></p>
<p>127. <b>The key priorities of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights should be 
identified and its role vis-&#224;-vis other authorities clarified in order to avoid 
</b></p>
<p><b>overlapping. The Ministry should assume responsibility for the development of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights policies as well as for the internal coordination of protection strategies 
</b></p>
<p><b>for human rights defenders. All policies, strategies and programmes, including the 
</b></p>
<p><b>current initiative to develop a national plan of action, should be developed taking into 
</b></p>
<p><b>account the recommendations made by human rights mechanisms, including special 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures mandate holders, treaty bodies, the universal periodic review and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Inter-American System, as well as those made by the Truth and Reconciliation 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission. A national mechanism to evaluate regularly the degree of 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of recommendations should be established in consultation with civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society.  
</b></p>
<p>128. <b>Institutions that work in the human rights field, inter alia, the Ministry of 
Justice and Human Rights, the Ministry for Development of Indigenous Peoples and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Afro-descendants, the National Commissioner for Human Rights, the Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Office of the Public Prosecutor and the National Committee for the Prevention of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment should be allocated 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate human and financial resources to enable them to carry out their mandates 
</b></p>
<p><b>fully.  
</b></p>
<p>129. <b>Reform of the police force, criminal investigations into human rights violations 
allegedly perpetrated by police officers and disciplinary measures against police 
</b></p>
<p><b>officers suspected of involvement in human rights violations should be undertaken as 
</b></p>
<p><b>a matter of priority in order to increase the credibility of the institution responsible 
</b></p>
<p><b>for law enforcement. The military should not assume policing functions. 
</b></p>
<p>130. <b>A dedicated unit of vetted and specifically trained police should be established 
for the protection of human rights defenders. Their sensitization and awareness of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>role of human rights defenders should be significantly strengthened, with technical 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance from relevant United Nations entities, non-governmental organizations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other partners. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p>131. <b>Judges, prosecutors, lawyers and other relevant public officials should be 
systematically trained on human rights standards, including on the recourse of habeas 
</b></p>
<p><b>corpus in order to improve its effective use. 
</b></p>
<p>132. <b>The national legal framework should be comprehensively revised to harmonize 
it with the principles and provisions of international human rights instruments. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration on Human Rights Defenders should be incorporated into national 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation, and awareness-raising initiatives on the definition and role of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights defenders should be undertaken. Legislation should also emphasize the 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of human rights defenders, with an emphasis on defenders facing greater 
</b></p>
<p><b>risks. It should also be developed in full consultation with civil society, while technical 
</b></p>
<p><b>advice may be sought from relevant United Nations entities. 
</b></p>
<p>133. <b>Law No. 185-95</b> <b>on the Framework of the Telecommunications Sector, 
Specialized Law No. 32-2011</b> <b>on the Promotion of Non-governmental Organizations 
for Development, Law No. 252-2010 prohibiting the Financing of Terrorism and Law 
</b></p>
<p><b>No. 143-2010</b> <b>on the Regulatory System of Public and Private Associations</b> <b>should be 
reviewed in the light of international human rights standards. Furthermore, a law on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the provision of reparation for victims of human rights violations should be promptly 
</b></p>
<p><b>adopted.  
</b></p>
<p>134. <b>The State should ensure that both public and private actors, including 
transnational companies and private security companies, respect the work of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights defenders, particularly those working on economic, social and cultural rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Instances where non-State actors have committed violations against human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>defenders should be investigated; those found to be accountable should be prosecuted 
</b></p>
<p><b>and punished, and compensation should be provided to victims.  
</b></p>
<p>135. <b>Efforts to mediate in land ownership disputes should be strengthened. 
Consultations with indigenous communities should be undertaken in accordance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>ILO Convention No. 169 and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Indigenous Peoples. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. For the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>136. <b>The judiciary should be aware of the role of human rights defenders. It should 
also take proactive measures to ensure the protection of human rights defenders. 
</b></p>
<p>137. <b>Prompt, thorough and impartial investigations on violations committed against 
human rights defenders should be conducted, and perpetrators should be prosecuted. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Practical measures should be taken to address backlogs and delays in administrating 
</b></p>
<p><b>cases of human rights violations. Effective reparation should be available to victims. 
</b></p>
<p>138. <b>While noting the adoption of Law</b> <b>No. 219-2011</b> <b>on the Judicial Council and 
Judicial Career, an independent body should be promptly established to safeguard the 
</b></p>
<p><b>independence of the judiciary and to supervise the appointment, promotion and 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulation of the profession in accordance with international human rights standards. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Judges should be ensured tenure so that they may exercise their functions in an 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent manner.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. For the Office of the Public Prosecutor 
</b></p>
<p>139. <b>A policy for effective criminal investigations should be defined, and 
investigative working methods should be revised. Reports of threats and attacks 
</b></p>
<p><b>against human rights defenders should be given priority and investigated ex officio 
</b></p>
<p><b>when required. The witness protection programme of the Office of the Public 
</b></p>
<p><b>Prosecutor should be significantly strengthened. Safeguards should be put in place to </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p><b>protect the Human Rights Office of the Public Prosecutor from political interference 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to ensure the physical security of prosecutors, particularly when they are 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigating cases involving members of the police force as alleged perpetrators. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. For the National Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>140. <b>The role and independence of the National Commissioner for Human Rights 
should be strengthened according to the Paris Principles. Cases transmitted by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commissioner should be promptly investigated by the competent authorities. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commissioner should also be consulted in the process of developing human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection mechanisms and, in particular, in the establishment of a protection 
</b></p>
<p><b>programme for human rights defenders. 
</b></p>
<p>141. <b>The functioning of the office of the National Commissioner should be reviewed 
with a view to strengthening the institution by, inter alia, increasing its capacity to 
</b></p>
<p><b>improve its case-handling function and to monitor independently compliance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations by international and regional human rights mechanisms.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. For human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>142. <b>Platforms and networks aimed at promoting and protecting defenders, 
facilitating national and local dialogue and coordination among them should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>developed and strengthened.  
</b></p>
<p>143. <b>Defenders should be better aware of the Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders. In this regard, they should create a comprehensive strategy on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>adoption of national laws on the protection of human rights defenders. 
</b></p>
<p>144. <b>Efforts should be made to continue to make full use of existing international 
and regional human rights mechanisms.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 6. For the international community and donors 
</b></p>
<p>145. <b>The United Nations and the international community should support dialogue 
and encourage collaboration between the Government and civil society. 
</b></p>
<p>146. <b>The situation of human rights defenders, in particular the most targeted and 
vulnerable ones, should be constantly monitored, and support for their work should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be provided in order to empower civil society.  
</b></p>
<p>147. <b>Attacks against human rights defenders should be condemned publically. The 
situation of human rights defenders should constitute a high priority in dialogue with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the authorities. 
</b></p>
<p>148. <b>Diplomatic missions should be familiar with the Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders, and are encouraged to pay due attention to the European Union 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders and the Manual thereon. 
</b></p>
<p>149. <b>Recommendations by international and regional human rights mechanisms, 
including those made by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>encouraged, monitored and included in institution-building, as well as in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of development programmes.</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 7. For all stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>150. <b>Any stigmatization of human rights defenders, whether by public or private 
entities, such as the media, should be discouraged and sanctioned.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>24</b>  
</p>
<p>151. <b>National reconciliation in the country should be promoted by all players in 
society, and efforts should be continued to raise the awareness of the general public 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to foster a spirit of dialogue and cooperation in society. 
</b></p>
<p>152. <b>The Declaration on Human Rights Defenders should be disseminated widely.</b> <b>
