</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and relevant international human rights treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights and the 
Human Rights Council on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, in particular 
Council resolution 20/8 of 5 July 2012, on the promotion, protection, and enjoyment of 
human rights on the Internet, as well as resolutions 12/16 of 2 October 2009, on freedom of 
opinion and expression, and 23/2 of 13 June 2013, on the role of freedom of opinion and 
expression in women&#8217;s empowerment, and also recalling General Assembly resolutions 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>68/167 of 18 December 2013, on the right to privacy in the digital age, and 68/198 of 20 
December 2013, on information and communications technologies for development, and 
Human Rights Council decision 25/117 of 27 March 2014 on the panel on the right to 
privacy in the digital age, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of the Internet 
Governance, held in S&#227;o Paulo on 23 and 24 April 2014, which acknowledged, inter alia, 
the need for human rights to underpin Internet governance and that rights that people have 
offline must also be protected online, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that the exercise of human rights, in particular the right to freedom of 
expression, on the Internet is an issue of increasing interest and importance as the rapid 
pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use new 
information and communication technologies, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting also </i>the importance of building confidence and trust in the Internet, not least 
with regard to freedom of expression, privacy and other human rights so that the potential 
of the Internet as, inter alia, an enabler for development and innovation can be realized, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that access to information on the Internet facilitates vast opportunities 
for affordable and inclusive education globally, thereby being an important tool to facilitate 
the promotion of the right to education, while underlining the need to address digital 
literacy and the digital divide, as it affects the enjoyment of the right to education, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that, for the Internet to remain global, open and interoperable, it is 
imperative that States address security concerns in accordance with their international 
human rights obligations, in particular with regard to freedom of expression, freedom of 
association and privacy, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> <i>with appreciation</i> of the reports of the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, submitted to 
the Human Rights Council at its seventeenth and twenty-third sessions,1 and to the General 
Assembly at its sixty-sixth session,<footnote name="2">A/66/290. </footnote> on freedom of expression on the Internet, 
</p>
<p><i>Considering</i> the key importance of government engagement with all relevant 
stakeholders, including civil society, private sector, the technical community and academia, 
in protecting and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms online, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Affirms</i> that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected 
online, in particular freedom of expression, which is applicable regardless of frontiers and 
through any media of one&#8217;s choice, in accordance with articles 19 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Recognizes</i> the global and open nature of the Internet as a driving force in 
accelerating progress towards development in its various forms; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to promote and facilitate access to the Internet, and 
international cooperation aimed at the development of media and information and 
communication facilities and technologies in all countries; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Affirms</i> that quality education plays a decisive role in development, and 
therefore calls upon all States to promote digital literacy and facilitate access to information 
on the Internet, which can be an important tool in facilitating the promotion of the right to 
education; 
</p>

 A/HRC/17/27 and A/HRC/23/40 and Corr.1. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>5. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to address security concerns on the Internet in 
accordance with their international human rights obligations to ensure protection of 
freedom of expression, freedom of association, privacy and other human rights online, 
including through national democratic, transparent institutions, based on the rule of law, in 
a way that ensures freedom and security on the Internet so that it can continue to be a 
vibrant force that generates economic, social and cultural development; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Also</i> <i>calls upon</i> all States to consider formulating, through transparent and 
multi-stakeholder processes, and adopting national Internet-related public policies that 
affirm the global, open and interoperable nature of the Internet, and have the objective of 
universal access and enjoyment of human rights at its core; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Encourages</i> the special procedures to take these issues into account within 
their existing mandates, as applicable; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of the promotion, protection and 
enjoyment of human rights, including the right to freedom of expression, on the Internet 
and other technologies, as well as of how the Internet can be an important tool for 
development and for exercising human rights, in accordance with its programme of work.
