<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report is submitted in accordance with decision 1/102 of the 
Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p> In his introduction to the report, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
for human rights in Cambodia provides an account of his second mission to Cambodia in 
March 2006, and details his continuing concerns, which were reflected in his subsequent 
statement to the Human Rights Council in September. 
</p>
<p> In the report, the Special Representative addresses problems of a systemic nature from 
the perspective of commitments in the peace agreements adopted in Paris on 23 October 1991.  
These agreements recognized the central importance of human rights in establishing and 
maintaining peace and prosperity for all Cambodians, and contained provisions to promote 
human rights and constitutional guarantees for their protection.  
</p>
<p> He concludes his report with recommendations designed to assist the Government and 
the people of Cambodia to secure the observance and enjoyment of human rights for all 
Cambodians. 
</p>
<p> The Special Representative notes the start of proceedings within Extraordinary Chambers 
of the Courts of Cambodia to try senior Khmer Rouge leaders and those most responsible for the 
atrocities of the regime of Democratic Kampuchea.  The purpose of the trials, to recognize the 
value of and promote respect for human rights, to acknowledge the evils of impunity, and to 
strengthen the rule of law and the machinery of justice, will be futile unless the Government 
agrees to stop practices, documented in this and in previous reports of special representatives, 
which undermine these very objectives.  The Special Representative also points to the special 
responsibilities of the international community to support Cambodia in its quest to strengthen 
human rights and ensure social justice. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council 
decision 1/102, in which the Council decided to extend exceptionally for one year the mandates 
and the mandate-holders of all the Commission&#8217;s special procedures, subject to the review that 
the Council is to undertake in conformity with General Assembly resolution 60/251. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Representative undertook a second mission to Cambodia 
from 19 to 28 March 2006.  The main purpose of the mission was to discuss his report and 
recommendations to the Commission on Human Rights at its sixty-second session, and to update 
himself on issues that had been the focus of his analysis in the report. 
</p>
<p>3. During his mission, he had discussions with Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng, the 
Ministers of Women&#8217;s Affairs and Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction and 
other senior officials of the Government of Cambodia.  He also met members of the 
Constitutional Council and judiciary, leaders of political parties, representatives of human rights, 
legal aid and trade union organizations, the United Nations Country Team, bilateral and 
multilateral development cooperation agencies and the diplomatic community.  He visited 
Kompong Speu and Battambang provinces, where he met with victims of land disputes and with 
representatives of non-governmental organizations and provincial authorities. 
</p>
<p>4. In his public statement at the end of the mission, he welcomed the mid-January 2006 
releases from prison and the return to Cambodia of several persons active in public life, charged 
variously with criminal defamation, disinformation and incitement in the latter part of 2005.  At 
the same time, he expressed concern that the charges still stood, as a constant threat of re-arrest 
to those released and deterring others from the exercise of the freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>5. He also welcomed the return of the leader of the main opposition party, the release from 
prison of a parliamentarian of the same party, and the restoration of their parliamentary 
immunity. 
</p>
<p>6. He concluded that most of the long-standing issues discussed in his report remain valid 
and pressing.  He reiterated his recommendation that specific provisions regarding defamation, 
disinformation and incitement of the Provisions relating to the Judiciary and Criminal Law and 
Procedure applicable in Cambodia during the Transitional Period (commonly known as the 
&#8220;UNTAC<b>1</b> law&#8221;) should be repealed without delay, and that no provision for criminal defamation 
should be retained in the new Penal Code.  He noted that in parallel with discussions on a new 
openness, legislation was being drafted that could limit freedom of association and assembly.  
He expressed concern about continuing executive interference in the work of the judiciary and 
the inability of the Supreme Council of Magistracy to carry out its role of safeguarding the 
integrity and independence of judges.  Impunity for serious human rights violations remained 
deeply rooted in Cambodia, and this would be difficult to overcome without an independent, 
competent and impartial judiciary. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>7. He was concerned that land grabbing continued to deprive the rural poor and indigenous 
communities of their land and livelihoods.  He recommended a moratorium on concessions and 
land sales of indigenous lands until a clear policy and the necessary legislation were in place to 
safeguard the rights of indigenous peoples.  He hoped that the improved political climate would 
translate into concrete measures to effect real and tangible change. 
</p>
<p>8. Following his mission, he explained in a letter to the Prime Minister that the starting 
point and framework for his engagement as Special Representative of the Secretary-General for 
human rights in Cambodia rested firmly on Cambodia&#8217;s Constitution and the implementation of 
the international human rights treaties to which Cambodia is party.  He welcomed the 
Government&#8217;s stated commitment to positive change, including in the area of human rights, and 
brought his continuing concerns to the attention of the Prime Minister.  He expressed his wish to 
work constructively with the Government, and to benefit from the views and guidance of the 
Prime Minister, whom he had not yet had the honour to meet, in the discharge of his mandate. 
</p>
<p>9. He presented his report and recommendations to the Human Rights Council in 
September 2006.  In his statement to the Council, he expressed disappointment that few of his 
own or his predecessors&#8217; recommendations had been implemented, that human rights continued 
to be violated on a systemic scale, and that this could not be explained away by poverty or 
massive violations of human rights during the period of Democratic Kampuchea.  He regretted 
the ruling party&#8217;s dominance of the political sphere, the subversion of the Constitution and the 
legal and judicial system, the entrenched corruption and the impact of illegal land grabbing on 
the rural poor.  He emphasized the responsibility of the international community to support the 
people of Cambodia in their quest for justice and accountability.  He stressed that he did not 
underestimate the difficulties that countries face in the aftermath of war and conflict.  He had 
first visited Cambodia in 1992 and seen the state of the country at the time it was just emerging 
from years of war and civil strife.  He recognized the progress that had been made in rebuilding 
Cambodia.  However, 15 years after the signing of the peace agreements at the Paris Conference 
on Cambodia in October 1991, most of the human rights provisions contained therein had not 
been fulfilled. 
</p>
<p>10. In the discharge of his mandate, the Special Representative has continued to closely 
follow the situation in Cambodia and to be guided by the priorities of the Commission on Human 
Rights resolution 2005/77.  In this report the Special Representative has taken a longer-term 
view, concentrating on problems of a systemic nature which must be tackled if Cambodia is to 
flourish and its people are to have decent lives. 
</p>
<p>11. With the year 2006 marking the fifteenth anniversary of the peace agreements, it is an 
appropriate time to assess the fulfilment of their provisions.  Each of the three documents 
adopted by the Conference - the Agreement on a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the 
Cambodia Conflict, the Agreement concerning the Sovereignty, Independence, Territorial 
Integrity and Inviolability, Neutrality and National Unity of Cambodia, and the Declaration on 
the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Cambodia - recognized the central importance of the 
protection and promotion of human rights in establishing and maintaining peace and prosperity 
for all Cambodians, and contained provisions for the promotion of human rights as well as 
constitutional guarantees for their protection. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>12. In these agreements, the Cambodian authorities undertook to protect human rights and to 
ensure that the policies and practices of the past would never be repeated.  Noting that 
Cambodia&#8217;s &#8220;tragic recent history requires special measures to ensure protection of human 
rights&#8221;, the agreements set out in detail the human rights provisions to be included in the new 
Constitution, which should contain a declaration of fundamental rights.  These rights should be 
enforced by an independent judiciary, and &#8220;aggrieved individuals&#8221; should be able to enforce 
their rights before the courts.  Adherence to international human rights instruments was also a 
core part of the agreements.  
</p>
<p>13. The agreements were intended to have a lasting effect, beyond the end of the transitional 
period.  They provided for continual respect for and observance of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms; the right of all Cambodian citizens to undertake activities to promote and 
protect human rights and fundamental freedoms; effective measures to ensure that the policies 
and practices of the past are not allowed to return; adherence to international human rights 
instruments; the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Cambodia with full respect for human rights 
for all; and an undertaking of other signatories to promote and encourage respect for and 
observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cambodia, as embodied in the 
international instruments. 
</p>
<p>14. The agreements gave the Commission on Human Rights a continuing mandate to monitor 
the human rights situation after the end of the transitional period, including by the appointment 
of a Special Rapporteur.  Since 1993, the Secretary-General has appointed four special 
representatives for human rights in Cambodia, whom he has successively entrusted with 
maintaining contact with the Government and the people, and assisting the Government in the 
promotion and protection of human rights.  The Commission on Human Rights and the 
General Assembly, in their resolutions on Cambodia supported and encouraged the Government 
to strengthen its efforts to further the observance of human rights and the rule of law. 
</p>
<p><b>I. ADHERENCE TO INTERNATIONAL  
HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS 
</b></p>
<p>15. Cambodia was already party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination when in 1992 it acceded to five of the remaining six core 
international human rights treaties.  It has subsequently ratified the two optional protocols on 
children&#8217;s rights.  It is not party to the second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, although the Constitution does abolish the death penalty, and it has not 
accepted individual communications or inquiries under the treaties which provide for these 
procedures. 
</p>
<p>16. In November 2006, the National Assembly began the process of ratifying the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, which Cambodia signed in September 2005.  Several additional international human 
rights instruments are incorporated into Cambodian law through article 74 of the UNTAC law. 
</p>
<p>17. Cambodia&#8217;s 1993 Constitution contains most basic guarantees of human rights.  Through 
article 31 of the Constitution, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the human rights 
treaties were given the force of law.  Article 48 specifically guarantees the protection of the 
rights of children, as enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>18. When the Special Representative met the President and some members of the 
Constitutional Council during his second mission to discuss the Council&#8217;s role in enforcing the 
constitutional guarantees of human rights, he was concerned about the fact that some members 
had doubts as to the direct applicability of the treaties in Cambodian law, notwithstanding 
article 31. 
</p>
<p>19. Since the Constitution does not set out in detail the rights it guarantees, the human rights 
treaties provide crucial substantive elaboration of the content of those rights.  Unless the 
Constitutional Council, as guarantor of the Constitution, is prepared to uphold constitutionally 
protected treaty rights against encroachments from subsequent legislation, human rights cannot 
be adequately protected and Cambodia&#8217;s assertion that the treaties take precedence over national 
law cannot be sustained. 
</p>
<p>20. While Cambodia&#8217;s adherence to international human rights instruments is to be 
applauded, to protect human rights and meet these international obligations the Government 
must ensure that individuals are able to exercise their rights under the rule of law and claim 
effective remedy when these rights are violated. 
</p>
<p><b>II. EFFECTIVE REMEDY FOR HUMAN RIGHTS  
VIOLATIONS UNDER THE CONSTITUTION 
</b></p>
<p>21. The right to an effective remedy by competent national tribunals for acts violating rights 
granted by the Constitution or by law is a fundamental principle of human rights.  In practice, 
neither the constitutional guarantees of human rights, nor the institutions created by Cambodia&#8217;s 
Constitution to enforce them, provide an effective remedy for violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  The Constitutional Council 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Constitutional Council, which has the responsibility for protecting and interpreting 
the Constitution, has shown a marked reluctance to challenge government legislation on the 
grounds that it violates human rights guarantees.  In December 2004, it asserted the 
constitutionality of the 1991 Law on Demonstrations, despite a widespread view that the Law 
violated the constitutionally guaranteed right to peaceful assembly.  In November 2006, the 
Council approved a Law on the Status of National Assembly Members, rejecting an application 
from a group of opposition members that it violated the constitutional guarantees of 
parliamentary immunity provisions and the right to freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>23. The promulgation of the Law on Aggravating Circumstances for Felonies, promulgated 
in January 2002, in order to increase penalties, illustrates the failure of the institutions 
established under the Constitution, i.e. the Government, the National Assembly, the Senate, the 
Constitutional Council and the courts, to uphold rights guaranteed in the Constitution and to 
ensure that children receive the protections provided for in the Constitution and the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>24. When the draft law was being debated in the Senate on 6 December 2001, 34 out 
of 51 senators voted against the draft.  Three dissenting senators were summarily dismissed from 
their posts by the Cambodian People&#8217;s Party, a case that was subsequently pursued by the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Inter-Parliamentary Union.  When the bill was sent back to the National Assembly, the 
Assembly&#8217;s Permanent Commission on Legislation without further debate forwarded the Law to 
the King for promulgation. 
</p>
<p>25. The Law substantially revised certain criminal law provisions.  Article 8 compels judges 
to apply the maximum sentences to those convicted for felonies, overriding the obligation placed 
on judges by article 68 (1) of the UNTAC law to weigh attenuating circumstances, and to reduce 
sentences below the minimum punishments prescribed by law or give a suspended sentence.  
Article 8 also invalidated article 68 (2) of the UNTAC law, which allows for the halving of 
prison sentences for persons under the age of 18. 
</p>
<p>26. During his second mission, the Special Representative met with representatives of legal 
aid organizations, who drew his attention to the harsh effects that the uncompromising 
provisions of this law have on children, effects which are compounded by the definition of any 
theft involving two or more people as felony.  Although most judges feel constrained to apply 
the law, some have continued to apply the UNTAC provisions in cases of juveniles. 
</p><p>27. The effect of the law would seem to constitute a prima facie breach of Cambodia&#8217;s 
international obligations to consider non-custodial and minimum sentencing options for 
juveniles, under article 37 (b) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  As such, it may be 
unconstitutional as a consequence of articles 31 and 48, which specifically guarantee the 
Convention.  However, no attempt has been made to test the Law&#8217;s constitutionality either 
through the courts or directly with the Constitutional Council. 
</p>
<p>28. Under the Constitution and its implementing legislation, anyone involved in a legal suit 
may request the court to consider the constitutionality of any law or decision of a State 
institution which affects their fundamental rights and freedoms, thus giving defendants the 
important right to challenge the constitutionality not only of laws but also of executive decisions 
against them.  However, the right can be denied by the cumbersome rule that the court trying the 
case must first determine whether there is sufficient legal basis for the claim that the law is 
unconstitutional.  The court must then refer the matter to the Supreme Court within 10 days.  The 
Supreme Court has 15 days in which to determine whether the case is &#8220;acceptable&#8221; and, if so, to 
refer the matter to the Constitutional Council for a decision.  There are no known cases of courts 
initiating this procedure. 
</p>
<p>29. Individuals not involved in a court case have very restricted rights under the Constitution 
to seek the Council&#8217;s assistance to claim their constitutional rights.  Nor can the Council itself 
initiate reviews of national legislation.  Reviews can only be undertaken at the request of the 
King, the Prime Minister, the President of the National Assembly or Senate, one tenth of 
National Assembly members or a quarter of senators.  Citizens may request their representatives 
to forward their case to the Council but cannot appeal in their own right if their request is 
declined.  Of the 36 cases published in the <i>Official Gazette</i> since July 1998 which had challenged 
the constitutionality of laws, the Council found only 5 to be unconstitutional, each of which 
following requests submitted by persons affiliated to the Government. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Representative recalls and reiterates his concern about the impartiality of the 
Constitutional Council in the light of its current composition and the affiliation of six of its nine 
members with the Cambodian People&#8217;s Party. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Independence of judges and lawyers 
</b>31. The independence of judges is enshrined in the Constitution and further guaranteed 
within criminal procedure through article 1 of the UNTAC law, which incorporated directly into 
Cambodian law the &#8220;Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary&#8221;.  The lack of 
independence of the judiciary and its inability to secure effective remedy for violations of human 
rights have been matters of continual concern to all special representatives and have been noted 
repeatedly in resolutions of the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>32. In practice, the judiciary has not been able to exercise effective restraint against executive 
power.  Judges have continued to be subject to political interference, and have been unable or 
unwilling to exercise their functions independently.  Corruption has continued to be widespread. 
</p>
<p>33. The Supreme Council of Magistracy, the constitutional organ charged with protecting the 
independence and professional integrity of judges, including prosecutors, is widely 
acknowledged to be unable to carry out its role credibly and effectively.  As the Special 
Representative stated in his last report, the Council requires wholesale reform, in line with the 
constitutional principle of separation of powers, so that its composition represents the judicial 
profession free from political influence.  It is difficult to see how the independence of judges 
can be guaranteed when their regulatory body includes in its ranks one government minister 
ex officio and one member of the permanent committee of the ruling party.  Judges are, like 
other citizens, entitled to freedom of expression, belief, association and assembly, provided, 
however, that in exercising such rights, they always conduct themselves in such a manner as to 
preserve the dignity of their office and the impartiality and independence of the judiciary.  In a 
democracy, the judiciary must not only be independent but must be seen to be independent. 
</p><p>34. The proposed amendment to the 1994 Law establishing the Supreme Council of 
Magistracy has been placed on hold, pending the finalization of laws on the organization of the 
courts and on the status of judges and prosecutors, whose status and conditions of service remain 
regulated by vague and scattered legislation prepared on an ad hoc basis since the 1992 UNTAC 
law. 
</p>
<p>35. A law protecting judicial tenure, an appointment process, a code of conduct, benefits and 
a clearly defined salary structure for judges should have been drafted immediately after the 
Constitution.  The Special Representative is of the view that the drafting of these three laws 
should be coordinated, within a holistic reform which takes account of the Constitution, the 
Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary and other relevant international 
instruments.  This would ensure that the commitment made in the peace agreements to develop 
the judiciary is kept. 
</p><p>36. The system of prosecutions pollutes the system of justice.  Many prosecutors fail to meet 
national and international standards guaranteeing that investigations and prosecutions are 
pursued with impartiality and integrity, and in the public interest rather than partisan interest.  
Complaints filed by senior government officials, even when based on weak or unsubstantiated 
evidence, are prosecuted with vigour, while the vast majority of the populace have little hope or 
expectation of having their grievances taken up by public prosecutors. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>37. The independence of lawyers is essential to the right to an effective defence guaranteed 
in the Constitution.  In accordance with the due process guarantees in the human rights treaties 
and protections for defendants incorporated into the Constitution in article 38, the Government 
has a duty to ensure that lawyers are able to perform their professional functions without 
intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference, free from the threat of prosecution 
or other sanctions. 
</p>
<p>38. The Bar Association of the Kingdom of Cambodia was created by law in 1995 to regulate 
the legal profession as &#8220;an independent and autonomous profession&#8221;.  However, the 
independence of the Bar is widely perceived as having been compromised in recent years.  
Elections for the Bar Association&#8217;s presidency and the Bar Council have become highly 
politicized.  The appointment of the Prime Minister and senior government ministers to the Bar 
in 2004 and 2006, notwithstanding their lack of requisite legal qualifications, has undermined the 
reputation and integrity of the Bar Association as an independent institution.  Elections in 
October 2006 ended a dispute over the presidency that had paralysed the Association for two 
years in favour of the Acting President, who was widely perceived as the government candidate.  
The President&#8217;s strident position with regard to the establishment and role of a Defence Office 
within the Extraordinary Chambers for the Khmer Rouge trials has resurrected concern that the 
Bar is not independent and does not serve the best interests of all lawyers, regardless of their 
political affiliation. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Representative is also concerned that highly questionable criminal charges of 
forgery, which carry a prison sentence of up to 15 years, remain pending against several, now 
former, Bar Council members who resisted the politicization of the legal profession. 
</p>
<p>40. The lack of independence and integrity of the judiciary, the prosecutorial authorities, and 
the legal profession pose a fundamental threat to human rights.  Ministers and senior government 
officials enjoy wide immunities for breaches of the law, while innocent people become, at the 
instigation of the Government, the victims of the legal system.  Thus, far from protecting human 
rights, the legal system becomes a principal agency of oppression. 
</p>
<p><b>III. THE RIGHT TO DEFEND HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL  
FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION, ASSOCIATION AND ASSEMBLY 
</b></p>
<p>41. The peace agreements guarantee the right of all Cambodian citizens to undertake 
activities to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms.  In the last 15 years, 
individually, and in association with others, Cambodia&#8217;s citizens have worked energetically for 
the human rights of all Cambodians, and for the specific rights of women, children, workers, the 
disabled, minorities and others. 
</p>
<p>42. While the Government has generally been supportive of educational activities, it has been 
wary of advocacy, and has generally reacted harshly to activities that are critical of its policies 
and practices.  It has been hostile to organizations defending, advocating and monitoring human 
rights.  Members of these organizations have frequently encountered the perversion of law 
enforcement and justice, and, on the part of State authorities, a reluctance to accept 
accountability, vaguely plausible denial followed by delays and obfuscation, and reliance on 
crimes being forgotten. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>43. The development of the media, crucial for human rights and democracy, has been 
negatively affected in Cambodia by unresolved murders of journalists, threats against editors, 
and attacks on newspaper offices.  Although the July 1995 press law contains some positive 
provisions, it prohibits, contrary to the spirit of the Constitution and international norms, 
&#8220;humiliation of national institutions&#8221;, and authorizes the suspension of publications and 
imprisonment of journalists for publishing or reproducing information which &#8220;may affect 
national security and political stability&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>44. Cambodia has ratified most of the relevant International Labour Organization 
conventions.  Some unions, however, have experienced continuing difficulties in exercising their 
rights, and since the anti-Thai riots of 29 January 2003, requests to hold demonstrations have 
been routinely refused.  The police continue to break up marches and demonstrations, citing 
public order.  The murders in 2004 of Chea Vichea and Ros Sovannareth of the Free Trade 
Union of Workers of the Kingdom of Cambodia remain unresolved, with a continuing chilling 
effect on union activities. 
</p>
<p>45. To participate meaningfully and effectively in public and political life, Cambodia&#8217;s 
citizens must be able to organize and associate with others and speak with a collective voice; 
express themselves freely, seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds in a 
climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats; and enjoy an elementary level of economic 
security and well-being. 
</p>
<p>46. Regarding freedom of expression, the Special Representative regrets that his 
recommendation to the Government to suspend or repeal the defamation, disinformation and 
incitement provisions in the UNTAC law was not taken up.  Article 63 of the law concerning 
defamation was amended in May 2006 to remove the prison penalties for defamation, but heavy 
fines can nevertheless still be imposed.  Defamation remains in the draft penal code.  Although 
no new cases of defamation have been reported since the amendment, the Government has 
instead used the provision on &#8220;disinformation&#8221;, an offence which carries a punishment of six 
months to three years in prison, and therefore allows for pretrial detention pending trial.  It also 
carries heavy fines. 
</p>
<p>47. Under article 62 of the UNTAC law, disinformation occurs when:  &#8220;The director or other 
party responsible for the publication or other means of communication who took the decision to 
publish, distribute or reproduce by any means information which is false, fabricated, falsified or 
untruthfully attributed to a third person and did so in bad faith and with malicious intent, 
provided that the publication, distribution or reproduction has disturbed or is likely to disturb the 
public peace.&#8221;  This should require a high standard of proof for a conviction:  the information 
has to be false or falsified or wrongly attributed; its publication has to be in bad faith and with 
malicious intent; and its publication has to have caused or have been likely to cause a breach of 
public order. 
</p>
<p>48. The following two cases illustrate the Special Representative&#8217;s concern.  Deputy Prime 
Minister Sok An filed a complaint against the editor of the newspaper <i>Moneaksekar</i> for 
publishing an article on 13 June 2006 that reported alleged tensions between members of the 
Cambodian People&#8217;s Party and the Minister, as a result of the concentration of power and 
corruption in his hands.  The case was heard on 15 September.  The editor and his lawyer did not </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>appear in court.  The court found the editor guilty of disinformation and sentenced him to fines 
of some $2,000 to be paid to the State and some $2,500 to be paid to Minister Sok An.  In this 
case the judge considered that the article itself was sufficient evidence to secure a conviction for 
disinformation. 
</p>
<p>49. Teang Narith, a law and political science lecturer at Sihanouk Raj Buddhist University in 
Phnom Penh, was arrested and detained on 4 September 2006, and charged with disinformation 
in connection with his manuscript &#8220;Political Philosophy&#8221;, which contained criticisms of senior 
government officials.  He remains in pretrial detention.  He is reliably reported to suffer from 
mental health problems, and his welfare is a matter of great concern.  He requires proper care 
and attention and should be immediately released. 
</p>
<p>50. In August 2006 the National Assembly amended the Law on the Status of National 
Assembly Members, putting members at greater risk.  In derogation of the Constitution as well 
as international norms, the Law imposes extensive qualifications on their immunity in respect of 
freedom of expression.  It subjects Members whose comments are deemed to abuse an 
individual&#8217;s dignity, social customs, public order and national security to the same legal penalties 
that already restrict the freedom of expression of Cambodian citizens.  The same Law authorizes 
the arrest of members without prior lifting of immunity.  As he was finalizing this report, the 
Special Representative was informed that the National Assembly had amended article 120 of the 
Law on Election of Assembly Members on 15 December, according to which Members 
convicted of a crime or misdemeanour will automatically lose their seats. 
</p>
<p>51. Articles 37 and 41 of the Constitution guarantee the right to strike, to peaceful 
demonstration and freedom of assembly.  However, the Government continued to restrict these 
rights in 2006 through routine and arbitrary denial of permissions for demonstrations and public 
gatherings.  The attitude of the authorities towards public assembly has remained one of 
restriction rather than facilitation.  Where demonstrations or gatherings took place without 
permission, excessive and disproportionate force was recorded in several instances, with police 
now routinely carrying and using electric batons. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Representative is concerned that demonstrations per se are generally 
presumed to be threatening to the Government, an attitude that manifests itself both through the 
decisions not to authorize demonstrations and in the draft law currently being prepared by the 
Ministry of the Interior to regulate assembly.  The apparent starting point of the Government&#8217;s 
approach to the draft Law on Freedom of Assembly and Peaceful Demonstration seems to be 
restriction, rather than freedom subject to an appropriate regulatory framework.  The 
Government has also indicated its preference for freedom of assembly to be exercised on private 
premises behind closed doors.  A law on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) has been on 
the Government&#8217;s agenda since 1995.  The Government has argued that article 42 of the 
Constitution obliges it to draft one.  Article 42 states that Khmer citizens shall have the right to 
establish associations and political parties.  These rights shall be determined by law.  It also 
states that Khmer citizens may take part in mass organizations for mutual benefit to protect 
national achievements and social order. 
</p>
<p>53. As noted in the Special Representative&#8217;s previous report, in 2005 the Ministry of the 
Interior asked the World Bank to assist in the drafting of the law.  In the World Bank&#8217;s view, a 
law may not be required, and it has proposed a dialogue between NGOs and the Government to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>identify the problems that each encounter.  Human rights and advocacy organizations remain 
understandably troubled about the Government&#8217;s intentions, concerned that its motives are to 
restrict rather than facilitate their activities. 
</p>
<p>54. It will be important for the upcoming 2007 Commune Council and 2008 National 
Assembly elections to be conducted in a climate free from fear, where fundamental freedoms are 
fully respected and upheld.  These will be the first elections following the constitutional 
amendment in March 2006 to reduce the number of lawmakers required to form a government 
from a two-thirds to a simple majority. 
55. The Special Representative&#8217;s predecessor reported 43 murders during the last election 
period where a political motivation was strongly suspected.  Most cases involved members of the 
Sam Rainsy and Funcinpec<b>2</b> parties, and the majority have not been credibly resolved.  In the 
context of the upcoming elections, the Government must take, and be seen to take, effective 
protection measures to reassure Cambodian citizens of their safety, and promptly investigate all 
murders and serious threats and intimidation against politically active persons.  Electoral 
authorities should not deal with complaints that involve violations of criminal law. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  IMPUNITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
</b></p>
<p>56. The peace agreements stipulated that the tragic history of Cambodia requires special 
measures to ensure the protection of human rights and the non-return to the policies and practices 
of the past.  A report completed by the Special Representative&#8217;s predecessor in October 2005<b>3</b> 
shows that since the early 1990s the vast majority of the many murders of politicians, journalists, 
trade unionists and other Cambodians active in political and public life have remained 
unresolved, including the contract killing of trade union leader Chea Vichea in central 
Phnom Penh in January 2004.  In this case, two men widely believed to be innocent were 
immediately arrested and convicted of the crime in August 2005.  On 6 October 2006, the 
Appeal Court immediately adjourned its hearing of their appeal on the grounds that a judge had 
suddenly taken ill.  No date for a new hearing has been set. 
</p>
<p>57. Impunity means that Cambodia&#8217;s citizens are not protected by law.  As the report states, 
it exists where individuals who break the law and commit violations of human rights are exempt 
from any punishment, and are not brought to account in any proceedings - whether criminal, 
civil, administrative or disciplinary - or made subject to any penalties, and where no reparation is 
made to the victims.  With impunity there is no protection of human rights.  Impunity is the 
opposite of accountability and the antithesis of the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>

Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia&#8221;.

</p>
<p>following web address:  http://cambodia.ohchr.org/download.aspx?ep_id=242. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>58. Impunity for serious violations of human rights does not only affect the direct victims.  
As the report notes, where party workers are killed before an election, this has an impact on the 
freedom of the democratic process.  Where a journalist or editor is murdered, or a newspaper&#8217;s 
offices attacked, this limits freedom of the press and of expression.  Where someone charged 
with the criminal offence of human trafficking bribes a prosecutor or judge to drop the charges, 
the court in effect condones the act.  Where police instigate or facilitate a mob killing, and no 
sanction is imposed, they become complicit in the crime.  Where a union leader is killed and 
those responsible remain at large, this threatens wider labour rights and freedom of association.  
There is also impunity where corruption is unchecked or scarce medical resources are diverted 
from the neediest without oversight and accountability, or where land is acquired in breach of the 
law, and results in the dispossession of rural populations and the loss of basic livelihoods. 
</p>
<p>59. The report also notes that impunity has other far-reaching effects insofar as it allows 
official authority to be abused for personal enrichment or to maintain vested interests by 
operating outside the law.  It also results in the distorted allocation of economic resources, 
further exacerbating existing inequalities and perpetuating poverty. 
</p>
<p>60. The Government must take, and be seen to take, effective measures to end impunity.  In 
this context the Extraordinary Chambers represent a hope, which must not be squandered, of 
breaking the pattern of impunity that has characterized Cambodia&#8217;s history in recent decades. 
</p>
<p><b>V. REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF CAMBODIA  
WITH FULL RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS FOR ALL 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Declaration on the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Cambodia, which was part 
of the Paris peace agreements, provided that the primary objective of the reconstruction of 
Cambodia should be &#8220;the advancement of the Cambodian nation and people, without 
discrimination or prejudice, and with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedom for 
all&#8221;.  It also provided that economic aid should benefit all areas of Cambodia, especially the 
more disadvantaged, and reach all levels of society.  The peace agreements recognized the 
centrality of human rights in promoting equitable and sustainable development in Cambodia. 
</p>
<p>62. The National Strategic Development Plan 2006 to 2010 is the master development plan 
for Cambodia, and all bilateral and multilateral aid is expected to be aligned and harmonized 
with its priorities and principles.  While it commits the Government to key principles such as 
participation, non-discrimination and accountability, it does not include concrete measures to 
translate these principles into practice.  Nor does it emphasize the importance of human rights to 
reducing poverty and achieving the Cambodian Millennium Development Goals.  The 
Government and its development-cooperation partners should acknowledge the central role of 
human rights protection and promotion in securing political stability and socio-economic 
development. 
</p>
<p>63. Despite a decade of considerable economic growth and influx of aid, growth has been 
largely confined to urban areas.  Most of Cambodia&#8217;s population is clustered around the poverty 
line; and it is estimated that 35 per cent subsist below this level.  The World Bank&#8217;s report 
<i>Cambodia Poverty Assessment 2006</i> found that although poverty has been reduced, the 
distribution of increased wealth shows a growing and alarming gap between the rich and the 
poor.  Landlessness is rising rapidly due to a mix of factors, including land grabbing, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>accompanied by declining access to common property resources.  The report concluded that with 
present trends Cambodia will not meet the Millennium Development Goal of halving poverty 
by 2015.  The Cambodia Development Resource Institute, a research institute in Phnom Penh, 
also concluded in a recent draft study that there is little evidence of a significant reduction in 
income poverty, human deprivation and inequality. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Representative notes with concern that the Government has yet to submit 
Cambodia&#8217;s initial report on its compliance with the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, which was due in 1994.  This report and its consideration by the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights presents a valuable opportunity to explicitly integrate 
Cambodia&#8217;s progressive realization of the rights in the Covenant into the National Strategic 
Development Plan, and for the Government, NGOs, development cooperation and international 
agencies together to identify and discuss ways to overcome the obstacles to the enjoyment of 
these rights. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  ACCESS TO LAND AND LIVELIHOODS 
</b></p>
<p>65. The majority of Cambodia&#8217;s population lives in rural areas and depends heavily on land 
and natural resources as a source of livelihood.  Thus the question of how Cambodia manages 
and distributes its land and natural resources, and for whose benefit, is one of the most pressing 
issues facing the country today.  It is also critical to the ability of all Cambodians to benefit from 
equitable and sustainable development that respects and promotes their human rights. 
</p>
<p>66. Contrary to the principles set out in the Declaration on the Rehabilitation and 
Reconstruction of Cambodia, Cambodia&#8217;s rural populations find themselves increasingly 
displaced from the land, forests and other resources upon which many depend and have 
legitimate claim, without any protection of the law.  The Constitution states that all Cambodian 
citizens have the right to private ownership of land, a right which shall be protected by law.  The 
Land Law of 2001 provides that any person who has enjoyed peaceful and uncontested 
possession of land prior to 2001 has the right to request a definitive title of ownership.  However,  
government authorities, who bear the responsibility of upholding people&#8217;s rights as set out in the 
Constitution and Land Law, have been implicated in illegal or coercive land sales that deprive 
rural communities of their land and source of livelihoods.  The judicial system has upheld such 
unlawful land deals, which comply neither with the provisions nor intent of the Land Law, 
leading rural Cambodians to mistrust the judicial system as a means to claim their rights and to 
provide effective redress and remedy. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Representative also expresses continuing concern over the eviction of poor 
people from settlements along the Bassac River in Phnom Penh, and their relocation to sites that 
lack basic infrastructure and services such as water, sanitation and electricity, and whose 
distance from Phnom Penh compromises their ability to earn a living.  Concerns about this 
situation have been raised in public statements by the Special Representative, communications to 
the Government, and a report of the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of 
the right to an adequate standard of living (E/CN.4/2006/41/Add.3). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Economic land concessions in law and practice 
</b></p>
<p>68. Economic land concessions are large-scale industrial-agricultural plantations granted by 
the Government to individuals or companies to promote economic growth and increase 
employment in rural areas.  Notwithstanding this, the World Bank&#8217;s <i>Cambodia Poverty 
Assessment 2006</i> found agricultural productivity to be low.  To promote growth and equity, it 
recommended smallholder agriculture, rather than the current model of large concession or 
plantation-based agriculture. 
</p>
<p>69. It is clear that economic land concessions have not had tangible benefits in rural areas but 
instead have deprived communities of vital sources of livelihoods, thus aggravating and 
worsening their already difficult situation.  It is also clear that the grant of economic land 
concessions has increased the accumulation of property and wealth in the hands of those with 
political or economic influence. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Representative has now been able to study the Land Law of 2001 and its 
sub-decrees on State Land Management and Economic Land Concessions, adopted by the 
Council of Ministers in 2005.  The sub-decree on State Land Management provides that, in 
general, the State is the owner of all land not legally privately or collectively owned or possessed 
under the Land Law, and distinguishes between &#8220;State public&#8221; and &#8220;State private&#8221; land.  The 
sub-decree on Economic Land Concessions states that economic land concessions of up to 
10,000 hectares may be granted over land that has been registered and classified as State private 
land, provided the other prerequisites of an approved land use plan, environmental and social 
impact assessments, public consultations and solutions for resettlement issues are also met.  
Economic land concessions granted prior to the sub-decree shall be reviewed to consider 
contractual compliance, solicit public comments on land concession activities within the local 
communes, and negotiate a reduction in size of concessions in excess of 10,000 hectares. 
</p>
<p>71. In practice, there has not been a systematic process of mapping, classification and 
registration of State land prior to the granting of economic land concessions, as required by law.  
Following the adoption of the sub-decrees, concessions have continued to be granted over land 
before determining whether the land is in fact State private land, and not privately or collectively 
owned or possessed in accordance with the Land Law.  In general, most of the land conceded has 
not been registered or classified as State private land. 
</p>
<p>72. Further, the other prerequisites for granting concessions have not been met.  Where 
environmental and social impact assessments have been conducted to comply with the 
sub-decree&#8217;s requirements, according to reliable information available these assessments are not 
always genuine and accurate. 
</p>
<p>73. For example, the Special Representative is informed that an environmental assessment of 
a concession granted in 2006 in the Sre Ambil district of Koh Kong province talked mainly 
about soil types.  It did not look at broader environmental impact or the social impact on 
communities living and farming on the land covered by the concession.  The requirement of 
public consultations with local residents is also generally overlooked prior to decisions to grant a 
concession, and not enforced by local authorities.  A number of affected communities have </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>stated that they were unaware of plans to grant concessions until the arrival of the company to 
start work, and that they were not consulted, even though they have lived on and cultivated their 
land for many years. 
</p>
<p>74. Not surprisingly, as concessions continue to be granted without proper consultation or 
consideration for the existing ownership, possession and use of land, they are having serious 
adverse impacts on the communities concerned.  Common and shared concerns reported by 
communities include the encroachment of concession companies on their farm land and rice 
fields, leading to food shortages; loss of access to forests to collect and sell non-timber forest 
products; loss of grazing land for livestock; illegal logging; and threats and intimidation from 
company workers and local authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Transparency and availability of information 
</b></p>
<p>75. According to information available, over 40 economic land concessions have been 
formally granted in 14 provinces.  In addition, information has been received about further new 
concessions that may have been granted, including in Kratie, Stung Treng, Ratanakiri, 
Mondulkiri, Kampot and Oddar Meanchey. 
</p>
<p>76. Although the Ministry of Agriculture has taken some steps to disclose information 
through its web site, the information provided is incomplete and the web page often inaccessible.  
According to information available, only one concession contract has been cancelled, which was 
granted in 2000 but never activated.  No information is available on the required review of 
economic land concessions granted prior to the enactment of the Land Law, and the reduction of 
concessions that exceed the 10,000-hectare limit stipulated in the Law. 
</p>
<p>77. The Pheapimex concession, which spans Kompong Chhnang and Pursat provinces, while 
currently inactive, still officially stands at over 300,000 hectares, more than 30 times the limit 
specified in the Land Law.  The Green Sea concession in Stung Treng, granted in 2001 just prior 
to the Land Law, measures over 100,000 hectares, and activity has reportedly begun on the site.  
Reducing existing concessions to 10,000 hectares would release land for social land concessions 
for the very poor, as envisaged by the Land Law. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Representative&#8217;s predecessor, in a report issued in November 2004 on 
economic land concessions from a human rights perspective,<b>4</b> underlined the urgent need for 
public disclosure and accountability mechanisms.  These would help gain a complete 
understanding of the concession system overall, and its impact on and potential benefits for 
Cambodians.  Donors have repeatedly asked for and the Government has repeatedly promised 
that such mechanisms would be established.  Joint monitoring indicators agreed upon at the 
seventh Consultative Group Meeting for Cambodia in December 2004 included the immediate 
disclosure of information on concessions, including mining concessions and military 
development zones.  This call for transparency was repeated at the Group&#8217;s 8th meeting in 
March 2006.  Disclosure of information on the management of land and natural resources

 <p> 
</p>
<p>becomes all the more important with the discovery of significant oil reserves in the Gulf of 
Thailand.  Foreign oil companies have reportedly signed contracts for their exploitation.  
However, these contracts are not in the public domain. 
</p>
<p>79. Two foreign mining companies have been granted an exploration licence for bauxite 
over 100,000 hectares in the predominantly indigenous north-eastern provinces.  Neither the 
geographic scope of the licence nor the terms of the licence have been made public, despite 
concern about the potential impact on local indigenous populations and the environment. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Indigenous peoples and access to land 
</b></p>
<p>80. While indigenous communities in Cambodia face similar problems to other rural 
Cambodians in relation to diminishing access to land, the impact has an added dimension owing 
to their special cultural and spiritual relationship with and dependence on traditional lands as a 
source of livelihood and identity. 
</p>
<p>81. There is widespread concern about the future of indigenous communities in Cambodia, as 
they are rapidly and steadily losing their traditional lands to private individuals and companies 
through illegal or coercive land sales and economic land concessions.  This alarming rate of land 
alienation has grave social, cultural and environmental consequences, and action must be taken 
before it is too late. 
</p>
<p>82. A report released in May 2006 by the NGO Forum on Cambodia, a membership 
organization for information sharing, debate and advocacy on important issues affecting 
Cambodia&#8217;s development, estimates that in Ratanakiri province alone, between late 2004 and 
early 2006, land alienation increased in severity in 30 per cent of the communes, and continued 
unabated in the remaining 70 per cent.  In provinces such as Ratanakiri, Mondulkiri and 
Stung Treng, which have large indigenous populations, land grabbing and economic land 
concessions have led to deforestation and loss of livelihoods and access to land. 
</p>
<p>83. The Land Law recognizes the right of indigenous communities to collective ownership of 
their land, which includes land used for residences and traditional agriculture.  Indigenous 
collective title can be granted over State private or State public land.  While this is an important 
recognition of indigenous land rights, the process of registration of indigenous collective title 
remains long and uncertain.  Pilot projects are under way to register indigenous land in 
Mondulkiri and Ratanakiri, but the process of registration of collective title and overall policy 
framework are unclear, with no designated lead Ministry.  
</p>
<p>84. At the March 2006 Consultative Group meeting of donors and government, it was agreed 
that a strategy and regulatory framework in relation to indigenous peoples would be finalized by 
November 2006.  However, there is as yet no clear policy or strategy on how to protect and 
implement the rights of indigenous peoples, including their rights to land. 
</p>
<p>85. A question commonly asked is:  how much land will remain available for collective 
titling once the administrative process for registration of indigenous collective title is clarified?  
The process and impact of the alienation of indigenous land has been documented by NGOs, and 
illustrates the urgent need for interim measures to protect land eligible for indigenous collective 
ownership. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Access to justice in relation to land and natural resources 
</b>86. The Special Representative is concerned about the increasingly difficult environment 
faced by NGO workers and community activists advocating for equitable access to land and 
natural resources.  He has continued to receive reports of restrictions placed on their activities, 
meetings and movement, and acts of intimidation by authorities and company security.  
Recently, a human rights activist in Ratanakiri province received death threats related to his 
work on land disputes - he has previously been the subject of threats and criminal charges related 
to his land-related activism.  In Mondulkiri, authorities continue to regulate the work of NGOs 
and community activists by asking NGOs for regular reports of their activities and plans, and 
requiring community activists to seek permission before attending meetings outside the province.  
In many cases, authorities have accused NGOs and village activists of inciting trouble in 
communities affected by economic land concessions and land disputes, using this as a pretext for 
restricting their activities.   
</p>
<p>87. In Koh Kong province, NGO workers were denied access to areas affected by an 
economic land concession, and told that they needed permission from the authorities if they 
wished to meet with the local villagers.  In Pursat province, the local authorities told community 
members near another economic land concession not to participate in activities organized by 
community activists, alleging that they were supported by the opposition Sam Rainsy party.   
</p>
<p>88. The Special Representative is particularly concerned about the increasing number of 
community activists facing criminal charges related to land disputes and their land-related 
activism.  He has received numerous reports of community activists being charged with 
infringement of private property, or other criminal offences created by the Land Law, in 
connection with disputes over unregistered land.  It is apparent that the legal system is being 
used to protect those with power and influence, rather than to provide protection and justice for 
poor individuals and communities. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY  
</b></p>
<p>89. In the peace agreements, other signatories undertook to promote and encourage respect 
for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cambodia, as embodied in the 
international instruments in order, in particular, to prevent the reoccurrence of human rights 
abuses.  The Agreement concerning the Sovereignty, Independence, Territorial Integrity and 
Inviolability, Neutrality and National Unity of Cambodia includes provisions in the event of 
violations of the Agreement, including human rights provisions.  These include collective 
efforts by the parties to the Agreement to resolve violations by peaceful means, referral to the 
Security Council or recourse to peaceful settlement means under Article 33 of the Charter of the 
United Nations.  
</p>
<p>90. The Special Representative has underlined the moral and legal responsibility of the 
international community and its members to support Cambodia in its quest to strengthen human 
rights and democratic and accountable institutions, whether as signatories to the agreements, as 
States Members of the United Nations, or as States parties to the human rights treaties.  This was 
the primary rationale for their engagement in Cambodia in the early 1990s.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>91. The Government of Cambodia has produced successive reform plans which speak of 
governance, Millennium Development Goals, sustainable development, poverty reduction, rule 
of law and legal and judicial reform.  It is, however, largely silent on the central issues raised in 
this and in previous reports of special representatives.  That many reform plans have not been 
implemented and that progress has been less than expected is often attributed to continued weak 
institutional capacity, lack of coordination among donors, too many competing demands on 
fragile government institutions, and a lack of qualified people, a legacy of the Khmer Rouge 
period. 
</p>
<p>92. While these may have some validity, the Special Representative has concluded that in 
reality those holding economic and political power are reluctant to support genuine reform when 
they benefit from and rely on their control over State institutions to remain in power. 
</p>
<p>93. It is clear that technical cooperation, training and capacity building alone will not work 
without addressing the underlying problems and without a firm demand for accountability.  The 
use of systemic human rights violations has been a rational choice for those who hold power in 
Cambodia, and who refuse to accept accountability vis-&#224;-vis the law and the people of 
Cambodia.  Different choices might be possible if the costs of repression were to be seen as 
being greater than their immediate benefits.   
</p>
<p>94. As evidence from Cambodia&#8217;s recent history and elsewhere indicates, repression, 
intimidation and extortion can create preconditions for serious counter violence.  The 
Prime Minister has himself recognized this, for example, in his statements on land grabbing.  
</p>
<p>95. The reports and recommendations of the special representatives, the resolutions of the 
Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly and the concluding observations and 
recommendations of the human rights treaty bodies should all be an integral part of the dialogue 
between the Government and donor agencies.  And Cambodia&#8217;s neighbours and influential 
Governments in the Asian region, especially those providing significant development assistance 
and loans to the Government, should be far more active in discharging their responsibilities 
towards Cambodia and its people.  
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>96. With the end of civil conflict, overall security has improved in Cambodia.  Yet, the 
absence of effective institutions of government, basic laws and an impartial judiciary, 
accompanied by continuing impunity and threats against those who criticize the status quo, 
increasing landlessness and growing numbers of displaced persons all leave Cambodia&#8217;s citizens 
insecure, vulnerable to systemic denial and violations of their rights, and exposed to 
well-established methods for maintaining the existing economic and political order.  Few of the 
problems Cambodia faces today are unique:  entrenched corruption at the highest level; a system 
based on patronage; pillaging of natural resources; divide-and-rule tactics; use of the State 
structure to undermine the political opposition; and enrichment of the few to the neglect of the 
many.</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>97. These are all familiar phenomena that have been studied in many countries, including in 
East Asia and in post-conflict settings.  Yet Cambodia is unique insofar as the international 
community has played a central role since the peace agreements in rebuilding the country and its 
institutions, with the aim of establishing a regime based on respect for human rights and the rule 
of law. 
</p>
<p>98. The Special Representative regrets that instead of responding to the concerns raised by 
the special representatives and United Nations bodies, a frequent response of the Government 
has been evasion or accusation, scapegoating and intimidation.   
</p>
<p>99. The protection and enjoyment of human rights are essential to ensure a legacy of peace 
with justice for Cambodia, 15 years after the peace agreements and 27 years after the end of the 
regime of Democratic Kampuchea.   
</p>
<p>100. Important commitments have been made to Cambodia&#8217;s people that cannot be thrown 
aside.  It is the Government&#8217;s duty and responsibility to put in place policies and laws to meet 
these commitments and the duty of the international community to help it in doing so.  More 
fundamentally, the Government, the ruling party, other political parties and Cambodia&#8217;s 
powerful business elites would do well to reflect on the kind of society they want Cambodia to 
become.  
</p>
<p>101. In his message to the children and youth of Cambodia on Human Rights Day 2005, the 
Special Representative expressed concern that attitudes towards human rights have become very 
divisive in Cambodia, that some people consider advocates of human rights as obstacles to 
development, and that in this argument the real meaning of human rights is getting lost.  
</p>
<p>102. He underlined that the fundamental principle of human rights is that everyone is equal in 
rights and dignity, regardless of whether the person is rich or poor, young or old, weak or 
powerful.  While this may upset the current order of things, it creates the possibility of 
relationships based on respect and fairness.  
</p>
<p>103. Solidarity, another important principle of human rights, recognizes that we are all human 
beings, that we share the same needs and aspirations, that we should treat everyone around us 
with tolerance, respect and understanding.  Through the rights of expression and association we, 
as the community, can exchange ideas peacefully and cooperate.  
</p>
<p>104. Human rights are also about our responsibility to our neighbours and to our society, and 
they are about our protection against unjust or oppressive government, creating rules about 
relations between people and the State.  They enable people to choose their leaders and 
determine the policies of the State.  They are about dialogue and participation.  They ensure the 
accountability of the Government and integrity of its leaders.  The idea of dignity, which is so 
central to rights, means that society must try to ensure that everyone has security and that their 
basic needs for food, shelter, clothing and clean water at the bare minimum are met.  Without 
such conditions, people cannot participate on an equal basis, and there can be no justice.   
</p><p>105. The Special Representative looks forward to discussing this report and his 
recommendations on his next mission to Cambodia in early 2007 before presenting them to the 
Human Rights Council at its fourth session.  He finalized this report on 18 December 2006.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IX.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>As deliberate and systemic violations of human rights have become central to the 
Government&#8217;s hold over power, the international community, bound by obligations in the 
Paris peace agreements, should do all it can to persuade and press the Government to 
respect its human rights commitments under the agreements, international human rights 
treaties and the Constitution of Cambodia.  The Government on its part must declare 
unequivocally to the international community and to the people of Cambodia its 
obligations, legal and moral, to stop the abuse of rights and to respect the independence of 
the judiciary and prosecutorial authorities. 
</b>107. <b>The Special Representative reiterates his invitation to the Government to inform the 
Human Rights Council about the concrete measures that it has taken and that it intends to 
take to respond to the recommendations that he and his predecessors have made, and to 
the recommendations of the treaty bodies and the international community through 
resolutions of the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights.  
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The recommendations that follow include previous recommendations not addressed 
in the body of this report.  Together, they can be seen as constituting the minimal elements 
of a plan of action for human rights in Cambodia:  
</b></p>
<p><b>The rule of law and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Adopt measures, as a matter of priority, to ensure the independence, 
impartiality and effectiveness of the Constitutional Council, the Supreme 
Council of the Magistracy and the judicial system as a whole; and allow citizens 
effective access to these institutions to enforce their rights; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Finalize, enact and implement the laws and codes that are essential components 
of the rule of law in accordance with the Constitution and international 
instruments; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Uphold the right of all Cambodian citizens to undertake activities to promote 
and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms by ensuring full respect for 
the United Nations Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, 
Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Fully protect freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association in 
accordance with the Constitution and international instruments.  Ensure that 
any new legislation complies with these instruments.  Repeal provisions in the 
law on defamation, disinformation and incitement.  Ensure access to information 
held by public authorities;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Ensure that law enforcement officials disperse demonstrations and gatherings 
only if absolutely necessary.  Use force only as a last resort, in proportion to the 
threat posed, with minimum damage or injury to persons and property;  </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <b>End forced evictions;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Conduct impartial and credible investigations into grave violations of human 
rights, past and present.  Bring to justice those responsible.  The murder of trade 
union leader, Chea Vichea, is a case in point;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Establish an independent commission to investigate complaints concerning 
military or police conduct;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>End forced confessions as evidence in trials.  Institute a system of regular visits 
of NGOs to police cells and detention centres to prevent torture and cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.  Complete ratification of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and implement its 
provisions;   
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Review sentencing policies.  Introduce non-custodial options as an alternative to 
imprisonment, first and foremost for children;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Ensure that lawyers, family members and human rights organizations have 
regular access to prisoners and detainees.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Access to land and livelihoods 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Make publicly available details of all approved concessions, including contracts, 
maps and information about concession companies and their shareholders; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Enforce the requirement to undertake public consultations and meaningful 
environmental social impact assessments prior to granting economic land 
concessions.  Concessions granted without these requirements being fulfilled 
should be null and void; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Cancel concessions that do not comply with the requirements of the Land Law 
and its sub-decrees.  Provide a mechanism for affected communities to request 
the review and cancellation of non-compliant concessions; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Ban the granting of economic land concessions and other concessions in areas of 
primary forest;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Ban the sale of land and the granting of economic land and other concessions in 
areas occupied by indigenous communities, pending the registration of 
indigenous claims over traditional lands and the collective titling process;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Put in place mechanisms to protect indigenous land pending the registration of 
collective title, and finalize the process of registration of collective title over 
indigenous land; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Protect the rights of NGOs and community activists to advocate for equitable 
access to land and natural resources, without threats, intimidation or restriction 
of their activities.  The legal system must not be used to silence or punish 
activists. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Adherence to International Instruments 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Ratify the Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Accede to the United Nations Convention against Corruption.  Bring the draft 
Anti-Corruption Law into conformity with its provisions;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Submit as a matter of priority Cambodia&#8217;s initial report on its compliance with 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Fully uphold and comply with the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees 
and its 1967 Protocol.  </b>
