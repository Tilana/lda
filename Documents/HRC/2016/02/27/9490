<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p>The present report, submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council decision 1/102, 
aims at providing practical and operational tools to promote, monitor and implement the human 
right to adequate housing.  The report also identifies a normative gap - the non-recognition in 
international human rights law of the human right to land.   
</p>
<p>The conceptual work on human rights indicators has sufficiently progressed and there is 
currently a good basis for endorsing a list of indicators for monitoring the right to adequate 
housing.  The Special Rapporteur urges Governments to test and adapt these to establish national 
benchmarks consistent with their human rights obligations, and to participate actively in piloting 
and validating them with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the 
United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT).   
</p>
<p>In its resolution 2002/49, the Commission on Human Rights entrusted the Special 
Rapporteur with the additional task of conducting a global study on women and adequate 
housing.  He therefore integrated a gender perspective in every aspect of his mandate through the 
development of specific strategies for collecting information from States and civil society 
groups, including the elaboration of a questionnaire on women and housing that has become a 
useful tool for monitoring the realization of women&#8217;s right to housing and land.   
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur has throughout his mandate cautioned against the practice of 
forced evictions.  As a result of an International Workshop on Forced Evictions, basic principles 
and guidelines aimed at assisting States and the international community in significantly 
reducing the practice of forced evictions have been elaborated.  The Special Rapporteur requests 
the Human Rights Council to ensure wide dissemination of the Basic principles and guidelines 
on development-based evictions and displacement annexed to this report and urges States to 
incorporate them into national laws and policies. 
</p>
<p>In addition, this report discusses the importance of, and proposes strategies to strengthen 
the legal framework to promote and implement the human right to land, an issue the Special 
Rapporteur believes is of particular significance for implementing the right to adequate housing. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Throughout his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has favoured a constructive approach to 
promoting the human right to adequate housing.  To this end, the Special Rapporteur uses several 
means.  First, by using the indivisibility approach, he analyses the different components of the 
right to adequate housing and elements that promote or impede the realization of this right, and 
tries to identify existing gaps in international human rights law and national law and policy.  
Second, the Special Rapporteur engages in constructive dialogues with States and other actors, 
collects information, prepares communications<b>1 </b>and undertakes country missions.<b>2</b>  Third, the 
Special Rapporteur proposes practical tools and solutions to help States and civil societies in 
implementing the human right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>2. Based on this approach the present report is composed of two parts.  The first part aims at 
providing practical tools to recognize, monitor and implement the right to adequate housing.  
The second part discusses the importance of strengthening the legal framework to promote and 
implement the human right to land, an issue the Special Rapporteur believes is of particular 
significance for implementing the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  PRACTICAL TOOLS OF IMPLEMENTATION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Indicators on the right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>3. The need for the elaboration of an operational framework for the realization of the right 
to adequate housing, including indicators and methods of monitoring, has become more pertinent 
with the emergence of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  Developing rights-based 
indicators and monitoring tools could contribute to more effective implementation of the MDGs 
and the realization of relevant human rights.  The MDGs are important in the targets that they 
set for States and other actors working towards human development and improved human 
well-being.  But the overriding human rights principles and their progressive realization must 
underlie the process of meeting the Goals.  One of the targets of the MDGs (Goal 7) is relevant 
to the right to adequate housing pertains to slums:  &#8220;By 2020 to have achieved a significant 
improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers.&#8221;  The realization of this target is 
to be monitored by:  (a) the proportion of people with access to improved sanitation; and (b) the 
proportion of people with access to secure tenure.  In a world where there are significant 
variations across countries on the definition of a &#8220;slum&#8221; and &#8220;secure tenure&#8221;, the reliance on 
these two indicators for monitoring the quality of life of slum dwellers could be restrictive or 
insufficient.  Recognizing the challenge, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme 
</p>
<p>

  </b>During the current reporting period, the Special Rapporteur visited Australia 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/4/18/Add.2) and Spain (A/HRC/4/18/Add.3). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(UN-HABITAT) convened an expert group meeting on urban indicators in October 2002 to 
address some of these concerns, in which both the Special Rapporteur and the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) participated.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur addressed the issue of indicators and tools for monitoring the 
right to adequate housing in his reports in documents E/CN.4/2003/5 and E/CN.4/2004/48, 
wherein he outlined relevant issues and possible options for taking this work forward.  Since 
then there has been some progress in this area, including the work undertaken by Paul Hunt, the 
Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health (see E/CN.4/2006/48), by UN-HABITAT<b>4</b> and by OHCHR in support of the 
ongoing reform of human rights treaty monitoring bodies and the reporting procedure.<b>5</b>  There 
has also been considerable progress at the civil society level in refining indicators for monitoring 
the right to adequate housing.<b>6</b>  The Special Rapporteur would like to draw attention to the expert 
consultation organized by OHCHR on 19 and 20 December 2006, where housing rights 
indicators were discussed and to which he actively contributed.   
</p>
<p>5. After reviewing these developments, the Special Rapporteur believes that the conceptual 
work on human rights indicators has sufficiently progressed and provides a basis for endorsing 
an illustrative list of indicators for monitoring the right to adequate housing.  While presenting 
such a list in annex II, based on discussions at the expert meeting in December 2006, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to draw attention to issues critical to understanding and applying the 
suggested framework at the national and subnational levels. 
</p>
<p>6. The first issue relates to the imperative of disaggregated data for monitoring human 
rights.  Identification of vulnerable groups has to be the starting point for seeking specific 
information for monitoring the enjoyment of those rights.  Thus, for the right to adequate 
housing, there is, in most instances, a need to have data disaggregated by sex, major population 
age groups, regions (including rural and urban) and, where possible, in relation to other groups, 
including racial, ethnic or religious groups, minorities, indigenous peoples, refugees, internally 
displaced persons and migrants.  Moreover, while some data may be presented at the individual 
level and some at the household level, often there may be a case for further disaggregation by 
household types, including by female-headed households.  Human rights monitoring in addition 
also requires indicators that reflect the substantive standards of the right, which incorporate 
human rights principles, including gender equality, non-discrimination and participation.

</b>  See for example the work done by the Housing and Land Rights Network (HLRN), 
</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>7. Second, for indicators to be useful in monitoring the implementation of human rights, it 
is important that they be explicitly and precisely defined, based on an acceptable and 
participatory methodology of data collection and presentation, and available on a regular basis. 
</p>
<p>8. Third, it is essential that the approach used for identifying indicators be simple, 
systematic and comprehensive.  At the same time, it should be flexible in order to reflect, in the 
selection of specific indicators, contextual concerns at the national and subnational levels.  
Finally, the framework adopted to assess the implementation of human rights has to capture, 
through the selection of suitable indicators, both the effort being made by States parties in 
implementing particular human rights standards and the outcome of those efforts.   
</p>
<p>9. Taking these concerns into account, the focus in this report is on identifying from the 
available data, to the extent feasible, illustrative indicators that as a starting point translate the 
narrative on the legal standard of the right (such as article 11 (1) of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and general comments No. 4 and No. 7 of the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) into a specific number of characteristic 
attributes that facilitate the identification of indicators for monitoring the implementation of the 
right.  Thus, for instance, the annexed list identifies four attributes (essential elements) of the 
right to adequate housing:  habitability, accessibility to services, housing affordability, and 
security of tenure.  Having identified the attributes of the right in a mutually exhaustive manner, 
the next step is to identify a configuration of structural-process-outcome indicators. 
</p>
<p>10. <b>Structural indicators</b>.<b>  </b>These are indicators that reflect the ratification/adoption of legal 
instruments and the existence of basic institutional mechanisms deemed necessary for facilitating 
realization of the particular human right.  Among the structural indicators, which are likely to be 
qualitative in nature rather than quantitative, one could consider indicators such as &#8220;time frame 
and coverage of national housing policy statements/strategies for the progressive implementation 
of measures for the right to adequate housing at different levels of Government, as applicable&#8221;. </p>
<p>11. <b>Process indicators</b>.  These relate State policy instruments with milestones, which in turn 
cumulate into outcome indicators that could be more directly related to realization of human 
rights.  Such indicators contribute to assessing an important aspect of the notion of 
accountability.  Unlike outcome indicators, process indicators are more sensitive to changes, and 
are thus better at reflecting progressive realization of the right and States parties&#8217; efforts in 
protecting the rights, including their obligation as stated in article 2 of ICESCR.<b>7</b>  Thus, 
indicators like &#8220;share of public development budget spent on social/community housing&#8221; capture 
the effort of the State party in meeting its obligation to protect and promote the right to adequate 
housing.   
</p>
<p>12. <b>Outcome indicators</b>.  These capture attainments, individual and collective, that reflect 
the status of realization of a human right in a given context.  Outcome indicators have two 
important features.  First, as mentioned, they are more directly related to the realization of the 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>7
  </b>&#8220;Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to take steps &#8230; to the maximum of its 
</p>
<p>available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights 
recognized in the present Covenant by all appropriate means &#8230; .&#8221; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>corresponding right and second, a number of processes could contribute to the attainment of a 
single outcome.  In such a case, it becomes useful to make a distinction between process and 
outcome indicators.  An example of an outcome indicator would be &#8220;proportion of households 
with legally enforceable, contractual, statutory or other protection providing security of tenure&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>13. The suggested framework has emerged from the ongoing work on developing indicators 
for States parties&#8217; compliance with international human rights instruments.  The configuration of 
the structural, process and outcome indicators should be seen as a framework to systematically 
cover all aspects of the realization of a right - from the perspective of duty holders and their 
obligations, as well as of the right holder and his/her rights.  Working with such an approach 
simplifies the selection of indicators and encourages the use of contextually relevant information.  
Though it addresses a range of issues in building an adequate approach to human rights 
assessment, a few areas still require further work.  One such area relates to the need for specific 
indicators to monitor the process of implementing a given human right for its adherence to 
human rights principles.  It is important, for such a monitoring process, to identify the vulnerable 
groups in a country, the information provider and information user, and those individuals and 
communities whose human rights are at stake. 
</p>
<p>14. Further work is also required in building capacity for collecting and using disaggregated 
data.  There is also scope to devise additional gender-sensitive indicators (see annex II) on some 
of the attributes identified in the proposed framework.  Moreover, there is a need for detailed 
meta-sheets on each indicator, elaborating, for instance, information on definition of the 
indicators, rationale for selection of the indicator, possible disaggregation and contextual 
formulation, and availability and periodicity of data.  Thus, for example, to disaggregate the 
outcome indicator of &#8220;proportion of homeless population using shelters&#8221; one could include 
indicators that ask for specific information, such as &#8220;number of shelters per thousand homeless 
women&#8221;.  Finally, the suggested indicators need to be validated through piloting at the country 
level before they can provide the basis for a standardized approach to monitor the right to 
adequate housing at the international and national levels. 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur will continue to work on the development of such indicators.  
The next step will consist of refining the indicators, in consultation with OHCHR and 
UN-HABITAT.  The Special Rapporteur will make further use of the indicators in his work, 
including during country missions.  He will also encourage States and civil society to use the 
data generated by these indicators to monitor the implementation of the right to adequate 
housing. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Monitoring women&#8217;s rights to adequate housing and land 
</b></p>
<p>16. In its resolution 2002/49 entitled &#8220;Women&#8217;s equal ownership of access to and control 
over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing&#8221;, the Commission on 
Human Rights entrusted the Special Rapporteur with the additional task of conducting a global 
study on women and adequate housing. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur thus strengthened the focus on women&#8217;s rights through the 
development of specific strategies for collecting information from States and civil society 
groups, including the elaboration of a questionnaire on women and adequate housing and 
conducting regional consultations with grass-roots and civil society groups.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>18. The questionnaire draws from experience gained during the study on women and 
housing, especially through regional consultations and testimonies received from women during 
country missions.  It makes explicit the elements of women&#8217;s right to adequate housing.  Using 
the indivisibility of rights approach, this questionnaire demonstrates the connections between 
various civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights in relation to women&#8217;s 
adequate housing, land and inheritance, including an emphasis on the close link between 
violence against women and the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>19. Part I of the questionnaire solicits information on the legal and policy framework for 
realizing women&#8217;s adequate housing.  Part II focuses on how different elements of adequate 
housing affect women.  The questionnaire is structured around the expanded definition of the 
right to adequate housing provided by the Special Rapporteur which enables greater elaboration 
of the elements of &#8220;adequacy&#8221; as related to women&#8217;s lives and experiences.   
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur believes in the timeliness of presenting this questionnaire to the 
Human Rights Council as a tool with multiple uses.  The questionnaire can be used to:  derive 
indicators that would result in the collection of disaggregated data to monitor the realization and 
violations of women&#8217;s right to adequate housing; to collate information on the right to adequate 
housing for women with disabilities, particularly in relation to access issues - as recognized in 
the recently adopted (December 2006) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; by 
States and civil society for human rights education, thereby strengthening communities&#8217; capacity 
to analyse and present violations within the human rights framework, including the capacity to 
access available monitoring mechanisms and international legal mechanisms for redress; to draft 
model questions for monitoring by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women (CEDAW) as a basis for a general recommendation on women and land and housing.   
</p>
<p><b>C. Basic principles and guidelines on development-based  
evictions and displacement 
</b></p>
<p>21. From the start of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has witnessed and increasingly 
received reports on forced evictions and displacement around the world.<b>9</b>  As recognized by 
several human rights bodies, forced evictions constitute prima facie violations of a wide range of 
internationally recognized human rights and can only be carried out under exceptional 
circumstances and in full accordance with international human rights law.  As a result of forced 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  See, as one result of the global study, the three reports to the Commission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>and reports of seven regional consultations, at:  www.ohchr.org/english/issues/housing/ 
women.htm. 
<b>9
</b>  The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report (E/CN.4/2004/48) focused on forced evictions and included a 
</p>
<p>recommendation to hold an expert seminar to elaborate guidelines. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>evictions, people are often left homeless and destitute, without means of earning a livelihood 
and, in practice, with no effective access to legal or other remedies.  Forced evictions are often 
associated with physical and psychological injuries to those affected, with a particular impact on 
women and on persons already living in extreme poverty, children, indigenous peoples, 
minorities and other vulnerable groups.   
</p>
<p>22. In collaboration with the German Federal Foreign Office and the German Institute for 
Human Rights, the Special Rapporteur co-organized an International Workshop on Forced 
Evictions in Berlin in June 2005, for the purpose of elaborating guidelines aimed at assisting 
States and the international community in developing policies and legislation to address forced 
evictions.  The attached Basic principles and guidelines on development-based evictions and 
displacement (annex I) are the result of this workshop and subsequent consultations. 
</p>
<p>23. While acknowledging existing standards on forced evictions, the Special Rapporteur 
believed that these could be further strengthened and put forward in more operational terms.  
These basic principles and guidelines offer several new prescriptions, based on experiences 
gathered worldwide since 1997.  In particular, they: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Define the practice of forced evictions (paras. 4-8); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Lay down stringent criteria under which displacement can occur in &#8220;exceptional 
circumstances&#8221;, with &#8220;full justification&#8221; and procedural guarantees (para. 21); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Enumerate detailed steps to be taken by States to protect human rights prior to, 
during, and after evictions (paras. 37-58); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Call for comprehensive &#8220;eviction-impact assessments&#8221; to be carried out prior to 
displacement (paras. 32, 33); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Call for provision of compensation, restitution and adequate rehabilitation consistent 
with human rights standards (paras. 42, 60-63); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Provide useful guidance on other phenomena that lead to displacement such as 
disasters (paras. 52, 55); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Establish a &#8220;right to resettle&#8221; consistent with the right to adequate housing for 
displaced communities living in adverse conditions (paras. 16, 52-56); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Call on States, in pursuance of an &#8220;immediate obligation&#8221; to guarantee security of 
tenure to all those currently lacking titles to home and land (paras. 23, 25); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Provide a strong gender perspective, including protection and entitlements to women 
(paras. 7, 15, 26, 29, 33, 34, 38, 39, 47, 50, 53, 54, 57 and 58); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Call for States to take intervening measures to ensure that market forces do not 
increase the vulnerability of low-income and marginalized groups to forced eviction 
(paras. 8, 30).   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the many positive comments he has received on 
these guidelines from States during the interactive dialogue at the second session of the Human 
Rights Council.  The Special Rapporteur is also encouraged by the use of these guidelines by 
national and international civil society organizations.  Several delegations and civil society 
organizations have asked for the translation of these guidelines into the United Nations 
languages.  The Special Rapporteur has also found these guidelines useful in his missions.  The 
guidelines are also now routinely mentioned in communications (both of his own and those 
written jointly with other mandate holders).  The Special Rapporteur is of the view that these 
guidelines need to be endorsed by the Human Rights Council.  For all these reasons he is 
attaching the guidelines as an annex to this report. 
</p>
<p><b>III. IDENTIFYING NORMATIVE GAPS:  THE  
HUMAN RIGHT TO LAND 
</b></p>
<p>25. Throughout his work, the Special Rapporteur has tried to identify elements that positively 
or negatively affect the realization of the right to adequate housing.  Land as an entitlement is 
often an essential element necessary to understand the degree of violation and the extent of 
realization of the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>26. In several previous reports and statements, the Special Rapporteur has stressed that land 
is a critical element of the human right to housing.  Inadequate housing is often the consequence 
of being barred access to land and common property resources.  Inequitable land ownership 
patterns and the phenomenon of landlessness give rise to interrelated problems that range from 
inadequate housing, lack of livelihood options, poor health, hunger and food insecurity, to acute 
poverty. 
</p>
<p>27. In country visits, the Special Rapporteur is very often confronted with the problem of 
adequate housing in relation to land and land rights.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>28. The question of land has particular effects on groups such as indigenous peoples, 
communities that have historically been discriminated against, minorities, internally displaced 
persons and returning refugees.  It is of crucial importance to women when it comes to the 
question of inheritance and issues of access, tenure and livelihood. 
</p>
<p>29. Without the adequate legal recognition of individual as well as collective land rights, the 
right to adequate housing, in many instances, cannot be effectively realized.  The right to land, 
however, is not just linked to the right to adequate housing but is integrally related to the human 
rights to food, livelihood, work, self-determination, and security of the person and home and the 
sustenance of common property resources.  The guarantee of the right to land is thus critical for 
the majority of the world&#8217;s population who depend on land and land-based resources for their 
lives and livelihoods.  In the urban context legal recognition of land rights is often critical to 
protecting the right to adequate housing, including access to essential services and livelihoods, 
especially for the urban poor. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  See for instance the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s country mission reports to Afghanistan, Australia, 
</p>
<p>Brazil, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kenya, the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Peru. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>30. The indicators on the right to adequate housing (annex II) include references to land.  The 
questionnaire on women and housing (annex III) demonstrates that land is an important 
entitlement for realizing the full scope of women&#8217;s right to housing.  It is also clear that in 
identifying the importance of protecting the right to adequate housing throughout the process of 
evictions, the Basic principles and guidelines (annex I) comprise numerous aspects of the right to 
land. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur strongly believes that the Human Rights Council should consider 
devoting attention to the question of the human right to land and should conduct studies in this 
regard which build on the work of organized peasant and indigenous peoples&#8217; movements.  The 
Council is ideally placed to ensure the recognition in international human rights law of land as a 
human right.  Land as a cross-cutting issue could also be the subject of a joint analysis by 
concerned mandate holders, including on the rights of indigenous peoples, violence against 
women, food and housing. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>32. <b>In pursuance of the constructive manner in which the Special Rapporteur has 
attempted to carry out his mandate, this report provides standards and tools that could be 
utilized and further developed by States and other parties to promote the defence and 
realization of the human right to adequate housing.  In this context, he would like to make 
the following recommendations to the Human Rights Council, which should be read 
alongside the recommendations contained in his last two reports to the Commission on 
Human Rights.11 
</b></p>
<p>33. <b>In particular, the Special Rapporteur requests the Council to: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Urge Governments to test and adapt the indicators presented on adequate 
housing (annex II), to establish national benchmarks consistent with their human rights 
obligation, and to participate actively in piloting and validation of these indicators with 
OHCHR; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Revisit the recommendations contained in document E/CN.4/2006/118, with a 
view to institutionalizing women&#8217;s human rights to housing, land, property and inheritance 
within the work of the Council and relevant special procedures; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure wide dissemination of the Basic principles and guidelines on 
development-based evictions and displacement (annex I) and inclusion of the issue of 
development and market-induced evictions in the elaboration of mandates of relevant 
special procedures of the Council, in particular on the rights of indigenous peoples, food, 
violence against women and adequate housing; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Urge States to incorporate these guidelines into national laws and policies 
governing housing and land issues, including resettlement policies; 
</b></p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>11
  </b>E/CN.4/2006/41 and E/CN.4/2006/118. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (e) Recognize the right to land as a human right and strengthen its protection in 
international human rights law.  Given the magnitude of homelessness and landlessness 
across the world such recognition would promote the right to adequate housing, including 
protection against forced evictions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Urge States to give priority to agrarian reform, and to land and wealth 
redistribution.  Legislation should be enacted and implemented to check forced evictions 
and segregation, growth of the land mafia and cartels, and uncontrolled property 
speculation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Consider holding an expert seminar to develop strategies for the legal 
recognition of land as a human right, including the protection of land rights of indigenous 
peoples, peasants, the landless and other groups that are dependent on and derive their 
identity and livelihood from land and land-based resources; </b></p>
<p><b> (h) Consider, in its review of the mandate on adequate housing, to make more 
explicit, consistent with the work of United Nations treaty bodies and the Special 
Rapporteur, the recognition of adequate housing as a distinct human right. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  SCOPE AND NATURE 
</b></p>
<p>1. The obligation of States to refrain from, and protect against, forced evictions from 
home(s) and land arises from several international legal instruments that protect the human right 
to adequate housing and other related human rights.  These include the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 11, 
para. 1), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (art. 27, para. 3), the non-discrimination 
provisions found in article 14, paragraph 2 (h), of the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, and article 5 (e) of the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
</p>
<p>2. In addition, and consistent with the indivisibility of a human rights approach, article 17 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subjected to 
arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence&#8221;, and further 
that &#8220;[e]veryone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks&#8221;.  
Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child contains a similar 
provision.  Other references in international law include article 21 of the 1951 Convention 
relating to the Status of Refugees; article 16 of International Labour Organization (ILO) 
Convention No. 169 concerning indigenous and tribal peoples in independent countries (1989); 
and article 49 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of 
War of 12 August 1949 (Fourth Geneva Convention). 
</p>
<p>3. The present guidelines address the human rights implications of development-linked 
evictions and related displacement in urban and/or rural areas.  These guidelines represent a 
further development of the Comprehensive human rights guidelines on development-based 
displacement (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/7, annex).  They are based on international human rights law, 
and are consistent with general comment No. 4 (1991) and general comment No. 7 (1997) of the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Guiding Principles on Internal 
Displacement (E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2), the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to 
Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and 
Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law, adopted by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 60/147, and the Principles on housing and property restitution for refugees and 
displaced persons (see E/CN.4/Sub.2/2005/17 and Add.1). 
</p>
<p>4. Having due regard for all relevant definitions of the practice of &#8220;forced evictions&#8221; in the 
context of international human rights standards, the present guidelines apply to acts and/or 
omissions involving the coerced or involuntary displacement of individuals, groups and 
communities from homes and/or lands and common property resources that were occupied or 
depended upon, thus eliminating or limiting the ability of an individual, group or community to 
reside or work in a particular dwelling, residence or location, without the provision of, and 
access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection.<b>a</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>a
</b>  The prohibition of forced evictions does not apply to evictions carried out both in accordance 
</p>
<p>with the law and in conformity with the provisions of international human rights treaties. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>5. Forced evictions constitute a distinct phenomenon under international law, and are often 
linked to the absence of legally secure tenure, which constitutes an essential element of the right 
to adequate housing.  Forced evictions share many consequences similar to those resulting from 
arbitrary displacement,<b>b</b> including population transfer, mass expulsions, mass exodus, ethnic 
cleansing and other practices involving the coerced and involuntary displacement of people from 
their homes, lands and communities. 
</p>
<p>6. Forced evictions constitute gross violations of a range of internationally recognized 
human rights, including the human rights to adequate housing, food, water, health, education, 
work, security of the person, security of the home, freedom from cruel, inhuman and degrading 
treatment, and freedom of movement.  Evictions must be carried out lawfully, only in 
exceptional circumstances, and in full accordance with relevant provisions of international 
human rights and humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>7. Forced evictions intensify inequality, social conflict, segregation and &#8220;ghettoization&#8221;, and 
invariably affect the poorest, most socially and economically vulnerable and marginalized 
sectors of society, especially women, children, minorities and indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>8. In the context of the present guidelines, development-based evictions include evictions 
often planned or conducted under the pretext of serving the &#8220;public good&#8221;, such as those linked 
to development and infrastructure projects (including large dams, large-scale industrial or energy 
projects, or mining and other extractive industries); land-acquisition measures associated with 
urban renewal, slum upgrades, housing renovation, city beautification, or other land-use 
programmes (including for agricultural purposes); property, real estate and land disputes; 
unbridled land speculation; major international business or sporting events; and, ostensibly, 
environmental purposes.  Such activities also include those supported by international 
development assistance. 
</p>
<p>9. Displacement resulting from environmental destruction or degradation, evictions or 
evacuations resulting from public disturbances, natural or human-induced disasters, tension or 
unrest, internal, international or mixed conflict (having domestic and international dimensions) 
and public emergencies, domestic violence, and certain cultural and traditional practices often 
take place without regard for existing human rights and humanitarian standards, including the 
right to adequate housing.  Such situations may, however, involve an additional set of 
considerations that the present guidelines do not explicitly address, though they can also provide 
useful guidance in those contexts.  Attention is drawn to the Basic Principles and Guidelines on 
the Right to Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human 
Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law, the Guiding Principles on 
Internal Displacement, and the Principles on housing and property restitution for refugees and 
displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>10. While recognizing the wide range of contexts in which forced evictions take place, the 
present guidelines focus on providing guidance to States on measures and procedures to be 
adopted in order to ensure that development-based evictions are not undertaken in contravention 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>b
</b>  Consistent with Principle 6 of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of existing international human rights standards and do not thus constitute &#8220;forced evictions&#8221;.  
These guidelines aim at providing a practical tool to assist States and agencies in developing 
policies, legislation, procedures and preventive measures to ensure that forced evictions do not 
take place, and to provide effective remedies to those whose human rights have been violated, 
should prevention fail. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  GENERAL OBLIGATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Duty bearers and nature of obligations 
</b></p>
<p>11. While a variety of distinct actors may carry out, sanction, demand, propose, initiate, 
condone or acquiesce to forced evictions, States bear the principal obligation for applying human 
rights and humanitarian norms, in order to ensure respect for the rights enshrined in binding 
treaties and general principles of international public law, as reflected in the present guidelines.  
This does not, however, absolve other parties, including project managers and personnel, 
international financial and other institutions or organizations, transnational and other 
corporations, and individual parties, including private landlords and landowners, of all 
responsibility. 
</p>
<p>12. Under international law, the obligations of States include the respect, protection and 
fulfilment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.  This means that States shall:  refrain 
from violating human rights domestically and extraterritorially; ensure that other parties within 
the State&#8217;s jurisdiction and effective control do not violate the human rights of others; and take 
preventive and remedial steps to uphold human rights and provide assistance to those whose 
rights have been violated.  These obligations are continuous and simultaneous, and are not 
suggestive of a hierarchy of measures. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Basic human rights principles 
</b></p>
<p>13. According to international human rights law, everyone has the right to adequate housing 
as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living.  The right to adequate housing 
includes, inter alia, the right to protection against arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, 
family, home, and to legal security of tenure. 
</p>
<p>14. According to international law, States must ensure that protection against forced 
evictions, and the human right to adequate housing and secure tenure, are guaranteed without 
discrimination of any kind on the basis of race, colour, sex, language, religion or belief, political 
or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, legal or social status, age, disability, property, 
birth or other status. 
</p>
<p>15. States must ensure the equal right of women and men to protection from forced evictions 
and the equal enjoyment of the human right to adequate housing and security of tenure, as 
reflected in the present guidelines. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>16. All persons, groups and communities have the right to resettlement, which includes the 
right to alternative land of better or equal quality and housing that must satisfy the following 
criteria for adequacy:  accessibility, affordability, habitability, security of tenure, cultural 
adequacy, suitability of location, and access to essential services such as health and education.<b>c</b> 
</p>
<p>17. States must ensure that adequate and effective legal or other appropriate remedies are 
available to any person claiming that his/her right to protection against forced evictions has been 
violated or is under threat of violation. 
</p>
<p>18. States must refrain from introducing any deliberately retrogressive measures with respect 
to de jure or de facto protection against forced evictions. 
</p><p>19. States must recognize that the prohibition of forced evictions includes arbitrary 
displacement that results in altering the ethnic, religious or racial composition of the affected 
population. 
</p>
<p>20. States must formulate and conduct their international policies and activities in 
compliance with their human rights obligations, including through both the pursuit and provision 
of international development assistance. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Implementation of State obligations 
</b></p>
<p>21. States shall ensure that evictions only occur in exceptional circumstances.  Evictions 
require full justification given their adverse impact on a wide range of internationally recognized 
human rights.  Any eviction must be (a) authorized by law; (b) carried out in accordance with 
international human rights law; (c) undertaken solely for the purpose of promoting the general 
welfare;<b>d</b> (d) reasonable and proportional; (e) regulated so as to ensure full and fair compensation 
and rehabilitation; and (f) carried out in accordance with the present guidelines.  The protection 
provided by these procedural requirements applies to all vulnerable persons and affected groups, 
irrespective of whether they hold title to home and property under domestic law. 
</p>
<p>22. States must adopt legislative and policy measures prohibiting the execution of evictions 
that are not in conformity with their international human rights obligations.  States should 
refrain, to the maximum extent possible, from claiming or confiscating housing or land, and in 
particular when such action does not contribute to the enjoyment of human rights.  For instance, 
an eviction may be considered justified if measures of land reform or redistribution, especially 
for the benefit of vulnerable or deprived persons, groups or communities are involved.  States 
should apply appropriate civil or criminal penalties against any public or private person or entity 
within its jurisdiction that carries out evictions in a manner not fully consistent with applicable 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>c
</b>  See general comment No. 4 on the right to adequate housing, adopted by the Committee on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 1991. 
<b>d
  </b>In the present guidelines, the promotion of the general welfare refers to steps taken by States 
</p>
<p>consistent with their international human rights obligations, in particular the need to ensure the 
human rights of the most vulnerable. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>law and international human rights standards.  States must ensure that adequate and effective 
legal or other appropriate remedies are available to all those who undergo, remain vulnerable to, 
or defend against forced evictions. 
</p>
<p>23. States shall take steps, to the maximum of their available resources, to ensure the equal 
enjoyment of the right to adequate housing by all.  The obligation of States to adopt appropriate 
legislative and policy measures to ensure the protection of individuals, groups and communities 
from evictions that are not in conformity with existing international human rights standards is 
immediate.<b>e</b> 
</p>
<p>24. In order to ensure that no form of discrimination, statutory or otherwise, adversely affects 
the enjoyment of the human right to adequate housing, States should carry out comprehensive 
reviews of relevant national legislation and policy with a view to ensuring their conformity with 
international human rights provisions.  Such comprehensive review should also ensure that 
existing legislation, regulation and policy address the privatization of public services, inheritance 
and cultural practices, so as not to lead to, or facilitate forced evictions.<b>f</b> 
</p>
<p>25. In order to secure a maximum degree of effective legal protection against the practice of 
forced evictions for all persons under their jurisdiction, States should take immediate measures 
aimed at conferring legal security of tenure upon those persons, households and communities 
currently lacking such protection, including all those who do not have formal titles to home and 
land. 
</p>
<p>26. States must ensure the equal enjoyment of the right to adequate housing by women and 
men.  This requires States to adopt and implement special measures to protect women from 
forced evictions.  Such measures should ensure that titles to housing and land are conferred on 
all women. 
</p>
<p>27. States should ensure that binding human rights standards are integrated in their 
international relations, including through trade and investment, development assistance and 
participation in multilateral forums and organizations.  States should implement their human 
rights obligations with regard to international cooperation,<b>g </b>whether as donors or as 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>e
</b>  See general comment No. 3 on the nature of States parties&#8217; obligations, adopted in 1990 by the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
<b>f
</b>  See the guidelines on housing and discrimination contained in the 2002 report of the 
Commission on Human Rights Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the 
right to an adequate standard of living (E/CN.4/2002/59). 
<b>g
</b>  As set forth in article 22, Universal Declaration of Human Rights; Articles 55 and 56 of the 
</p>
<p>Charter of the United Nations; articles 2, paragraph 1, 11, 15, 22 and 23, International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; articles 23, paragraph 4, and 28, paragraph 3, 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>beneficiaries.  States should ensure that international organizations in which they are represented 
refrain from sponsoring or implementing any project, programme or policy that may involve 
forced evictions, that is, evictions not in full conformity with international law, and as specified 
in the present guidelines. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Preventive strategies, policies and programmes 
</b></p>
<p>28. States should adopt, to the maximum of their available resources, appropriate strategies, 
policies and programmes to ensure effective protection of individuals, groups and communities 
against forced eviction and its consequences. 
</p>
<p>29. States should carry out comprehensive reviews of relevant strategies, policies and 
programmes, with a view to ensuring their compatibility with international human rights norms.  
In this regard, such reviews must strive to remove provisions that contribute to sustaining or 
exacerbating existing inequalities that adversely affect women and marginalized and vulnerable 
groups.  Governments must take special measures to ensure that policies and programmes are not 
formulated or implemented in a discriminatory manner, and do not further marginalize those 
living in poverty, whether in urban or rural areas. 
</p>
<p>30. States should take specific preventive measures to avoid and/or eliminate underlying 
causes of forced evictions, such as speculation in land and real estate.  States should review the 
operation and regulation of the housing and tenancy markets and, when necessary, intervene to 
ensure that market forces do not increase the vulnerability of low-income and other marginalized 
groups to forced eviction.  In the event of an increase in housing or land prices, States should 
also ensure sufficient protection against physical or economic pressures on residents to leave or 
be deprived of adequate housing or land. 
</p>
<p>31. Priority in housing and land allocation should be ensured to disadvantaged groups such as 
the elderly, children and persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>32. States must give priority to exploring strategies that minimize displacement.  
Comprehensive and holistic impact assessments should be carried out prior to the initiation of 
any project that could result in development-based eviction and displacement, with a view to 
securing fully the human rights of all potentially affected persons, groups and communities, 
including their protection against forced evictions.  &#8220;Eviction-impact&#8221; assessment should also 
include exploration of alternatives and strategies for minimizing harm. 
</p>
<p>33. Impact assessments must take into account the differential impacts of forced evictions on 
women, children, the elderly, and marginalized sectors of society.  All such assessments should 
be based on the collection of disaggregated data, such that all differential impacts can be 
appropriately identified and addressed. 
</p>
<p>34. Adequate training in applying international human rights norms should be required and 
provided for relevant professionals, including lawyers, law enforcement officials, urban and 
regional planners and other personnel involved in the design, management and implementation 
of development projects.  This must include training on women&#8217;s rights, with an emphasis on 
women&#8217;s particular concerns and requirements pertaining to housing and land. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>35. States should ensure the dissemination of adequate information on human rights and laws 
and policies relating to protection against forced evictions.  Specific attention should be given to 
the dissemination of timely and appropriate information to groups particularly vulnerable to 
evictions, through culturally appropriate channels and methods. 
</p>
<p>36. States must ensure that individuals, groups and communities are protected from eviction 
during the period that their particular case is being examined before a national, regional or 
international legal body. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  PRIOR TO EVICTIONS 
</b></p>
<p>37. Urban or rural planning and development processes should involve all those likely to be 
affected and should include the following elements:  (a) appropriate notice to all potentially 
affected persons that eviction is being considered and that there will be public hearings on the 
proposed plans and alternatives; (b) effective dissemination by the authorities of relevant 
information in advance, including land records and proposed comprehensive resettlement plans 
specifically addressing efforts to protect vulnerable groups; (c) a reasonable time period for 
public review of, comment on, and/or objection to the proposed plan; (d) opportunities and 
efforts to facilitate the provision of legal, technical and other advice to affected persons about 
their rights and options; and (e) holding of public hearing(s) that provide(s) affected persons and 
their advocates with opportunities to challenge the eviction decision and/or to present alternative 
proposals and to articulate their demands and development priorities. 
</p>
<p>38. States should explore fully all possible alternatives to evictions.  All potentially affected 
groups and persons, including women, indigenous peoples and persons with disabilities, as well 
as others working on behalf of the affected, have the right to relevant information, full 
consultation and participation throughout the entire process, and to propose alternatives that 
authorities should duly consider.  In the event that agreement cannot be reached on a proposed 
alternative among concerned parties, an independent body having constitutional authority, such 
as a court of law, tribunal or ombudsperson should mediate, arbitrate or adjudicate as 
appropriate. 
</p>
<p>39. During planning processes, opportunities for dialogue and consultation must be extended 
effectively to the full spectrum of affected persons, including women and vulnerable and 
marginalized groups, and, when necessary, through the adoption of special measures or 
procedures. 
</p>
<p>40. Prior to any decision to initiate an eviction, authorities must demonstrate that the eviction 
is unavoidable and consistent with international human rights commitments protective of the 
general welfare.  
</p>
<p>41. Any decision relating to evictions should be announced in writing in the local language to 
all individuals concerned, sufficiently in advance.  The eviction notice should contain a detailed 
justification for the decision, including on:  (a) absence of reasonable alternatives; (b) the full 
details of the proposed alternative; and (c) where no alternatives exist, all measures taken and 
foreseen to minimize the adverse effects of evictions.  All final decisions should be subject to 
administrative and judicial review.  Affected parties must also be guaranteed timely access to 
legal counsel, without payment if necessary. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>42. Due eviction notice should allow and enable those subject to eviction to take an inventory 
in order to assess the values of their properties, investments and other material goods that may be 
damaged.  Those subject to eviction should also be given the opportunity to assess and document 
non-monetary losses to be compensated. 
</p>
<p>43. Evictions should not result in individuals being rendered homeless or vulnerable to the 
violation of other human rights.  The State must make provision for the adoption of all 
appropriate measures, to the maximum of its available resources, especially for those who are 
unable to provide for themselves, to ensure that adequate alternative housing, resettlement or 
access to productive land, as the case may be, is available and provided.  Alternative housing 
should be situated as close as possible to the original place of residence and source of livelihood 
of those evicted. 
</p>
<p>44. All resettlement measures, such as construction of homes, provision of water, electricity, 
sanitation, schools, access roads and allocation of land and sites, must be consistent with the 
present guidelines and internationally recognized human rights principles, and completed before 
those who are to be evicted are moved from their original areas of dwelling.<b>h</b> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  DURING EVICTIONS 
</b></p>
<p>45. The procedural requirements for ensuring respect for human rights standards include the 
mandatory presence of governmental officials or their representatives on site during evictions.  
The governmental officials, their representatives and persons implementing the eviction must 
identify themselves to the persons being evicted and present formal authorization for the eviction 
action. 
</p>
<p>46. Neutral observers, including regional and international observers, should be allowed 
access upon request, to ensure transparency and compliance with international human rights 
principles during the carrying out of any eviction. 
</p>
<p>47. Evictions shall not be carried out in a manner that violates the dignity and human rights 
to life and security of those affected.  States must also take steps to ensure that women are not 
subject to gender-based violence and discrimination in the course of evictions, and that the 
human rights of children are protected. 
</p>
<p>48. Any legal use of force must respect the principles of necessity and proportionality, as 
well as the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials and 
any national or local code of conduct consistent with international law enforcement and human 
rights standards. 
</p>
<p>49. Evictions must not take place in inclement weather, at night, during festivals or religious 
holidays, prior to elections, or during or just prior to school examinations. 
</p>
<p>

</b>  See section V of the present guidelines. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>50. States and their agents must take steps to ensure that no one is subject to direct or 
indiscriminate attacks or other acts of violence, especially against women and children, or 
arbitrarily deprived of property or possessions as a result of demolition, arson and other forms of 
deliberate destruction, negligence or any form of collective punishment.  Property and 
possessions left behind involuntarily should be protected against destruction and arbitrary and 
illegal appropriation, occupation or use. 
</p>
<p>51. Authorities and their agents should never require or force those evicted to demolish their 
own dwellings or other structures.  The option to do so must be provided to affected persons, 
however, as this would facilitate salvaging of possessions and building material. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  AFTER AN EVICTION:  IMMEDIATE RELIEF AND RELOCATION 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Government and any other parties responsible for providing just compensation and 
sufficient alternative accommodation, or restitution when feasible, must do so immediately upon 
the eviction, except in cases of force majeure.  At a minimum, regardless of the circumstances 
and without discrimination, competent authorities shall ensure that evicted persons or groups, 
especially those who are unable to provide for themselves, have safe and secure access to:  
(a) essential food, potable water and sanitation; (b) basic shelter and housing; (c) appropriate 
clothing; (d) essential medical services; (e) livelihood sources; (f) fodder for livestock and access 
to common property resources previously depended upon; and (g) education for children and 
childcare facilities.  States should also ensure that members of the same extended family or 
community are not separated as a result of evictions. 
</p>
<p>53. Special efforts should be made to ensure equal participation of women in all planning 
processes and in the distribution of basic services and supplies. 
</p>
<p>54. In order to ensure the protection of the human right to the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health, all evicted persons who are wounded and sick, as well as those with 
disabilities, should receive the medical care and attention they require to the fullest extent 
practicable and with the least possible delay, without distinction on any non-medically relevant 
grounds.  When necessary, evicted persons should have access to psychological and social 
services.  Special attention should be paid to:  (a) the health needs of women and children, 
including access to female health-care providers where necessary, and to services such as 
reproductive health care and appropriate counselling for victims of sexual and other abuses; 
(b) ensuring that ongoing medical treatment is not disrupted as a result of eviction or relocation; 
and (c) the prevention of contagious and infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, at relocation 
sites. 
</p>
<p>55. Identified relocation sites must fulfil the criteria for adequate housing according to 
international human rights law.  These include:<b>i </b> (a) security of tenure; (b) services, materials, 
facilities and infrastructure such as potable water, energy for cooking, heating and lighting, 
sanitation and washing facilities, means of food storage, refuse disposal, site drainage and 
</p>
<p>

Social and Cultural Rights in 1991. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>emergency services, and to natural and common resources, where appropriate; (c) affordable 
housing; (d) habitable housing providing inhabitants with adequate space, protection from cold, 
damp, heat, rain, wind or other threats to health, structural hazards and disease vectors, and 
ensuring the physical safety of occupants; (e) accessibility for disadvantaged groups; (f) access 
to employment options, health-care services, schools, childcare centres and other social facilities, 
whether in urban or rural areas; and (g) culturally appropriate housing.  In order to ensure 
security of the home, adequate housing should also include the following essential elements:  
privacy and security; participation in decision-making; freedom from violence; and access to 
remedies for any violations suffered. 
</p>
<p>56. In determining the compatibility of resettlement with the present guidelines, States 
should ensure that in the context of any case of resettlement the following criteria are adhered to: 
</p>
<p> (a) No resettlement shall take place until such time as a comprehensive resettlement 
policy consistent with the present guidelines and internationally recognized human rights 
principles is in place; 
</p>
<p> (b) Resettlement must ensure that the human rights of women, children, indigenous 
peoples and other vulnerable groups are equally protected, including their right to property 
ownership and access to resources; 
</p>
<p> (c) The actor proposing and/or carrying out the resettlement shall be required by law 
to pay for any associated costs, including all resettlement costs; 
</p>
<p> (d) No affected persons, groups or communities shall suffer detriment as far as their 
human rights are concerned, nor shall their right to the continuous improvement of living 
conditions be subject to infringement.  This applies equally to host communities at resettlement 
sites, and affected persons, groups and communities subjected to forced eviction; 
 (e) The right of affected persons, groups and communities to full and prior informed 
consent regarding relocation must be guaranteed.  The State shall provide all necessary 
amenities, services and economic opportunities at the proposed site; 
</p>
<p> (f) The time and financial cost required for travel to and from the place of work or to 
access essential services should not place excessive demands upon the budgets of low-income 
households; 
</p>
<p> (g) Relocation sites must not be situated on polluted land or in immediate proximity 
to pollution sources that threaten the right to the highest attainable standards of mental and 
physical health of the inhabitants; 
</p>
<p> (h) Sufficient information shall be provided to the affected persons, groups and 
communities on all State projects and planning and implementation processes relating to the 
concerned resettlement, including information on the purported use of the eviction dwelling or 
site and its proposed beneficiaries.  Particular attention must be paid to ensuring that indigenous 
peoples, minorities, the landless, women and children are represented and included in this 
process; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (i) The entire resettlement process should be carried out with full participation by 
and with affected persons, groups and communities.  States should, in particular, take into 
account all alternative plans proposed by the affected persons, groups and communities; 
</p>
<p> (j) If, after a full and fair public hearing, it is found that there still exists a need to 
proceed with the resettlement, then the affected persons, groups and communities shall be given 
at least 90 days&#8217; notice prior to the date of the resettlement; and 
</p>
<p> (k) Local government officials and neutral observers, properly identified, shall be 
present during the resettlement so as to ensure that no force, violence or intimidation is involved. 
</p>
<p>57. Rehabilitation policies must include programmes designed for women and marginalized 
and vulnerable groups to ensure their equal enjoyment of the human rights to housing, food, 
water, health, education, work, security of the person, security of the home, freedom from cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment, and freedom of movement. 
</p>
<p>58. Persons, groups or communities affected by an eviction should not suffer detriment to 
their human rights, including their right to the progressive realization of the right to adequate 
housing.  This applies equally to host communities at relocation sites. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  REMEDIES FOR FORCED EVICTIONS 
</b></p>
<p>59. All persons threatened with or subject to forced evictions have the right of access to 
timely remedy.  Appropriate remedies include a fair hearing, access to legal counsel, legal aid, 
return, restitution, resettlement, rehabilitation and compensation, and should comply, as 
applicable, with the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to Remedy and Reparation for 
Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Compensation 
</b></p>
<p>60. When eviction is unavoidable, and necessary for the promotion of the general welfare, 
the State must provide or ensure fair and just compensation for any losses of personal, real or 
other property or goods, including rights or interests in property.  Compensation should be 
provided for any economically assessable damage, as appropriate and proportional to the gravity 
of the violation and the circumstances of each case, such as:  loss of life or limb; physical or 
mental harm; lost opportunities, including employment, education and social benefits; material 
damages and loss of earnings, including loss of earning potential; moral damage; and costs 
required for legal or expert assistance, medicine and medical services, and psychological and 
social services.  Cash compensation should under no circumstances replace real compensation in 
the form of land and common property resources.  Where land has been taken, the evicted should 
be compensated with land commensurate in quality, size and value, or better. 
</p>
<p>61. All those evicted, irrespective of whether they hold title to their property, should be 
entitled to compensation for the loss, salvage and transport of their properties affected, including 
the original dwelling and land lost or damaged in the process.  Consideration of the 
circumstances of each case shall allow for the provision of compensation for losses related to 
informal property, such as slum dwellings. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>62. Women and men must be co-beneficiaries of all compensation packages.  Single women 
and widows should be entitled to their own compensation. 
</p>
<p>63. To the extent not covered by assistance for relocation, the assessment of economic 
damage should take into consideration losses and costs, for example, of land plots and house 
structures; contents; infrastructure; mortgage or other debt penalties; interim housing; 
bureaucratic and legal fees; alternative housing; lost wages and incomes; lost educational 
opportunities; health and medical care; resettlement and transportation costs (especially in the 
case of relocation far from the source of livelihood).  Where the home and land also provide a 
source of livelihood for the evicted inhabitants, impact and loss assessment must account for the 
value of business losses, equipment/inventory, livestock, land, trees/crops, and lost/decreased 
wages/income. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Restitution and return 
</b></p>
<p>64. The circumstances of forced evictions linked to development and infrastructure projects 
(including those mentioned in paragraph 8 above) seldom allow for restitution and return.  
Nevertheless, when circumstances allow, States should prioritize these rights of all persons, 
groups and communities subjected to forced evictions.  Persons, groups and communities shall 
not, however, be forced against their will to return to their homes, lands or places of origin. 
</p>
<p>65. When return is possible or adequate resettlement in conformity with these guidelines is 
not provided, the competent authorities should establish conditions and provide the means, 
including financial, for voluntary return in safety and security, and with dignity, to homes or 
places of habitual residence.  Responsible authorities should facilitate the reintegration of 
returned persons and exert efforts to ensure the full participation of affected persons, groups and 
communities in the planning and management of return processes.  Special measures may be 
required to ensure women&#8217;s equal and effective participation in return or restitution processes in 
order to overcome existing household, community, institutional, administrative, legal or other 
gender biases that contribute to marginalization or exclusion of women. 
</p>
<p>66. Competent authorities have the duty and responsibility to assist returning persons, groups 
or communities to recover, to the maximum extent possible, the property and possessions that 
they left behind or were dispossessed of upon their eviction. 
</p>
<p>67. When return to one&#8217;s place of residence and recovery of property and possessions is not 
possible, competent authorities must provide victims of forced evictions, or assist them in 
obtaining, appropriate compensation or other forms of just reparation. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Resettlement and rehabilitation 
</b></p>
<p>68. While all parties must give priority to the right of return, certain circumstances (including 
for the promotion of general welfare, or where the safety, health or enjoyment of human rights so 
demands) may necessitate the resettlement of particular persons, groups and communities due to 
development-based evictions.  Such resettlement must occur in a just and equitable manner and 
in full accordance with international human rights law as elaborated in section V of these 
guidelines. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  MONITORING, EVALUATION AND FOLLOW-UP 
</b></p>
<p>69. States should actively monitor and carry out quantitative and qualitative evaluations to 
determine the number, type and long-term consequences of evictions, including forced evictions, 
that occur within their jurisdiction and territory of effective control.  Monitoring reports and 
findings should be made available to the public and concerned international parties in order to 
promote the development of best practices and problem-solving experiences based on lessons 
learned. 
</p>
<p>70. States should entrust an independent national body, such as a national human rights 
institution, to monitor and investigate forced evictions and State compliance with these 
guidelines and international human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII. ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, INCLUDING 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>71. The international community bears an obligation to promote, protect and fulfil the human 
right to housing, land and property.  International financial, trade, development and other related 
institutions and agencies, including member or donor States that have voting rights within such 
bodies, should take fully into account the prohibition on forced evictions under international 
human rights law and related standards. 
</p>
<p>72. International organizations should establish or accede to complaint mechanisms for cases 
of forced evictions that result from their own practices and policies.  Legal remedies should be 
provided to victims in accordance with those stipulated in these guidelines. 
</p>
<p>73. Transnational corporations and other business enterprises must respect the human right to 
adequate housing, including the prohibition on forced evictions, within their respective spheres 
of activity and influence. 
</p>
<p><b>IX.  INTERPRETATION 
</b></p>
<p>74. These guidelines on development-based evictions and displacement shall not be 
interpreted as limiting, altering or otherwise prejudicing the rights recognized under international 
human rights, refugee, criminal or humanitarian law and related standards, or rights consistent 
with these laws and standards as recognized under any national law. </p>

<p><b>QUESTIONNAIRE ON WOMEN AND ADEQUATE HOUSING 
Questions on general legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p><i>Q1. Please provide information on relevant national legislation with regard to 
housing and related services.  Please also specify whether the right to adequate 
housing (RAH) is recognized in the Constitution or guaranteed in specific 
legislation. 
</i></p>
<p><i>In addition, please specify whether women&#8217;s equality is recognized in the 
Constitution or guaranteed in specific legislation.  
</i></p>
<p><i>Q2. Does the Constitution provide that the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women or other international human rights treaties which guarantee the 
right to housing form a part of national law and have domestic applicability?  Is 
there an effective judicial review process to ensure consistency of legislation with 
relevant provisions of the international human rights treaties, particularly those 
which specifically protect women&#8217;s right to adequate housing? 
</i></p>
<p><i>Q3. How do laws, policies and practices, through existing institutions (both formal 
and customary and traditional norms and practices), budgets and programmes, 
ensure substantive gender equality in the various entitlements of the right to 
adequate housing, including land, access to finance, civic services and 
information and freedom from violence against women (VAW)? 
</i></p>
<p><i>Q3.b. Do other laws (e.g. personal laws, family laws, domestic violence legislation, 
inheritance laws) ensure equal right to adequate housing for women? 
</i></p>
<p><i>Q4. What is your assessment of the housing situation of women belonging to 
particularly vulnerable groups, such as female-headed households, indigenous 
and tribal women, women with HIV/AIDS, women with disability, rural women 
living on subsistent farming, women victims of forced evictions, women victims of 
violence including domestic violence, refugees, migrants, migrant workers, 
domestic workers, internally displaced women and women of different sexual 
orientation?  Do they have access to justice and legal remedies?  Please share 
case studies and testimonies where available. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Q5. What are the historical, traditional, cultural, religious and other factors affecting 
the equal access of women to housing, land and related services? 
</i></p>
<p><i>Q6. How have the policies and processes of globalization such as trade, finance, 
investment and debt affected women&#8217;s right to adequate housing and access to 
related services?  How do these make women more vulnerable to VAW? 
</i></p>
<p><i>Q7. How have women&#8217;s rights to adequate housing and access to related services 
been addressed in poverty reduction strategies and programmes in your country? </i></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i>Q8. How have women&#8217;s rights to adequate housing and access to related services 
been addressed in violence against women legislation and programmes in your 
country? 
</i></p>
<p><i>Q9. Please share positive examples or &#8220;best practices&#8221; whereby Governments and 
civil society have endeavoured, separately or jointly, to protect and promote 
women&#8217;s equal right to adequate housing. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Q10. Please provide gender-disaggregated statistics on housing (urban/rural, forms of 
ownership, female-headed households, homelessness, access to basic services, 
etc.). 
</i></p>
<p><b>Questions on specific elements of the right to adequate housing 
</b>(a) Legal security of tenure.  The legal right to secure tenure, whether freehold, leasehold, or 
other form of individual and collective rights to housing, involves protection from forced 
eviction, harassment and other threats.  It also effectively guarantees access to, use of and control 
over land, property and housing resources. 
</p>
<p><i>Q11. Do women and men enjoy equal tenure and property rights regardless of their 
civil or other status?  Has lack of secure tenure contributed to situations of VAW?  
How does the Government guarantee such security of tenure to women?  What 
measures have been adopted to give full protection against forced eviction, based 
upon effective participation, consultation and negotiation with affected persons or 
groups? 
</i></p>
<p>(b) Access to public goods and services.  The right to adequate housing cannot be effectively 
realized without access to public goods and services, including water, health care, transport, fuel, 
sanitation, lighting and electricity, sewerage and waste disposal, childcare and communications. 
</p>
<p><i>Q12. What policies and measures have been adopted by the Government to provide or 
regulate such services to meet the needs of the community?  Do women and 
female-headed households enjoy equal access to such services?  Are the basic 
services privatized?  If so, are there subsidies and/or different pricing 
mechanisms designed to ensure affordable access by the poor? 
</i></p>
<p>(c) Access to land, water and other natural resources.  Every community must have access to 
natural resources necessary for its survival and livelihood, including, inter alia, fuel, fodder, 
water and building materials. 
</p>
<p><i>Q13. What are the laws, policies and measures adopted to ensure equitable distribution 
of land with emphasis on gender equality and provision of necessary resources for 
poor households and other marginalized and vulnerable groups?  Have land 
reforms, both urban and rural, been implemented to ensure its fair distribution as 
a public good?  What steps have been taken to respect the housing rights of 
land-based indigenous and tribal peoples in general and women within these 
groups in particular? </i></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i>Q14. Do women and female-headed households have equal access to natural resources 
sufficient to their needs, including those necessary for their survival and 
livelihood, including, inter alia, land, water, building materials, fuel and fodder?  
What measures have been adopted by the State to effectively regulate distribution 
and ensure the accessibility and affordability of such resources for women and 
female-headed households, including through subsidies? 
</i></p>
<p><i>Q15. What measures have been adopted to ensure that clean and safe water is reliably 
accessible and provided in adequate supply for individual, family and community 
use?  Do women enjoy equal access to safe drinking water and to water for 
agricultural or other domestic use? 
</i></p>
<p>(d) Affordability.  Individuals and communities should have access to affordable housing 
and must have the corresponding right to livelihood so as to be able to afford decent housing. 
</p>
<p><i>Q16. Do women enjoy equal access to housing finance?  What policies and measures 
have been adopted by the State, including through subsidies, tax incentives or 
market regulation, to ensure affordability of housing particularly for women and 
female-headed households?  Is there a national definition of &#8220;affordability&#8221; of 
housing (e.g. a maximum of one third of any household income should be 
sufficient to obtain adequate housing)?  How does unaffordability of housing 
contribute to women&#8217;s vulnerability to VAW, e.g. preventing women from leaving 
situations of domestic violence? 
</i></p>
<p>(e) Habitability.  Adequate housing must provide needed space to live in dignity and peace.  
It must also provide protection from natural elements, structural hazards and disease vectors that 
are threats to physical well-being. The physical conditions of the home can affect the realization 
of other rights, including the highest attainable standard of mental and physical health, as well as 
education, and the absence of adequate conditions is not conducive to learning (especially for 
children). 
</p>
<p><i>Q17. How do laws and policies that regulate the habitability of housing or define the 
habitability aspect of adequate housing take into consideration special needs of 
women? 
</i></p>
<p><i>Q18. What laws and policies have been adopted to regulate environmental degradation 
and to guarantee the right to a safe environment? 
</i></p>
<p>(f) Physical accessibility.  Disadvantaged communities and groups, which often include 
women and female-headed households, must be allowed full and sustainable access to adequate 
housing and resources, including land, infrastructure and sources of livelihood, and the State 
must take account of special housing needs. 
</p>
<p><i>Q19. What measures and policies have been adopted to guarantee equality of access to 
adequate housing for women and female-headed households and other 
disadvantaged groups within communities (e.g. battered women, women with 
HIV/AIDS, women with disability, indigenous women, refugees and internally 
displaced)? </i></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(g) Location.  Adequate housing must be in a place that enables access to employment, 
primary health care, education and other social services and civic amenities.  The financial and 
temporal cost of transport must not place excessive financial and other demands on the 
household.  In addition, both rural and urban housing must be in a location that is safe, 
particularly from environmental hazards and pollutants. 
</p>
<p><i>Q20. Do women face any particular constraints in accessing services and resources 
necessary for livelihood because of where they live?  What policies and measures 
are adopted to alleviate them? 
</i></p>
<p>(h) Cultural adequacy.  Housing configuration, spatial design and site/community 
organization should be determined locally and in harmony with a community&#8217;s cultural 
preferences and attributes. 
</p>
<p><i>Q21. Are women from all cultural, ethnic, religious or other backgrounds enabled 
to express cultural diversity, participate in the planning process (also see 
questions 23 and 24 below) and have the right to self-determination in relation to 
housing?  Please share such cases and examples. 
</i></p>
<p>(i) Freedom from dispossession, damage and destruction.  Each individual and community 
has a right to a place to live without threat of dispossession from land, all forms of their property, 
their homes and resources, as well as all individual and collective holdings required to sustain 
livelihood. 
</p>
<p><i>Q22. Does the State effectively safeguard the right not to be subjected to arbitrary 
interference with home, person and privacy, including dispossession?  What are 
the policies and measures adopted to protect women, including female-headed 
households,  and compensate, resettle or provide for restitution where 
dispossession takes place? 
</i></p>
<p>(j) Access to information.  Individuals and communities must have access to appropriate 
data, documents and intellectual resources that impact upon their right to obtain adequate 
housing.  Having access to appropriate data means being informed about potential industrial and 
natural hazards, infrastructure, planning design, availability of services and natural resources and 
other factors that affect the right. 
</p>
<p><i>Q23. What laws and policies exist to facilitate access to information that impacts upon 
the right to adequate housing, including information about potential industrial 
and natural hazards, infrastructure, planning design, availability of services and 
natural resources?  Are women regularly accessing such information and 
benefiting from it? 
</i></p>
<p>(k) Participation.  Effective participation in decision-making is essential to the fulfilment 
of all other rights, as well as the elements of the right to housing.  At all levels of the 
decision-making process in respect of the provision of and right to adequate housing, individuals 
and communities must be able to express and share their views; they must be consulted and be 
able to contribute substantively to such processes that affect housing, including, inter alia, 
location, spatial dimensions, links to community, social capital and livelihood, housing </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>configuration and other practical features.  The State must ensure that building and housing laws 
and policies do not preclude free expression, including cultural and religious diversity. 
</p>
<p><i>Q24. What policies and measures have been adopted to ensure/encourage popular 
participation in the decision-making process with regard to housing policies and 
planning?  Are women sufficiently represented in the process? 
</i></p>
<p><i>Q25. Do the housing laws and policies expressly protect, promote and fulfil the right to 
freedom of expression to ensure harmonious and effective design, implementation 
and maintenance of the community? 
</i></p>
<p>(l) Resettlement, restitution, compensation, non-refoulement and return.  Resettlement may 
be essential to survival in the case of natural or human-made disasters, including in conflict and 
post-conflict situations.  Therefore, the congruent right to freedom of movement can be essential 
to the fulfilment of all other rights.  Any resettlement arrangement, whatever the cause, must be 
consensual, fair and adequate to meet individual and collective needs. 
</p>
<p><i>Q26. Are there special measures adopted in resettlement processes that recognize the 
need of women and female-headed households to sufficient access to the sources 
of livelihood, productive land, infrastructure, social services and civic amenities, 
as well as fair and adequate restitution and/or compensation for losses? 
</i></p>
<p>(m) Privacy and security.  Every woman, man, youth and child has the right to live and 
conduct her/his private life in a secure place and be protected from threats or acts that 
compromise her/his mental and/or physical well-being or integrity inside or outside the home. 
</p>
<p><i>Q27. What measures have been adopted to ensure physical and mental security and 
personal privacy of women, including preventing domestic violence? 
</i></p>
<p>(n) Access to remedies.  Provision of domestic legal and other remedies is an important part 
of protecting the right to adequate housing.  Individuals and groups must be protected from 
abuse by landlords, property developers, landowners or any other third party capable of abusing 
their rights.  Where such infringements do occur, public authorities should act to preclude further 
deprivations as well as guaranteeing access to judicial redress including legal and equitable 
remedies for any infringement caused.  
</p>
<p><i>Q28. Are there remedies and legal aid available for women?  What measures have been 
adopted to ensure equal access of women to judicial processes and remedies?  
What are other innovative mechanisms such as self-help groups and women&#8217;s 
collectives that can facilitate women&#8217;s access to housing and livelihood? 
</i></p>
<p>(o) Education and empowerment.  Individuals and communities should have access to 
technical assistance and other means to enable them to improve their living standards and fully 
realize their economic, cultural and social rights and development potential.  The State, for its 
part, should endeavour to promote and provide for catalysts and mechanisms for the same, 
including efforts to ensure that all citizens are aware of procedural measures available for 
defending and realizing her/his right to adequate housing.  Human rights education is a key part 
of such an empowerment strategy. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i>Q29. What has been achieved in terms of building capacities and awareness on the 
right to adequate housing among women in your country?  What is your 
assessment of remaining needs and challenges? 
</i></p>
<p>(p) Freedom from violence against women.  The State must prevent all forms of violence 
against women committed by either State or non-State actors to ensure women&#8217;s RAH.  The 
definition of VAW as per the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against 
Women (1993) is, &#8220;any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, 
physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, 
coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life&#8221;.  
Further, the State is responsible for addressing both individual and structural forms of violence, 
in the family, the community and by the State, and for ensuring that there is legal redress for any 
acts or threats of VAW.  
</p>
<p><i>Q30. What forms of VAW and what threats of VAW occur as a result of housing 
violations, such as rape, domestic violence, assault, trafficking, family abuse, 
forced marriage, dowry deaths and others?  How do housing violations make 
women more vulnerable to VAW? 
</i></p>
<p><i>Q31. Who are the perpetrators?  What kinds of housing violations do victims of VAW 
face, e.g. battered women, rape survivors?  Show information where realization of 
RAH has led to less VAW. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Q32. What strategies/best practices have been used to address VAW related to housing 
rights violations, e.g. are there adequate shelters for victims of domestic violence?
