<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
</p>
<p>women, its causes and consequences, Rashida Manjoo, conducted an official visit to the 
</p>
<p>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, from 31 March to 15 April 2014. 
</p>
<p>She visited London, Leicester, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast and 
</p>
<p>Cookstown, where she met both State and non-State actors. 
</p>
<p>2. In London, consultations were held with the Home Secretary, the Minister of State 
</p>
<p>for Crime Prevention, the Chief Executive of the Office of the Children&#8217;s Commissioner, 
</p>
<p>the Chief Inspector of Prisons, and representatives from the Government Equalities Office, 
</p>
<p>the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department of Health, the Department of 
</p>
<p>Education and the Ministry of Justice. She also attended a public meeting of the 
</p>
<p>Parliament&#8217;s Joint Committee on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>3. In Scotland, the Special Rapporteur met with the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, the 
</p>
<p>Cabinet Secretary for Commonwealth Games, Sport, Equalities and Pensioners&#8217; Rights, the 
</p>
<p>Chief Constable of Police Scotland, the Procurator Fiscal for domestic abuse cases and 
</p>
<p>representatives of the Scottish Government Equality Unit; the Justice Directorate; the 
</p>
<p>Learning Directorate and Education Scotland.  
</p>
<p>4. In Northern Ireland, she met with the departmental representatives of the Regional 
</p>
<p>Steering Group on the Joint Sexual and Domestic Violence and Abuse Strategy, junior 
</p>
<p>ministers and Gender Equality Strategy officials from the Office of the First Minister and 
</p>
<p>the Deputy First Minister.  
</p>
<p>5. In Wales, the Special Rapporteur met with the Minister for Communities and 
</p>
<p>Tackling Poverty, the Head of the Equalities Team of the Welsh Government; the Police 
</p>
<p>and Crime Commissioner for South Wales and his deputy; and officials representing the 
</p>
<p>Minister for Local Government and Government Business, the Minister for Education and 
</p>
<p>Skills, the Minister for Housing and Regeneration and the Minister for Health and Social 
</p>
<p>Services.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur also met representatives of the Equality and Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission (in both England and Wales), the Scottish Human Rights Commission and the 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express her appreciation to all her interlocutors, 
</p>
<p>including State authorities, and civil society representatives and especially individual 
</p>
<p>survivors in the four constituent countries. Owing to limitations on the length of documents 
</p>
<p>submitted to the Human Rights Council, it is not possible to convey all the information 
</p>
<p>received in the present report. The report will adopt a general approach and briefly 
</p>
<p>highlight specificity, where it is of relevance.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to a fruitful dialogue with the Government 
</p>
<p>and other stakeholders on the implementation of her recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Manifestations of violence against women and girls,  
its causes and consequences 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Violence in the family  
</b></p>
<p>9. Domestic violence is one of the most pervasive forms of violence against women in 
</p>
<p>the United Kingdom. Crime surveys for England and Wales reveal that 30 per cent of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>women reported having experienced some domestic abuse since the age of 16, and 7 per 
</p>
<p>cent reported having experienced some type of domestic abuse in the course of the last 
</p>
<p>year.1 In 2012&#8211;2013, 77 women were killed by their partners or ex-partners.2 
</p>
<p>10. The incidence of domestic and sexual violence across Northern Ireland during the 
</p>
<p>2012/13 period included 27,190 incidents of domestic abuse, 5 murders as a direct result of 
</p>
<p>domestic violence and 404 sexual offences with a domestic motivation. During 2011/12, 
</p>
<p>697 victims and their children were recorded as being homeless as a result of domestic 
</p>
<p>violence.3 
</p>
<p>11. In Scotland for the 2012/13 period there were 60,080 incidents of domestic abuse; 
</p>
<p>61 per cent involved repeat victimization; and women were the victims in 81 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>incidents in which the sex of the victim was recorded.4 Furthermore, for homicides 
</p>
<p>recorded in the past 10 years, 50 per cent of female victims, aged between 16 and 70 years, 
</p>
<p>were killed by their partner or ex-partner, while this was the case for only 6 per cent of 
</p>
<p>male victims.5 
</p>
<p>12. A 2014 Europe-wide survey on violence against women found that 29 per cent of 
</p>
<p>respondents in the United Kingdom had experienced physical and/or sexual violence 
</p>
<p>committed by a current and/or previous partner since the age of 15. This is above the 
</p>
<p>European Union average for the survey, which was 22 per cent.6 
</p>
<p>13. The Government&#8217;s Forced Marriage Unit gave advice or support related to forced 
</p>
<p>marriage in 1,302 cases in 2013. Victims included people thought to be at potential risk, 
</p>
<p>those going through forced marriage, and those who had already been forced to marry, with 
</p>
<p>82 per cent of female victims and 40 per cent under the age of 18.7 Ninety-seven cases 
</p>
<p>involved victims with disabilities and 12 involved victims who identified as lesbian, gay, 
</p>
<p>bisexual or transgender.8 
</p>
<p>14. Forced and early marriage affects a wide range of communities in the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom, including the Irish Traveller community, as well as Afghan, South Asian, 
</p>
<p>Kurdish, Iraqi Kurd, Arab and some African communities. Some interlocutors believe that 
</p>
<p>only some of these communities are targeted by existing policy and service frameworks and 
</p>
<p>other marginalized communities are not included in the discussions and efforts to address 
</p>
<p>the problem.9 
</p>
<p>15. A 2007 study estimates that at least 66,000 women and girls in England and Wales 
</p>
<p>may be living with the consequences of female genital mutilation (FGM) and 21,000 girls 
</p>

<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>under the age of 8 are deemed to be at risk, based on the countries of origin of women and 
</p>
<p>girls.10 The Home Office is currently partly funding a study to obtain accurate statistics.  
</p>
<p>16. The current focus is largely on girls being taken to their countries of origin so that 
</p>
<p>FGM can be carried out during the summer holidays, but concerns were also shared about 
</p>
<p>girls undergoing FGM within the United Kingdom. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, 
</p>
<p>the Crown Prosecution Service announced the first prosecution of a FGM case against a 
</p>
<p>doctor accused of performing FGM and another man charged with intentionally 
</p>
<p>encouraging FGM. This is the first prosecution since the Female Genital Mutilation Act 
</p>
<p>2003 and the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Act 2005 came into 
</p>
<p>force.  
</p>
<p>17. According to interviewees, women victims of harmful practices, especially from 
</p>
<p>black and minority ethnic and refugee communities, are more likely to view their 
</p>
<p>experience within the context of family or community expectation, rather than as a form of 
</p>
<p>abuse. Socialization, dependency and the &#8220;normalization&#8221; of certain practices contribute to 
</p>
<p>the silence of young women and girls in particular.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Violence in the community 
</b></p>
<p>18. A total of 60,894 sexual offences were recorded by the police for 2013 across 
</p>
<p>England and Wales, representing an increase of 17 per cent compared to the previous year. 
</p>
<p>Rape increased by 20 per cent and other sexual offences by 15 per cent.11 
</p>
<p>19. Media and other reports suggest that some of the increased reporting of sexual 
</p>
<p>offences may be linked to the publicity surrounding the Saville case and Operation 
</p>
<p>Yewtree.12 This view was not shared by the civil society organizations interviewed. 
</p>
<p>20. Based on combined data from the 2009&#8211;2010 and 2011&#8211;2012 periods, an estimated 
</p>
<p>2.5 per cent of women reported having experienced sexual assault, including attempted 
</p>
<p>assaults.13 Other incidents of sexual assault, which include indecent exposure, unwanted 
</p>
<p>touching and sexual threats, accounted for 91 per cent of cases, while sexual assault which 
</p>
<p>includes rape and assault by penetration accounted for 21 per cent of all sexual assaults.14  
</p>
<p>21. In Northern Ireland, 1,948 sexual offences and 533 rapes were reported during the 
</p>
<p>2012&#8211;2013 period,15 a 6.1 per cent increase in overall sexual offences since the 2011&#8211;2012 
</p>
<p>period.16 In Scotland, the number of sexual offences for the same period was 7,693, 
</p>
<p>representing a 5 per cent increase from the previous year. Crimes of rape and attempted 
</p>
<p>rape increased by 15 per cent and crimes of sexual assault and other sexual offences 
</p>
<p>increased by 3 per cent in Scotland.17

</p>
<p>22. According to interlocutors, 38 per cent of women victims of the most serious sexual 
</p>
<p>offences in England and Wales in 2011&#8211;2012 did not tell anyone, and 87 per cent did not 
</p>
<p>tell the police.18 Issues such as victim-blaming and a lack of trust in the justice system 
</p>
<p>discouraged women from disclosing incidents.  
</p>
<p>23. As regards sexual harassment, it was reported that 42 per cent of young women in 
</p>
<p>London aged between 18 and 34 experienced unwanted sexual attention in 2013.19
 
Girls 
</p>
<p>aged between 16 and 18 are reportedly at the highest risk of sexual assault,20
 
while women 
</p>
<p>aged between 18 and 29 are at greatest risk of threatening and offensive advances on the 
</p>
<p>Internet.  
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur met with young women, the representatives of organizations 
</p>
<p>that represent young women in London and Bristol, as well as with the service providers 
</p>
<p>working with black and minority ethnic girls, who shared concerns regarding the grossly 
</p>
<p>underreported problem of sexual violence experienced by women and girls aged between 
</p>
<p>11 and 25. A 2010 poll indicates that almost one in three 16&#8211;18-year-old girls surveyed had 
</p>
<p>experienced unwanted sexual touching at school.21 A 2009 study indicates that one in three 
</p>
<p>teenage girls had experienced sexual violence from a partner while in a relationship.22 
</p>
<p>Service providers reported an overwhelming normalization of attitudes and behaviours 
</p>
<p>around sexual abuse and harassment in schools and in the community, leading to its 
</p>
<p>acceptance and tolerance, even by victims themselves. Cases of groping, harassment, sexual 
</p>
<p>abuse and other offences, occurring in private and public spaces, including school 
</p>
<p>bathrooms, have been documented.  
</p>
<p>25. Regarding Internet violence, a recent study found that many women and girls had 
</p>
<p>been exposed to harmful behaviours online, including humiliation, harassment, intimidation 
</p>
<p>and &#8220;sexting&#8221; as a form of bullying.23 Furthermore, interviewees stated that boyfriends 
</p>
<p>commonly published, and/or threatened to publish, photographs of consensual sexual 
</p>
<p>activity to harass and manipulate women and even force them to engage in sexual activity 
</p>
<p>with the boyfriend and/or their friends.  
</p>
<p>26. Young girls involved in gangs are often raped and forced to carry drugs and guns. 
</p>
<p>They are pressured to have sex with boys as an initiation into a gang and have been 
</p>
<p>abducted and sexually assaulted for criticizing gang members. Young women associated 
</p>
<p>with rival gangs are targeted24 and, in some cases, forced to take part in a &#8220;line-up&#8221;, where 
</p>
<p>they are made to perform sexual acts on several men.25 Interviewees allege that some 
</p>
<p>schools turn a blind eye to gang activity in order to protect their reputation. 
</p>
<p>27. For women and girls from black and minority ethnic communities, the consequences 
</p>
<p>of sexual violence include additional fears, pressure, shame linked to family honour and 
</p>
<p>community norms, stigmatization and rejection. This then leads to further silence in these 
</p>
<p>families and communities. <b>

<p><b> C. Violence perpetrated or condoned by the State 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur visited Hydebank Wood Prison in Northern Ireland, 
</p>
<p>Cornton Vale Prison in Scotland and Holloway Prison for Women and Young Offenders in 
</p>
<p>London.  
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur regrets that, despite her repeated requests from the start of 
</p>
<p>the mission, the Government did not permit a visit to Yarl&#8217;s Wood Immigration Removal 
</p>
<p>Centre. In compliance with the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council (Council resolution 5/2, annex) and the terms of reference for 
</p>
<p>fact-finding missions by special rapporteurs/representatives of the Commission on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (E/CN.4/1998/45, appendix V) governing official country visits, she attempted to 
</p>
<p>visit the Centre independently. However, she was denied entry and was informed by the 
</p>
<p>Centre&#8217;s director that instructions had been received to deny entry to the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>30. There is an increase in women being incarcerated, with black and minority ethnic 
</p>
<p>women overrepresented within prisons and immigration detention centres. A 2007 report 
</p>
<p>indicates that ethnic minority women made up 28 per cent of the women&#8217;s prison 
</p>
<p>population, representing over three times that of the general population.26 Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>black and minority ethnic women were more likely to be living in a deprived area, more 
</p>
<p>likely to be subject to poverty, to have experienced the State care system and to find it 
</p>
<p>harder to access educational opportunities. They were also more likely to be remanded in 
</p>
<p>custody than white offenders, and their disadvantage and marginalization continues and is 
</p>
<p>compounded in the criminal justice system.27 
</p>
<p>31. Reports indicate that over half of women in prisons have experienced emotional, 
</p>
<p>physical or sexual abuse, including during childhood.28 This was confirmed in interviews 
</p>
<p>with inmates and staff, and it was clear that the strong links between violence against 
</p>
<p>women and women&#8217;s incarceration, whether prior to, during or after incarceration, is not 
</p>
<p>being fully acknowledged or addressed.  
</p>
<p>32. Information provided by interviewees, and echoed in recent reports, reflects that 
</p>
<p>female inmates are much more likely to repeatedly self-harm, and that they are at high risk 
</p>
<p>of suicide. Concerns were expressed about the Government&#8217;s failure to protect women from 
</p>
<p>high levels of self-harm while in State custody.29 It is unfortunate that the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was not allowed sufficient privacy and access, particularly while visiting 
</p>
<p>Holloway Prison. The hesitation of the staff to allow direct access to inmates adversely 
</p>
<p>affected the gathering of information and this contributed to  inmates being reluctant to 
</p>
<p>speak freely.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur also heard concerns about the number of young women who 
</p>
<p>are incarcerated, which was strikingly evident during the prison visits she conducted.

</p>
<p>Interviewees stated that younger women are more likely to be involved in incidents of self-
</p>
<p>harm, antisocial behaviour and physical altercations.  
</p>
<p>34. In a 2013 report, the Chief Inspector of Prisons had raised concerns regarding the 
</p>
<p>inadequate handling of cases, with women&#8217;s histories of victimization not being sufficiently 
</p>
<p>acknowledged by the authorities, or detainees with clear trafficking indicators not being 
</p>
<p>referred to the relevant mechanisms. Particular concern was expressed about women who 
</p>
<p>had been detained for very long periods, as well as mentally ill women and pregnant 
</p>
<p>women who were detained despite their situations and without a clear justification.30  
</p>
<p>35. A concern raised by the Chief Inspector and non-governmental organizations 
</p>
<p>(NGOs) is the lack of sufficient female staff in female custodial settings. Interviewees 
</p>
<p>stated that women who have experienced rape and sexual violence experience fear and 
</p>
<p>distress about being guarded by male staff, including having male staff enter rooms without 
</p>
<p>notice, and the disregard for privacy, with women often being seen naked or when using the 
</p>
<p>toilet. 
</p>
<p>36. Concerns were raised about allegations of ill-treatment and abuse within 
</p>
<p>immigration detention facilities, including at Yarl&#8217;s Wood. Prior to the visit of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur, there were numerous media reports of allegations of abuses in the detention 
</p>
<p>centre, based on the testimonies of both former Yarl&#8217;s Wood detainees and former Serco 
</p>
<p>employees.31 Such reports refer to a culture of bullying and intimidation of detainees, with 
</p>
<p>guards often entering rooms without knocking and women being constantly monitored with 
</p>
<p>no respect for their privacy. More serious allegations include sexual activity, not always 
</p>
<p>consensual, between staff and detainees, and the existence of &#8220;blind spots&#8221; in the facility 
</p>
<p>where these activities have taken place.32 The Chief Inspector of Prisons has stated that, 
</p>
<p>even if/when sexual activity was &#8220;consensual&#8221;, this &#8220;can never be less than abusive given 
</p>
<p>the vulnerability of the detained population&#8221;.33  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of these allegations during her interviews 
</p>
<p>with NGO representatives and through submissions received prior to and after her visit. 
</p>
<p>Some NGOs also reported cases of physical assault and threats by staff during the process 
</p>
<p>of removal and deportation. These include allegations of sexual assaults perpetrated on 
</p>
<p>three occasions against one individual by a Serco employee and the failure of the police to 
</p>
<p>conduct an impartial, adequate or effective investigation into the victim&#8217;s allegations. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur also heard directly the allegations of a former Serco service provider, 
</p>
<p>who shared concerns about the safety and well-being of individuals who had been subjected 
</p>
<p>to abuse, or were likely to be subjected to abuse, and who remained vulnerable. Claims 
</p>
<p>include detainees not receiving a full and proper in-depth mental health assessment; the 
</p>
<p>untimely and inadequate treatment of detainees who had subjected themselves to serious 
</p>
<p>self-harm and suicidal acts; the inconsistent application of individual safeguards; and 
</p>
<p>allegations of sexual assaults not being properly investigated.  
</p>
<p>38. The 2013 report on Yarl&#8217;s Wood by the Chief Inspector of Prisons was based on 
</p>
<p>more than 50 confidential interviews, and found the establishment to be largely respectful 
</p>
<p>and a safe place for detainees. No evidence was found of a culture of victimization or 
</p>

<p>systematic abuse.34 The reaction of some NGO service providers to this finding is that such 
</p>
<p>a claim could be partly explained because victims interviewed had not yet been granted 
</p>
<p>refugee status, and that it is usually former detainees who will talk more freely about their 
</p>
<p>experiences, both positive and negative, after their status is secured.35 
</p>
<p><b> D. Violence linked to the transnational sphere 
</b></p>
<p>39. The United Kingdom is a destination country for migrant and asylum-seeking 
</p>
<p>women, with approximately 30 per cent of asylum applications being submitted by women 
</p>
<p>in their own right since 2003. In 2012, 6,071 of a total of 21,785 asylum seekers were 
</p>
<p>women.36
 
 
</p>
<p>40. A recent report indicates that over 85 per cent of the interviewees claimed they had 
</p>
<p>been raped, tortured or both in their country of origin.37 While Home Office statistics do not 
</p>
<p>indicate whether gender-based persecution is the basis of a woman&#8217;s claim, research 
</p>
<p>reflects the high prevalence of gender-based violence suffered by asylum-seeking women in 
</p>
<p>their country of origin, during transit or within the United Kingdom.38 
</p>
<p>41. Concerns were raised regarding the inadequate assessment made by the Home 
</p>
<p>Office to identify and acknowledge women&#8217;s past experiences of violence when applying 
</p>
<p>for asylum. A 2013 report states that, &#8220;women are less likely than men to receive a correct 
</p>
<p>initial decision on their asylum claim&#8221;.39 It is estimated that approximately one third of 
</p>
<p>women are granted asylum on appeal, with cases being overturned because of poor initial 
</p>
<p>credibility assessments.40  
</p>
<p>42. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has also voiced 
</p>
<p>concerns that women asylum seekers may not have their protection needs appropriately 
</p>
<p>assessed, or have the ability to speak in confidence about any gender-based violence they 
</p>
<p>might have experienced, or be experiencing. Also, the use of the Detained Fast Track 
</p>
<p>Processes does not favour the proper identification and examination of cases involving 
</p>
<p>gender-related violence or trafficking, owing to the speed with which asylum decisions are 
</p>
<p>made, and the limited involvement of claimants&#8217; legal representatives.41 
</p>
<p>43. Another issue of concern highlighted is the situation of migrant domestic workers in 
</p>
<p>the United Kingdom. The Special Rapporteur met with a large group of women domestic 
</p>
<p>workers and representatives of NGOs providing support and assistance to migrant domestic 
</p>
<p>workers. The testimonies of abuse included accounts of women being forced to work very 
</p>
<p>long hours, both cleaning and/or taking care of children; not being allowed to take leave

<p>days during the year; being constantly shouted at by employers; not being allowed to talk to 
</p>
<p>anybody; being forced to sleep in inadequate rooms, such as utility rooms, kitchens or 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rooms; and having their salaries withheld. Furthermore, testimonies were shared 
</p>
<p>of domestic workers being subjected to coercion and deceit, with some employers 
</p>
<p>deliberately trying to keep them uninformed and isolated, and misleading them about their 
</p>
<p>legal status, their rights and the employer&#8217;s power to have them incarcerated or deported. 
</p>
<p>Migrant domestic workers&#8217; families usually depend on their remittances and thus women 
</p>
<p>often feel they do not have a choice but to remain in exploitative or abusive situations.42 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur also heard allegations from NGOs that many domestic workers are 
</p>
<p>trafficked into the country. 
</p>
<p>44. The new overseas domestic worker visa has raised further concerns, including 
</p>
<p>because it affects whether domestic workers can change employers or renew their visas, 
</p>
<p>even in abusive employment situations. NGO service providers have documented how 
</p>
<p>migrant domestic workers with the new visa are clearly experiencing worse treatment by 
</p>
<p>employers, as compared to those who entered the United Kingdom on the previous visa.43  
</p>
<p><b> III. Implications for effective citizenship rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p>45. Worldwide, inequality, discrimination and violence against women are barriers to 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s full participation in public and political life. 
</p>
<p>46. In July 2013, concerns were raised by the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women, including that women continue to be significantly 
</p>
<p>underrepresented in certain occupations, including in Parliament, in the judiciary and on 
</p>
<p>public sector boards. The United Kingdom ranks eleventh among member States of the 
</p>
<p>European Union in terms of female representation, and fiftieth worldwide (see 
</p>
<p>CEDAW/C/GBR/7, para. 88). The Committee was particularly concerned at the low 
</p>
<p>representation in political life of black and ethnic minority women and women with 
</p>
<p>disabilities (see CEDAW/C/GBR/CO/7, para. 42). Black and ethnic minority women 
</p>
<p>represent 5.8 per cent of the population, yet make  up less than 1 per cent of councillors at 
</p>
<p>the local government level (see CEDAW/C/GBR/7, para. 93). 
</p>
<p>47. In Northern Ireland, concerns were raised with the Special Rapporteur regarding the 
</p>
<p>exclusion of women from the peacebuilding processes and how their experiences of 
</p>
<p>violence during and after the conflict have been mostly unrecognized. Calls have been 
</p>
<p>made by some international human rights mechanisms for the implementation of Security 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 1325 (2000), including the development of the relevant national action 
</p>
<p>plans.  
</p>
<p>48. In 2010, women constituted 24 per cent of professional judges in England and Wales 
</p>
<p>and 21 per cent in Scotland.44 In 2012, women held 43 per cent of judicial posts in Northern 
</p>
<p>Ireland, but there are no women on the High Court bench.45

<p>49. Regarding access to justice for women victims of violence, a crucial concern raised 
</p>
<p>was in regard to the changes and cuts to legal aid, following the adoption of the Legal Aid, 
</p>
<p>Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012. Through this law, the majority of 
</p>
<p>family law proceedings, including disputes involving access to/residence of children, were 
</p>
<p>reportedly made ineligible for legal aid funding. Exceptions were made for applications for 
</p>
<p>protective injunctions for domestic violence or forced marriage, as well as for divorce, 
</p>
<p>matrimonial finance and cases relating to children where evidence of violence is provided.46 
</p>
<p>Advocates argue, however, that the evidence required to demonstrate domestic violence 
</p>
<p>places an onerous burden upon victims.47 For example, women are required to pay for 
</p>
<p>documentary evidence (&#163;50 for a letter from their doctor and &#163;60 for a memorandum of 
</p>
<p>conviction), even when on welfare benefits, with no recourse to public funds.48 Owing to 
</p>
<p>the strict criteria, some of those excluded are victims who reached out to women&#8217;s support 
</p>
<p>groups, but not to the authorities; women who called the police but whose calls were 
</p>
<p>unanswered; or women who did not call the police or see a doctor, because they suffered no 
</p>
<p>serious physical injuries.49  
</p>
<p>50. In family law proceedings, victims are forced to face their perpetrators in court 
</p>
<p>without the assistance of lawyers, while perpetrators can often afford legal representation. 
</p>
<p>According to interviewees, women who seek justice and protection by participating in law 
</p>
<p>family proceedings are frequently fearful of attending court and having to interact with the 
</p>
<p>perpetrator. 
</p>
<p>51. Furthermore, the disproportionate effect that the legal aid cuts are having on black 
</p>
<p>and minority ethnic women was consistently raised, as these women are more likely to 
</p>
<p>experience poverty or very low levels of income. Women with disabilities and those from 
</p>
<p>migrant communities, especially women who do not speak English, and women who are on 
</p>
<p>low incomes or have &#8220;no recourse to public funds&#8221;, were also identified as more vulnerable 
</p>
<p>to violations of human rights and less likely to be able to access justice.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur also heard concerns about the emergence of alternative 
</p>
<p>sources of support and arbitration within certain communities. Within such forums, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;unaccountable community or religious leaders&#8221; settle matters in a way that does not 
</p>
<p>necessarily provide justice to women. These include Jewish beth dins and Muslim 
</p>
<p>arbitration tribunals that use the Arbitration Act 1996 to formally pronounce religious 
</p>
<p>judgements in cases of divorce, child custody, domestic violence, forced marriage and 
</p>
<p>inheritance. In these forums, emphasis is placed on family reconciliation, which often 
</p>
<p>results in women being forced back into abusive families, divorce is discouraged and 
</p>
<p>women are deterred from reporting or pursuing criminal proceedings.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Economic and developmental rights 
</b></p>
<p>53. Many women continue to be disproportionately overrepresented in part-time jobs, 
</p>
<p>temporary work and self-employment and often work in low-wage, feminized sectors of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>evidence-for-private-family-law-matters.pdf. 
</p>
<p> 47 The criteria, provided through regulations 33 and 34, include protective injunctions for domestic 
</p>
<p>violence, referrals to a multi-agency risk assessment conference, or reports from social services.

<p>economy.50 They are also affected by unpaid care work and responsibilities. This is an issue 
</p>
<p>that was particularly highlighted during interviews with NGOs who work with the black 
</p>
<p>and minority ethnic communities.  
</p>
<p>54. Responding to and preventing violence against women needs to include basic 
</p>
<p>survival needs, such as subsidized housing, income support,  childcare and educational 
</p>
<p>support.51 However, in the current context of economic and financial constraints, 
</p>
<p>interviewees claimed that there have been cutbacks to funding, which has impacted the 
</p>
<p>provision of basic support services. Since 2010, the United Kingdom has adopted a fiscal 
</p>
<p>policy that has been characterized by sustained reductions in public spending.52 These 
</p>
<p>austerity measures were originally launched in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, 
</p>
<p>with the aim of reducing the country&#8217;s budget deficit over five years.53 Such measures have 
</p>
<p>been extended to apply until the fiscal year 2017/18.54  
</p>
<p>55. The devolution of authority to local authorities (referred to as localism by 
</p>
<p>interviewees) on issues such as service provision has reportedly led to changes to 
</p>
<p>commissioning models, including open tendering and short-term commissioning, and the 
</p>
<p>increased participation of sectors that do not necessarily have the expertise to provide 
</p>
<p>responsive and appropriate services. Submissions sent to the Special Rapporteur state that 
</p>
<p>this move has come at the expense of the expertise and experience of community-based 
</p>
<p>service providers. The increase in the commissioning of gender-neutral services, which 
</p>
<p>disregard the specific needs of women and girls, was also highlighted as a concern.  
</p>
<p>56. The need for greater prioritization and investment by the National Health Service in 
</p>
<p>tackling violence against women and girls was an issue raised by numerous interviewees. 
</p>
<p>One report highlights recommendations to improve the provision of care and support for 
</p>
<p>victims, including improved identification of victims, provision of support and appropriate 
</p>
<p>referrals, and the commissioning of specialist services.55 According to the Equality and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Commission, the health sector is yet to invest the resources necessary to 
</p>
<p>treat violence against women as a major public health issue.56  
</p>
<p>57. Furthermore, owing to their experiences of violence and abuse, women victims of 
</p>
<p>violence often present symptoms of depression and other mental health problems. The 
</p>
<p>Government has recognized that there is a link between sexual and domestic violence, and 
</p>
<p>mental health illness, and has developed mental health and suicide prevention strategies.57 
</p>
<p>However, suicide still carries considerable social stigma and, together with self-harm, 
</p>
<p>remains a hidden phenomenon in many communities. NGOs interviewed noted the 
</p>
<p>insufficient attention paid to the particular intersections of violence, poverty and structural 
</p>
<p>inequality, which is experienced by black and minority ethnic women and which places 
</p>
<p>them at particular risk of suffering depression, anxiety and other mental health issues.

<p>further explained that, while specific services to address the mental health needs of black 
</p>
<p>and minority ethnic women are sometimes found in larger cities, this is not the case in 
</p>
<p>smaller towns, where women are often further isolated from their support networks and 
</p>
<p>families.  
</p>
<p>58. In Northern Ireland, a concern raised by interviewees is the restrictive abortion law, 
</p>
<p>under which termination of pregnancy is illegal unless it is necessary to preserve the life or 
</p>
<p>health of women, but is not allowed in cases of rape or incest, or malformation of the 
</p>
<p>foetus. The Special Rapporteur was informed of a 16-week public consultation launched by 
</p>
<p>the Northern Ireland Government on a revised set of guidelines for the lawful termination 
</p>
<p>of pregnancy.58 However, no public consultation regarding the abolition of the law 
</p>
<p>criminalizing abortion has been undertaken (see A/63/38, paras. 288 and 289). 
</p>
<p>59. Given the current economic realities, including the rising costs of living, testimonies 
</p>
<p>reflect the weekly struggle, with women having to make hard choices regarding the 
</p>
<p>purchase of basic foods, expenditure on children and meeting other household needs. 
</p>
<p>Interviewees highlighted the detrimental and disproportionate impact of the rising cost of 
</p>
<p>living, particularly for women with no income or with fixed incomes that are not in line 
</p>
<p>with inflation, as well as for women who rely on benefits. The situation is even worse for 
</p>
<p>asylum-seeking women who do not benefit from any social welfare, such as failed asylum-
</p>
<p>seeking women who cannot claim benefits such as Housing Benefit, Job Seeker&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Allowance, Child Benefit or Family Tax Credit. 
</p>
<p>60. Domestic violence is recognized as a major cause of homelessness for women and is 
</p>
<p>reportedly the fourth most common reason given for an application for housing in 
</p>
<p>Scotland.59 Changes to housing support in the United Kingdom, and the withdrawal of the 
</p>
<p>Spare Room Subsidy, also known as the &#8220;bedroom tax&#8221;, are reportedly reducing women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>ability to find rental properties owing to the unavailability of suitably sized accommodation 
</p>
<p>(see A/HRC/25/54/Add.2, para. 46). This is also causing bottlenecks in shelters, as women 
</p>
<p>are unable to leave, thereby preventing other women and children getting safe 
</p>
<p>accommodation and support.60 
</p>
<p>61. Women with disabilities shared concerns regarding abuse, fear of disclosure, leaving 
</p>
<p>and homelessness. Interviewees stated that local authorities were failing to offer them 
</p>
<p>priority housing based on both their disability and them being victims of domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>62. NGOs, particularly in Scotland and the North-East of England, also expressed 
</p>
<p>concerns regarding the situation of destitute women asylum seekers, particularly those who 
</p>
<p>have had their asylum claims refused. The Special Rapporteur heard of women often 
</p>
<p>sleeping on the streets, and having to rely on the goodwill of friends or on food parcels 
</p>
<p>from churches and from charity organizations.61 Destitution puts women at further risk of 
</p>
<p>experiencing violence, including sexual violence, or having to engage in transactional 
</p>
<p>sexual activities in exchange for food and shelter. A 2012 study shows that of 67 women 
</p>
<p>who were refused asylum interviewed, 67 per cent had become destitute, and of those 16 
</p>
<p>per cent had experienced sexual violence while destitute.62  
</p>
<p>63. The right to work and the right to social security are integral to the right to an 
</p>
<p>adequate standard of living. Cutbacks in public spending often lead to increased 
</p>
<p>unemployment. In the United Kingdom, the cuts to State spending have mainly affected

</p>
<p><b> C. Social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>64. Generally, social and cultural constructions of women&#8217;s roles and status perpetuate 
</p>
<p>stereotypes that disadvantage women and preclude the enjoyment of all their human rights, 
</p>
<p>including the right to a life free of violence.  
</p>
<p>65. Practices justified on the basis of customs, religions and traditions also facilitate 
</p>
<p>violence against women and girls in some instances. Negative and over-sexualized media 
</p>
<p>portrayals of women and girls include women being predominantly represented in passive 
</p>
<p>and stereotyped roles and often portrayed as victims. They are also far more likely to be 
</p>
<p>referred to in terms of their age, physical appearance or family role in the media.65 The 
</p>
<p>proliferation of a &#8220;celebrity culture&#8221; and of beauty advertising has had a tremendous effect 
</p>
<p>on girls&#8217; body image, with 29 per cent of 11&#8211;16 year girls being &#8220;not at all happy with the 
</p>
<p>way they look&#8221;.66 This is further compounded by the stereotyped portrayal of rape and 
</p>
<p>abuse victims; the underrepresentation of positive news items related to women; and men&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>domination in the leadership and shaping of the media industry.67 
</p>
<p>66. Other concerns regarding stereotyping include the narratives around single 
</p>
<p>parenting, which often demonize single mothers; the infantilization of women with 
</p>
<p>disabilities; the stereotyped assumptions about the skills and backgrounds of refugee, 
</p>
<p>asylum-seeking and migrant women; and the stereotyping of lesbian, bisexual and 
</p>
<p>transgender women in respect of relationships, family and reproductive choices.68 
</p>
<p>67. In the case of black and minority ethnic communities, interviewees explained how 
</p>
<p>they tend to be represented by &#8220;self-styled community (business and religious) male 
</p>
<p>leaders&#8221;, who rarely represent the interests of women and increasingly adhere to patriarchal 
</p>
<p>religious norms and values. This has resulted in the increased surveillance and policing of 
</p>
<p>women, and the denial and silencing of issues that affect them, including gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence. This situation is further exacerbated when government and statutory agencies 
</p>
<p>seek to accommodate religious norms and values in the name of &#8220;religious sensitivity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>68. NGO service providers also expressed serious concerns about the problematic 
</p>
<p>narratives surrounding violence against black and minority ethnic women and girls. Such 
</p>
<p>narratives are often framed solely within notions of culture, community or religion, rather 
</p>
<p>than within the larger context of a general patriarchal and discriminatory societal approach 
</p>
<p>to women and girls. The consequence is that legal and policy responses are then limited to 
</p>
<p>some harmful practices, such as early/forced marriages of young women and girls or female 
</p>
<p>genital mutilation, as applicable to certain communities. This then ignores the harms 
</p>
<p>emanating from other sexist practices that are prevalent in the United Kingdom, and which 
</p>
<p>impact women and girls of all ethnic and racial backgrounds.

<p><b> IV. Challenges in fulfilling the S</b>tate&#8217;s obligation to act with due 
<b>diligence to eliminate violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>69. The United Kingdom has committed to protecting and promoting the rights of 
</p>
<p>women through its ratification of numerous international human rights instruments. The 
</p>
<p>Government has also committed to ratifying the Council of Europe Convention on 
</p>
<p>preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (the Istanbul 
</p>
<p>Convention). Furthermore, numerous laws, policies and programmes have been put in place 
</p>
<p>to address women&#8217;s rights generally, and violence against women specifically.  
</p>
<p>70. The present section examines the measures taken by the Government of the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom to fulfil its international obligations, and also the challenges it faces to prevent, 
</p>
<p>investigate, prosecute and punish violence against women, as well as to protect victims and 
</p>
<p>provide them with effective remedies.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Prevention 
</b></p>
<p>71. Prevention is one of the guiding principles of the United Kingdom strategy on 
</p>
<p>violence against women, and it aims to prevent violence against women and girls from 
</p>
<p>happening in the first place by challenging the attitudes and behaviours which foster it, and 
</p>
<p>intervening early to prevent it. Yet shortcomings remain in ensuring the promotion of 
</p>
<p>gender equality and challenging harmful attitudes and behaviours, including among 
</p>
<p>children and teenagers, especially at schools. According to interviewees, the work on issues 
</p>
<p>such as bullying is often de-gendered, and the expansion of faith schools has led to 
</p>
<p>reticence to provide education on sex, sexuality and relationships. 
</p>
<p>72. A 2013 study found a lack of high-quality, age-appropriate sex and relationships 
</p>
<p>education in more than a third of the schools inspected in England.69 Personal, social, health 
</p>
<p>and economic education modules are not compulsory and, when offered by schools, often 
</p>
<p>avoid discussion of sexual and emotional feelings and issues such as sexual abuse, 
</p>
<p>homosexuality and pornography. The report also highlights how children and young people 
</p>
<p>may be left at risk when they are not taught appropriate language or how to describe 
</p>
<p>unwanted sexual behaviours, or where to go to for help.70  
</p>
<p>73. During the mission, no information was forthcoming as regards specific government 
</p>
<p>programmes at the national level that address strategies to prevent violence aimed at 
</p>
<p>women.  
</p>
<p>74. As regards the legal framework, while there is no general, stand-alone law on 
</p>
<p>violence against women applicable to the United Kingdom as a whole, there are some legal 
</p>
<p>instruments that aim to address the issue. These include the Equality Act 2010, the 
</p>
<p>Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Act 2004, the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the 
</p>
<p>Policing and Crime Act 2009, the Crime and Security Act 2010, the Forced Marriages 
</p>
<p>(Civil Protection) Act 2007, the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 and the Protection 
</p>
<p>from Harassment Act 1997. The Domestic Violence Immigration Rule was also introduced 
</p>
<p>in 2002. In terms of harmful practices, new offences were recently introduced to 
</p>
<p>criminalize forced marriage through the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 
</p>
<p>2014.

</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur heard concerns regarding current gaps in the law, including 
</p>
<p>the lack of a specific prohibition of simulated rape pornography in the Criminal Justice and 
</p>
<p>Courts Bill; the lack of adequate regulation in relation to the display of highly sexualized 
</p>
<p>images of women in men&#8217;s magazines; the non-existence of the criminal offence of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;intentionally seriously impairing a person&#8217;s psychological integrity through coercion or 
</p>
<p>threats&#8221;; and the lack of provisions in the Immigration Rules to reflect the relevance of 
</p>
<p>taking into account issues other than domestic violence against women and girls.71 
</p>
<p>Concerns were also raised about the criminalization of forced marriage and its negative 
</p>
<p>effect on reporting.72  
</p>
<p>76. NGOs also expressed concerns about the use of terms such as &#8220;domestic abuse&#8221; in 
</p>
<p>legislation, which tends to conflate interpersonal/spousal violence with broader family 
</p>
<p>violence incidents, and how is leading to gender neutrality in legislative developments. A 
</p>
<p>positive exception was found in the practice of the Scottish Government, which uses the 
</p>
<p>definition proposed in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, 
</p>
<p>which clearly identifies the gendered nature of violence against women and, more 
</p>
<p>importantly, frames it as a human rights violation. 
</p>
<p>77. Regarding policies and programmes, in 2010, the Government of the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom developed the strategy &#8220;A Call to End Violence against Women and Girls&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>which is applicable in England and Wales. As part of the strategy, annual action plans are 
</p>
<p>developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders and monitored by government 
</p>
<p>departments.
 
The Government&#8217;s five-year strategy is aimed at improving access to justice, 
</p>
<p>services and support for crime victims and witnesses. Its implementation is overseen by an 
</p>
<p>interministerial group chaired by the Home Secretary. Furthermore, a stakeholder group, 
</p>
<p>which consists of State and non-State actors, serves as an important forum for exchange of 
</p>
<p>information and expertise and evaluation and identification of ways to improve the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s responses to violence against women.  
</p>
<p>78. Similar initiatives have also been developed in the constituent countries. The 
</p>
<p>Scottish Government has developed a draft violence against women strategy.73 In Northern 
</p>
<p>Ireland, a public consultation was undertaken in 2014 to adopt the Stopping Domestic and 
</p>
<p>Sexual Violence and Abuse Strategy.74 In Wales, the &#8220;Right to Be Safe&#8221; strategy was 
</p>
<p>adopted in 2010 and has been coupled with efforts to draft new legislation to end violence 
</p>
<p>against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence, in consultation with specialized third 
</p>
<p>sector organizations.75  
</p>
<p>79. Efforts have been made to design and launch campaigns to reach out to young 
</p>
<p>people and educate them about the various manifestations of violence, including in the 
</p>
<p>home, in schools, in social media and on the Internet. The national prevention campaign

</p>
<p>(http://gov.wales/docs/dsjlg/publications/commsafety/100325besafefinalenv1.pdf). The Scottish 
</p>
<p>Government is developing its own strategy on violence against women, which is likely to be

<p>published in summer 2014 (www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Equality/violence-

<p>&#8220;This is Abuse&#8221; is noteworthy and has been welcomed by the relevant stakeholders. It 
</p>
<p>encourages teenagers to rethink their views about rape, consent, violence and abuse. The 
</p>
<p>work by the Office of the Children&#8217;s Commissioner includes a focus on child sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation and specific research on sexual exploitation within gangs and other social 
</p>
<p>groups; abuse of children in care; access and exposure to pornography; and children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>understandings of sexual consent.  
</p>
<p>80. While most stakeholders interviewed welcomed such initiatives, concerns were 
</p>
<p>shared about the lack of a comprehensive and coordinated strategy to adequately address 
</p>
<p>violence against women and girls across the entire country. The lack of a central budget and 
</p>
<p>the emphasis on local decision-making are among potential risks to the effective 
</p>
<p>implementation of the United Kingdom strategy.76  
</p>
<p>81. The shift from gender specificity to gender neutrality in the Government&#8217;s responses 
</p>
<p>to violence against women, which has occurred to the detriment of gender-specific 
</p>
<p>initiatives and programmes, was also of concern to many stakeholders. It was stressed that 
</p>
<p>policies and practices on equality generally, and those on violence against women in 
</p>
<p>particular, are increasingly gender neutral and aim for equal treatment for all, thereby 
</p>
<p>disregarding the need for special measures that acknowledge difference and recognize that 
</p>
<p>women are disproportionately impacted by violence, inequality and discrimination.  
</p>
<p>82. Preventive measures on violence against women also require the development of 
</p>
<p>national data collection systems. In July 2014, a parliamentary report raised concerns about 
</p>
<p>the alleged underrecording of crime by police in England and Wales. The evidence pointed 
</p>
<p>to manipulated police figures regarding rape and sexual abuse, which are commonly 
</p>
<p>recorded as &#8220;crime-related&#8221; incidents or &#8220;no crimes&#8221;.77 This is reportedly due to &#8220;lax police 
</p>
<p>compliance with the agreed national standard of victim-focussed crime recording&#8221;, as well 
</p>
<p>as pressure to achieve numerical targets.78 Furthermore, the data currently collected tends to 
</p>
<p>be part of a wider analysis of violent crime, rather than a specific assessment on the 
</p>
<p>prevalence of violence against women and girls.79  
</p>
<p>83. In terms of training and capacity-building, the Special Rapporteur was made aware 
</p>
<p>of progress made in the criminal justice system, particularly through the Crown Prosecution 
</p>
<p>Service, which has worked with experts from the women&#8217;s sector and academics to 
</p>
<p>improve training for lawyers and judges. The Crown Office in Scotland has also 
</p>
<p>implemented training programmes for staff and has revised its guidelines on domestic 
</p>
<p>violence. Service providers welcomed such measures but raised concerns, as such training 
</p>
<p>is mainly focused on the prosecution aspect of violence against women, as opposed to a 
</p>
<p>wider range of practitioners involved in preventive work, such as the police and health and 
</p>
<p>education professionals.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Protection 
</b></p>
<p>84. Protection provisions for victims of domestic violence, some of which came into 
</p>
<p>existence in England and Wales through the Family Law Act 1996, were strengthened 
</p>
<p>through the Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Act 2004 (which covers the four

<p>constituent countries). Non-molestation orders were amended to provide a criminal sanction 
</p>
<p>for non-compliance, with a maximum sentence of five years&#8217; imprisonment. The act also 
</p>
<p>provides for restraining orders, which can be imposed upon acquitted defendants when a 
</p>
<p>court deems it necessary to protect a person. The 2004 Act also deemed &#8220;common assault&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>an offence for which the police can make an arrest at the scene, without a warrant.  
</p>
<p>85. The Crime and Security Act 2010, applicable throughout the United Kingdom, 
</p>
<p>provides for a new civil protection order, the domestic violence protection order, which 
</p>
<p>aims to give victims time, space and support to consider their options. The order places 
</p>
<p>conditions on perpetrators, including restricting/removing perpetrators from households, 
</p>
<p>and preventing contact with, or molestation of victims.80 An evaluation report published in 
</p>
<p>2013 made some recommendations for better implementation of the order, including 
</p>
<p>ensuring that police must routinely give reasons when neither a charge nor a protection 
</p>
<p>notice is issued; the proactive monitoring of the protection notice; the enhancing of police 
</p>
<p>training on these orders; and the need for clear guidance regarding &#8220;no contact&#8221;, &#8220;non-
</p>
<p>molestation&#8221;, and child contact arrangements.81 
</p>
<p>86. The Children&#8217;s Act 1989 provides for the prohibited steps order, which can be 
</p>
<p>granted by a court to prevent, among other steps, a parent from taking a child without the 
</p>
<p>express permission of the other parent. The Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007 
</p>
<p>allows a person threatened with forced marriage to apply for a forced marriage protection 
</p>
<p>order before a court. The order may require such measures as confiscation of the passport 
</p>
<p>of the wrongdoer and restrictions on their contact with the victim, and it can be issued 
</p>
<p>against any person who aids, abets or encourages a forced marriage. 
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the Domestic Violence Disclosure 
</p>
<p>Scheme in England and Wales that provides a framework for disclosing information to 
</p>
<p>potential victims of domestic violence and abuse.82 The aim of the scheme is to disclose 
</p>
<p>information to an individual about previous violent offending by their partner. The 
</p>
<p>disclosure might be triggered by a request made by a member of the public directly or by 
</p>
<p>information that the police deem important to reveal to a potential victim.83  
</p>
<p>88. Some initiatives have been launched by Police Scotland to ensure coordinated and 
</p>
<p>adequate police responses to domestic abuse. These include the establishment of the 
</p>
<p>Domestic Abuse Coordination Unit, which works closely with local police units; the 
</p>
<p>Domestic Abuse Investigation Units in every division, with an emphasis on proactive 
</p>
<p>investigation; and the Domestic Abuse Task Force, to target &#8220;high tariff&#8221; perpetrators and 
</p>
<p>undertake complex and protracted investigations. Also, the Domestic Abuse Multi-Agency 
</p>
<p>Tasking and Coordinating process was set up in each of the 14 territorial police divisions, 
</p>
<p>to proactively target high-risk perpetrators and reduce, among other issues, the number of 
</p>
<p>domestic related homicides and repeat victims. A domestic abuse toolkit was developed, 
</p>
<p>which identifies best practices when dealing with victims and perpetrators and provides a 
</p>
<p>framework for police to follow. Furthermore, an online/third party/remote reporting system 
</p>
<p>has been set up to encourage reporting, particularly among black and minority ethnic and 
</p>
<p>other hard-to-reach communities. The Special Rapporteur was informed of a joint protocol 
</p>
<p>signed between the police and prosecution services that outlines the procedures and 
</p>
<p>practices that must be followed to address domestic abuse.

<p>Northern Ireland, which is the region&#8217;s first purpose-built centre. It provides specialized 
</p>
<p>services and support to victims, while also encouraging and helping them to pursue their 
</p>
<p>cases through the criminal justice system.  
</p>
<p>90. Regarding emergency helplines, there are some telephone lines available for women 
</p>
<p>and children in crisis, mostly managed by third sector organizations, such as the National 
</p>
<p>Domestic Violence Helpline, run in partnership between Women&#8217;s Aid and Refuge; the All 
</p>
<p>Wales Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence Helpline managed by Welsh Women&#8217;s Aid, 
</p>
<p>on behalf of the Welsh Government; the Scottish Domestic Abuse Helpline; and the 
</p>
<p>24 Hour Domestic and Sexual Violence Helpline, run by Women&#8217;s Aid Federation 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland. Rape crisis centres run sexual violence helplines across the country, as 
</p>
<p>does the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children through its Child 
</p>
<p>Protection Helpline. In addition to this, some smaller service providers offer their own 
</p>
<p>specialist helplines at the community level.  
</p>
<p>91. Interviewees&#8217; concerns revolve around the implementation of existing laws and 
</p>
<p>policies, owing to the lack of consistent, effective and sensitive implementation and the 
</p>
<p>variation in police and other service responses across the United Kingdom.  
</p>
<p>92. Interviewees highlighted that the current austerity measures and the devolution of 
</p>
<p>authority to local authorities was having a negative impact on the provision of services to 
</p>
<p>women victims of violence. NGO service providers working at the community level are 
</p>
<p>now forced to devote more time and human resources to comply with more burdensome 
</p>
<p>fundraising, bidding and reporting requirements. They are being forced to make cuts to 
</p>
<p>their frontline services as a result of reduced funding, whether by closing refuges, reducing 
</p>
<p>support hours or increasing waiting time for services, including admission to shelters. Such 
</p>
<p>measures have negatively impacted the health and safety needs of women and children, 
</p>
<p>thus placing them at a heightened risk of re-victimization. Access to trauma services, 
</p>
<p>financial support and housing are crucial, but current reforms to the funding and benefits 
</p>
<p>system are negatively impacting women&#8217;s ability to address safety and other relevant 
</p>
<p>issues.85 
</p>
<p>93. Interviewees also stated that women from black and minority ethnic communities, 
</p>
<p>women belonging to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) 
</p>
<p>community and women with disabilities are more adversely affected by these cutbacks. 
</p>
<p>These women are often subjected to entrenched discriminatory practices in the political, 
</p>
<p>social and economic spheres and are more likely to depend on benefits and support from an 
</p>
<p>increasingly underresourced non-profit sector. Some argued that it was precisely the 
</p>
<p>specialized services catering for black and minority ethnic women which are more affected, 
</p>
<p>even more so than the services available to the mainstream violence against women and 
</p>
<p>girls service providers..  
</p>
<p>94. There are various benefits and entitlements, depending on whether a woman is a 
</p>
<p>refugee, an asylum-seeking woman or a victim of trafficking. Women may face insecure 
</p>
<p>immigration status, have no recourse to public funds or legal aid and face greater risks, 
</p>
<p>including being unable to access emergency accommodation, including shelters, or claim 
</p>
<p>housing benefit, income support and other State benefits. This leads to further

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.2 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>victimization, vulnerabilities and risk of abuse. Migrant domestic workers, whose visas are 
</p>
<p>tied to their employers, and who break the terms of their immigration status by leaving 
</p>
<p>abusive employers, also face detention as immigration offenders if they do not go back 
</p>
<p>home, unless they are victims of trafficking.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Prosecution and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>95. Many individuals stated during interviews that the justice system is not effectively 
</p>
<p>equipped, or responsive, to address the specific needs of women and girl survivors of 
</p>
<p>violence. Many interlocutors of all ages and backgrounds indicated that they do not 
</p>
<p>consider the justice system a viable option to obtain remedies for several reasons, ranging 
</p>
<p>from the inadequate police responses and the lack of coordination among the various State 
</p>
<p>agencies to the low levels of prosecution and the negligible conviction rates in such cases. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the cuts to legal aid make it virtually impossible for some women to consider 
</p>
<p>using the criminal justice system, as they cannot afford advice, representation or the costs 
</p>
<p>linked to gathering the relevant evidence. 
</p>
<p>96. Regarding the police response to domestic violence, interviewees reported a pattern 
</p>
<p>of continued scepticism, indifference and a lack of empathy towards women, particularly 
</p>
<p>women from black and minority ethnic communities. Effective action is rare even when 
</p>
<p>injuries from physical assaults are visible, and is virtually non-existent in cases of coercive 
</p>
<p>control involving emotional, sexual and financial abuse. These concerns echo the findings 
</p>
<p>of the March 2014 report by the Inspectorate of Constabulary, which found that domestic 
</p>
<p>abuse is a priority on paper, but not in practice, in the majority of forces.86 In response to 
</p>
<p>concerns, one recent development is the setting up of a new domestic abuse national 
</p>
<p>oversight group, chaired by the Home Secretary. 
</p>
<p>97. Interviewees also highlighted that investigations are often not undertaken, or are 
</p>
<p>done superficially. Besides the immediate safety concerns for victims, the failure of the 
</p>
<p>police to investigate or provide support can also affect other legal proceedings, such as 
</p>
<p>child custody or immigration matters. For example, the failure to take account of, and 
</p>
<p>adequately investigate, reports of domestic violence can result in migrant women being 
</p>
<p>denied the right to remain in the United Kingdom as allowed under immigration law. In 
</p>
<p>other cases, police failure to properly record or act on domestic violence can have an 
</p>
<p>adverse effect on women&#8217;s applications for legal aid in family proceedings, including when 
</p>
<p>seeking a divorce or protection order or submitting an application for child-related 
</p>
<p>residence and contact orders.  
</p>
<p>98. Interviewees argued that the failures of the police response are compounded by 
</p>
<p>weak protection by the court system, which is widely perceived to be biased in favour of 
</p>
<p>men and is focused on individual incidents of violence, rather than addressing the 
</p>
<p>cumulative nature of domestic violence. In Scotland, for example, courts are required to 
</p>
<p>consider the safety of children under 16 when hearing civil applications for &#8220;contact or 
</p>
<p>residence&#8221; from estranged parents, with domestic abuse being a safety concern to be 
</p>
<p>considered.87 Interviewees claim that family lawyers and sheriffs may have a limited 
</p>
<p>understanding of the dynamics of domestic abuse, with children and mothers often being 
</p>
<p>obliged to keep unsafe and inappropriate contact with perpetrators of violence. Concerns 
</p>
<p>were also expressed about shared parenting increasingly being seen as an appropriate, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p> 87 The 2006 Family Law (Scotland) Act introduced the need to protect the child from the risk of abuse 
</p>
<p>in granting an order for contact or residence. </p>

<p>default position without due consideration of the best interests of the child. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur also heard accounts of women, including those with disabilities, being deemed 
</p>
<p>unfit mothers for having &#8220;failed to protect&#8221; their children from an abusive parent. 
</p>
<p>99. The victims of sexual violence interviewed expressed reservations about using the 
</p>
<p>criminal justice system, owing to the lack of a responsive and supportive environment, 
</p>
<p>which adds to their trauma and re-victimization, and the low levels of prosecution and 
</p>
<p>convictions. Interviewees reported how victim-blaming, assumptions made based on the 
</p>
<p>clothing worn by victims, the number of previous sexual partners or whether there had been 
</p>
<p>prior consensual sexual contact with the perpetrator, all negatively influence the way 
</p>
<p>women are treated when reporting sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>100. In terms of the low levels of convictions for cases of domestic and/or sexual 
</p>
<p>violence, the Special Rapporteur was informed by interviewees that this is due to the nature 
</p>
<p>of the offences, which often happen in private with no witnesses; underreporting by victims 
</p>
<p>owing to, for example, fear of the perpetrator, fear they will not be believed or fear of 
</p>
<p>repercussions for their family; the high number of victims who withdraw complaints or 
</p>
<p>support for prosecutions even when a decision to prosecute has been taken; the fact that 
</p>
<p>defendants know that there may be a withdrawal of support for prosecution which means 
</p>
<p>that they will not make any admissions in interviews and will plead not guilty in court in 
</p>
<p>anticipation that the victim will not give evidence; applications by defendants that lead to a 
</p>
<p>delay in trials; and the issue of abuse linked to past incidents, which has an effect on the 
</p>
<p>quality of the evidence owing to time and memory lapses. 
</p>
<p>101. As regards harmful practices, interviewees made reference to the public consultation 
</p>
<p>process and their participation therein. They reiterated concerns about how the 
</p>
<p>criminalization of forced marriage may lead to lower levels of reporting, as children and 
</p>
<p>young women may not want a prosecution. Recommendations shared by service providers 
</p>
<p>to encourage victims and potential victims to report include: strengthening existing 
</p>
<p>legislation, such as the criminalization of breaches of forced marriage protection orders; 
</p>
<p>prioritizing safety and empowerment measures over prosecution; and providing a package 
</p>
<p>of specialist services, including safe accommodation, as well as practical and emotional 
</p>
<p>support.88 Such recommendations are also applicable to FGM cases, the first prosecution of 
</p>
<p>such a case having taken place in 2014. Despite political declarations on the elimination of 
</p>
<p>harmful practices, interviewees stressed the need for de facto remedies, including 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising, training of frontline service agencies and investment in specialist 
</p>
<p>women-centred services, to effectively protect women and girls from such practices. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Provision of effective redress, including reparations 
</b></p>
<p>102. Effective remedies must guarantee the rights of women to access both criminal and 
</p>
<p>civil remedies, and the establishment of effective protection, support and rehabilitation 
</p>
<p>services, including reparations.  
</p>
<p>103. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme is a Government-funded scheme 
</p>
<p>designed to compensate victims of violent crime, including domestic and sexual abuse, with 
</p>
<p>awards calculated to reflect the seriousness of injuries. It includes compensation for mental 
</p>
<p>or physical injury following a crime of violence, sexual or physical abuse, loss of earnings, 
</p>
<p>and special expenses payments incurred as a direct result of an incident. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur did not receive specific information as to whether women victims of violence 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p>are benefiting from such compensation schemes, or whether such measures are meeting the 
</p>
<p>goals of transformative reparations. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Government of the United Kingdom has declared violence against women 
</b></p>
<p><b>and girls to be a national priority. It has developed a number of strategies and action 
</b></p>
<p><b>plans to address the issue at the national level, as have the constituent countries. These 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiatives have been developed with the participation of civil society stakeholders and 
</b></p>
<p><b>are monitored across government departments and by third sector organizations.  
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>In most cases, however, these initiatives have resulted in isolated pockets of 
</b></p>
<p><b>good practice and often depend on the personal commitment and leadership of 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals and certain authorities. This is largely due to the lack of a consistent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>coherent human rights-based approach in </b>the Government&#8217;s response to violence 
</p>
<p><b>against women and girls. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Special Rapporteur is concerned about a number of regressive measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>that have been adopted. These include the shift from gender specificity to gender 
</b></p>
<p><b>neutrality, including gender-neutral services being increasingly favoured; power 
</b></p>
<p><b>being devolved to local authorities on such issues as service provision, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>changes to commissioning models which are detrimental to experienced community-
</b></p>
<p><b>based service providers; austerity measures that are having an effect on the provision 
</b></p>
<p><b>of services to address violence against women; as well as other cross-cutting issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>affecting women, such as poverty and unemployment. Women from black and 
</b></p>
<p><b>minority ethnic communities, as well as migrant, refugee and asylum-seeking women, 
</b></p>
<p><b>women belonging to the LGBTI community, and women with disabilities, have been 
</b></p>
<p><b>further affected by these cutbacks, as specialized services catering for their specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>needs have been reduced.  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Special Rapporteur would like to address the following recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the Government of the United Kingdom: 
</b></p>
<p>(a)<b> Prevention and awareness-raising: 
</b></p>

<p><b>and behaviours;  
</b></p>
<p>(ii) <b>Ensure the consistent regulation and restriction of harmful and 
</b></p>
