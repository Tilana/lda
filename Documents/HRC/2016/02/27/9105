<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples held its first session from 1 to 
3 October 2008. The session was attended by the five members of the Expert Mechanism, 
representatives of States, United Nations bodies and specialized agencies, academics and a large 
number of indigenous peoples and non-governmental organizations, including participants 
supported by the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations. 
</p>
<p> The Expert Mechanism held a discussion on the implementation of Human Rights Council 
resolution 6/36 entitled &#8220;Expert Mechanism on the rights of indigenous peoples&#8221;, including 
consideration of thematic expertise. It also held a discussion on issues related to the study on 
lessons learned and challenges to achieve the implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples 
to education, as requested by the Council in its resolution 9/7. Pursuant to that resolution, the 
Expert Mechanism also undertook a review of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action 
for the purpose of submitting recommendations as contributions to the outcome of the Durban 
Review Conference. 
</p>
<p> The Expert Mechanism adopted the report of the session as well as five proposals for 
consideration and approval by the Council. The proposals relate to the issues of organization of 
work; the Durban Review Conference; the right of indigenous peoples to education; participation 
of indigenous peoples; and coordination with other United Nations bodies and mandates. The 
Expert Mechanism proposes specifically that the Council authorize the Expert Mechanism to 
meet for five working days in 2009. It also proposes that the Council approve two additional 
days for the members to meet prior to the session to make preparations. Moreover, the Expert 
Mechanism proposes that the Council approve a two-day technical workshop/review to finalize 
the study on the rights of indigenous peoples to education. It further proposes that the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur be invited to participate in the Durban Review Conference in 
April 2009 and that the Chairperson-Rapporteur or a designated member of the Expert 
Mechanism be invited to the session of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 6/36 of 14 December 2007, the Human Rights Council decided to establish 
the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as a subsidiary expert mechanism to 
assist the Council in the implementation of its mandate, by providing it with thematic expertise 
on the rights of indigenous peoples in the manner and form requested by the Council. The 
thematic expertise was to focus mainly on studies and research-based advice, and the mechanism 
could make proposals to the Council for its consideration and approval, within the scope of its 
work as set out by the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>II. PROPOSALS FOR CONSIDERATION AND APPROVAL 
BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL 
</b></p>
<p><b>Proposal 1:  Organization of work 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
</i> 1. <i>Proposes</i> that the Council authorize the Expert Mechanism to meet for five working 
days in 2009 and to hold two days of preparatory meetings prior to its second session; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Invites </i>participants to submit relevant written documentation to the Expert 
Mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b>Proposal 2:  Durban Review Conference 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
 </i>1. <i>Affirms</i> its support for the Durban review process and welcomes the request from the 
Human Rights Council to contribute to the outcome of the Durban Review Conference; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Notes </i>the achievements in the area of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights since the 
2001 Durban Conference and, in particular, the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the establishment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people in 2001, the 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, which held its first session in May 2002, and the 
creation of the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which met from 1 
to 3 October 2008; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Welcomes</i> the positive steps taken by Governments to address the discrimination 
faced by indigenous peoples, including through the introduction of legislation and ratification of 
ILO Convention No. 169 on indigenous and tribal peoples in independent countries; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Recommends</i> that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action be revised to 
take into account the above-mentioned developments; in particular, the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action should acknowledge that the right of self-determination and the principle 
of free, prior and informed consent are now universally recognized through the adoption of the 
Declaration, making paragraph 24 of the Durban Declaration obsolete; the Expert Mechanism </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>also recommends that these principles be included in the future outcome document, and proposes 
that paragraph 43 of the Durban Declaration be revised to take into account the recognition in the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to 
lands and resources; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Considers </i>that the specific paragraphs in the Programme of Action relating to 
indigenous peoples remain relevant but is of the opinion that the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples provides a new overarching context that orientates the action to 
be taken by States; it furthermore recommends that specific reference is made in the outcome 
document to implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by States 
and that particular attention be paid by the United Nations system and international and regional 
financial institutions to assisting States in the implementation of the provisions; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Proposes </i>that the outcome document include a request to States to implement 
recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in 
relation to indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, and considers that specific reference needs to be made to 
the discrimination being encountered by indigenous peoples in maintaining their traditional 
occupations; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Also proposes </i>that the Expert Mechanism continue to provide input during the 
preparatory phase for the Durban Review Conference to the Human Rights Council and the 
Preparatory Committee for the Durban Review, and requests that any proposals be taken into 
account; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Urges </i>all future preparatory meetings to ensure indigenous participation; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Recommends</i> that the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Expert Mechanism be invited to 
participate in the Durban Review Conference in April 2009. 
</p>
<p><b>Proposal 3:  Right of indigenous peoples to education 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
 Bearing in mind</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 6/36 of 14 December 2007 and 9/7 of 
18 September 2008, and in order to fulfil the request of the Council to prepare a study by 2009 
on lessons learned and challenges to achieve the implementation of the right of indigenous 
peoples to education, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
send out notifications to indigenous peoples organizations, Member States, relevant international 
and regional organizations, the Special Rapporteur on the right to education, relevant 
United Nations agencies, national human rights institutions and civil society organizations to 
submit, by February 2009, information pertaining to achieving the implementation of the rights 
of indigenous peoples to education, including lessons learned, case studies, challenges and 
recommendations, which may be in the form of written reports or audio-visuals; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Invites</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to provide inputs; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Invites </i>the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people and the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues to contribute to 
the study; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Proposes </i>that the Council authorize a two-day technical workshop/review to 
facilitate the finalization of the above-mentioned study. 
</p>
<p><b>Proposal 4:  Participation of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
</i> <i>Noting </i>paragraph 8 of Human Rights Council resolution 9/7, and considering the 
importance and need for indigenous peoples to follow-up on the work of the Expert Mechanism, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Proposes</i> that the Human Rights Council suggests to the General Assembly to 
broaden the mandate of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations to help 
indigenous peoples to participate in the sessions of the Council and the treaty bodies; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Encourages</i> the Board of Trustees to identify beneficiaries of the Fund who could 
effectively contribute to the thematic agenda of the Expert Mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b>Proposal 5:  Coordination with other United Nations bodies and mandates 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
 Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 5 of Human Rights Council resolution 6/36, in which the 
Council decided that, in order for the Expert Mechanism to enhance cooperation and avoid 
duplicating the work of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people and the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, it should invite 
the Special Rapporteur and a member of the Permanent Forum to attend and contribute to its 
annual meeting, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Proposes </i>that the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Expert Mechanism or a designated 
member thereof participate in the sessions of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Invites</i> all relevant mandate-holders, in particular the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and representatives of 
the Permanent Forum, to participate in the annual sessions of the Expert Mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  ORGANIZATION OF THE SESSION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Attendance 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples held its first session in Geneva 
from 1 to 3 October 2008. The members who participated in the session were Catherine Odimba 
(Congo), Jannie Lasimbang (Malaysia), John Henriksen (Norway), Jos&#233; Carlos Morales 
(Costa Rica) and Jos&#233; Mencio Molintas (Philippines). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>3. The Expert Mechanism was attended by representatives of 37 Member States, the 
Holy See, 4 United Nations organizations and programmes, a national human rights institution 
and a large number of indigenous delegates and non-governmental organizations. A total 
of 367 participants were accredited, with 222 effectively participating (see annex I). 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people, James Anaya, and Mick Dodson and Bartolom&#233; Clavero, members of the 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, attended the session. The President of the Human Rights 
Council Advisory Committee, Miguel Alfonso Martinez, also attended the session. The Expert 
Mechanism would like to express its appreciation to the Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Centre for 
Documentation, Research and Information, the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs 
and the Indigenous Portal for their support for indigenous participants during the session. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Documentation 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Expert Mechanism had before it the provisional agenda (A/HRC/EMRIP/2008/1) and 
the annotated provisional agenda (A/HRC/EMRIP/2008/1/Add.1), as prepared by the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Kyung-Wha Kang, opened the 
first session of the Expert Mechanism. She referred to the institutional changes represented by 
the creation of the Human Rights Council and its enhanced normative framework. In particular, 
she encouraged the experts to consider how they would contribute to the promotion and 
implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. She 
recalled that the Declaration set out a clear and universally agreed upon framework for the 
advancement of the rights of indigenous peoples. Although the Declaration is non-binding, it 
nonetheless offers the basis for reconciliation between indigenous peoples and States. She added 
that the provisions of the Declaration provided an agenda for dialogue and practical 
policymaking. 
</p>
<p>7. The Deputy High Commissioner assured the participants and the members that the work of 
her Office was to assist States and indigenous peoples in implementing the Declaration. She 
stated that the Expert Mechanism also had its role to play in helping to contribute to that end. 
</p>
<p>8. The President of the Council, Martin I. Uhomoibhi, recalled that the Declaration was one 
of the first international instruments adopted by the Council and provided, together with 
International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal 
Peoples in Independent Countries and other human rights standards, the international normative 
framework on the rights of indigenous peoples. He said that the Expert Mechanism was directly 
accountable to the Council and this gave it more leverage and significance as a veritable organ of 
the Council, to which it could propose how to contribute best to ensure the respect and 
advancement of the rights of indigenous peoples. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Election of officers 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Deputy High Commissioner invited the members to nominate a Chairperson for the 
first session. Ms. Lasimbang announced that the members of the Expert Mechanism, through 
consensus, had nominated Mr. Henriksen and Mr. Morales as Chairperson-Rapporteur and 
Vice-Chairperson-Rapporteur, respectively. The Deputy High Commissioner declared them 
elected by acclamation. 
</p>
<p>10. In his opening statement, the Chairperson-Rapporteur said that the Expert Mechanism 
provided a unique space for focused multilateral discussions on how the United Nations could 
contribute to a better understanding of the scope and content of the rights of indigenous peoples. 
He emphasized that the mandate and functions of the Expert Mechanism were different from 
those of the former Working Group on Indigenous Populations. The Expert Mechanism had a 
strictly thematic mandate. It was not mandated to develop new standards or address country 
situations, nor was it a complaint procedure. 
</p>
<p>11. The Chairperson-Rapporteur stated that the normative framework for the work of the 
Expert Mechanism included all relevant international instruments related to the rights of 
indigenous peoples, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples. He added that the Expert Mechanism had an important role in promoting the 
operationalization of the rights affirmed in the Declaration and in mainstreaming them into the 
Council&#8217;s overall efforts to promote and protect all human rights. 
</p>
<p>12. The Chairperson-Rapporteur called upon Member States, indigenous peoples and other 
stakeholders to engage themselves in the work of the mechanism. He said that it should be able 
to address issues that are truly important for indigenous peoples. He expressed the hope and 
belief that the thematic focus of the Expert Mechanism would emerge as a natural outcome of 
the discussions and consultations during the annual sessions of the Mechanism. 
</p>
<p>13. The Chairperson-Rapporteur was of the view that the open arrangement for participation 
greatly facilitated the work of the Expert Mechanism. He stated that it was of particular 
importance that indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations and representatives not in consultative status 
with the Economic and Social Council were also able to participate. In his view, strong and 
broad indigenous participation was of utmost importance. He welcomed the suggestions made by 
the Council to the General Assembly to adjust the mandate of the United Nations Voluntary 
Fund for Indigenous Populations, taking into account the creation of the Expert Mechanism. 
</p>
<p>14. A representative of the Navajo nation, Rex Lee Jim, gave an invocation to open the 
session. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Adoption of the agenda and programme of work 
</b></p>
<p>15. At its first meeting, the revised provisional agenda prepared by OHCHR was adopted (see 
annex II). At the same meeting, the Expert Mechanism also adopted a programme of work for 
the session, showing the order and distribution of meeting time for each agenda item at the 
first session. The Expert Mechanism held six meetings during the session, of which one was a 
private meeting.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV. IMPLEMENTATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL 
RESOLUTION 6/36, INCLUDING CONSIDERATION 
OF THEMATIC EXPERTISE 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Chairperson-Rapporteur invited delegations to make general statements on the 
implementation of the mandate of the Expert Mechanism. He stated that the item provided an 
opportunity to discuss the scope of the mandate, expectations and methods of work of the new 
body about its thematic focus and how to enhance cooperation and avoid duplicating the work of 
other mandates.  
</p>
<p>17. He invited observers to provide the Expert Mechanism with concrete suggestions about 
possible proposals to the Council so that the members could take them into account in their 
deliberation under agenda item 6 (see annex II). The members of the Expert Mechanism 
encouraged States, United Nations agencies, indigenous peoples, non-governmental 
organizations and other delegations present at the session to engage in a frank and constructive 
dialogue and invited them to actively contribute to the work of the Expert Mechanism. The 
importance and need to benefit from the expertise and experience of indigenous peoples were 
stressed.  
</p>
<p>18. A number of States, including Argentina, Bolivia, Canada, Denmark, Guatemala, 
Indonesia, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, Peru, the Philippines, the Russian Federation and 
Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), took the floor to underline the need for coordination to be 
established among the Expert Mechanism, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous 
people, to ensure effectiveness and credibility and to avoid duplication of activities.  
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people, James Anaya, and a member of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, 
Michael Dodson, also recognized the challenges ahead for the three mechanisms to coordinate 
their work and establish fruitful cooperation, thus ensuring complementarity.  
</p>
<p>20. Referring to the research-based and study-oriented nature of the mandate of the Expert 
Mechanism, the Special Rapporteur stated that he expected the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to be an important focal point of the Mechanism&#8217;s research and 
studies on issues of concern to indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur further elaborated on his own role, noting that he would focus 
primarily on examining specific situations of violations of indigenous peoples&#8217; human rights, and 
said that he would complement the Expert Mechanism by providing input to its thematic 
mandate rather than by engaging in thematic studies. He informed the meeting participants that 
OHCHR staff assisting his mandate would be available throughout the session of the Expert 
Mechanism to receive communications and documentation of alleged human rights violations of 
indigenous peoples and individuals. 
</p>
<p>22. All participants welcomed the establishment of the Expert Mechanism and pledged support 
for its work. The first session was seen as a historic moment, as it represented the start of a new 
phase in the promotion and protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. Tribute was paid to the 
achievements of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations; while some acknowledged that </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the Expert Mechanism was to some extent a legacy of the Working Group, the different purposes 
of the two mechanisms were emphasized. Suggestions were made that the Expert Mechanism 
take into account the work of the Working Group while carrying out its research mandate. It was 
also suggested that the Expert Mechanism prepare a review of the status and implementation of 
the recommendations on studies carried out by the Working Group. However, some observers 
expressed the concern that this approach might overburden the new body.  
</p>
<p>23. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was unanimously 
seen as a vital instrument providing a normative framework to guide the work of the Expert 
Mechanism.  
</p>
<p>24. The opportunity for the Expert Mechanism to establish effective collaboration and 
contribute substantially to the work of the Council was emphasized. Some recommended that the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, as an international instrument 
adopted by the Council and the General Assembly, be used as a reference in the context of the 
universal periodic review process. It was also suggested that the Expert Mechanism engage with 
other international human rights mechanisms, including the treaty bodies, as well as with 
regional and national human rights bodies, in particular national human rights institutions and 
the Working Group on Indigenous Populations/Communities of the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights.  
</p>
<p>25. Many indigenous representatives said that they would prefer to be referred to as 
&#8220;rights-holders&#8221; rather than &#8220;stakeholders&#8221; in the context of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights.   
</p>
<p>26. Methodological considerations were discussed, including the importance that the Expert 
Mechanism have an inclusive approach and ensure the full and effective participation of 
indigenous peoples in its work. In that regard, some appealed to the United Nations to provide 
adequate funding through its regular budget to the Expert Mechanism and for the participation of 
indigenous representatives in future sessions of the Expert Mechanism.  
</p>
<p>27. The need for the Expert Mechanism to identify global and cross-cutting issues of 
significance to indigenous peoples and engage in subsequent studies was stressed on several 
occasions. Some suggestions were made on potential areas or themes of interest, including the 
right to land and territories; the right to self-determination; the right to free, prior and informed 
consent; indigenous refugees and internally displaced persons; customary law; challenges to the 
implementation of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights; treaties; oil and mining industries; the impact of 
environmental contamination on indigenous peoples&#8217; lives; and the specific challenges and rights 
of indigenous children, women and people with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>28. The indigenous caucus, on behalf of all indigenous observers, proposed that the agenda of 
the Expert Mechanism include a permanent item on the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Three thematic issues were identified as possible sub-agenda 
items for the second session: (a) the right to self-determination and the right to development; 
(b) free, prior and informed consent; and (c) adjudication, remedies, repatriation and redress.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>V. STUDY ON LESSONS LEARNED AND CHALLENGES TO 
ACHIEVE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RIGHT 
OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES TO EDUCATION  
</b></p>
<p>29. The Chairperson-Rapporteur referred to Council resolution 9/7, in which the Council 
request the Expert Mechanism to prepare a study on lessons learned and challenges to achieve 
the implementation of the right of indigenous peoples to education, and to conclude it in 2009. 
He informed the participants that the Expert Mechanism had entrusted two of its members, 
Ms. Lasimbang and Mr. Molintas, with the overall responsibility for preparing the study.  
</p>
<p>30. Ms. Lasimbang made preliminary remarks on the agenda item, inviting the participants to 
share their views on effective methods for carrying out the thematic research related to the right 
to education. She recalled the request by the Council, in its resolution 9/7, that the Expert 
Mechanism prepare a study on lessons learned and challenges to achieve the implementation of 
the right of indigenous peoples to education. The study, she said, could broadly encompass the 
following elements: (a) a human rights-based approach to the right to education; (b) good 
examples and lessons learned in establishing and controlling indigenous education systems and 
institutions; (c) the challenges to achieve the implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples 
to education; and (d) recommendations.  
</p>
<p>31. Ms. Lasimbang acknowledged the existing relevant sources related to the theme, including 
the report by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
of indigenous people (E/CN.4/2005/88) and the outcome of the fourth session of the Permanent 
Forum on Indigenous Issues related to the right to education as part of achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals (E/2005/43). She stated that the study should build on those and other 
reports and draw on the recommendations they contained. 
</p>
<p>32. Ms. Lasimbang concluded by stressing that the study should elaborate and focus on the 
promotion of the right of indigenous peoples to establish and control their own education 
systems and institutions that provide education in their own languages, curricula that are based 
on cultural values and philosophies and conducted in a manner appropriate to indigenous 
cultures and learning. 
</p>
<p>33. A number of governmental delegations acknowledged the importance of the study to be 
undertaken, hoping that it would contribute to a greater awareness of options to effectively 
implement this right at the national level, based on shared experiences on what was needed and 
what has proved to work. Many States provided concrete examples on how recognition by 
domestic law, including constitutions, of indigenous languages as official or national languages 
or the affirmation of the collective right to education for indigenous peoples have promoted the 
right to education as it applies to indigenous peoples. Others stressed that any efforts and good 
practices that have proved effective in ensuring that indigenous peoples enjoy their right to 
education were based on the imperative of high-quality teaching, for instance when bilingual 
education systems were established. 
</p>
<p>34. A large number of indigenous representatives, while recognizing efforts made in some 
countries, stressed that the greatest challenge faced by many indigenous peoples in terms of 
achieving the full implementation of the right to education was the continuing non-recognition 
by States of the existence of indigenous peoples. In urban areas, indigenous-controlled education </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>is rare and educational bodies and formal educational milestones, which are set by 
State-endorsed programmes, have been detrimental to the education of indigenous peoples. 
Another critical issue noted by indigenous representatives was the threat to indigenous languages 
and cultures. 
</p>
<p>35. Specific proposals were made to the Expert Mechanism regarding areas of consideration 
for the study, including the use of mother tongues and indigenous systems of education; the 
impact of religious schools on indigenous communities; the implementation of the provisions of 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other related international instruments on 
education; and the impact on education of demographic policies, such as population transfer. 
</p>
<p>36. Some examples of successful educational work among indigenous peoples that was 
initiated and managed by indigenous peoples themselves were shared as positive initiatives. It 
was suggested that such indigenous-led initiatives should be supported and expanded.  
</p>
<p>37. Indigenous representatives noted that the study should also take into consideration the fact 
that no actions or measures could be effective if the issue of the high level of illiteracy among 
indigenous communities, particularly women and girls, was not overcome. It was also important 
to address the serious lack of educational resources faced by indigenous communities living in 
remote areas, including human resources, infrastructure and educational materials. 
</p>
<p>38. Many statements underlined the need not to isolate the right to education from other rights 
affirmed in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, in particular the 
right to self-determination, free, prior and informed consent, treaties, non-discrimination and 
equality. The distinct identities and cultures of indigenous peoples require States to take special 
legislative, administrative and budgetary measures to ensure that indigenous peoples enjoy the 
right to education in a meaningful and effective manner.  
</p>
<p>39. Reference was also made to possible cooperation with regional mechanisms, in particular 
with the Working Group on Indigenous Populations/Communities of the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, which has engaged in extensive studies on the situation of 
indigenous peoples in Africa. The draft declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples of the 
Organization of American States was also seen as a normative framework that should guide the 
study together with the international instruments related to indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. 
</p>
<p>40. With regard to the methods of work of the Expert Mechanism, indigenous representatives 
called upon the experts to involve indigenous researchers in their work and encouraged the 
Expert Mechanism to include regional seminars and case studies on thematic issues. Indigenous 
representatives also referred to the World Indigenous Peoples Conference on Education which 
will be held in Melbourne, Australia, from 7 to 11 December 2008.  
</p>
<p>41. In a joint intervention, indigenous representatives from Australia invited the members of 
the Expert Mechanism to attend the Conference in Melbourne. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>VI. REVIEW AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE OUTCOME 
TO THE DURBAN REVIEW CONFERENCE 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Chairperson-Rapporteur referred to Council resolution 9/7, in which the Expert 
Mechanism is requested to undertake a review of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action and submit recommendations as contributions to the outcome of the Durban Review 
Conference, through its Preparatory Committee. He invited observers to provide 
recommendations for the Mechanism&#8217;s input to the Durban review process for the imminent 
second session of the Preparatory Committee, from 6 to 17 October 2008, and the Review 
Conference itself, pursuant to Council resolution 9/7.  
</p>
<p>43. The Chairperson-Rapporteur reported that the Expert Mechanism had entrusted two of its 
members, Mr. Morales and Ms. Odimba Kombe, with the overall responsibility for preparing the 
above-mentioned recommendations.  
</p>
<p>44. Mr. Morales and Ms. Odimba Kombe introduced the agenda item by pointing out that the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action included a number of paragraphs dealing 
specifically with discrimination against indigenous peoples, but that some of the paragraphs, 
such as paragraphs 24, 44, 45, had become obsolete owing to recent developments, most notably 
by the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>45. There was consensus among the participants that the Expert Mechanism should review the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and make recommendations for the Durban 
review process, taking into account that the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples should provide the normative framework for the Durban review process with 
regard to indigenous peoples. It was suggested that changes should be made to the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action based on the Declaration as a reference document for the 
minimum standards to combat discrimination against indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>46. Many participants reported that indigenous peoples continue to be targets of racism and 
discrimination in all parts of the world, which was also the conclusion of a recent draft report of 
the intersessional open-ended working group, issued on 29 September 2008, and the Durban 
review process should thus pay close attention to the need for implementation of the rights and 
freedoms contained in the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, particularly those 
related to non-discrimination and equality (such as articles 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 15, 21 and 22). 
</p>
<p>47. Many participants argued that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action fell well 
below currently recognized international human rights standards and thus needed to be revised. 
The basis for its revision should be the full implementation of the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. For example, paragraph 24 of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action states that the term &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221; could not &#8220;be construed as 
having any implications as to rights under international law&#8221;. As such, the Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action denies indigenous peoples the right to self-determination in article 3 
of the Declaration and other well-established international standards. Similarly, paragraph 43 of 
the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action limits the right of indigenous peoples to 
ownership of their lands to domestic law and not the international standard of traditional use, as 
found in articles 25 and 26 of the Declaration as well as the jurisprudence of the treaty bodies 
and regional mechanisms. The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action also does not </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>include the principle of free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples before any 
development can take place on their lands and territories, enshrined in article 32 of the 
Declaration. However, participants also acknowledged that there were a number of positive 
articles in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, such as in Durban Declaration 
articles 22 and 25, and in Durban Programme of Action paragraphs 18, 50 and 117, and States 
should be urged to implement them. 
</p>
<p>48. Some participants further stressed that the review process should include an assessment of 
the implementation by States of the concluding observations of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination because experience indicates that these recommendations 
are often ignored by Governments. There should be a national level process of review of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action involving indigenous peoples in accordance with 
paragraph 22 (b) of the Durban Programme of Action. Participation of indigenous peoples in the 
review process should be ensured at all levels - national, regional and international - and 
increased funding should be provided for it. 
</p>
<p>49. One non-governmental organization raised a concern that there was no acknowledgement 
of discrimination faced by indigenous peoples in Africa during the recent regional preparatory 
meeting in Abuja, and called on States to ensure that indigenous issues remain one of the key 
issues to be addressed in the review process. Other suggestions for the Expert Mechanism 
included that it should conduct an independent evaluation of discrimination against indigenous 
peoples worldwide for the purposes of the Durban Review, call upon all States to participate in 
the Durban review process, and to support a gender perspective in it.  
</p>
<p>50. Two governmental delegations took the floor, mostly to express support for the fight 
against racism and to encourage the Expert Mechanism to submit its recommendations for the 
review process, pursuant to Council resolution 9/7, before the meeting of the Preparatory 
Committee so that they could be reflected in the outcome document. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  ADOPTION OF THE REPORT AND PROPOSALS  
</b></p>
<p>51. At its last meeting, the Expert Mechanism adopted five proposals for the consideration and 
approval of the Council. The proposals related to the organization of work; the Durban Review 
Conference; the right of indigenous peoples to education; participation of indigenous peoples; 
and coordination with other United Nations bodies and mandates.  
</p>
<p>52. In his closing statement, the Chairperson-Rapporteur expressed his gratitude to all 
participants for their attendance and contribution, with a special mention for the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and 
the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. He also expressed appreciation to the Secretariat for 
the organization of the session.  
</p>
<p>53. The Expert Mechanism adopted a provisional agenda for its second session (see annex III).  
</p>
<p>54. Under agenda item 5 (see annex III), the Expert Mechanism intends to focus on possible 
processes and mechanisms for the operationalization of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples, including processes and mechanisms identified in the Declaration 
itself (adjudication, remedies, repatriation, redress and compensation). </p>
