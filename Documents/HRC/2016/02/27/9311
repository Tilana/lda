<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government of Latvia, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance visited Latvia from 
20 to 24 September 2007. The objective of the mission was to gather first-hand information on 
issues that are relevant to his mandate. To this end, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with 
authorities from the executive, legislative and judicial branches, as well as civil society, 
representatives of minority communities and victims of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur concluded that Latvia has put in place legislation and a number of 
institutions aimed at tackling racism and discrimination, but that further steps are needed to 
complement these achievements with more holistic and global legislation covering all forms of 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur found important areas of concern, particularly in terms of three 
generally vulnerable groups and communities, who nonetheless present distinct problems. The 
first group is composed of the ethnic Russians who immigrated to Latvia during the Soviet 
occupation, many of whom have yet to acquire Latvian citizenship and are living under the 
status of non-citizens. The second vulnerable group identified by the Special Rapporteur is the 
Roma community, which suffers, as in most European countries, from cultural stigma and 
socio-economic discrimination and live under marginalized conditions. Finally, the Special 
Rapporteur assessed the situation of a third vulnerable group, composed of non-European 
migrants who have only recently arrived in the country, and who have been subject to racist 
violence and hate speech, particularly in the electronic media, mostly from extremist and 
neo-Nazi groups. Contrary to traditional minorities, which have been present in the country for 
decades or centuries, these migrants pose new identity tensions that need to be overcome by the  
promotion of a democratic, equal and interactive multiculturalism. 
</p>
<p> Latvia, like the other Baltic countries, is currently at a turning point in its history. The 
central challenge it faces is to build a democratic, egalitarian and interactive society by taking 
into account both the need to reassert the continuity of its national identity - shaken and eroded 
by occupation but deeply rooted in memory - and the recognition and respect of the rights of all 
minorities including those resulting from the occupation. Two principles should guide this 
process: respect for historical truth in the construction of the new national identity and 
non-discrimination of minorities. To fully implement this strategy, national and regional factors 
will be of key relevance as far as the Russian communities are concerned. The full respect of 
their rights - in terms of citizenship, language, culture and the eradication of any form of 
discrimination - is closely linked to their involvement and participation in the process of 
construction of a harmonious cohabitation and a new multicultural nation that is fully respected 
by all countries in the region. Another pressing challenge is to prepare Latvian society for the 
progressive but steady arrival of new waves of non-European migrants who bear their own 
traditions, cultures and religions. This challenge is also an opportunity to enrich Latvian society 
with more diversity, intercultural dialogue and interaction. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.3 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur formulates a number of recommendations, including the 
following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; State authorities should highlight their strong political will and commitment to fight all 
forms of racism and discrimination in Latvian society and strengthen their vigilance to 
face the new challenges that arise from growing migration, multiculturalism and identity 
tensions in full respect of democratic and human rights principles. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Government should adopt holistic national legislation dealing with all forms of 
discrimination in a readily identifiable legal act. The Government should also adopt 
complementary legislation that unambiguously specifies criminal liability for all types of 
hate crimes. This would complement the legislative basis that exists in Latvia and, most 
importantly, ensure that no protection gaps remain. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Government should revisit the existing requirements for naturalization with the 
objective of facilitating the granting of citizenship to non-citizens, implementing the 
commitments established by the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The role of the Special Assignment Minister for Social Integration and his Secretariat 
should be strengthened, both in terms of mandate and resources. In particular, 
transforming the Secretariat into a fully-fledged Ministry would not only enhance its 
effectiveness and voice, but symbolically reflect the will of the Government to tackle the 
issues of racism and discrimination with the ultimate aim of building a democratic, equal 
and interactive multiculturalism in Latvian society. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Government should reinforce its National Action Plan &#8220;Roma in Latvia 2007-2009&#8221;, 
aiming at both promoting and respecting the cultural identity of Roma people and at 
eradicating their social and economic marginalization, in particular the poor educational 
attainment of Roma children and the drastically high unemployment rates among Roma 
citizens. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Government and civil society should adopt an ethical and cultural strategy that 
addresses through the drafting of history, education, culture and information, the deepest 
roots of racism, xenophobia and intolerance and is built around the promotion of 
reciprocal knowledge of cultures and values, the interaction among the different 
communities and the link between the fight against racism, xenophobia and 
discrimination and the long-term construction of a democratic, equalitarian and 
interactive multicultural society. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance visited Latvia (Daugavpils and 
Riga) from 20 to 24 September 2007. At the Government level, he held meetings with the 
Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Education and Science, the 
Special Assignments Minister for Social Integration, officials at the Ministry of Interior, 
including the Security Police, and the Ministry of Justice, and the Deputy Head of the 
Naturalization Board. He also met with the President of the Constitutional Court, the Head of the 
Human Rights and Public Affairs Committee of the <i>Saeima</i> (the Latvian Parliament) and the 
Ombudsman. 
</p>
<p>2. Apart from the agenda with the Government and State institutions, the Special Rapporteur 
also had extensive meetings with representatives of civil society organizations that are active in 
the realm of racism and xenophobia, minority communities and victims of racism and racial 
discrimination, both in Daugavpils and Riga. The Special Rapporteur also visited the Occupation 
Museum as well as the Latvian Ethnographic Museum in Riga. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his gratitude to the Government of Latvia for its 
cooperation and openness throughout the visit and in the preparatory stages. He also wishes to 
thank the United Nations country team in Riga, particularly the staff of the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), for its outstanding support. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  GENERAL BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Historical and political context 
</b></p>
<p>4. For many centuries, the territory that constitutes Latvia today has been an important 
trading crossroads in Europe, linking distinct civilizations, particularly Scandinavia and the 
Byzantine Empire, in what has been famously described in ancient chronicles as the &#8220;route from 
the Vikings to the Greeks&#8221;. The geographic position of the Daugava river also provided 
Western European traders with direct access to Russia, amplifying opportunities for cultural 
contact between the tribes that lived in the territory and the outside world. 
</p>
<p>5. An important episode in Latvian history was the arrival, in the twelfth century, of German 
traders and preachers who attempted to convert local pagan believers to Christianity. Local 
resistance led Pope Innocent III to send German crusaders to Latvia. These crusaders founded 
Riga in 1201 and conquered the territory, unifying the separate tribes under the Livonian 
Confederation. Due to its commercial importance, Riga quickly became the centre of the Baltic 
region, joining the Hanseatic League in the late thirteenth century. In subsequent centuries, 
Latvia was conquered by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden, becoming part of 
Russia after the Great Northern War in 1700. 
</p>
<p>6. A nationalistic revival took place in the mid-nineteenth century, among intellectuals, but 
only gained momentum during the Russian Revolution of 1905. However, Latvia remained 
under Russian rule until the end of the First World War, gaining independence in 1918 when the 
Soviet Government renounced all claims to Latvian territory. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.3 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>7. The history of Latvia would be profoundly affected by the start of the Second World War. 
The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact led to the first Soviet occupation in 1940-1941. In this period, 
some 35,000 Latvians were deported to the Soviet Union, particularly to Siberia. Latvia fell 
under Nazi Germany&#8217;s control from 1941 to 1944, leading to the extermination of the Jewish 
population; an estimated number of 70,000 Jews were killed in Latvia during the Holocaust. As 
the confrontation between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union approached Latvia, particularly 
in 1943-1944, the local population was divided: some groups joined the Red Army while others, 
most of whom were forcibly drafted, fought with the Waffen SS. 
</p>
<p>8. The second Soviet occupation started in 1944, as the war came to an end, and lasted 
until 1991. As in the other Baltic countries, the first years of occupation, in particular during 
Stalin&#8217;s era, were marked by high levels of repression, with forced deportation of more than 
120,000 Latvians to the East and the fleeing of some 130,000 to the West to take refuge. Other 
policies implemented by the Soviet Union led to what many historians call an attempted 
Russification of Latvian society, in particular through the introduction of Russian as an official 
language and the arrival of large numbers of migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union, in 
particular a large Russian community. 
</p>
<p>9. With the restoration of independence in 1991, Latvia embarked on a process of close 
rapprochement with the West, particularly through the introduction of widespread economic 
reforms, including privatization, to integrate the economy into global markets. This process 
culminated in 2004, when Latvia was admitted to the European Union (EU) as well as to NATO. 
During this period, the adaptation of EU legislation in order to implement the <i>acquis 
communautaire </i>led to important changes in policies that directly affect the fight against racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Demographic, ethnic and religious composition 
</b></p>
<p>10. Due to its historical legacy and geographical position, Latvia has developed a multicultural 
society with a core Latvian national identity. Out of its population of around 2.2 million, 
59 per cent are of Latvian origin and 28.5 per cent of Russian descent. Other sizeable ethnic 
groups are Belorussians (3.8 per cent), Ukrainians (2.5 per cent), Poles (2.4 per cent), 
Lithuanians (1.4 per cent), Jews and Roma (0.4 per cent each).  
</p>
<p>11. There is an important demographic distinction between citizens, non-citizens and 
foreigners. The Government formally differentiates between non-citizens and stateless persons. 
It argues that non-citizens may not be regarded as stateless persons within the meaning of the 
1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons due to the specific nature of their 
legal status, its temporary character and the broad scope of rights enjoyed thereby. The 
Government emphasizes that non-citizens are granted permanent residence in Latvia <i>ex lege</i>. It 
was also emphasized to the Special Rapporteur that non-citizens are entitled to visa-free travel 
within the EU. In 2007, 81 per cent of the population were Latvian citizens, 17.2 per cent were 
non-citizens and 1.8 per cent were foreign citizens. 
</p>
<p>12. Although there are no centralized statistics concerning religious affiliation, estimates 
indicate that around 22 per cent of the population are Catholic, 20 per cent are Lutherans and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.3 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>some 16 per cent are Orthodox. A significant proportion of the population is believed to be 
atheist. The Muslim and Jewish communities, as well as those of other religions or beliefs, are 
very small. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Political structure 
</b></p>
<p>13. Latvia is a parliamentary democracy whose Government is headed by the Prime Minister. 
The Head of State is the President, who is elected by the 100-seat Parliament (<i>Saeima</i>). Seats in 
Parliament are allocated proportionally for all party lists meeting the threshold of 5 per cent of 
national votes. A multiparty system is in place, and government has traditionally been 
coalitional. Only citizens have the right to vote in both national and municipal elections. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  International human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>14. Latvia is a State party to the core international human rights instruments, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its first Optional Protocol, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Latvia is also party to 
the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and to the 1961 Convention on 
the Reduction of Statelessness. 
</p>
<p>15. At the European level, Latvia has ratified the European Convention for the Protection of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the European Social Charter and the Council of 
Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. Latvia has yet to 
become a party to other legal instruments that are relevant for questions of racism and 
discrimination, including Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights on 
general non-discrimination (signed, but not ratified), the European Convention on Nationality 
(signed, but not ratified), the Convention on the Participation of Foreigners in Local Public Life 
at Local Level and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur carried out extensive meetings with authorities at the executive, 
legislative and judiciary branches to collect their views, as well as information concerning 
racism and xenophobia in Latvia, the adequacy of the existing legal framework and the 
programmes and policies adopted by the authorities to fight racism, racial discrimination and 
xenophobia. Additionally, a series of meetings with civil society organizations, communities and 
associations representing minority groups, victims of discrimination and journalists was 
organized. 
</p>
<p>17. In order to objectively assess the situation and collect information concerning his mandate, 
the Special Rapporteur structured his meetings with all his interlocutors around three questions: 
(a) Is there racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in Latvia? (b) If this 
is the case, what are their main manifestations and expressions and the communities affected? 
(c) What are or should be Governmental policies and programmes to fight these phenomena at 
the political, legal and cultural levels? </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.3 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>18. Chapter II of this report analyses the political and legal strategy adopted by State 
institutions in Latvia, with a particular focus on the perceptions of State officials concerning the 
problems related to racism and discrimination in the country. Subsequently, in chapter III, the 
views of civil society organizations, representatives of minorities and victims of discrimination 
are introduced. This is followed in chapter IV by an analysis of the situation by the Special 
Rapporteur and in chapter V his recommendations to the Latvian Government. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  POLITICAL AND LEGAL STRATEGY OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. The legal and institutional framework to combat racism  
and racial discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Constitutional and legislative provisions 
</b></p>
<p>19. Through an amendment to the Latvian Constitution in 1998, a chapter on fundamental 
human rights was introduced. The general legal provision of equal treatment is contained in 
article 91, which asserts that: &#8220;All human beings in Latvia shall be equal before the law and the 
courts&#8221; and that: &#8220;Human rights shall be realized without discrimination of any kind&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>20. The Constitution also provides for particular protection for minorities under article 114, 
which asserts that: &#8220;Persons belonging to ethnic minorities have the right to preserve and 
develop their language and their ethnic and cultural identity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>21. Incitement to national or racial hatred is prohibited under section 78 of the Criminal Code 
and carries a punishment of up to three years of detention. The restriction of rights based on 
racial or ethnic origin is also considered a criminal act that entails the same sanctions. In 
October 2006, the <i>Saeima</i> passed an amendment to the Criminal Code whereby racism is 
considered 1 of 14 aggravating factors in crimes. It is expected that this amendment should more 
clearly distinguish cases of incitement to racial, religious or ethnic hatred and racially motivated 
crimes. 
</p>
<p>22. Rather than taking the approach of passing broad anti-discrimination legislation, Latvia&#8217;s 
policy choice was to include provisions on anti-discrimination throughout its legal framework, 
such as in the Labour Law. The main mechanism available to redress alleged discrimination is 
the Office of the Ombudsman, which replaced the Latvian National Human Rights Office with a 
broader mandate, as well as national courts. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Office of the Ombudsman 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Office of the Ombudsman, the main mechanism available to redress alleged 
discrimination, replaced the Latvian National Human Rights Office on 1 January 2007, after the 
adoption of the Ombudsman Law. This Law entrusts the Ombudsman with an enlarged mandate 
and more robust resources, including twice as many staff as the National Human Rights Office. 
</p>
<p>24. The Office of the Ombudsman is responsible for activities such as awareness-raising 
among the general public concerning human rights; promoting recognition, monitoring and 
responding to violations of these rights; drafting programmes and coordinating the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.3 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>implementation of projects developed by Government institutions at the national or local level; 
and assessing the adequacy of existing legislation and proposing new laws. The role of the 
Ombudsman is thus not only reactive; he is entrusted with the power to take the initiative to 
investigate possible cases of racism and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>25. In his meeting with the Ombudsman, the Special Rapporteur was informed that although 
his office does not receive a large number of complaints of discrimination, this number has been 
steadily increasing (64 complaints in 2006 and 67 complaints from January-August 2007). 
</p>
<p>26. A particular form of action carried out by the Ombudsman is to review cases of racist 
crimes in order to analyse whether the racist connotation is being considered and registered by 
the police. The Ombudsman explained that there used to be important obstacles to the 
categorization and prosecution of racially motivated crimes, which led in most instances to the 
qualification of these crimes as acts of hooliganism. However, in the Ombudsman&#8217;s view this 
problem was solved in 2006 after the adoption of amendments to the Criminal Code clearly 
stipulating racial crimes. 
</p>
<p>27. The Office of the Ombudsman receives a limited number of complaints regarding 
citizenship regulations (17 from January-August 2007). However, the Ombudsman informed the 
Special Rapporteur that there are elements of the legislation on citizenship that can be improved, 
including regulations for automatic citizenship for all children born in Latvia and facilitating the 
procedure for elderly residents. 
</p>
<p>28. The overall perception of the Ombudsman is that Latvia has made important advances in 
the progressive transposition of EU directives, notwithstanding the difficulties in the realm of 
access to goods and services. He noted that racial discrimination is a recent problem in Latvia, 
connected to new waves of migration that are likely to expand, and therefore will require 
concerted efforts for the future. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Citizenship legislation 
</b></p>
<p>29. Citizenship policy in Latvia after the restoration of independence was based on the 
doctrine of legal continuity of the Latvian State. According to this principle, the end of the 
Soviet occupation did not create a new State, but rather restored a previously existing State 
whose independence was interrupted by forcible annexation into the USSR. In this regard, the 
first steps after the end of occupation were to restore the Latvian political and legal framework, 
including the Constitution that existed in 1940.  
</p>
<p>30. The policy after the restoration of independence was to recognize as citizens only those 
persons who enjoyed citizenship prior to 1940 and their direct descendants. For all others, no 
regulations were in place, which left some 740,000 persons, mostly Russian-speaking, without 
citizenship of Latvia or any other State, and thus stateless.<b>1</b> A large number of citizenship 
requests by Russian-speaking residents were denied due to claims of links to the Soviet army. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Under international law, a stateless person is generally defined as a person who is not 
</p>
<p>considered as a national by any State under the operation of its law.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.3 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>The Law on Citizenship approved in 1994 set out specific conditions for the acquisition of 
Latvian citizenship, directly affecting the status of the non-citizen populace. Strict rules for 
naturalization were put in place at that time, which included requirements regarding command 
of the Latvian language and knowledge of the Constitution and the history of the country. An 
&#8220;age windows system&#8221; was also created, which only allowed individuals from certain age groups 
to apply for citizenship at a certain time (e.g. in 1996, only persons between the ages of 16 
and 20 were allowed to apply). 
</p>
<p>31. In 1998, Latvia liberalized its citizenship laws, eliminating the window system and 
granting citizenship to children born in the country after 1991 upon registration by the parents. 
These changes quickly increased the number of naturalizations granted, which almost tripled 
between 1998 and 1999.<b>2</b>   
</p>
<p>32. A second piece of legislation - the Law on the Status of those Former USSR Citizens who 
do not Possess Citizenship of Latvia or Citizenship of any Other Country, approved in 1995 - 
regulated the rights of those former USSR citizens who, after the restoration of independence, 
were left without citizenship of Latvia or any other State. These persons were granted the formal 
status of non-citizens. In particular, it establishes that &#8220;a non-citizen has those rights and 
obligations set forth by the Constitution &#8230;&#8221; including the right to &#8220;maintain his/her native 
language and culture within the limits of cultural-national autonomy and traditions if such do not 
contravene the laws of the Republic of Latvia&#8221;.<b>3</b> Non-citizens are also issued with a special 
passport that allows for international travel. However, non-citizens do not have the right to vote 
or be elected for office in national or municipal elections, nor to work as civil servants. There are 
also limitations concerning the right to property and land ownership as well as private sector jobs 
linked to the judiciary.<b>4</b> 
33. At present, there are around 372,000 non-citizens in Latvia, 66 per cent of whom are of 
Russian origin, 13.4 per cent of Belorussian origin, 9.5 per cent of Ukrainian origin. Other 
groups of non-citizens are Poles (3.4 per cent), Lithuanians (2.8 per cent) and Jews 
(0.9 per cent). The majority of non-citizens reside in Riga, although sizeable communities also 
exist in Daugavpils and Liep&#257;ja. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Language legislation 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Official Language Law approved in 1999 defines the status of languages spoken in 
Latvian territory. The Law aims to ensure &#8220;the maintenance, protection and development of the 
Latvian language&#8221; and &#8220;of the cultural and historic heritage of the Latvian nation&#8221;. Although the

<p>law recognizes the right of different communities to use their native language, it sets language 
policy as a means to ensure the integration of members of ethnic minorities into the society of 
Latvia and the increased influence of the Latvian language in the cultural environment of Latvia. 
</p>
<p>35. The Law recognizes Latvian as the official state language and no specific provisions for 
minority languages are contained in the Law. It establishes that the exclusive use of Latvian is 
compulsory in any public institution as well as in private institutions performing activities of 
legitimate public interest. Communications with public institutions are normally required to be 
carried out in Latvian. The Law also establishes that the names of all persons living in Latvia, 
including non-citizens, need to be presented in identification documents according to Latvian 
language norms. 
</p>
<p>36. The monitoring of the Official Language Law and implementation of the language policy 
is conducted by the State Language Center, which operates under the aegis of the Ministry of 
Justice. Particular violations of the Law are also established in the Administrative Violations 
Code, including cases of private institutions with a legitimate public interest.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>B. Policies and programmes to combat racism, racial  
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>37. According to Latvian authorities, the legal and institutional framework, including the 
central role played by the Office of the Ombudsman, are only one part of the fight against racism 
and discrimination. The second form of action concerns positive initiatives that aim to promote 
tolerance, respect for diversity and, ultimately, integration of racial, ethnic and religious 
minorities in Latvian society. This includes specific integration measures as well as broader 
efforts carried out in other areas, particularly education. 
</p>
<p>38. The overarching policy to promote the integration in Latvia is carried out by the Secretariat 
of the Special Assignment Minister for Social Integration. This Government body, headed by a 
Cabinet Minister, is responsible for the implementation of the National Programme for the 
Integration of Society, either directly or in concert with other Governmental institutions - 
including the Ministries of Education and Science, Culture, Children and Family Affairs - whose 
actions have a direct impact on ethnic or racial minorities. It also implements the National 
Tolerance Programme 2005-2009 and the National Action Plan &#8220;Roma in Latvia 2007-2009&#8221;. 
The Secretariat is also responsible for the implementation of different international instruments 
pertaining to racism and minorities, including transposing the EU Race Directive, as well as for 
the drafting of anti-discrimination legislation. 
</p>
<p>39. The Secretariat collaborates closely with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in 
particular community organizations, to develop actions aimed at preserving their cultural 
identity, promote integration and respect for cultural diversity. It created a network of NGOs, 
funded by the Secretariat, which is regularly consulted and decides on the type of integration 
actions that will be implemented. Consultation with civil society was highlighted by the 
Secretariat as a key ingredient of the success of these initiatives. Two main consultative bodies 
were created to promote consultation with civil society: (a) a council on ethno-political issues 
composed of delegates sent by some 150 NGOs; (b) the Minister&#8217;s Advisory Board, composed 
of 17 members who represent regional NGOs, ethnic minorities, journalists, human rights 
experts and a delegate representing Russian schools.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.3 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>40. Although an important part of the Secretariat&#8217;s focus is related to traditional minorities 
living in Latvia, including the Russian-speaking communities, actions are also being developed 
for newly arrived migrants of non-European origin. A number of cultural activities fostering 
interaction among the different communities living in Latvia are organized, such as inter-ethnic 
festivals of Indian, Arab and African cultures.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur also enquired as to the impact of educational policies on minority 
communities, their integration into society and on the promotion of respect for their cultural 
identity. Latvia&#8217;s educational system is mainly based on two types of schools: Latvian-language 
and minority-language (mostly Russian) schools. In application of the Law on Education, 
which establishes that a certain proportion of the courses need to be taught in Latvian, 
minority-language schools are gradually introducing bilingual education. A major educational 
reform was passed in 2004, establishing that in public secondary schools at least 60 per cent of 
the courses in secondary education need to be taught in Latvian or bilingually.  
</p>
<p>42. The Minister of Education emphasized that the language policy in the educational system 
is an important means of promoting linguistic integration into Latvia of students of all ethnic 
and racial minorities. The central principle followed during the reform was to progressively 
improve the quality of education for all students and to allow for access to higher education, 
which is exclusively taught in Latvian. According to data of the Ministry&#8217;s Examination Centre, 
61 per cent of minority students finishing secondary education choose to undertake the maturity exam in Latvian, which according to Ministry officials shows that the educational system is 
managing to promote linguistic integration. Examination data also show that minority schools 
have the best results in terms of quality of education in Latvia. The subject where minorities 
have a poorer performance is history, which according to Ministry officials is evidence of 
Latvia&#8217;s complex historical legacy.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Perceptions and reactions of State officials and Government agencies  
</b></p>
<p>43. The majority of State authorities highlighted the importance of recognizing Latvia&#8217;s 
historical heritage in order to understand inter-community relations today, particularly for issues 
such as citizenship and language. At the same time, these officials stressed that Latvia has 
historically been a multicultural State open to different communities and that this tradition still 
resonates among the population today. The high rate of mixed marriages (around 20 per cent) 
and the growth of multi-ethnic parties were pointed out as examples of tolerance and 
multiculturalism in Latvia. 
</p>
<p>44. The common opinion expressed by State authorities was that racism and discrimination are 
not widespread phenomena in Latvia, but isolated cases, usually perpetrated by extremists that 
do not represent the country&#8217;s tradition of tolerance. However, it was emphasized that all acts of 
racism and discrimination are to be condemned and that Latvia counts on mechanisms such as 
the Ombudsman to redress this problem. In this context, the authorities pointed out that Latvia&#8217;s 
legal framework unambiguously establishes the principle of equality and prohibits any form of 
discrimination. The Prime Minister, in particular, emphasized the measures that have been taken 
to protect minorities and improve inter-community relations, including Latvia&#8217;s ratification of 
the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. He also 
explained that Latvia&#8217;s tradition of tolerance and respect for other cultures reflects in its 
favourable position towards Turkish membership of the EU. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.3 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>45. Most authorities saw the large number of non-citizens not as evidence of discrimination, 
but rather as the outcome of large-scale historical processes; instead of dispute between ethnic 
groups, it is believed to be a reflection of international political tensions projected onto ethnic 
issues. In spite of these deep-rooted problems, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors also 
pointed out that a number of actions have been taken to facilitate the process of naturalization for 
non-citizens, particularly the simplification of citizenship exams. Furthermore, it was 
emphasized that non-citizens enjoy virtually the same rights as citizens, except for some political 
rights and the possibility of being employed in the civil service. However, many interlocutors 
recognized that the high number of non-citizens is a problem that needs long-term solutions, 
whilst pointing out that a complete reversal of Latvia&#8217;s citizenship policy would pose a threat to 
the present status of Latvians, who could become a minority in their own country. 
</p>
<p>46. The Minister of Foreign Affairs also focused on the need to bridge the gap in the 
interpretation of history between ethnic groups, particularly regarding symbolic events such as 
the Second World War, collaboration with the Nazis and the meaning of the Soviet occupation. 
This gulf in the reading of the past has been an important source of problems for 
inter-community relations not only in Latvia, but also in the other Baltic States. A particularly 
important problem expressed by the Minister, as well as other authorities, is that some groups 
have instrumentalized history in order to question the legitimacy of Latvia as an independent 
State, which has made most of the population question the loyalty of these groups to the Latvian 
State. The Minister also emphasized the importance of the intellectual debate on this issue, to 
which he contributed an important scholarly work.<b>5 
</b></p>
<p>47. Apart from the issues related to citizenship and integration of the Russian-speaking 
minorities, the Special Rapporteur also asked his interlocutors for their views on the mounting 
racist violence that is seen in Latvia, as in other countries, including the problem of groups that 
instrumentalize the principle of freedom of expression to incite racial, ethnic and religious 
hatred. 
</p>
<p>48. Officials at the Ministry of Justice emphasized that the qualification of racially motivated 
crimes is the function of public prosecutors and the police, arguing that any intervention by the 
Ministry would be seen as interference with the independence of justice. Officers of the State 
police assured the Special Rapporteur that it had been putting a major focus on racially 
motivated crimes, not only in terms of prevention but also when investigations need to be carried 
out. However, they noted that there are difficulties in concretely establishing the racist 
motivation for crimes, which in many cases did not allow for such a qualification. Police 
officials acknowledged that hate speech is a current problem in Latvia, reaching a peak in 2005, 
but noted that these are instances of young extremists trying to affect public opinion rather than a 
structural problem in the country. 
</p>
<p>49. The President of the Constitutional Court argued that there is an important gap in the 
existing legal framework, in terms of comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation, particularly  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>because it does not formally comprise all forms of discrimination. However, he emphasized that 
existing norms are effective and pointed to the most recent examples of their application to 
complaints of discrimination in Latvia. 
</p>
<p>50. Some State authorities, in particular the Minister of Foreign Affairs, recognized that Latvia 
is facing new challenges concerning the new migratory dynamics, especially of non-European 
migrants, that will reach the country as it integrates in the global economy. These new waves of 
migration have the potential to create negative reactions on the part of some groups, particularly 
neo-Nazi extremists. These interlocutors therefore acknowledged that innovative policies and 
strategies will have to be devised to tackle emerging challenges and that it is not clear whether 
the Latvian society is already prepared for this new context. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  VIEWS OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND COMMUNITIES CONCERNED 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Concerns in response to State policies and measures 
</b></p>
<p>51. Civil society, including human rights NGOs, representatives of minorities and victims of 
discrimination, strongly expressed to the Special Rapporteur the perception that, contrary to the 
statements of most Government officials, racism and discrimination are widespread and 
pervasive in Latvian society. Although separate interlocutors raised different types of criticism, 
their common thread was concern over the lack of political leadership and willingness to tackle 
racism and discrimination issues, and devise policies to promote tolerance. In particular, they 
emphasized their concern that State institutions have been slow to recognize the central 
importance and current relevance of these issues and have often approached racism and 
discrimination as isolated instances rather than structural and deep-rooted problems. Civil 
society recognized the prominent position and positive role played by a few officials, in 
particular the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, in bringing racism and discrimination to the 
centre of the public debate, but argued that these are as yet lone voices in the fight against 
racism. 
</p>
<p>52. A grave indicator of the increase in racism and discrimination mentioned by civil society 
interlocutors was the mounting number of racially motivated crimes committed in the past years. 
This included a surge in incitement to racial, ethnic and religious hatred, often fuelled by 
politicians from extremist parties. Latvian legislation was considered severely deficient in terms 
of responding to hate speech and racially motivated crimes. Criminal prosecution of incitement 
to hatred has formally demanded overly high thresholds of proof to show explicit intent to incite 
violence. This provision has meant, in practice, that the accused must individually confess to 
showing intent, while other relevant indicators have not been taken into account. Furthermore, 
until 2006 the only provision available for prosecuting racially motivated crimes was incitement 
to racial, ethnic or religious hatred under section 78 of the Criminal Code. Since this type of 
charge often requires a higher threshold of evidence, the lack of specific provisions on hate 
crimes has led to widespread qualification of racist violence as cases of hooliganism, which 
entails softer sanctions. The amendment approved by the <i>Saeima</i> in 2006 to include racism as an 
aggravating factor in criminal acts is considered incomplete and overly general. Human rights 
NGOs have called for the drafting of a norm that clearly stipulates criminal liability for hate 
crimes. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.3 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>53. One of the major obstacles to full protection against racism and discrimination, in the view 
of civil society, is the weak institutional framework in this area. It was emphasized that although 
the Office of the Ombudsman is an important mechanism to redress and prevent violations, it has 
not taken a very active stance on racism and discrimination and has limited capacity to do so, 
illustrated by the small size of its anti-discrimination unit (four staff). Furthermore, there is no 
systematic collection of data on hate crimes, which hinders many efforts to tackle the problem. 
Civil society also recognized the importance of the Secretariat of the Special Assignment 
Minister for Social Integration, especially for the transposition of the EU Race Directive. 
However, it pointed to the lack of resources and, in particular, political backing for the 
Secretariat, which undermined its effectiveness.  
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur has identified three main groups that are vulnerable to racism 
and discrimination and xenophobia in Latvia, but who face very distinct problems. The 
Russian-speaking minorities, particularly ethnic Russians, are mostly affected by the problem of 
citizenship as well as the restrictions on the use of Russian language in public life. The Roma 
community and persons of non-European origin have been the main victims of racially motivated 
crimes and negative stereotyping. The Roma, in particular, have historically faced cultural 
stigma and structural discrimination that directly hinders their ability to fully enjoy their rights. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Views of the Russian-speaking communities 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Russian-speaking communities in Latvia are composed mostly of ethnic Russians, but 
also of smaller groups of ethnic Belorussians and other minorities. Ethnic Russians arrived in 
Latvia during different waves of migration that extended from the sixteenth century to the 
aftermath of the 1917 Revolution; only a part - albeit a large one - of the Russian community 
arrived during the Soviet occupation. Therefore, it is inaccurate to speak of a unified ethnic 
Russian minority, since different members of this group have different legal status in Latvia. The 
Special Rapporteur speaks of the Russian-speaking communities to refer to those former 
USSR citizens that immigrated to Latvia during the Soviet occupation. 
</p>
<p>56. Members of the Russian-speaking communities expressed the view that the most important 
form of discrimination in Latvia originates not in society, but rather in State institutions, in the 
form of the existing citizenship policy. The large number of stateless persons - 392,000 at 
present - was pointed out as evidence of discrimination on the basis of denial of citizenship 
rights. It was pointed out that despite an increase in naturalization rates in the early 2000s, the 
rate has fallen drastically in the past few years.  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors pointed to the failure by the Government to 
implement the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
(CERD) for Latvia to accelerate the pace of naturalization and, in particular, to let non-citizens 
participate in local government, including the right to vote and be elected for local office.<b>6</b> The 
restriction of some political rights to non-citizens, many of whom were born in Latvia, is 
considered by Russian-speaking communities a form of discrimination that hinders their 
representation in local government and restricts their ability to voice their concerns in the public 
arena. 
</p>
<p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.3 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>58. Apart from the problem of citizenship, the Russian-speaking communities highlighted 
concerns over language policy in Latvia, in terms of language requirements for naturalization, 
regulations on the use of non-official languages in public and private life and the role of 
language in education. One of the main reasons that was raised as an explanation for the decline 
in the rate of naturalization was the language requirement in the naturalization exam, which is 
seen as strict by representatives of the Russian-speaking communities. In particular, although the 
Government has sponsored some language instruction courses for non-citizens, free-of-charge 
Latvian language classes in preparation for the naturalization exam are seen as a fundamental 
step to positively encourage more applications for citizenship, particularly of marginalized 
members of the Russian-speaking communities. 
</p>
<p>59. Regulations for the use of non-official languages are believed to have drastically curtailed 
the use of Russian even in community affairs, permission only being granted to use Russian in 
police and hospital emergencies. These restrictions have especially affected vulnerable groups. 
NGOs highlighted the situation of Russian-speaking persons in Latvian prisons, who have 
limited access to legal counsel and formal communication with wardens and the judicial system. 
Concerns have been expressed that the existing regulations are sometimes used to restrict usage 
of Russian even in private affairs, by claims of a &#8220;legitimate public interest&#8221;. The 
Russian-speaking communities highlighted the importance of establishing clear limits to the 
regulations prohibiting use of non-official languages in order to guarantee that private affairs, 
including business, is not affected. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors called for 
authorization of the use of Russian in local affairs in areas densely populated by 
Russian-speaking citizens.  
</p>
<p>60. Another area of concern in terms of language policy regards the educational reforms 
introduced in 2004, which introduced bilingual education in minority schools by establishing a 
minimum share of 60 per cent of courses that need to be taught in Latvian, or bilingually, in 
public secondary schools. In its concluding observations on Latvia, CERD called for closer 
dialogue between the Government, schools, parents and pupils in order to ensure that a high 
quality of education is maintained and that the educational needs of minorities are met.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Views of the Roma community 
</b></p>
<p>61. Representatives of the Roma community expressed their concern regarding widespread 
discrimination faced in various fields of social life, including the constant threat of physical 
violence by extremist groups. This discrimination was reportedly not manifested in regard to 
citizenship status, as some 92 per cent of Roma are citizens. Rather, Roma representatives, as 
well as human rights NGOs, argue that discrimination against Roma has two major expressions: 
(a) structural discrimination, manifested in the field of economic, social and cultural rights 
(particularly employment and education), in the judiciary and law enforcement agencies, as well 
as in the negative stereotypes of the Roma that are still pervasive in Latvian society; (b) racist 
violence by extremist groups, which has been on the rise in the past few years and has not been 
met with a firm reaction by State officials, particularly those in law enforcement. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  Ibid., para. 15. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.3 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>62. Concerning structural discrimination, Roma representatives brought a number of instances 
and concrete examples to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention. An issue of particular concern is 
education. According to statistics collected by local NGOs, Roma students have drastically lower 
educational enrolment and achievement rates than the rest of the population, as well as a higher 
dropout rate. For example, while 46.4 per cent of ethnic Latvians and 46.5 per cent of ethnic 
Russians have completed secondary education, this rate is only 7.9 per cent for Roma. Although 
the Ministry of Education has prioritized Roma education, the Roma community emphasized the 
difficult material conditions faced by children in attending and performing well in schools, as 
well as the negative stereotypes they face from both instructors and peers. The poor educational 
performance of Roma children is seen as the most important challenge for their access to the 
labour market and subsequent integration into Latvian society. The impact of discrimination and 
poor education on unemployment among Roma citizens is striking: only 5 per cent of Roma 
citizens are believed to be employed in long-term jobs.<b>8</b> 
63. Other areas of preoccupation highlighted by the Roma community and human rights NGOs 
were the judiciary and law enforcement agencies. Roma representatives expressed their 
perception that proceedings are not always equitable and fair, claiming that there is a tendency 
for members of the Roma community, when convicted, to be given the maximum sentence. 
Roma citizens, particularly women, are over-represented in prisons, which has also contributed 
to further stereotyping and, in particular, informal profiling of Roma by law enforcement 
officials. Violence perpetrated by the police was also a matter of the utmost concern, in 
particular the issue of impunity for police officers who commit crimes against Roma persons.  
</p>
<p>64. Apart from structural discrimination, the central issue of concern expressed by Roma 
representatives concerned cases of racist violence and incitement to racial hatred against Roma 
by members of extremist groups, including neo-Nazi sympathizers. Widespread insecurity and 
fear of attacks among the Roma were reported. In particular, a case was brought to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s attention concerning a member of a neo-Nazi group who called in public for the 
&#8220;extermination of Jews and gypsies as non-humans&#8221;. Even though this appalling statement was 
videotaped and in spite of criminal provisions concerning incitement to racial, ethnic and 
religious hatred and violence, the case was initially dismissed by a public prosecutor on the 
grounds of freedom of expression and further rejected by a high court. The Special Rapporteur 
received the information that on 12 November 2007 the Office of the Prosecutor General 
revoked the decision to terminate proceedings in this case. In December 2007, the final bill on 
indictment was prepared and the criminal case was transferred to the court for adjudication. 
</p><p>65. Some concrete demands were made by the Roma community, including the establishment 
of Roma cultural centres, which do not exist presently in Latvia; the adoption of all international, 
in particular EU, directives against racism and discrimination; the strengthening of the Office of 
the Ombudsman and the character of its recommendations; and more inclusive and frequent 
consultations between the Government and community representatives.

page 18 
 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Views of non-European communities 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with several representatives of the African and Arab 
communities in Latvia. These communities are small in size and many of their members have 
lived in the country for many years, acquiring Latvian citizenship. However, they expressed 
concerns regarding mounting racism and discrimination, giving examples of the particular 
expressions of these phenomena. 
</p>
<p>67. The two main concerns expressed by residents of non-European origin in Latvia are 
racially motivated crimes, particularly by members of extremist organizations, including 
neo-Nazi groups, and relations with law enforcement officials, especially the police and border 
guards. According to minority representatives, these two trends will pose a grave threat to 
residents of non-European origin in the future, particularly with the new waves of migration that 
are likely to follow Latvia&#8217;s accession to the EU. 
</p>
<p>68. Insofar as racially motivated crimes are concerned, non-European communities 
emphasized the lack of adequate mechanisms to redress violations and, in particular, punish 
perpetrators. The problem of an overly high burden of proof was mentioned, which makes it 
virtually impossible to accurately prosecute racist crimes as such. Furthermore, members of 
these communities expressed serious concern regarding the tendency to qualify racist violence as 
acts of hooliganism, often leading only to suspended sentences and a formal apology. 
</p>
<p>69. Relations with law enforcement officials were also emphasized as an important form of 
discrimination against persons of non-European origins. Numerous cases of harassment by 
police officers were reported, and many interlocutors mentioned that informal racial profiling is 
widespread. This has been a particularly sensitive problem for the Arab community, affected 
with negative stereotypes as terrorists, which has increased harassment by the police in general 
as well as border guards. 
</p>
<p>70. Non-European communities emphasized the importance of multicultural training 
programmes for law enforcement officials, focusing on respect for diversity and promotion of 
tolerance. On the legal level, more comprehensive legislation was called for, especially in the 
realm of racially motivated crimes, as well as clear guidelines for the prosecution of cases of 
incitement to racial and religious hatred. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p>71. After closely analysing the statements of Government officials and those of civil society 
organizations, representatives of minorities and victims of racism and discrimination, the Special 
Rapporteur reached the following conclusions. 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur has noted that Latvian society has a history of tolerance, 
muticulturalism and openness to distinct cultures. Since the Middle Ages, Latvian territory has 
been a crossroads for different ethnic groups who lived together in harmony. Despite the 
existence of scars from the more recent historical experience of the Second World War, in 
particular the Holocaust, and subsequent Soviet occupation, the Latvian tradition of tolerance 
and multiculturalism needs to be a major element in the deployment of efforts to eradicate racism 
and discrimination in the long term. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.3 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur considers that Latvia has managed to put in place some institutions 
and legislation that address racism and discrimination and attempt to provide effective remedies 
to these problems. In this regard, he was positively impressed by the work developed by the 
Office of the Ombudsman and the Constitutional Court. He was also particularly impressed by 
the progressiveness and proactive stance of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who has managed to 
become the Government&#8217;s leading voice on racism and discrimination and has gained the utmost 
respect of his civil society interlocutors. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is grateful to have 
been able to meet with the Prime Minister, which he takes as a sign of the Government&#8217;s strong 
commitment at its highest level to fight racism and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>74. Apart from the institutions that operate on the legal level, the Special Rapporteur strongly 
supports the work of the Secretariat of the Special Assignment Minister for Social Integration, 
which performs a central role within the Government to promote the integration of all minorities. 
Notwithstanding the lack of financial resources and at times political support, the Secretariat has 
managed to develop innovative programmes and set up a framework for close consultations 
between the Government, the communities concerned and civil society on issues relating to 
minority rights and integration.  
</p>
<p>75. Despite the existence of provisions that establish the principles of equality and 
non-discrimination throughout the Latvian legal framework, including in the Labour Code, the 
Special Rapporteur has noted the existence of protection gaps that need to be corrected. This 
applies in particular to the problems faced in prosecuting racially motivated crimes due to the 
lack of specific legal provisions in this regard. This has led to a tendency for law enforcement 
agencies to prosecute racist aggression as acts of hooliganism or vandalism, disregarding the 
racial connotations of the crime. Although State authorities have pointed to a new amendment of 
the Criminal Code, approved by the <i>Saeima</i>, which considers racism as one of the aggravating 
factors for crimes, the Special Rapporteur considers that the existing legal framework contains 
protection gaps for the prosecution of hate crimes, which undermines an important deterrent 
against the future increase of this type of crime. 
</p>
<p>76. Apart from the issue of the legal and institutional framework to fight racism and 
discrimination, the Special Rapporteur has noted a strong dissonance between the opinion 
expressed by most State institutions, who view racism and discrimination as rare and isolated 
cases, and the views of civil society, who expressed serious concern regarding the structural 
nature of these problems. Civil society interlocutors expressed in strong terms their perception of 
serious and widespread discrimination that, albeit in different ways, targets particular groups: the 
Russian-speaking communities, Roma and persons of non-European origin. 
</p>
<p>77. The issues of citizenship and naturalization regulations are seen by the Russian community 
as discriminatory practices that directly restrict the full enjoyment of their human rights, 
particularly political rights. The large number of non-citizens persons living in Latvia - many of 
whom were born in the country - is evidence that a problem exists and that broader efforts need 
to be undertaken to overcome it. Although citizenship regulations are not formally 
discriminatory in the sense of treating distinct ethnic groups differently, historical circumstances 
mean that these regulations mostly affect Russian-speaking minorities, particularly ethnic 
Russians. The Special Rapporteur is aware that the problem of citizenship in Latvia involves 
sensitive issues related to the recent historical experience of the country, in particular the need to </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.3 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>reaffirm the principle of the legal continuity of the Latvian State and the reinforcing of Latvia&#8217;s 
national identity. However, he highlights the need to revisit this policy as a means to overcome 
this divisive issue between the Latvian and Russian-speaking communities. In particular, he 
noted the existence of two especially vulnerable groups of non-citizens - children of non-citizens 
who were born in Latvia and elderly persons - who could enjoy easier access to citizenship. 
</p><p>78. The Roma community in Latvia, as in most European countries, lives in particularly 
vulnerable conditions and suffers from structural discrimination that manifests itself specifically 
in the realms of education, employment and cultural stereotypes. Furthermore, Roma citizens 
have been exposed to mounting racist violence that has already claimed lives and that has left the 
Roma community under constant fear of attacks. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that some 
efforts have been made to address these problems, particularly with the implementation of the 
National Action Plan &#8220;Roma in Latvia 2007-2009&#8221;. However, apart from the provision of basic 
economic, social and cultural rights, authorities should focus on projects that target not only the 
community itself, but society as a whole. One of the main reasons for the marginalization of 
Roma citizens is intolerance and lack of acceptance by society at large, which can only be 
redressed through a national strategy that promotes cultural diversity and acceptance of 
multiculturalism. Such a strategy would also include activities that promote Roma culture as an 
enriching and unique component of Latvian national culture, thus deepening social and economic 
interactions between the Roma community and the rest of society. 
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur notes that racism and discrimination are phenomena under 
constant evolution, changing forms, expressions and typical targets. The gradual arrival in Latvia 
of new waves of migration, bringing for the first time non-European migrants to the country, is 
posing new challenges for the country in the integration of racially, ethnically and religiously 
different minorities. These challenges have already become present threats as non-Europeans 
have suffered from physical attacks and verbal threats, mainly by extremist groups. Although 
these crimes need to be met with a strong response by State institutions in the first instance, 
broader efforts need to be made to prepare Latvian society for the arrival and integration of 
persons with different traditions, ensuring respect for their culture, religion and customs. 
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur has noted that Latvia, like the other Baltic countries, is currently at 
a turning point in history. Its society is profoundly marked by the legacy of the Soviet 
domination and occupation, which has left scars that have yet to be healed, as the Special 
Rapporteur noted in his visit to the Occupation Museum. The central challenge it thus faces is to 
build a democratic, egalitarian and interactive multicultural society by taking into account both 
the need to reassert the continuity of its national identity - shaken and eroded by occupation but 
deeply rooted in a long memory - and the recognition and respect of the rights of minorities that 
arrived during the occupation. This new identity tension, with its political and cultural 
expressions, requires political vision, legal vigilance and cultural creativity to foster among 
communities a long-lasting sense of belonging and living together. Two principles should guide 
this process: respect for the historical truth and non-discrimination against minorities. To fully 
implement this strategy, national and regional factors will be of key relevance as far as the 
Russian communities are concerned. The full respect of their rights - in terms of citizenship, 
language, culture and the eradication of any form of discrimination - is closely linked to their 
involvement and participation in the process of a new multicultural nation that is fully respected 
by all countries in the region. </p>

<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>State authorities in the executive, legislative and judiciary branches should highlight 
their strong political will and commitment to fighting all forms of racism and 
discrimination in Latvian society and their vigilance as to the new challenges that arise 
from growing migration, multiculturalism and identity changes. It is especially important 
to firmly condemn any racist or xenophobic action or discourse, including by political 
parties and the media. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Latvia has a strong heritage of tolerance and multiculturalism that originated in its 
strategic position of the trade route in the Middle Ages, bringing many different ethnic 
groups together. State authorities and civil society should build on these pluralistic 
traditions to strengthen all actions against racism and discrimination and to promote a 
democratic multiculturalism that will be central to including new minorities in Latvian 
society. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Insofar as Latvia&#8217;s legal framework is concerned, to fight racism and discrimination, 
despite the existence of separate provisions in various different laws, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that the Government adopt comprehensive national legislation 
dealing with all forms of discrimination in a readily identifiable legal act. This would 
complement the relevant legislative basis that already exists in Latvia and, most 
importantly, ensure that no protection gaps remain. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>In order to deter and punish hate crimes, particularly racially, ethnically and 
religiously motivated crimes, the Government should also adopt complementary legislation 
that unambiguously specifies criminal liability for all types of hate crimes, building on the 
recent amendment to the Criminal Code that considers racism an aggravating 
circumstance. However, apart from legislative changes, training programmes for law 
enforcement agencies and prosecutors to improve the implementation of this legislation are 
required, including the drafting of clear guidelines for the investigation and prosecution of 
hate crimes. Additionally, the Government should systematically collect data on hate 
crimes and make them publicly available, allowing for monitoring by civil society and 
international instruments. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Government should develop best practices and general guidelines for the 
prosecution of cases of incitement to racial hatred, developing clear criteria for the 
threshold of evidence that is required to be presented and for the investigative conduct of 
law enforcement bodies. Whilst developing these guidelines, the Government should bear 
in mind the need for the prohibition of incitement to racial, religious or ethnic hatred 
established by section 78 of the Criminal Code, article 20 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Government should also strengthen the capacity of the Office of the Ombudsman 
to thoroughly investigate and act on allegations of racist crimes and incitement to racial, 
ethnic or religious hatred. In particular, the anti-discrimination unit of the Office, which 
currently employs four officials, should be significantly strengthened and enlarged. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.3 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>87. <b>To complement the role of the Ombudsman and to ensure that no protection gaps 
remain, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government put in place an 
independent institution that will link the fight against all forms of discrimination to the 
active promotion of multiculturalism as the long-term solution to this problem.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Insofar as citizenship regulations are concerned, the Government should revisit the 
existing requirements for naturalization with the objective of facilitating the granting of 
citizenship to non-citizens and implementing the commitments established by the 
1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. In particular, the Government should 
consider appropriate measures to tackle the problem of the low level of registration as 
citizens of children born in Latvia after 21 August 1991 to non-citizen parents. These 
measures could include granting automatic citizenship at birth, without a requirement of 
registration by the parents, to those children born to non-citizen parents who do not 
acquire any other nationality. The Government should also relax naturalization 
requirements, in particular language proficiency exams, for elderly persons. Additionally, 
the granting of voting rights in local elections for non-citizens who are long-term residents 
of Latvia should be considered by the Government and the subject of broad discussion 
within Latvian society. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that Latvia&#8217;s language policy be revisited, 
aiming to better reflect the multilingual character of its society. This process should aim to 
promote the cohabitation of all the communities in Latvia on the basis of two principles: 
first, the legitimate right of the Latvian Government to disseminate Latvian language 
among all residents; second, the respect for the existence of minority languages spoken by 
sizeable communities, in particular Russian, in full compliance with the Declaration on the 
Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, in 
particular, article 2.1 which states that &#8220;Persons belonging to national &#8230; minorities have 
the right to &#8230; use their own language, in private and in public, freely and without 
interference or any form of discrimination&#8221;; article 4.2 which states that &#8220;States shall take 
measures where required to create favourable conditions to enable persons belonging to 
minorities to [&#8230;] develop their culture, language, religion, traditions and customs&#8221; and 
article 4.3 which states that &#8220;States should take appropriate measures so that, wherever 
possible, persons belonging to minorities may have adequate opportunities to learn their 
mother tongue or to have instruction in their mother tongue.&#8221; Specific measures that could 
be taken to improve the situation of linguistic minorities include extending free-of-charge 
Latvian language courses for all residents in Latvian territory. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The role of the Special Assignment Minister for Social Integration and his Secretariat 
should be strengthened, both in terms of mandate and resources. Transforming the 
Secretariat into a fully-fledged Ministry would not only enhance its effectiveness and voice, 
but symbolically reflect the will of the Government to tackle the issues of racism and 
discrimination and promote integration. The Secretariat should expand its activities to 
promote the cultural expressions of minority communities based on its distinctive vision of 
multicultural integration. Besides working with traditional minorities, the Secretariat 
should be given the capacity to focus also on the integration of new religious and ethnic 
communities. </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/19/Add.3 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>91. <b>Particular attention should be granted to the vulnerable situation of the Roma 
community. The Government should reinforce its National Action Plan &#8220;Roma in Latvia 
2007-2009&#8221;, aiming at both promoting and respecting their cultural identity and living 
cultural expressions and at eradicating the deep cultural stigma affecting the community, 
their social and economic marginalization, particularly the poor educational attainment of 
Roma children and the drastically high unemployment rates among Roma citizens. The 
programme should also have a strong component that focuses on sensitizing society at large 
to Roma history and traditions, including their fate during the Holocaust, in order to 
eliminate the negative stigma and stereotypes constantly associated with the Roma. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Government should develop mandatory training schemes for all law enforcement 
officials, including border guards, focusing on human rights education in general and 
racism and discrimination in particular. Achieving a multicultural composition and 
training of these officials will in the medium-term improve their relations with, and 
increase respect for, minority communities. Additionally, adequate mechanisms should be 
put in place to identify and punish unprofessional behaviour of law enforcement officials 
when dealing with minorities, in particular in cases of harassment and racial, ethnic or 
religious profiling. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Government should promote a profound process of multiculturalism in Latvian 
society, based both on the recognition and the respect of the cultural and religious diversity 
of its different communities, old and recent, and the strengthening of the unity of the 
nation. Education, in particular the writing and teaching of history, based on this 
dialectical approach should play a key role in this long-term process. 
</b></p>
<p>94. T<b>he Government should strengthen its cooperation with civil society, which has been 
playing an important monitoring role for human rights violations and legislative 
developments in the realm of racism and discrimination. Civil society should be 
encouraged to further its work in providing legal counsel to victims, as well as access to 
international instruments, both at the international and regional levels. 
</b></p>
<p>95. I<b>n parallel with a political and legal strategy, the Government, in cooperation with 
civil society, should adopt an ethical and cultural strategy that addresses the deepest roots 
of racism, xenophobia and intolerance and is built around the promotion of reciprocal 
knowledge of cultures and values, interaction among the different communities and the 
link between the fight against racism, xenophobia and discrimination and the long-term 
construction of a democratic, egalitarian and interactive multicultural society.
