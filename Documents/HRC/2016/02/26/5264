<p><b>Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council</b>* 
</p>
<p><b>12/9.   Human rights and international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p><i> The</i> <i>Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and the 
Council on the issue of the human rights and international solidarity, including Commission 
resolution 2005/55 of 20 April 2005 and Council resolutions 6/3 of 27 September 2007, 7/5 of 27 
March 2008 and 9/2 of 24 September 2008, and taking note of the reports presented by the 
independent expert on human rights and international solidarity, in particular his latest report 
(A/HRC/12/27), 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> the fact that the processes of promoting and protecting human rights should be 
conducted in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations 
and international law, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that, at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in June 1993, States 
pledged to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to 
development, and stressed that the international community should promote effective 
international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination of 
obstacles to development,  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>*</b> The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of the Council 
on its twelfth session (A/HRC/12/50), chap. I. </p>

 <p><i> Reaffirming</i> the fact that article 4 of the Declaration on the Right to Development states 
that sustained action is required to promote more rapid development of developing countries and, 
as a complement to the efforts of developing countries, effective international cooperation is 
essential in order to provide these countries with the appropriate means and facilities to foster 
their comprehensive development, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking into account</i> the fact that article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights states that each State party to the Covenant undertakes to take steps, 
individually and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and 
technical, to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the 
full realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant by all appropriate means, including 
particularly the adoption of legislative measures, 
</p>
<p><i> Persuaded</i> that sustainable development can be promoted by peaceful coexistence, friendly 
relations and cooperation among States with different social, economic or political systems,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the fact that the widening gap between the economically developed and 
developing countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human rights in the 
international community, and makes it all the more imperative for every nation, according to its 
capacities, to make the maximum possible effort to close this gap, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing concern</i> at the fact that the immense benefits resulting from the process of 
globalization and economic interdependence have not reached all countries, communities and 
individuals, and at the increasing marginalization from their benefits of several countries, 
particularly least developed and African countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its deep concern</i> at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and 
agricultural pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in a massive 
loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and environmental consequences for 
vulnerable societies throughout the world, in particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the crucial importance of increasing the resources allocated for official 
development assistance, recalling the pledge of industrialized countries to allocate 0.7 per cent of 
their gross national product for official development assistance, and recognizing the need for 
new and additional resources to finance the development programmes of developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Determined</i> to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international community 
with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights endeavours by an increased and 
sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i> Asserting</i> the necessity for establishing new, equitable and global links of partnership and 
intra-generational solidarity for the perpetuation of humankind, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity as a vital 
component of the efforts made by developing countries to realize the right to development of 
their peoples and to promote the full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by 
everyone has been insufficient, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Resolved</i> to strive to ensure that present generations are fully aware of their responsibilities 
towards future ones, and that a better world is possible for both present and future generations, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the recognition set forth in the declaration adopted by the Heads of State 
and Government at the Millennium Summit of the fundamental value of solidarity to 
international relations in the twenty-first century, in stating that global challenges must be 
managed in a way that distributes costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with basic principles of 
equity and social justice, and that those who suffer, or who benefit least, deserve help from those 
who benefit most; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses its determination</i> to contribute to the solution of current world problems 
through increased international cooperation, to create conditions that will ensure that the needs 
and interests of future generations are not jeopardized by the burden of the past, and to hand over 
a better world to future generations; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> the international community to consider urgently concrete measures to 
promote and consolidate international assistance to developing countries in their development 
endeavours and for the promotion of conditions conducive to the full realization of all human 
rights; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> the international community to promote international solidarity and 
cooperation as an important tool to help to overcome the negative effects of the current 
economic, financial and climate crisis, particularly in developing countries; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the promotion of international cooperation is a duty for States, that it 
should be implemented without any conditionality and on the basis of mutual respect, in full 
compliance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, in particular 
respect for the sovereignty of States, and taking into account national priorities; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Recognizes</i> that the so-called &#8220;third-generation rights&#8221; closely interrelated to the 
fundamental value of solidarity need further progressive development within the United Nations 
human rights machinery in order to be able to respond to the increasing challenges of 
international cooperation in this field; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests </i>all States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations to mainstream the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity in their activities, and to cooperate with the independent 
expert in his mandate, to supply all necessary information requested by him and to give serious 
consideration to responding favourably to his requests to visit their country, to enable him to 
fulfil his mandate effectively;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Requests</i> the independent expert to continue his work in the preparation of a draft 
declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity, and in further 
developing guidelines, standards, norms and principles with a view to promoting and protecting 
this right, by addressing, inter alia, existing and emerging obstacles to its realization; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also requests</i> the independent expert to take into account the outcomes of all major 
United Nations and other global summits and ministerial meetings in the economic, social and </p>

 <p>climate fields and to seek views and contributions from Governments, United Nations agencies, 
other relevant international organizations and non-governmental organizations in the discharge 
of his mandate; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests </i>the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee to prepare inputs to 
contribute to the elaboration of the draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to 
international solidarity, and to the further development of guidelines, standards, norms and 
principles with a view to promoting and protecting this right; </p>
<p> 11. <i>Requests </i>the independent expert to submit a report on the implementation of the 
present resolution to the Council at its fifteenth session; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Decides</i> to continue its examination of this issue at its fifteenth session under the 
same agenda item.
