</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i>The reinvestment in agriculture, triggered by the 2008 food price crisis, is essential 
</p>
<p>to the concrete realization of the right to food. However, in a context of ecological, food 
and energy crises, the most pressing issue regarding reinvestment is not how much, but 
how. This report explores how States can and must achieve a reorientation of their 
agricultural systems towards modes of production that are highly productive, highly 
sustainable and that contribute to the progressive realization of the human right to adequate 
food. 
</p>
<p>Drawing on an extensive review of the scientific literature published in the last five 
years, the Special Rapporteur identifies agroecology as a mode of agricultural development 
which not only shows strong conceptual connections with the right to food, but has proven 
results for fast progress in the concretization of this human right for many vulnerable 
groups in various countries and environments. Moreover, agroecology delivers advantages 
that are complementary to better known conventional approaches such as breeding high-
yielding varieties. And it strongly contributes to the broader economic development. 
</p>
<p>The report argues that the scaling up of these experiences is the main challenge 
today. Appropriate public policies can create an enabling environment for such sustainable 
modes of production. These policies include prioritizing the procurement of public goods in 
public spending rather than solely providing input subsidies; investing in knowledge by 
reinvesting in agricultural research and extension services; investing in forms of social 
organization that encourage partnerships, including farmer field schools and farmers&#8217; 
movements innovation networks; investing in agricultural research and extension systems; 
empowering women; and creating a macro-economic enabling environment, including 
connecting sustainable farms to fair markets.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In this annual report submitted to the Human Rights Council in accordance with 
Council resolution 13/4, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food shows why agriculture 
should be fundamentally redirected towards modes of production that are more 
environmentally sustainable and socially just, and how this can be achieved. The report is 
based on a large range of submissions received from experts from all regions, as well as on 
an international expert seminar on agroecology convened by the Special Rapporteur in 
Brussels, Belgium, on 21-22 June 2010, with support from the King Baudouin Foundation. 
</p>
<p>2. Agriculture is at a crossroads. For almost thirty years, since the early 1980s, neither 
the private sector nor governments were interested in investing in agriculture. This is now 
changing. Over the last few years, agri-food companies have seen an increase in direct 
investment as a means to lower costs and ensure the long-term viability of supplies:1 
Foreign direct investment in agriculture went from an average US$ 600 million annually in 
the 1990s to an average US$ 3 billion in 2005-2007.2 The shock created by the 2007-2008 
global food price crisis led to the establishment or strengthening of further initiatives, such 
as the Aquila Food Security Initiative, the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program 
(GAFSP) or NEPAD&#8217;s Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program 
(CAADP) in Africa. Governments are paying greater attention to agriculture than in the 
past.  
</p>
<p>3. But increasing food production to meet future needs, while necessary, is not 
sufficient. It will not allow significant progress in combating hunger and malnutrition if it is 
not combined with higher incomes and improved livelihoods for the poorest &#8211; particularly 
small-scale farmers in developing countries. And short-term gains will be offset by long-
term losses if it leads to further degradation of ecosystems, threatening future ability to 
maintain current levels of production. It is possible, however, to significantly improve 
agricultural productivity where it has been lagging behind, and thus raise production where 
it needs most to be raised (i.e. in poor, food-deficit countries3), while at the same time 
improving the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and preserving ecosystems. This would 
slow the trend towards urbanisation in the countries concerned, which is placing stress on 
public services of these countries. It would contribute to rural development and preserve the 
ability for the succeeding generation to meet its own needs. It would also contribute to the 
growth of other sectors of the economy by stimulating demand for non-agricultural 
products that would result from higher incomes in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>4. To achieve this, however, pouring money into agriculture will not be sufficient; 
what is most important is to take steps that facilitate the transition towards a low-carbon, 
resource-preserving type of agriculture that benefits the poorest farmers. This will not 
happen by chance. It can only happen by design, through strategies and programmes backed 
by strong political will, and informed by a right-to-food approach. This report explores how 
agroecology, a mode of agricultural development that has shown notable success in the last 
decade (see Section III), can play a central role in achieving this goal.

 3  Although this report focuses on these countries, the Special Rapporteur is convinced that the 
</p>
<p>transition towards low external input and sustainable agriculture is needed in all regions, including 
industrialized countries.   </p>


<p><b> II.  Diagnosis: three objectives of food systems 
</b></p>
<p>5.  Ensuring the right to food requires the possibility either to feed oneself directly from 
productive land or other natural resources, or to purchase food. This implies ensuring that 
food is available, accessible and adequate. Availability relates to there being sufficient food 
on the market to meet the needs. Accessibility requires both physical and economic access: 
physical accessibility means that food should be accessible to all people, including the 
physically vulnerable such as children, older persons or persons with disabilities; economic 
accessibility means that food must be affordable without compromising other basic needs 
such as education fees, medical care or housing. Adequacy requires that food satisfy dietary 
needs (factoring a person&#8217;s age, living conditions, health, occupation, sex, etc), be safe for 
human consumption, free of adverse substances and culturally acceptable. Participation of 
food-insecure groups in the design and implementation of the policies that most affect them 
is also a key dimension of the right to food.  
</p>
<p>6. Consistent with obligations assumed by States under international human rights 
treaties to take effective measures towards the realization of the right to food, food systems 
should be developed in order to meet the following three objectives.  
</p>
<p>7. First, food systems must ensure the availability of food for everyone, that is, supply 
must match world needs. The most widely cited estimates state that an overall increase in 
agricultural production should reach 70 per cent by 2050,4 taking into account demographic 
growth, as well as changes in the composition of diets and consumption levels associated 
with increased urbanization and higher household incomes. This estimate, however, needs 
to be put in an appropriate perspective, since it takes the current demand curves as a given. 
At present, nearly half of the world&#8217;s cereal production is used to produce animal feed, and 
meat consumption is predicted to increase from 37.4 kg/person/year in 2000 to over 52 
kg/person/year by 2050, so that by mid-century, 50 per cent of total cereal production may 
go to increasing meat production.5 Therefore, reallocating cereals used in animal feed to 
human consumption, a highly desirable option in developed countries where the excess 
animal protein consumption is a source of public health problems, combined with the 
development of alternative feeds based on new technology, waste and discards, could go a 
long way towards meeting the increased needs. The United Nations Environmental 
Programme (UNEP) estimates that, even accounting for the energy value of the meat 
produced, the loss of calories that result from feeding cereals to animals instead of using 
cereals directly as human food represents the annual calorie need for more than 3.5 billion 
people.6 In addition, food losses in the field (between planting and harvesting) may be as 
high as 20 to 40 per cent of the potential harvest in developing countries, due to pests and 
pathogens, and the average post-harvest losses, resulting from poor storage and 
conservation, amount at least to 12 per cent, and up to 50 per cent for fruits and vegetables.7 
Finally, as a result of policies to promote the production and use of agrofuels, the diversion 
of crops from meeting food needs to meeting energy needs contributes to tightening the 
pressure on agricultural supplies. Although these are all domains in which measures could 
be adopted, the need to meet the supply-side challenge remains.

<p>8. Second, agriculture must develop in ways that increase the incomes of smallholders. 
Food availability is, first and foremost, an issue at the household level, and hunger today is 
mostly attributable not to stocks that are too low or to global supplies unable to meet 
demand, but to poverty; increasing the incomes of the poorest is the best way to combat it. 
Cross-country comparisons show that GDP growth originating in agriculture is at least 
twice as effective in reducing poverty as GDP growth originating outside agriculture.8 But 
some types of investments are more effective than others in achieving that objective. The 
multiplier effects are significantly higher when growth is triggered by higher incomes for 
smallholders, stimulating demand for goods and services from local sellers and service-
providers. When large estates increase their revenue, most of it is spent on imported inputs 
and machinery, and much less trickles down to local traders.9 Only by supporting small 
producers can we help break the vicious cycle that leads from rural poverty to the 
expansion of urban slums, in which poverty breeds more poverty. 
</p>
<p>9. Third, agriculture must not compromise its ability to satisfy future needs. The loss of 
biodiversity, unsustainable use of water, and pollution of soils and water are issues which 
compromise the continuing ability for natural resources to support agriculture. Climate 
change, which translates in more frequent and extreme weather events, such as droughts 
and floods and less predictable rainfall, is already having a severe impact on the ability of 
certain regions and communities to feed themselves. It is also destabilizing markets.10 The 
change in average temperatures is threatening the ability of entire regions, particularly those 
living from rain-fed agriculture, to maintain actual levels of agricultural production.11 Less 
fresh water will be available for agricultural production, and the rise in sea level is already 
causing the salinization of water in certain coastal areas, making water sources improper for 
irrigation purposes. By 2080, 600 million additional people could be at risk of hunger, as a 
direct result of climate change.12 In Sub-Saharan Africa, arid and semi-arid areas are 
projected to increase by 60 million to 90 million hectares, while in Southern Africa, it is 
estimated that yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50 per cent 
between 2000 and 2020.13 Losses in agricultural production in a number of developing 
countries could be partially compensated by gains in other regions, but the overall result 
would be a decrease of at least 3 per cent in productive capacity by the 2080s, and up to 16 
per cent if the anticipated carbon fertilization effects (incorporation of carbon dioxide in the 
process of photosynthesis) fail to materialize.14  
</p>

are provided with a set of inputs that can increase yields, replicating the model of industrial

<p>processes in which external inputs serve to produce outputs in a linear model of production. 
Instead, agroecology seeks to improve the sustainability of agroecosystems by mimicking 
nature instead of industry.15 This report suggests that scaling up agroecological practices 
can simultaneously increase farm productivity and food security, improve incomes and 
rural livelihoods, and reverse the trend towards species loss and genetic erosion.  
</p>
<p>11. The following sections explain what agroecology is, and how it contributes to the 
realization of the right to adequate food in its different dimensions: availability, 
accessibility, adequacy, sustainability and participation (Section III). However, in moving 
towards more sustainable farming systems, time is the greatest limiting factor. Whether or 
not we will succeed will depend on our ability to learn faster from recent innovations and to 
disseminate works more widely. Section IV is dedicated to public policies that States 
should adopt to scale up agroecology. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Contribution of agroecology to the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>12. Agroecology is both a science and a set of practices. It was created by the 
convergence of two scientific disciplines: agronomy and ecology. As a science, 
agroecology is the &#8220;application of ecological science to the study, design and management 
of sustainable agroecosystems.&#8221;16 As a set of agricultural practices, agroecology seeks ways 
to enhance agricultural systems by mimicking natural processes, thus creating beneficial 
biological interactions and synergies among the components of the agroecosystem. It 
provides the most favourable soil conditions for plant growth, particularly by managing 
organic matter and by raising soil biotic activity. The core principles of agroecology 
include recycling nutrients and energy on the farm, rather than introducing external inputs; 
integrating crops and livestock; diversifying species and genetic resources in 
agroecosystems over time and space; and focusing on interactions and productivity across 
the agricultural system, rather than focusing on individual species. Agroecology is highly 
knowledge-intensive, based on techniques that are not delivered top-down but developed on 
the basis of farmers&#8217; knowledge and experimentation.  
</p>
<p>13. As a way to improve the resilience and sustainability of food systems, agroecology 
is now supported by an increasingly wide range of experts within the scientific 
community,17 and by international agencies and organizations, such as the United Nations 
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), UNEP18 and Biodiversity International.19 It is 
also gaining ground in countries as diverse as the United States, Brazil, Germany and 
France.20

<p>14. Agroecology is a coherent concept for designing future farming systems as it is 
strongly rooted both in science and in practice, and because it shows strong connections 
with the principles of the right to adequate food (Section III). It can be seen as 
encompassing &#8211; or closely related to &#8211; approaches such as &#8220;ecoagriculture&#8221;21 and 
&#8220;evergreen agriculture,&#8221;22 while the concepts of &#8220;ecological intensification&#8221; and 
&#8220;conservation agriculture&#8221; often follow certain agroecological principles. Agroecology is 
also linked to the &#8220;ecosystem approach to sustainable crop production intensification&#8221; 
recently supported by the FAO Committee on Agriculture (COAG).23 Discussion of the 
detailed differences among these concepts is beyond the scope of this report.  
</p>
<p>15. Crop breeding and agroecology are complementary. For instance, breeding provides 
new varieties with shorter growing cycles, which enable farmers to continue farming in 
regions where the crop season has already shrunk. Breeding can also improve the level of 
drought resistance in plant varieties, an asset for countries where lack of water is a limiting 
factor. Reinvesting in agricultural research must consequently mean continued efforts in 
breeding. However, agroecology is more overarching as it supports building drought-
resistant agricultural systems (including soils, plants, agrobiodiversity, etc.), not just 
drought-resistant plants.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Availability: agroecology raises productivity at field level  
</b></p>
<p>16. A wide panoply of techniques based on the agroecological perspective have been 
developed and successfully tested in a range of regions.24 These approaches involve the 
maintenance or introduction of agricultural biodiversity (diversity of crops, livestock, 
agroforestry, fish, pollinators, insects, soil biota and other components that occur in and 
around production systems) to achieve the desired results in production and sustainability. 
<i>Integrated nutrient management</i> reconciles the need to fix nitrogen within farm systems 
with the import of inorganic and organic sources of nutrients and the reduction of nutrient 
losses through erosion control. <i>Agroforestry</i> incorporates multifunctional trees into 
agricultural systems. In Tanzania, 350,000 hectares of land have been rehabilitated in the 
Western provinces of Shinyanga and Tabora using agroforestry;25 there are similar large-
scale projects developed in other countries including Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia.26 
<i>Water harvesting</i> in dryland areas allows for the cultivation of formerly abandoned and 
degraded lands, and improves the water productivity of crops. In West Africa, stone 
barriers built alongside fields slow down runoff water during the rainy season, allowing an 
improvement of soil moisture, the replenishment of water tables, and reductions in soil 
erosion. The water retention capacity is multiplied five- to ten-fold, the biomass production

<p>multiplies by 10 to 15 times, and livestock can feed on the grass that grows along the stone 
barriers after the rains. 27 <i>Integration of  livestock into farming systems</i>, such as dairy cattle, 
pigs and poultry, provides a source of protein to the family, as well as a means of fertilizing 
soils; so does the incorporation of fish, shrimps and other aquatic resources into farm 
systems, such as irrigated rice fields and fish ponds.  
</p>
<p>17. Such resource-conserving, low-external-input techniques have a proven potential to 
significantly improve yields. In what may be the most systematic study of the potential of 
such techniques to date, Jules Pretty et al. compared the impacts of 286 recent sustainable 
agriculture projects in 57 poor countries covering 37 million hectares (3 per cent of the 
cultivated area in developing countries). They found that such interventions increased 
productivity on 12.6 millions farms, with an average crop increase of 79 per cent, while 
improving the supply of critical environmental services.28 Disaggregated data from this 
research showed that average food production per household rose by 1.7 tonnes per year 
(up by 73 per cent) for 4.42 million small farmers growing cereals and roots on 3.6 million 
hectares, and that increase in food production was 17 tonnes per year (up 150 per cent) for 
146,000 farmers on 542,000 hectares cultivating roots (potato, sweet potato, cassava). After 
UNCTAD and UNEP reanalyzed the database to produce a summary of the impacts in 
Africa, it was found that the average crop yield increase was even higher for these projects 
than the global average of 79 per cent at 116 per cent increase for all African projects and 
128 per cent increase for projects in East Africa.29 
</p>
<p>18. The most recent large-scale study points to the same conclusions. Research 
commissioned by the Foresight Global Food and Farming Futures project of the UK 
Government reviewed 40 projects in 20 African countries where sustainable intensification 
was developed during the 2000s. The projects included crop improvements (particularly 
improvements through participatory plant breeding on hitherto neglected orphan crops30), 
integrated pest management, soil conservation and agro-forestry. By early 2010, these 
projects had documented benefits for 10.39 million farmers and their families and 
improvements on approximately 12.75 million hectares. Crop yields more than doubled on 
average (increasing 2.13-fold) over a period of 3-10 years, resulting in an increase in 
aggregate food production of 5.79 million tonnes per year, equivalent to 557 kg per farming 
household.31   
</p>
<p>19. Sometimes, seemingly minor innovations can provide high returns. In Kenya, 
researchers and farmers developed the &#8220;push-pull&#8221; strategy to control parasitic weeds and 
insects that damage the crops. The strategy consists in &#8220;pushing&#8221; away pests from corn by 
inter-planting corn with insect-repellent crops like <i>Desmodium</i>, while &#8220;pulling&#8221; them 
towards small plots of Napier grass, a plant that excretes a sticky gum which both attracts

<p>and traps pests. The system not only controls pests but has other benefits as well, because 
<i>Desmodium</i> can be used as fodder for livestock. The push-pull strategy doubles maize 
yields and milk production while, at the same time, improves the soil. The system has 
already spread to more than 10,000 households in East Africa by means of town meetings, 
national radio broadcasts and farmer field schools.32 In Japan, farmers found that ducks and 
fish were as effective as pesticide for controlling insects in rice paddies, while providing 
additional protein for their families. The ducks eat weeds, weed seeds, insects, and other 
pests, thus reducing weeding labour, otherwise done by hand by women, and duck 
droppings provide plant nutrients. The system has been adopted in China, India, and the 
Philippines. In Bangladesh, the International Rice Research Institute reports 20 per cent 
higher crops yields, and net incomes on a cash cost basis have increased by 80 per cent.33  
</p>
<p>20. Agroecology is also gaining ground in Malawi, a country that has been at the centre 
of attention in recent years. Malawi successfully launched a fertilizer subsidy programme in 
2005-2006, following the dramatic food crisis due to drought in 2004-2005. However, it is 
now implementing agroforestry systems, using nitrogen-fixing trees, to ensure sustained 
growth in maize production in preparation for the medium-term situation when fertilizer 
subsidies may have to be scaled back or withdrawn.34 By mid-2009, over 120,000 
Malawian farmers had received training and tree materials from the programme, and 
support from Ireland has now enabled extension of the programme to 40 per cent of 
Malawi&#8217;s districts, benefiting 1.3 million of the poorest people. Research shows that this 
results in increased yields from 1 t/ha to 2&#8211;3 t/ha, even if farmers cannot afford commercial 
nitrogen fertilizers. With an application of a quarter-dose of mineral fertilizer, maize yields 
may surpass 4 t/ha. However, this shows that, while investment in organic fertilizing 
techniques should be a priority, this should not exclude the use of other fertilizers. An 
optimal solution that could be an exit strategy from fertilizer subsidy schemes would be to 
link fertilizer subsidies directly to agroforestry investments on the farm in order to provide 
for long-term sustainability in nutrient supply, and to build up soil health as the basis for 
sustained yields and improved efficiency of fertilizer response.35 Malawi is reportedly 
exploring this &#8220;subsidy to sustainability&#8221; approach.36

<p>dependent on local retailers and moneylenders. One key reason why agroecology helps to 
support incomes in rural areas is because it promotes on-farm fertility generation. Indeed, 
supplying nutrients to the soil does not necessarily require adding mineral fertilizers. It can 
be done by applying livestock manure or by growing green manures. Farmers can also 
establish a &#8220;fertilizer factory in the fields&#8221; by planting trees that take nitrogen out of the air 
and &#8220;fix&#8221; it in their leaves, which are subsequently incorporated into the soil. That, in 
essence, is the result of planting <i>Faidherbia albida</i>, a nitrogen-fixing acacia species 
indigenous to Africa and widespread throughout the continent. Since this tree goes dormant 
and sheds its foliage during the early rainy season at the time when field crops are being 
established, it does not compete significantly with them for light, nutrients or water during 
the growing season; yet it allows a significant increase in yields of the maize with which it 
is combined, particularly in conditions of low soil fertility. In Zambia, unfertilized maize 
yields in the vicinity of <i>Faidherbia</i> trees averaged 4.1 t/ha, compared to 1.3 t/ha nearby, but 
beyond the tree canopy. Similar results were observed in Malawi, where this tree was also 
widely used. The use of such nitrogen-fixing trees avoids dependence on synthetic 
fertilizers, the price of which has been increasingly high and volatile over the past few 
years, exceeding food commodity prices, even when the latter reached a peak in July 2008. 
In this way, whatever financial assets the household has can be used on other essentials, 
such as education or medicine.

<p>22. Agroforestry or comparable techniques such as the use of leguminous-cover crops to 
fix nitrogen also have a huge potential.37 This matters particularly to the poorest farmers, 
who are least likely to be able to afford to buy inorganic fertilizers, and whom fertilizer 
distribution systems often do not reach, particularly since the private sector is unlikely to 
invest into the most remote areas where communication routes are poor and few economies 
of scale can be achieved. But it is also of great importance to low-income countries, which 
import to meet their inorganic fertilizer needs. In sub-Saharan Africa, part of the reason 
why the use of fertilizers is very low (average 13 kilograms (kg) of fertilizer nutrients per 
hectare)38 is because of the considerable fiscal costs involved in the import and distribution 
of fertilizers.  
</p>
<p><i>  Multiplier effects for rural development: job creation, increased incomes  
</i></p>
<p>23. Agroecological approaches can be labour-intensive during their launching period, 
due to the complexity of the tasks of managing different plants and animals on the farm, 
and recycling the waste produced. However, research shows that the higher labour-intensity 
of agroecology is a reality particularly in the short term.39 In addition, while labour-saving 
policies have generally been prioritized by governments, creation of employment in rural 
areas in developing countries, where underemployment is currently massive, and 
demographic growth remains high, may constitute an advantage rather than a liability and 
may slow down rural-urban migration. Moreover, the cost of creating jobs in agriculture is 
often significantly lower than in other sectors: in Brazil, data from INCRA, the agency 
responsible for land reform, showed that each job generated in a settlement costs the 
government 3.640 USD, while the cost would be 128 per cent more expensive in industry, 
190 per cent more in trade, and 240 per cent more in services.40 According to peasant 
organizations, agroecology is also more attractive to farmers, because it procures pleasant 
features for those working the land for long hours, such as shade from trees or the absence 
of smell and toxicity from chemicals.41  
</p>
<p>24. In Burkina Faso, rather than migrating, work groups of young men specialized in 
land rehabilitation techniques, such as tassas and zai planting pits, go from village to village 
to satisfy farmers&#8217; growing interest in improving their own lands. Farmers are now buying 
degraded land for improvement and paying these labourers to dig zai pits and construct the 
rock walls and half-moon structures which can transform yields.42 This is one of the reasons 
why more than 3 million hectares of land in Burkina Faso are now rehabilitated and 
productive.

<p>25. Although they can create jobs, agroecological approaches are fully compatible with 
a gradual mechanization of farming. The need to produce equipment for conservation 
agricultural techniques such as no-till and direct seeding actually results in more jobs being 
created in the manufacturing sector. This is true in particular in Africa which still imports 
most of its equipment, but which increasingly manufactures simple equipment43 
Employment could also result from the expansion of agroforestry. In Southern Africa, 
farmers produce trees as a business, supported by a financing facility established by the 
World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF). During its first year, the Malawi Agroforestry Food 
Security Programme distributed tree seeds, setting up 17 nurseries that raised 2,180,000 
seedlings and establishing 345 farmer groups.44 
</p>
<p><b> C. Adequacy: agroecology contributes to improving nutrition </b></p>
<p>26. In the past, Green Revolution approaches have focused primarily on boosting cereal 
crops. However, rice, wheat and maize are mainly sources of carbohydrates: they contain 
relatively little protein, and few of the other nutrients essential for adequate diets. The shift 
from diversified cropping systems to simplified cereal-based systems thus contributed to 
micronutrient malnutrition in many developing countries.45 Indeed, of the over 80,000 plant 
species available to humans, rice, wheat and maize supply the bulk of our protein and 
energy needs.46 Nutritionists now increasingly insist on the need for more diverse agro-
ecosystems, in order to ensure a more diversified nutrient output of the farming systems.47 
</p>
<p>27. The diversity of species on farms managed following agroecological principles, as 
well as in urban or peri-urban agriculture, is an important asset in this regard. For example, 
it has been estimated that indigenous fruits contribute on average about 42 per cent of the 
natural food-basket that rural households rely on in southern Africa.48 This is not only an 
important source of vitamins and other micronutrients, but it also may be critical for 
sustenance during lean seasons. Nutritional diversity, enabled by increased diversity in the 
field, is of particular importance to children and women.

<p><b> D. Sustainability: agroecology contributes to adapting to climate change </b></p>

<p>promotion of agricultural biodiversity at ecosystem, farm system and farmer field levels, 
which is materialized by many agroecological approaches.49 Following Hurricane Mitch in 
1998, a large-scale study on 180 communities of smallholders from southern to northern 
Nicaragua demonstrated that farming plots cropped with simple agroecological methods 
(including rock bunds or dikes, green manure, crop rotation and the incorporation of 
stubble, ditches, terraces, barriers, mulch, legumes, trees, plowing parallel to the slope, no-
burn, live fences, and zero-tillage) had on average 40 per cent more topsoil, higher field 
moisture, less erosion and lower economic losses than control plots on conventional farms. 
On average, agroecological plots lost 18 per cent less arable land to landslides than 
conventional plots and had 69 per cent less gully erosion compared to conventional farms.50  
</p>
<p>29. More frequent and more severe droughts and floods can be expected in the future; 
agroecological modes of farming are better equipped to support such shocks. The 
agroforestry programme developed in Malawi protected farmers from crop failure after 
droughts, thanks to the improved soil filtration it allowed.51 Indeed, on-farm experiments in 
Ethiopia, India, and the Netherlands have demonstrated that the physical properties of soils 
on organic farms improved the drought resistance of crops.52  
</p>
<p>30. In addition, the diversity of species and of farm activities that agroecological 
approaches allow are ways to mitigate risks from extreme weather events, as well as from 
the invasion of new pests, weeds and diseases, that will result from global warming. The 
agroecological practice of cultivar mixtures bets on genetic diversity in the fields in order to 
improve crop resistance to diseases. In the Yunnan Province in China, after disease-
susceptible rice varieties were planted in mixtures with resistant varieties, yields improved 
by 89 per cent and rice blast disease was 94 per cent less severe than when the varieties 
were grown in monoculture, leading farmers to abandon the use of fungicidal sprays.53 
</p>
<p>31. Agroecology also puts agriculture on the path of sustainability by delinking food 
production from the reliance on fossil energy (oil and gas). It contributes to mitigating 
climate change, both by increasing carbon sinks in soil organic matter and above-ground 
biomass, and by avoiding carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions from farms by 
reducing direct and indirect energy use. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) has estimated the global technical mitigation potential for agriculture at 5.5 to 6 Gt 
of CO2-equivalent per year by 2030.54 Most of this total (89 per cent) can come from

which can be done through agroecology.55  
</p>
<p><b> E. Farmer participation: an asset for the dissemination of best practices  
</b></p>
<p>32. The participation of farmers is vital for the success of agroecological practices. So 
far, agroecology has been developed by grassroots organizations and NGOs, and it has 
spread through farmer field schools and farmers&#8217; movements, such as the Campesino a 
Campesino movement in Central America.56 Experience with agroecological techniques is 
growing everyday within peasant networks such as La Via Campesina and the AgriCultures 
Network (former LEISA) globally; R&#233;seau des Organisations Paysannes et des Producteurs 
Agricoles de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (ROPPA), Eastern &amp; Southern Africa Farmers' Forum 
(ESAFF), and PELUM (Participatory Ecological Land Use Management) network in 
Africa, MASIPAG network in the Philippines (Magsasaka at Siyentista Tungo sa Pag-unlad 
ng Agrikultura), or Assessoria e Servi&#231;os a Projetos em Agricultura Alternativa (AS-PTA) 
and Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Terra (MST) in Brazil.57 
</p>
<p>33. Farmer field schools have been shown to significantly reduce the amounts of 
pesticides use, as inputs are being replaced by knowledge. Large-scale studies from 
Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh recorded 35 to 92 per cent reduction in insecticide use 
in rice, and 34 to 66 per cent reduction in pesticide use, combined with 4 to 14 per cent 
better yields recorded in cotton production in China, India and Pakistan.58 Farmer field 
schools have also proven to be empowering by helping farmers to organize themselves 
better, and stimulating continued learning. The successful dissemination of the push-pull 
strategy (PPS) in East Africa, promoted by the International Centre for Insect Physiology 
and Ecology (ICIPE), is largely due to the demonstration of fields managed by model 
farmers, which attracts visits by other farmers during field days, and to partnerships with 
national research systems in Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia and other countries that have 
made research and development efforts to bring about the necessary adaptations such as 
choice of maize cultivars.59 The growth of the Campesino a Campesino movement in Cuba 
relied on technical advisers and coordinators supported by the National Association of 
Small Farmers (ANAB). Between 2001 and 2009, the number of &#8220;<i>promotores</i>&#8221; increased

<p>from 114 to 11,935, and a total of 121,000 workshops on agroecological practices were 
organized.60 
</p>
<p>34. State support can build on those efforts. In Brazil, for example, the 2010 Act on 
extension and technical assistance for family farming and agrarian reform (Lei 
12.188/2010)61 prioritizes support to rural extension activities in ecological agriculture. This 
Act will accentuate the qualitative shift in the Brazilian extension services which is parallel 
to quantitative changes in the last decade.  Indeed, extension activities organized under the 
Brazilian National Rural Extension Policy (2003) have increased from an average of 2,000 
activities/year in 2004-2005 to an average of close to 30,000/year in 2007-2009.62 Such 
efforts enable a rapid dissemination of best practices, including agroecological practices, 
especially when farmers participate in the system and are not mere receivers of trainings.   
</p>
<p><b> IV.  Public policies for the scaling up of agroecology 
</b></p>
<p>35. Scaling up agroecology in order to maximize its positive impacts on farmers&#8217; 
incomes, productivity and the environment means both (horizontally) increasing the areas 
cultivated by agroecological techniques and (vertically) creating an enabling framework for 
the farmers. Innovative ways of ensuring horizontal expansion include the &#8220;pilot scaling 
up&#8221; strategy such as the one successfully implemented in the Chinyanja Triangle 
(Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia) and West and Central Africa by the World 
Agroforestry Centre for tree domestication. The strategy relies on the identification of Pilot 
Scaling Up Areas (PSUAs) and the establishment of &#8220;scaling up platforms,&#8221; the formation 
of &#8220;change teams&#8221; and the identification of partners: from grassroots organization to private 
companies.63 The targeting of the zones where the adoption of agroecology has the greatest 
potential, based on biophysical criteria, may be facilitated by Geographic Information 
Systems (GIS), such as those that have been used both in Europe and in Southern Africa in 
order to identify the suitability areas for the scaling up of agroforestry systems.64 As 
mentioned earlier, the dissemination of the push-pull strategy in East Africa by the 
International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) was based both on 
demonstration fields managed by model farmers, which attracts visits by other farmers 
during field days, and on partnerships with national research systems in neighbouring 
countries that facilitated take-up of this approach. Localized innovations can spread rapidly 
through such approaches (see Figure 2 below).

<i>Number of farmers using the push-pull system in western Kenya (1997&#8211;2009)</i>65 </p>
<p>36. This report focuses on the vertical dimension of scaling up agroecology, namely, the 
establishment of an enabling framework &#8211; although this is both a condition and a driver of 
horizontal scaling up. Governments have a key role to play in this regard, beyond 
supporting access to land, water and seeds for small-scale farmers.66 This section identifies 
a number of principles that could support the scaling up of agroecological practices. 
Encouraging a shift towards sustainable agriculture may be a delicate process associated 
with transition costs, since farmers must learn new techniques that move away from the 
current systems, which are more specialized, less adaptive, and have a lower innovation 
capacity.67 Therefore, the following principles should be applied with flexibility. The 
incentive structures which such policies create to encourage the shift towards sustainable 
farming should be regularly tested and re-evaluated with the participation of the 
beneficiaries, transforming policy into a mode of &#8220;social learning rather than an exercise of 
political authority.&#8221;68 The move towards agroecology should be based on the farmers 
themselves - its main beneficiaries. Agroecological techniques are best spread from farmer 
to farmer, since they are often specific to an agroecological zone.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Prioritizing public goods  
</b></p>
<p>37. Agroecological practices require the supply of public goods such as extension 
services, storage facilities, rural infrastructure (roads, electricity, information and 
communication technologies) and therefore access to regional and local markets, access to 
credit and insurance against weather-related risks, agricultural research and development, 
education, and support to farmer's organizations and cooperatives. While this requires 
funding, the investment can be significantly more sustainable than the provision of private 
goods, such as fertilizers or pesticides that farmers can only afford so long as they are

<p>subsidized. While many efforts have been made since 2008 to reinvest in agriculture, too 
little attention has been paid to the differences between the various types of investment 
required and to understanding their impacts on the reduction of rural poverty. This has led 
World Bank economists to note that &#8220;underinvestment in agriculture is [&#8230;] compounded 
by extensive misinvestment&#8221;69 with a bias towards the provision of private goods, 
sometimes motivated by political considerations.70 Research based on the study of 15 Latin 
American countries over the period 1985&#8211;2001 in which government subsidies for private 
goods was distinguished from expenditures in public goods indicated that, within a fixed 
national agriculture budget, a reallocation of 10 per cent of spending to supplying public 
goods increases agricultural per capita income by 5 per cent, while a 10 per cent increase in 
public spending on agriculture, keeping the spending composition constant, increases per 
capita agricultural income by only 2 per cent.71 In other words, &#8220;even without changing 
overall expenditures, governments can improve the economic performance of their 
agricultural sectors by devoting a greater share of those expenditures to social services and 
public goods instead of non-social subsidies.&#8221;72 Thus, while the provision or subsidization 
of private goods may be necessary up to a point, the opportunity costs should be carefully 
considered.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Investing in knowledge 
</b></p>
<p>38. Agroecology is knowledge-intensive. It requires the development of both ecological 
literacy and decision-making skills in farmer communities. Investments in agricultural 
extension and agricultural research are key in this regard. While agricultural spending is 
among the four top contributors to increasing rural welfare, along with public spending in 
education, health and roads,73 agricultural research has the greatest overall impact on 
poverty and agricultural productivity in developing countries. Agricultural research had 
&#8220;the largest impact on agricultural production and second-largest impact on poverty 
reduction (after rural education) in China, and the second-largest impact on poverty 
reduction in rural India (after investment in roads).&#8221;74 Research in agroecological practices, 
in particular, should be prioritized, because of the considerable and largely untapped 
potential of such practices. Modern science combines with local knowledge in 
agroecological research. In Central America for instance, the coffee groves grown under 
high-canopy trees were improved by the identification of the optimal shade conditions, 
minimizing the entire pest complex and maximizing the beneficial microflora and fauna 
while maximizing yield and coffee quality.75 However, perhaps because such practices

</p>
<p><b> C. Strengthening social organisation by co-construction 
</b></p>
<p>39. Agroecological practices are best adopted when they are not imposed top-down but 
shared from farmer to farmer. Extension services play a key role in favouring the scaling up 
of agroecology. An improved dissemination of knowledge by horizontal means transforms 
the nature of knowledge itself, which becomes the product of a network.77 It should 
encourage farmers, particularly small-scale farmers, living in the most remote areas to 
identify innovative solutions, by working with experts towards a co-construction of 
knowledge to ensure that advances will benefit them as a matter of priority, rather than only 
benefiting the better-off producers.78 Co-construction is key for the realization of the right 
to food. First, it enables public authorities to benefit from the experience and insights of the 
farmers. Rather than treating smallholder farmers as beneficiaries of aid, they should be 
seen as experts with knowledge that is complementary to formalized expertise. Second, as 
the Special Rapporteur has previously illustrated in describing participatory plant-
breeding,79 participation can ensure that policies and programmes are truly responsive to 
the needs of vulnerable groups, who will question projects that fail to improve their 
situation. Third, participation empowers the poor &#8211; a vital step towards poverty alleviation. 
Lack of power is a source of poverty, as marginal communities often receive less support 
than the groups that are better connected to government. Poverty exacerbates this lack of 
power, creating a vicious circle of further disempowerment. Fourth, policies that are co-
designed with farmers have a high degree of legitimacy and thus favour better planning of 
investment and production and better up-take by other farmers.80 Participation of food-
insecure groups in the policies that affect them should become a crucial element of all food 
security policies, from policy design to the assessment of results to the decision on research 
priorities. Indeed, improving the situation of millions of food-insecure peasants cannot be 
done without them.  
</p>
<p>40. The best of what scientists can offer and the valuable experience of smallholder 
farmers should be brought together in order to develop participatory modes of learning. The 
development of participation can go beyond the field technology itself. In West Africa, for 
instance, citizens&#8217; juries on the governance of food and agricultural research<b> </b>were set up by 
the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), the Coordination 
Nationale des Organisations Paysannes (CNOP) and other partners, resulting in farmers 
formulating 100 recommendations after having heard experts on the models of agriculture, 
land tenure and property rights, macroeconomic issues and the governance of agricultural

<p>research.81 Not only research and extension services should develop into learning 
organisations, so too should ministries, and educational and financial institutions.82 
Farmers&#8217; organizations and networks have accumulated experience on the dissemination of 
agroecological practices in the last decade, with proven results. These movements are 
already functioning as learning organizations; they must now be supported in this role. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Gender empowerment </b></p>
<p>41. Specific, targeted schemes should ensure that women are empowered and 
encouraged to participate in this construction of knowledge. Culturally-sensitive 
participatory initiatives with female project staff and all-female working groups, and an 
increase in locally-recruited female agricultural extension staff and village motivators 
facing fewer cultural and language barriers, should counterbalance the greater access that 
men have to formal sources of agricultural knowledge.83 It is a source of concern to the 
Special Rapporteur that, while women face a number of specific obstacles (poor access to 
capital and land, the double burden of work in their productive and family roles, and low 
participation in decision-making), gender issues are incorporated into less than 10 per cent 
of development assistance in agriculture, and women farmers receive only 5 per cent of 
agricultural extension services worldwide.84 In principle, agroecology can benefit women 
most, because it is they who encounter most difficulties in accessing external inputs or 
subsidies. But their ability to benefit should not be treated as automatic; it requires that 
affirmative action directed specifically towards women be taken.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Organizing markets </b></p>
<p>42. In previous reports, the Special Rapporteur has insisted on the need to facilitate the 
ability of small-scale farmers to join supply chains.85 Farmers should also be encouraged to 
move up the value chain by adding value to raw products through assuming increased roles 
in packaging, processing, and marketing their produce. Cooperatives can help them achieve 
economies of scale to facilitate adding value.86 This can also be supported by novel types of 
partnerships with the private sector. However, improved access to markets is essential if 
this is to happen. Better access to markets requires the development of communication 
routes, particularly rural feeder roads. The marginal returns to public spending on feeder 
roads for agriculture output and poverty reduction has been estimated to be &#8220;three to four 
times larger than the return to public spending on murram and tarmac roads.&#8221;87 In addition, 
support for agroecological practices will fail to achieve the desired results if markets are not 
organized to protect farmers from volatile prices and the dumping of subsidized products on

<p>their local markets, which can seriously disrupt local production.88 Similarly, public 
procurement systems, fiscal incentives and credit, and land tenure policies &#8211; all areas on 
which the Special Rapporteur has made contributions in the past &#8211; must be aligned with the 
need to make the transition towards low-carbon and low-external-input modes of 
production in which farmers co-design the policies that affect them. The school-feeding 
programme in Brazil for instance, has been used as a leverage to support family farming 
through its public procurement scheme; future public procurements schemes should 
promote agroecological practices.89 
</p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b>43. Moving towards sustainability is vital for future food security and an essential 
component of the right to food. But in order to succeed in this transformation, 
consistency will be required across a variety of areas. States will need to invest in 
multi-year efforts, based on strategies identifying the measures that should be adopted 
in order to make this transition. 
</b></p>
<p><b>44. As part of their obligation to devote the maximum of their available resources 
to the progressive realization of the right to food, States should implement public 
policies supporting the adoption of agroecological practices by:  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>making reference to agroecology and sustainable agriculture in national 
strategies for the realisation of the right to food and by including measures 
adopted in the agricultural sector in national adaptation plans of action 
(NAPAs) and in the list of nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) 
adopted by countries in their efforts to mitigate climate change;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>reorienting public spending in agriculture by prioritizing the provision of 
public goods, such as extension services, rural infrastructures and agricultural 
research, and by building on the complementary strengths of seeds-and-breeds 
and agroecological methods, allocating resources to both, and exploring the 
synergies, such as linking fertilizer subsidies directly to agroecological 
investments on the farm (&#8220;subsidy to sustainability&#8221;); 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>supporting decentralized participatory research and the dissemination of 
knowledge about the best sustainable agricultural practices by relying on 
existing farmers&#8217; organisations and networks, and including schemes designed 
specifically for women; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>improving the ability of producers practicing sustainable agriculture to access 
markets, using instruments such as public procurement, credit, farmers&#8217; 
markets, and creating a supportive trade and macroeconomic framework. 
</b></p>
<p><b>45. Donors should: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>engage in long-term relationships with partner countries, supporting ambitious 
programs and policies to scale up agroecological approaches for lasting change,

on the effects of climate change on food security and nutrition, with a view to 
informing the 37th CFS session. The HLPE and the CFS should assess the potential of 
agroecology to meet the current challenges in the areas of food security and nutrition, 
with a view to informing the preparation of the Global Strategic Framework for Food 
and Nutrition Security (GSF) in 2012, and to strengthening the consistency between 
the international agendas in the areas of climate change and agricultural development 
respectively.
